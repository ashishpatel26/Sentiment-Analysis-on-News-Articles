"Following his appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” over the weekend, when he declined to offer a full endorsement of Hillary Clinton’s Presidential campaign bid, Mayor Bill de Blasio found himself on the front of New York City’s tabloids on Monday. “STABBED IN DE BACK,” blared the Daily News. The Post ran with “HILL’S FURY” and the subhead “Blaz won’t endorse as prez run official.”","April 13, 2015","1","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"As a former newspaper headline writer, I could admire the “DE BACK” formulation, but I was also keen to read what de Blasio had actually said. He turned out to have described Clinton as “a tremendous public servant” and “one of the most qualified people ever to run for this office.” But unlike New York’s two Democratic senators, Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as Governor Andrew Cuomo, de Blasio declined the opportunity to issue a full public endorsement of Clinton’s candidacy, saying, ”We need to see the substance.”","2","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"

"Coming from a politician who served in Bill Clinton’s Administration and who helped to run Hillary’s successful campaign for Senate in 2000, these comments were a bit surprising, especially since they were spoken a few hours before Hillary’s official announcement. I am sure they irked some people in the Clinton camp. But before we extrapolate this story into a major breach between Hillary and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, it’s worth looking in a bit more detail at the economic issues that might divide the two sides.","4","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"“I think progressives all over the country, I think everyday Americans are demanding that their candidates—the President and every other level—really say that we have a plan that we can believe in for addressing income inequality,” de Blasio said, in explaining his wait-and-see attitude. “It has to include increases in wages and benefits. It has to include the willingness to tax the wealthy so we can invest in infrastructure, so we can invest in education.”","5","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"This statement was certainly more specific than what Clinton offered in the video she released to announce her candidacy, in which she says, “Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times. But the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. Everyday Americans need a champion.” But in identifying the very rich as the beneficiaries of unfair circumstances rather than of individual enterprise and hard work, and in prioritizing the material circumstances of the middle class, Clinton was clearly pitching her tent on the same turf occupied by progressives like de Blasio and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.","6","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"The question, of course, is whether Clinton’s words were just talk. De Blasio was well within his rights to take a noncommittal attitude—indeed, his progressive supporters would have demanded no less. Traditionally, the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party has emphasized promoting “opportunity” over reducing inequality. As Lawrence Mishel, the president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute, pointed out in a blog post last week, that approach has sometimes enabled centrist Democrats to “avoid confronting the top 1 percent’s capture of the lion’s share of income growth. After all, addressing runaway executive pay and a runaway financial sector—the main causes of the top 1 percent’s income gains—smacks of redistribution; and besides, those folks are their donor base.” With Hillary and her staff about to hit up hedge-fund managers, investment bankers, tech moguls, and other rich folks for hefty campaign contributions, the suspicion lingers that, when it comes down to it, her campaign will punt, rather than directly confront, the entrenched problems of income and wealth inequality.","7","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"On the other hand, the political center of gravity has shifted in the Democratic Party, and there are reasons to hope that Clinton will embrace a more progressive, far-reaching agenda than anything that her husband and his fellow New Democrats would have endorsed in the nineteen-nineties. Since the financial crisis and the Great Recession, which were widely perceived to have been the work of Wall Street, inequality and wage stagnation have come to dominate the policy agenda in a way that they didn’t a decade ago. Even in what used to be called the Rubinite wing of the Party, after former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, there is a widespread recognition that something more is necessary.","8","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"Earlier this year, for instance, the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank created by John Podesta, Hillary’s campaign manager, issued a lengthy report devoted to the subject of “inclusive prosperity.” It was put together by a commission of economists and policy experts led by Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, and Ed Balls, the senior economic spokesman for the British Labour Party. During the nineties, Summers and Balls were both supporters of a “third way” approach to economic policy, which emphasized deregulation and the power of markets. Today their primary concern is coming up with policies designed to raise wages and ameliorate rising inequality.","9","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"Some of the proposals in the C.A.P. report were familiar. The commission called for a rise in the minimum wage and an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit program, which provides cash subsidies to low-wage workers. These are both good ideas, and ones that the Obama Administration has also championed. But what was novel, and potentially costly, in the report was the idea of providing temporary wage subsidies to working households that earn as much as eighty or ninety thousand dollars a year. (The current phase-out threshold for the Earned Income Tax Credit is about twenty-three thousand dollars.) “Short-term middle-class tax relief would ideally be provided until income stagnation is overcome,” the report said. “The tax relief could automatically expire in three years or automatically phase out based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing improvement in wage growth of a specified amount for the middle class.”","10","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"In another part of the report that seemed to go beyond the New Democrat ethos, the C.A.P. commission endorsed various steps to strengthen the bargaining position of workers and labor unions. In addition to endorsing the more expeditious “card check” method of setting up unions, which is a long-time demand of the labor movement, the report called for automatic government arbitration in instances when employers refuse to bargain collectively with newly formed unions, as well as the mandatory establishment of works councils, before which workers’ grievances could be heard. In an effort to insure that workers reap more of the benefits of corporate profits, which have been growing strongly, the report also recommended expanding tax incentives for employee-share-ownership schemes.","11","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"None of these policies represents a big threat to corporate America. But taken together they could help to tilt the balance of power back toward workers a bit and, over time, to give a boost to wages. After all, it’s no accident that wages and incomes have stagnated in the past thirty years. Under the guise of encouraging economic dynamism and responding to international competition, governments on both sides of the Atlantic have spent three decades undermining the gains that workers made during and after the Second World War. To be sure, factors such as globalization and technological progress were partly responsible for the emergence of wage stagnation, but, with a big gap having opened up between productivity and wages, there is no doubt that policy also played a significant role.","12","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"Those at the top of the income distribution have benefitted greatly from the assault on workers’ bargaining power, and from other policies, such as the emasculation of the inheritance tax—one of the few tools available to tackle glaring wealth inequality. Here, too, the C.A.P. report stopped short of endorsing truly radical measures, such as a new tax on wealth, like ones that Thomas Piketty and some other economists have recommended. But the report did call for eliminating a glaring loophole in the tax code, known as the “step-up in basis,” that enables even the very richest families to pass down their fortunes while minimizing their tax liabilities. The report also advocated reforming the mortgage interest deduction and other quirks of the tax code that benefit the wealthy more than anybody else, noting, “Eliminating the tax rules that shelter high-income households and corporations would raise their effective tax rates, make the tax code more progressive, and avoid the waste created by strategies for tax avoidance.”","13","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"To repeat, there is nothing particularly novel or ground-breaking here. Liberals have long advocated levelling the playing field for capital and labor. The Obama Administration has recently called for eliminating the “step-up in basis” and other tax dodges that benefit the ultra-wealthy. What is striking is the convergence in thinking between the center and center-left that has taken place in recent years, as the basic facts about rising inequality have become impossible to ignore. Now it’s up to Clinton and her advisers to exploit this convergence. As long as they are willing to defy some of their more conservative and tax-phobic donors, there is plenty of common ground on which to construct an inequality agenda that will satisfy de Blasio and many other progressives.","14","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"Of course, whatever Clinton does, there will still be some left-leaning Democrats who regard certain of her choices as a sop to the one per cent, or who oppose her on other grounds. That is inevitable. But despite the flap over de Blasio’s remarks, a lasting schism between Clinton and most progressives isn’t inevitable.","15","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"

"There are two new signs that the Republican Party, often said to be in the midst of a civil war, might be experiencing something more like the Internet bubble of the nineteen-nineties. First, there’s the money: at a conference this weekend organized by Freedom Partners, a network built around the Koch brothers, donors met in Rancho Mirage, California, and resolved to spend eight hundred and eighty-nine million dollars—the sort of number that gets rounded up to a billion—on the G.O.P.’s 2016 candidates, according to the Washington Post’s Matea Gold.","January 27, 2015","23","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"At the same time, at the similarly named, but differently catered, Freedom Summit, in Des Moines, Iowa, an event built around the alarmist Representative Steve King, potential Presidential candidates were on full, exhibitionist display. Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, and Rick Santorum were there, each claiming his own place on the strutting-stridency matrix; so were Donald Trump and Sarah Palin. Special bonus: Carly Fiorina. (Bobby Jindal was at his own rally, called The Response.*) Their presence onstage suggests that the G.O.P. field is wide open—far more so than it is for the Democrats—attracting boom-towners and political Ponzi-schemers, as well as ideologues. There will be plenty of money—hard and soft, smart and speculative—expended as giddily as anything that was ever put into Kozmo.com. A bubble can be less corrosive and bloody than a war, and there’s always a chance that an unlikely startup might make for a successful I.P.O. But it is not dignified.","24","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"","25","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"There were a lot of businessmen at Freedom Partners; there was a lot of talk about ordinary people and “crony capitalism” at the Freedom Summit. The latter event probably had the edge in theatricality. After watching several candidates, a Cedar Rapids billboard salesman told the Des Moines Register that he wished some of the “real true conservatives” had the “gravitas” of Chris Christie. Trump berated Romney (“He choked!”) and Sarah Palin improvised about the nature of freedom after her teleprompter went out (“The man can only ride you when your back is bent!”).","26","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"But it would be a mistake to see, in the coincidence of scheduling, a divide between the “establishment” and the upstarts. For one thing, a couple of the candidates, Walker and Cruz, made it to both Freedom pageants; Cruz, who in Iowa spoke about winning over “the forty-seven per cent,” spoke in Rancho Mirage about how the criticism of the Koch brothers was “grotesque.” Rand Paul and Marco Rubio opted solely for Freedom Partners, where Paul dismissed Romney, who was absent, in words only marginally more polite than Trump’s. Rubio, meanwhile, congratulated members of the audience for not trying to bribe him: “I don’t know a single person in this room who has ever been to my office … asking from government any special access.”","27","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"Jeb Bush missed both events; there may have been more people who were sorry about that in the Kochs’ circle than in King’s: it was King who described Dreamers as drug mules with “calves the size of cantaloupes,” which is not quite where Bush wants to be seen standing on immigration. (King’s Freedom Summit was co-sponsored by Citizens United, the group whose victory at the Supreme Court made all sorts of new political sponsorships possible.) Trump, in his speech, attacked Bush’s position on immigration this way: “He said, ‘They are coming for love.’ What? Half of them are criminals!” (A Politico dispatch describing the moment continued, “‘Jeb and Mitt you can’t have!’ Trump yelled. ‘It’s over!’”)","28","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"But the coolness to Jeb is more a matter of degree. According to the Washington Post, Paul, Cruz, and Walker were “favorites” at Rancho Mirage, too: “It’s not as if there’s one perfect champion and five bad individuals,” a “person familiar with donor views” told the paper. The Post added that Freedom Partners “is still debating whether it will spend some of that money in the GOP primaries. Such a move could have a major impact in winnowing the field of contenders but could also undercut the network’s standing if it engaged in intraparty politics and was not successful.”","29","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"Here, again, there might be an instructive contrast with the Democrats. The Republicans are looking at some dubious characters—but at least they are looking. If the G.O.P. is in a market bubble—whether of the tech or tulip variety—the Democrats might be experiencing something more like stagflation. The inflation is in the nominal price assigned to its main product, the putative candidacy of Hillary Clinton. That price keeps going up, without ever seeming to factor in her liabilities. The stagnation is in the party’s development of new voices, and, as a corollary, new ideas. In 2012, the Democrats benefited from the churn on the Republican side and the calm on theirs—but that’s largely because they were running an incumbent. (And it was Obama’s defiance of a similar sort of anointment that allowed him to emerge in 2008.) Now, there’s an artificial freeze on competition. Elizabeth Warren won’t say that she’s interested in running, and, even if she does run, her voice alone wouldn’t mean that there would be a broad debate. The peeps from the general direction of Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, have not been inspiring. (See Ryan Lizza on his travels with O’Malley.)","30","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"On both sides, in different ways, there might just be too much money chasing too few goods, to cite another economic dictum. Palin and Romney probably took the weekend’s prizes as the most mockable and the most mocked. And yet, they are also distinguished by being the only two characters in this ensemble whom the G.O.P. has put on a national ticket. If McCain had done just a little better, Palin might have had a chance to fidget at the State of the Union and mortify Americans with her behavior at state funerals. Romney got forty-seven per cent of the popular vote. Do Republicans see either of their nominations as an admonishment, or an inspiration? They made it to the finals; maybe anyone can.","31","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"

"With all the coverage of Hillary Clinton’s e-mails, another bit of political news has been largely overlooked. At a press conference in Baltimore on Tuesday, Martin O’Malley, the former Democratic governor of Maryland, said that he won’t seek the U.S. Senate seat that Barbara Mikulski, Maryland’s five-term Democratic senator, has announced she will vacate in 2016. Rather than entering a Senate race in which he would immediately be the favorite, O’Malley appears set to go all-in and challenge Clinton for the Democratic Presidential nomination.","March 4, 2015","33","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"Officially, O’Malley is still merely considering a bid. But his travel schedule suggests otherwise. Last weekend, he was in South Carolina; this weekend he’s headed to New Hampshire. He has also scheduled trips to Iowa this month and next.","34","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"If O’Malley does formally enter the race, he’ll be a heavy underdog, of course. Still, he’ll find some encouragement from Clinton’s ongoing troubles. On Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that she maintained her own home-brew server for the private e-mail address that she has been revealed to have used for work correspondence as Secretary of State, rather than relying on an outside service, such as Google or Yahoo. “Operating her own server would have afforded Clinton additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal, administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails,” the A.P. story said.","35","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"Yesterday, I expressed some skepticism about whether the e-mail flap would amount to much over the long term, and about whether the Republicans would be able to use it against Clinton once the campaign proper starts. In seeking to keep her State Department e-mails from prying eyes, she clearly skirted the rules. But it appears that she didn’t break the federal recordkeeping laws in place at the time, and everyone knows that she has good reason to be paranoid: on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, many people are out to get her, Republican attack dogs prominent among them.","36","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"The danger to Clinton is cumulative and close to home. In the past few weeks, many Democrats, particularly those on the progressive wing of the party, have been reminded of their reservations about a Clinton restoration. To begin with, there was the spectacle of Hillary, fresh from the State Department, traipsing around the country making highly paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, the Carlyle Group and other redoubts of the one per cent. Last week came the revelation that foreign governments were making financial contributions to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was still serving as Secretary of State. And now there’s her e-mail system, which appears to have been explicitly designed to frustrate legitimate requests for documents from the media and from Congress. It all adds to the impression that the Clintons operate by their own set of rules.","37","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"So far, other potential Democratic challengers, who include Vice President Joe Biden and Jim Webb, the former senator from Virginia, have shied away from criticizing Hillary directly, but this may be about to change. During O’Malley’s recent trip to South Carolina, the Associated Press reported, he “took a veiled shot at Clinton, warning Democrats that more ‘triangulation’ would not be a successful strategy for the party.”","38","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"The reference, to Dick Morris’s term describing Bill Clinton’s strategy for transcending ideological polarities, hardly constituted a venomous attack. O’Malley, who began his career in politics by working for Gary Hart’s 1984 Presidential campaign, is a thoughtful and deliberate politician, rather than a showman or a brawler. His standing in Democratic politics is currently diminished, however, by the results of last November’s gubernatorial election, in which O’Malley’s chosen successor, his lieutenant governor, Anthony Brown, suffered an upset defeat to the Republican candidate, Larry Hogan.","39","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"O’Malley had a strong record as governor, promoting the use of information technology, seeing liberal measures on immigration and gay marriage into law, and repealing the death penalty for future offenders. In recent months, he has been reaching out to progressives in the early primary states, and echoing many of the themes that made Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren popular, such as calling for the break-up of big banks. ”People want to see new faces,” Dan Calegari, a Democratic activist in New Hampshire, told the A.P. “There’s a certain amount of Clinton fatigue. They’ve been around for thirty years now. Quite honestly, I think if Martin decides to get in the race, he will surprise some people.”","40","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"To repeat, O’Malley would be a long shot. British bookmakers currently have the odds that he will win the nomination set at around twenty-five-to-one. Warren, despite her protestations that she won’t run, is at seven-to-one. Biden is at sixteen-to-one. Clinton remains the favorite, of course, but the betting markets suggest that the race isn’t entirely sewn up. At most of the bookmakers, the odds on her emerging as the Democratic candidate are one-to-three, which means that you would have to put down three dollars to win one dollar. These numbers imply that there’s a seventy-five-per-cent probability that Clinton will get the nomination. Until now, most political operatives and pundits, myself included, have been tacitly assuming that the chances that Hillary won’t be the Democratic candidate were lower than one in four. It may be time for a reassessment.","41","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"Nearly eight years ago, Democrats held their first televised Presidential debate of the 2008 campaign, marking the debut of a cast of characters that ranged from the plausible to the preposterous. For two hours, the candidates, some of them now remembered only by those with an unhealthy attachment to politics, went at it as the moderator, NBC’s Brian Williams, made game attempts to nudge them into saying something interesting. The most incautious remarks came from former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel and former Representative Dennis Kucinich, both of whom had nothing to lose and knew it. When Williams asked for reactions to Senator Harry Reid’s remark that “the war in Iraq is lost,” Gravel replied, “Well, first off, understand that this war was lost the day that George Bush invaded Iraq on a fraudulent basis.” Kucinich talked about impeaching Dick Cheney. The leading competitors were simply careful. Senator Joe Biden said, “Look, Brian, this is not a game show. You know, this is not a football game. This is not win or lose. The fact of the matter is that the President has a fundamentally flawed policy.” Senator Hillary Clinton said, “Well, Brian, at the outset let me say that the American people have spoken; the Congress has voted, as of today, to end this war. And now we can only hope that the President will listen. … This is not America’s war to win or lose. We have given the Iraqi people the chance to have freedom, to have their own country.” Senator Barack Obama said, “Well, Brian, I am proud that I opposed this war from the start, because I thought that it would lead to the some—the disastrous conditions that we’ve seen on the ground in Iraq.”","April 3, 2015","42","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"

"The other debate participants included the former Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd, the former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, and the former senator and Vice-Presidential candidate John Edwards. They have faded from the scene, in Edwards’s case not in a good way. Yet most of the topics—gay marriage, climate change, immigration reform, and Iraq—are still with us. Hillary Clinton is still being asked to defend her 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq-war resolution, and still sounds much as she did when she said, “Well, Brian, I take responsibility for my vote. … It was a sincere vote based on the information available to me. And I’ve said many times that if I knew then what I now know, I would not have voted that way.” At the same time, Clinton brought real conviction and knowledge to discussions of universal health care, a central issue in 2008 that is still with us. Those Democrats acted like a party engaged by issues and eager to win back the White House.","44","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"
"That’s how the Republicans are behaving this year—eager. The candidacy of Ted Cruz, possible encores by Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, and Rick Santorum, the emergence of Rand Paul, and a “center” represented by Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, and even Lindsey Graham may induce Romney nostalgia for horror-struck Democrats. But it’s a race that’s bound to become ever more compelling, possibly with more candidates (Ben Carson? Carly Fiorina?), and the contenders will be sharpened in the process. They’re looking for a contender, just as the Democrats were eight years ago, when debates and primaries altered early perceptions that Clinton, or possibly Edwards, was bound to win.","45","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"
"Democrats, meanwhile, seem ready to cede the whole thing to Clinton, who, for all her experience and intelligence, may be a less-than-ideal candidate. Even her e-mail problems, which polls at first suggested could be shrugged off, aren’t going away. It didn’t help when her lawyer, David Kendall, in response to a subpoena from a congressional committee looking into the 2012 attack on the American Embassy in Benghazi, told the Times, “There are no hdr22@clintonemail.com emails from Secretary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate or legally authorized.” That her personal e-mail server has been wiped clean of any records from her years at the State Department erases the chance of anyone ever making an independent study of their contents and is bound to encourage the suspicion that there was something worth hiding. The investigation community is like a perpetual scandal-seeking machine, quick to seize on any hint of inconsistency, and both Clintons, understandably, are weary of being pursued by those who don’t wish them well. But the public may be getting weary of seeing the words “Clinton” and “lawyers” juxtaposed yet again with any sort of frequency, which could explain her slippage in the polls in three battleground states.","46","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"
"Not long ago, Ryan Lizza wrote about Clinton’s aura of inevitability and the historic failure of most challenges to strong front-runners. At this point, though, any insurgencies are more notional than real. Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, has been gently critical of her as he shyly contemplates getting into the race. The former Virginia Senator James Webb, who began exploring a run last November, is still hinting that he intends to run. But when you look for signs of the Webb campaign, which promised a fresh view of income inequality, military commitments abroad, and the terrible waste of lives—mainly black lives—caused by mass incarceration, what you’re likely to find is the status of the James Webb space telescope, which will replace the Hubble. (That Webb ran NASA in the years of the Apollo program.) Clinton, meanwhile, has not exactly announced her intentions, but her campaign, without coyness, has reportedly leased two floors of office space in Brooklyn Heights, and that, as Politico notes, may be regarded by the Federal Election Commission as the beginning of a campaign.","47","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"
"Four years ago, Democrats were amused by the Republicans battling through the primaries, and by debates that even Republicans considered a “clown show.” This year, Republicans may be cheered by the absence of battle on the other side, by the sight of a major political party diminished by timidity and the uncertain candidacy of a single contender.","48","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"
"For months now, Elizabeth Warren, the liberal senator from Massachusetts, has been saying she isn’t running for President, but that hasn’t stopped people from speculating about whether she might enter the race at some point. “Now, you didn’t think you’d get away with this interview without me asking you point blank,” Savannah Guthrie, of the “Today” show, said to her on Tuesday. “Are you going to run for President?” Warren replied, “No. I’m not running. And I’m not going to run. I’m in Washington, and I’ve got this great job and a chance to try and make a difference on things that really matter.” That sounded pretty definitive. But just to make sure, Guthrie asked a follow-up: “Are you unequivocally and categorically saying, ‘I’m not running for President in 2016’?” To which Warren replied, “I’m not running. I’m not running.”","April 1, 2015","49","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"

"In the past few weeks, a grassroots campaign to persuade Warren to enter the Democratic primaries had attracted the support of some prominent individuals and institutions. Robert Reich, who served as Labor Secretary in Bill Clinton’s Administration, posted a statement on his Facebook page saying that a tough primary challenge to Clinton would be good for her and for Democrats, adding, “I wish that challenger would be Elizabeth Warren.” The editorial board of the Boston Globe, Warren’s home-town paper, published a lengthy commentary headlined, “Democrats need Elizabeth Warren’s voice in 2016 presidential race.” And two highly regarded progressive activists, Larry Cohen, the president of the Communications Workers of America, and Annie Leonard, the executive director of Greenpeace USA, echoed Reich’s message, coupling it with a statement questioning Clinton’s liberal credentials. “If we end up with a single Democratic candidate—and little to no debate in the primaries,” Cohen and Leonard wrote in an open letter published on the Run Warren Run Web site, “those of us unlikely to support a Republican nominee will be left voting for a Democrat who may be opposed to the Republican agenda but is not necessarily a champion of the vision of change that millions of us seek and that this country needs.”","52","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"With Clinton embroiled in a messy dispute over her decision to delete thousands of e-mails that she sent and received as Secretary of State, and also, apparently, to wipe her private server clean, the effort to draft Warren appeared to be gaining a bit of momentum. But following her statements to Guthrie, where will it go next? Is it done? Apparently not.","53","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"On Wednesday, MoveOn.org, the liberal advocacy group that helped to get the draft-Warren campaign started, was still featuring on its home page a petition calling on the Massachusetts senator to run. And the organization was continuing to plan a conference, to be held in New York next month, that will feature a number of prominent progressives who are calling on Warren to enter the race. In an e-mail to me, Brian Stewart, MoveOn’s media-relations director, played down the “Today” show interview, writing, “Sen. Warren has repeatedly made clear that she doesn’t plan to run—that’s why we’re running a draft campaign. We are calling on her to run because we believe our country will be better off if she does.”","54","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"The speakers at the New York event will include the Harvard law-school professor Lawrence Lessig, who is helping to lead the movement for campaign-finance reform (read my colleague Evan Osnos on the subject here); Zephyr Teachout, the Fordham law professor who challenged Andrew Cuomo in last year’s Democratic gubernatorial primary; and Van Jones, the environmental activist who did a short stint in the Obama White House. In a blog post explaining why he’s participating in the conference, Lessig said that the one thing that could persuade Warren to change her mind about running was “the recognition that her jumping in is necessary to make a difference. The more of us who speak up, the more clear it will be that this is just such a moment. That there’s a difference that only she can make, at a moment in our history when we desperately need that difference.”","55","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"The draft-Warren movement isn’t going away, then. But, with Clinton preparing to make her candidacy an official one, the political context in which the movement is operating is about to change. Warren’s supporters, having failed to lure her into the fray early, will be left to press her to join the race later on, which would surely happen only if Clinton were to stumble badly.","56","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"That prospect won’t please a lot of progressive activists. Warren, however, seems content with it. The “Today” show’s Guthrie, an admirably persistent interviewer, pressed Warren on whether she believed Clinton “could give a credible voice” to the issues she had raised, such as fighting for the middle class. “Well,” Warren said. “I think we need to give her a chance to decide if she’s going to run and to declare—” Guthrie interrupted her and said, “We know she’s going to run.” Warren paused for a moment, then ignored the interruption and continued, “And to lay out what she wants to run on. I think that’s her opportunity to do that.”","57","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"Coming from someone who had just reiterated that she was engaged with her own agenda, which includes reforming the student-loan program, raising the minimum wage, and protecting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she helped to create, from Republican attacks, Warren’s words could be interpreted as a statement of encouragement to a party leader whom she respects and wants to be victorious. On the other hand, they fell far short of an endorsement. And for those willing to attribute Machiavellian motives to Warren, they could even be taken as an indication that she had cannily decided to wait and see if Clinton self-destructs.","58","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"In the world of wishing and waiting for Elizabeth, that may well be the preferred interpretation. Even if it’s the correct one, though, it means that Clinton will get to make her case to the Democratic Party, its most progressive supporters included, with only Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, Jim Webb, the former Virginia Senator, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders as potential rivals who have expressed a serious interest in running. While each of these men has policy expertise and a track record, they are still struggling to be taken seriously as Presidential candidates. Which suggests that, for now, at least, Clinton controls her own destiny.","59","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s planned speech to Congress on Iran has been widely criticized, in Israel and in the United States. The unimportant criticism focusses on the way the event was concocted: House Speaker John Boehner and Ron Dermer, the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., planned it in secret for weeks, then sprang it on the State Department and White House (which gave Dermer an opening to blame the Speaker’s office “for not notifying” the Administration). President Obama has declined to meet with Netanyahu; Secretary of State John Kerry has not condescended to meet with Dermer. The speech is scheduled for March 3rd, two weeks before the Israeli election, and will coincide with the yearly mega-conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), where Netanyahu, as in past years, will be received as a champion.","February 4, 2015","69","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"","70","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"The more important criticism of Boehner’s invitation rests on a fiction: that Netanyahu, the leader of an embattled ally, must depend on bipartisan American support for his country to confront its regional enemies. Netanyahu, in this story, has been reckless in making common cause with Republicans, a move that has inadvertently strengthened Obama’s hand in opposing a new Iran-sanctions bill. Democratic senators who had indicated support for the bill—which its largely Republican sponsors had hoped to pass over Obama’s objections, while negotiations with Iran are still ongoing—are now rallying to the President. Obama now almost certainly has enough votes to prevent an override of his veto, should it come to that. Vice-President Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Minority Leader of the House, are hinting that they and many other Democrats may not even show up for Netanyahu’s speech. The moral of this story, presumably, is that the U.S. and Israel have distinct interests when it comes to Iran, and that both Netanyahu and his Republican hosts have erred in trying to blur them. Above all, they should not have defied a sitting President, who has the constitutional authority to manage foreign policy.","71","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"Some of the commentators you’d most expect to support Netanyahu have expressed shock at the planned speech (although they sound a little like Captain Renault discovering gambling at Rick’s Café). Fox News’s Chris Wallace complained, “For Netanyahu to come here and side with Boehner against Obama on Iran seems to me like very dicey politics.” Jeffrey Goldberg, who made the case for the imminence of Iranian nuclear capacity, is now skeptical: “His recent actions suggest he doesn’t quite know what he’s doing.” Other new Netanyahu critics believe that he does. Dan Margalit, most often a Netanyahu cheerleader at the tabloid Israel Hayom, told Israel’s Channel 10 that Netanyahu’s “trip is not being taken for the sake of the interests of the state of Israel—rather for the needs of Benjamin Netanyahu and the Likud, for the Likud election campaign.” According to these observers, Netanyahu is injecting partisanship into what should be a bipartisan issue in both Israel and the United States, and is doing harm to Israel by showing the American Presidency disrespect.","72","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"There is a measure of truth to this story, but it obscures a more significant reality. In their wars of ideas and political networks, Netanyahu’s Likud and his American supporters are an integral part of the Republican Party’s camp, and Israel is too involved in the American political landscape and defense establishment for Netanyahu to be considered as distant as a foreign leader. Netanyahu and Obama are at odds not only diplomatically, in their positions on Iran, but in their affiliated political parties and overarching strategic visions. Dermer once worked for the Republican strategist Frank Luntz; before moving to Israel, he helped to design the Contract With America. Netanyahu has been a member of the Republicans’ neoconservative circle since the Reagan years; when I interviewed him in 1998, during his first term as Prime Minister, he took up the first ten minutes reading me a column by Charles Krauthammer.","73","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"Before the 2012 U.S. election, Netanyahu received Mitt Romney in Jerusalem in a series of encounters arranged by his adviser Dan Senor, once a spokesman for George W. Bush’s Iraq czar, L. Paul Bremer, and the co-author of a gushing book about Israel’s entrepreneurial economy. These encounters were clearly calculated to undermine the President’s reëlection efforts. Netanyahu, moreover, openly solicits financial support from Sheldon Adelson, who is estimated to have donated at least a hundred million dollars to Romney’s electoral efforts, and who has spent tens of millions subsidizing the freely distributed Israel Hayom, which boosts Netanyahu and tears down his opponents. Netanyahu may fancy himself a Winston Churchill, warning the U.S. about Hitler’s threat to Britain. Instead, all this makes you wonder if he isn’t more like Texas Governor Rick Perry, warning about the threat posed to his state by the President’s executive order on immigration.","74","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"AIPAC has historically prided itself on fostering bipartisanship, and its conference in March will feature Democratic and Administration officials eager to remain in its good graces. (AIPAC members distribute roughly twenty-five million dollars in campaign contributions.) But, as Connie Bruck reported in the magazine last fall, its ability to present support for Netanyahu’s government as a bipartisan issue has been compromised. Polls by J Street, an advocacy group founded, in 2008, as a liberal counterbalance to AIPAC, have shown that seventy per cent of American Jews persist in voting Democratic, and that about an equal number would be open to Obama pressuring Israel, as well as Palestinians, to reach an agreement. Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told me that when he advanced negotiations with Mahmoud Abbas, AIPAC worked to undermine him. AIPAC is now sponsoring an effort to cut funding to the Palestinian Authority, on the grounds that Abbas’s efforts to force Hamas to join a unity government make him complicit with the group.","75","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"AIPAC itself isn’t fully responsible for its conservative tilt, J Street President Jeremy Ben-Ami told me. “What you have here is a group of partisan operatives, only loosely affiliated with AIPAC,” Ben-Ami said. “They are pulling threads that bind the Republicans and the Likud together.” “By simply echoing successive Likud governments that call for toughness and that engage in anti-Palestinian rhetoric,” AIPAC has ended up “in opposition to Obama and a good part of the Democratic Party, lining up with Republican policies, regardless of partisan intent.”","76","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"Netanyahu’s invitation to speak before Congress has precipitated a crisis with the White House, but the clarity it offers comes as a relief. The strategic conflict is not between American and Israeli interests but rather between rival conceptions of how the two countries should exert and coördinate their respective national powers, the United States globally, and Israel regionally. Each conception has organized advocates in each country—roughly, the Likud with Republicans and Israeli center-left parties with Democrats. One leftist Israeli party is petitioning the election commission to prevent Netanyahu’s speech from being broadcast.","77","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"Obama has kept Netanyahu from bombing Iran, but their differences have hardly been resolved. Increasingly, these conform to party lines. Obama and Kerry take what Steven Simon, the former senior director for Middle East and North Africa affairs in the Obama White House, has called a classically realist approach to global affairs. “Obama was both willing to deal with Egyptian President Morsi and also refused to label his overthrow as a coup, subordinating his concerns about Egyptian domestic political arrangements to a strategic concern for regional stability,” Simon told me. Similarly, the realist move for Israel, with regard to the Palestinian territories, would be to strike a deal that reduces the risk of their being inflamed by neighboring conflicts. Obama, Kerry, and many Democrats are joined in these views not only by Labor Party and centrist leaders but also by former Mossad leaders Efraim Halevy, Meir Dagan, and Amiram Levin, and by Yuval Diskin and Yaakov Perry, former heads of the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency.","78","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"Simon adds that Obama’s realism is reflected in his management of the Iranian threat, which isn’t popular in Netanyahu’s circle but is certainly understood by many Israelis. All Israelis are insistent that Iran’s proxy Hezbollah not threaten Israeli positions on the Golan Heights. But, on the question of how to respond to Iran’s nuclear program, there are differences of degree. Realists generally suppose that the value of nuclear weapons lies in deterring their use by others; they don’t consider them useful for much else, although, Simon added, “One cannot be sure that Iranian officials will think them valueless during the period when they adjust to having them.” In fact, Iran may be emboldened to act rashly, believing that its nuclear capability gives it some sort of immunity against a punishing conventional response from Israel, which could spin out of control. Obama’s repeated assertions that the U.S. would not permit Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon reflect this concern.","79","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"Obama seems sincerely determined to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear capacity, which would trigger a regional arms race. Unlike Netanyahu and the Republicans, however, he wants to play out the negotiations without undermining his interlocutors’ standing with Iranian hardliners. He knows that the other side has hardliners—that is, an internal politics to which he needs to be sensitive. He obviously supposes, but cannot be so undiplomatic as to say, that the best way to lower the flame under Iran’s nuclear program, and eventually to undermine the regime’s Islamist xenophobia, is to penetrate the country with Western investment (as happened in China in the seventies). Netanyahu says that he is adamantly against Iran gaining a “threshold” capability. Obama, reasonably, is less concerned. He knows that he has the military means to prevent an Iranian bomb, even at the eleventh hour. Why bring things to the point of war before it becomes absolutely necessary?","80","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"“I think there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says, unless you adopt an unwavering, pro-Likud approach to Israel, that you are anti-Israel—and that can’t be the measure of our friendship,” Obama told a Cleveland audience in 2008. He has not said anything so sharp since then. What’s stopping him now? The Netanyahu speech has brought the Likud alliance with the Republicans into the open, and to his doorstep. Why shouldn’t the Obama Administration and the Democratic leadership make their alliance with Netanyahu’s opponents just as plain?","81","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"The Israeli election is six weeks away, tight as a drum, and will be decided by unaffiliated and not very subtle voters. As I wrote in December, Netanyahu is stoking swing voters’ fear of Arab enmity. His chief opponents, Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, are provoking their concern about global isolation and wrecked relations with Washington. Hezbollah and Hamas are inadvertently helping Netanyahu. Are not Obama, Kerry, and the Democrats—by holding to the fiction of bipartisanship, and refusing to embrace European initiatives to pressure Netanyahu’s benighted government—unnecessarily doing the same?","82","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"

"If you were expecting a slick campaign video, or a big set-piece speech, to herald Bernie Sanders’s entry into the 2016 race, you don’t know the man or what he represents. For months now, the seventy-three-year-old Vermont senator has been indicating he would run for President. The official announcement, which came in the form of an e-mail to his supporters, merely confirmed that he’ll contest the Democratic primary rather than run as an independent. (Although he caucuses with the Senate Democrats, Sanders was elected in 2006 and 2012 as an “independent socialist.”)","April 30, 2015","89","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"

"The contrast with the carefully orchestrated launches of the Clinton, Cruz, and Rubio campaigns, to name but three, wasn’t due to the fact that Sanders hasn’t got any money—he has almost five million dollars left over from his last Senate campaign. Sanders was sending the message that he isn’t so much a candidate as an anti-candidate. Even more than Howard Dean’s pitch, in 2004, Sanders’s will be based on the proposition that American politics are broken and corrupted to their core, and that only an insurgency can do anything about it. “Let’s be clear,” Sanders said in his e-mail. “This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It’s about a grassroots movement of Americans standing up and saying: ‘Enough is enough. This country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.’ ”","91","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"That last line is one Sanders uses a lot, and it cuts across party lines. Mainly, he uses it to lambaste post-Citizens United Republicans, with their motley assortment of right-wing sugar daddies, from the Koch brothers to Sheldon Adelson to Harold Simmons. But Sanders has also accused the Democratic Party of playing the money game and pandering to wealthy donors. Last November, for example, he said that Party leaders had failed to make clear “that they are prepared to stand with the working-class people of this country, take on the big-money interests.” Now that he’s running in the Democratic primary, we can expect to hear him repeat this argument and apply it to the establishment candidate, Hillary Clinton. Indeed, he’s already doing this.","92","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Asked by Jonathan Karl, of ABC News, what he thought about the controversy over donations from wealthy foreign interests to the Clinton Foundation, Sanders replied, “It tells me what is a very serious problem. It’s not just about Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton. It is about a political system today that is dominated by big money. It’s about the Koch brothers being prepared to spend nine hundred million dollars in the coming election. … We’re looking at a system where our democracy is being owned by a handful of billionaires.”","93","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Sanders isn’t an attack dog. He likes to boast that he has never run a negative ad, and, rather than personalizing things, he generally sticks to the issues. Asked at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday why he was a better candidate than Clinton, he dodged the question. But the Clinton Foundation isn’t the only area where, in the past few days, he has raised questions about Clinton’s record. During an interview on CNN, he said that she ought to say whether she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade deal that the Obama Administration is trying to complete. And, in an interview with the Associated Press, Sanders reminded people that Clinton voted for the Iraq War and he voted against it.","94","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Despite these pointed statements, the conventional wisdom in political circles is that Sanders’s entry into the race is good news for Team Brooklyn. He can’t win the primary, the argument goes, and he will occupy the space to the left of Clinton, thus denying it to more plausible candidates, such as Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland. That may be true. But if Sanders succeeds in building a vigorous grassroots campaign, as Dean did in 2004, he could still have a significant impact on the contest.","95","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Admittedly, that’s a big if. For much of his career, Sanders has been a loner rather than a team player. His social-media presence is respectable but not huge. (His Facebook page has just under a million “likes”; on Twitter, he has close to three hundred thousand followers. ) Until he shows that he can attract big crowds and raise money from small donors, other players on the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, such as labor unions and environmental groups, will remain wary of endorsing him.","96","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"But, for all the challenges Sanders faces, his presence in the Democratic primary field is surely a plus. As I pointed out a few months ago, when he released his Economic Agenda for America, he’s a genuine economic populist, and many of his policy proposals—such as spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure investment, introducing a carbon tax, and replacing private health insurance with Medicare for all—are eminently defensible, if politically unrealistic. Most of all, he will provide a voice to those Democrats who agree with him that the U.S. political system has been bought, lock, stock, and barrel. In the televised debates and elsewhere, he will demand that the other candidates, Clinton included, respond to this indictment and say what they intend to do about it.","97","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"That alone is sufficient reason to welcome Sanders to the race. If, in addition, he manages to expand the range of policy options that can be openly discussed and forces Clinton to move from generalities to specifics, he will have performed a real public service.","98","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Hillary Clinton’s official announcement that she is running for President comes almost ten months to the day that she set out on a book tour to promote “Hard Choices,” a memoir of her four years as Secretary of State. Much has happened since that day, when supporters lined up for hours to get into the Barnes and Noble in Manhattan’s Union Square, where Clinton was signing copies, and some of it will work to her advantage.","April 11, 2015","99","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"With Elizabeth Warren’s refusal to jump into the Democratic primary, Clinton still lacks effective competition, whereas early indications that the Republican contest would turn into a slugfest have been confirmed, with at least half a dozen serious candidates entering, or preparing to enter, the race. In the past year or so, the U.S. economic situation has improved—job growth has picked up (with the exception of last month), and the number of people without health insurance has continued to fall as the effects of the Affordable Care Act have taken hold. Assuming Clinton wins the nomination, both of these things will make it easier for her to defend President Obama’s legacy, and to point to the potential folly, with things improving, of the economy coming under the tutelage of extremist Republicans.","100","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"","101","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Doubtless, the Republican candidates will subject Clinton to virulent attacks on all manner of subjects, but that could well help her to unite the Democratic Party behind her, and to rally the activists whose support she will need to get out the vote in places such as Florida and Ohio. Moreover, the electoral map remains favorable to the Democrats. If Clinton can carry all of the eighteen states, plus the District of Columbia, that have gone blue in every election since her husband’s first victory, in 1992, she will have two hundred and forty-two electoral votes, leaving her within striking distance of victory. As always, the contest is likely to come down a few battleground states, including Florida, Ohio, and Virginia. If Clinton can hold together the “Obama coalition” of young voters, women, and minorities, she has a very good chance of winning. (On the online-betting sites, she is the firm favorite.)","102","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"While the external circumstances favor Clinton, the preparations for her campaign have been anything but smooth. Her book tour was marred by a series of mini-gaffes—or that’s what the media perceived them to be, anyway. Earlier this year, it emerged that the Clintons’ charitable foundation, which was recently renamed the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, had taken donations from foreign governments, including repressive ones such as the monarchies that rule Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Then came the news that, during her time at the State Department, Clinton set up and operated a private e-mail system, whose server was subsequently wiped clean at her request. Clinton insisted that she had preserved all of the work-related e-mails on her server, about thirty thousand of them, and forwarded copies of them to Congress, but Republicans on Capitol Hill (and on the campaign trail) are unlikely to let the matter drop.","103","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"To be sure, many Democratic strategists insist that the furor over the Clinton Foundation donations and the e-mails are inside-the-Beltway affairs that won’t have any lasting impact on her campaign. But recent opinion polls tell a somewhat different story. In a Gallup poll carried out in early June, 2014, Clinton’s approval rating was fifty-four per cent, and her disapproval rating was forty-three per cent. Now, according to the Huffington Post’s poll-of-polls, her approval rating is forty-eight per cent and her disapproval rating is 46.2 per cent. And two recent polls, from Public Policy Polling and from Fox, show Clinton’s unfavorability rating moving above fifty per cent.","104","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"In the aftermath of the e-mails story, the Republicans also appeared to be eating into Clinton’s putative lead over various G.O.P. candidates in a number of battleground states—gaps that, until recently, had been holding steady. A poll from Quinnipiac University, released a few days ago, showed Clinton tied (statistically speaking) in Colorado and in Iowa with seven Republicans: Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, and Ted Cruz. (In Colorado, Walker, Paul, and Rubio were actually leading Clinton, but all of their leads were within the poll’s margin of error.) In Virginia, Clinton still seems to be holding her ground. According to the poll, she leads the Republicans by margins that vary from four points to ten points. But over all, the survey’s message was a worrying one for her campaign: “It is difficult to see Secretary Clinton’s slippage as anything other than a further toll on her image from the furor over her e-mail,” the assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll, Peter A. Brown, said.","105","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Of course, it is very early, and the polling data shouldn’t be taken too seriously. In the old days—I’m talking twenty or thirty years ago—a disapproval rating of more than forty per cent was considered a serious handicap to any candidate, but things have changed. In the current, highly polarized environment, Republicans rarely say they approve of Democrats, or vice versa. At the start of 2012, President Obama’s disapproval rating sat at about fifty per cent, according to Gallup, yet, he handily won reëlection. The key to victory isn’t being popular. It’s being less unpopular than the other candidate and getting your supporters to turn out.","106","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"With a formidable Democratic campaign apparatus to call on and a bruising Republican primary ahead, Clinton shouldn’t have much trouble raising the alarm about the prospect of the G.O.P. controlling the White House, as well as Congress. But, of course, it will be a tough race. The Republicans are coming off a strong performance in the midterms, and the Democrats have occupied the White House for eight years. As Al Gore discovered, in 2000, winning a third Presidential term for your party isn’t easy, even if you win the popular vote.","107","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Clinton’s first task is to switch the focus away from the e-mails story, which has clearly had an adverse effect on her reputation. Until now, her strategy has been to try to tough it out and move on. But she must be aware that the explanation she provided for setting up her own e-mail operation—it was all a matter of convenience—was a flimsy one, and that it didn’t persuade a lot of people. Referring to the Quinnipiac poll in Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia, Brown said,“In all three of these states, more, and in Colorado many more, registered voters say she is not honest and trustworthy. Voters do think she is a strong leader—a key metric—but unless she can change the honesty perception, running as a competent but dishonest candidate has serious potential problems.”","108","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Having offered up her version of the e-mails story, Clinton could hardly change tack, but she had to do something to arrest the decline in her numbers. Hence, surely, the decision to launch her campaign now, and then, reportedly, to travel to Iowa in the coming days and, later this month, to New Hampshire. That was clearly the right thing to do. Now Clinton needs to demonstrate that, at the age of sixty-seven, after more than twenty years in the public spotlight, she represents a brighter future rather than a fractious past.","109","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"An important part of her message, and one that the all-male Republican field may well have trouble countering, is that it’s high time for America to elect a female President. But if Clinton is to follow the examples of Margaret Thatcher, Angela Merkel, and Dilma Rousseff, she will also have to project a powerful message about where she wants to lead the country. In policy terms, all indications are that she will run a traditional Democratic campaign, promoting social mobility and emphasizing the interests of the middle class. That’s what Bill Clinton did in 1992; it’s what she did in 2008; and it’s what Obama did in 2012. Given the enduring problems of wage stagnation and rising inequality, it is the appropriate and right agenda.","110","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"The task is to make it sound fresh and convincing. I well recall Michael Dukakis campaigning on his version of the “middle-class agenda,” and it wasn’t enough to carry him to victory over George H. W. Bush. But things have changed since 1988, when the full scale of the economic challenge facing ordinary Americans was only beginning to be understood. Today there is hardly a policy-oriented economist in the country who isn’t concerned, in some way, about issues relating to wage stagnation and inequality. To tackle these problems and to promote what is often referred to as “inclusive prosperity,” Clinton can call on a wide range of experts, and a number of detailed proposals that Democratic think tanks, such as the centrist Center for American Progress and the liberal Economic Policy Institute have laid out in recent reports. The ideas range from raising the minimum wage and encouraging the growth of trade unions, to changing the tax code and investing in infrastructure.","111","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Policy wonks, myself included, will be watching closely to see what proposals Clinton adopts and which experts she chooses to rely on. (So far, she’s covering all her bases. A few weeks ago, she spoke at a Center for American Progress event. Last week, she attended a meeting organized by the progressive Roosevelt Institute.) But from the broader perspective of her campaign, the imperative is that she taps into the deep economic insecurity that many Americans feel, and that she is seen to have a credible and sensible agenda for tackling it. And on top of that, of course, she will need to craft a foreign-policy message that addresses Americans’ concerns about the chaos they see enveloping many parts of the world, but that hopefully also goes beyond the hawkish stance that she sometimes adopted in the Senate.","112","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Can she do it? It won’t necessarily be easy and, almost certainly, it won’t be pleasant to watch. Barring something unexpected, the former Secretary of State and First Lady will be engaged in the fight of her life for the next nineteen months. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned about her over the years, it’s that she’s a battler.","113","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Mario Cuomo was so impressive an orator that he had to title a collection of his speeches “More Than Words,” lest anybody gets the wrong idea. The three-term New York governor, who died on Thursday at the age of eighty-two, resented the notion that he could speak better than he could govern. “People say, ‘Well, he gives a good speech but there are homeless in the streets and the taxes are too high,’ ” he complained to the New York Times in 1993, the year the anthology was published. “If you do something extremely well . . . people will believe automatically that you can’t do anything else.” (Ineloquently, he called it “a variation of the dumb blonde syndrome.”)","January 2, 2015","114","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomos-finest-moment"
"The greatest of Cuomo’s speeches may well be his lecture at the University of Notre Dame, in September 1984, on Catholicism and public morality; in the thirty years since, few political speeches have approached that one in intellectual acuity. (Barack Obama’s “race speech” during the 2008 campaign was one.) In it, he identified “a latitude of judgment” in Catholic teaching and rejected the notion, in the face of rising religious fundamentalism, that “our morality should be everybody else’s,” particularly when it concerned public-policy matters such as abortion and capital punishment. Cuomo’s own favorite speech, perhaps tellingly, was the grim commencement speech that he gave in June 1984, at Iona College. Cuomo addressed—chastised, really—his fellow-parents, asking whether they had the right to instruct the graduates (who included his daughter Maria) on the value of serving others. “How do we tell them that one not be discouraged by the imperfection of the world and the inevitability of death and diminishment?” Though the Iona speech was “not a great” one, Cuomo later told William Safire, it “says best what is most important to me.”","115","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomos-finest-moment"
"","116","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomos-finest-moment"
"But the speech that most resonated in the national consciousness is without doubt Cuomo’s keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, in San Francisco, the convention that marked Walter Mondale for annihilation later that year at the hands of the incumbent President, Ronald Reagan. The Cuomo keynote had much the same effect as the speech by Ted Kennedy at the Democratic Convention of 1980, where President Carter was resignedly renominated, or Reagan’s remarks at the Republican gathering in 1976, after losing the nomination to President Ford. Cuomo stole the show, leaving the delegates with the sinking feeling that they had picked the wrong man. On the floor at the Moscone Center, unease about Mondale was so pronounced that a “Draft Cuomo” movement became a real, if mathematically remote, possibility; after giving his speech on July 16th, Cuomo promptly skipped town and stifled the prospect.","117","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomos-finest-moment"
"At the podium, Cuomo took, as his point of departure, the President’s frequent reference to America as a “shining city upon a hill” (the phrase, which comes from the Sermon on the Mount, was brought to the Massachusetts Bay Colony by John Winthrop, in 1630; Reagan later applied the shine). “The hard truth,” Cuomo said at the start of his speech, “is that not everyone is sharing in this city’s splendor and glory.” There is, he said, another part of the city—a part where “there are more poor than ever, more families in trouble, more and more people who need help but can’t find it,” where people sleep in the streets, “in the gutter, where the glitter doesn’t show.” America, in Cuomo’s telling, was less a city on a hill than “A Tale of Two Cities,” and the touch of Queens in the way he said “gutter” made clear which of these two cities Cuomo came from, and which he spoke for.","118","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomos-finest-moment"
"There was a seriousness, even a severity, to Cuomo’s delivery. Still, it was an impassioned performance, and, as James Reston of the Times rated it, a “brilliant” one, “with every word, gesture, expression and pause in harmony.” Garry Wills saw in Cuomo the “moral urgency” of the black preacher; and this address, like so many of Cuomo’s speeches, was a sort of civic sermon. It inveighed against the evils of Reaganism—“a kind of social Darwinism” that held that “the wagon train will not make it to the frontier unless some of the old, some of the young, some of the weak are left behind by the side of the trail.” Democrats, Cuomo said, thought the wagon train could get there with “the whole family aboard,” and with room to “extend and enlarge that family” along the way.","119","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomos-finest-moment"
"That metaphor—the nation as a family—was a favorite of Cuomo’s, and, though it’s as timeworn and trite as a trope can be, Cuomo gave it new meaning—as a moral summons, as a philosophy of government, and as a rejoinder to Reagan’s emphasis on the individual above all. “We believe in a single fundamental idea that describes better than most textbooks and any speech that I could write what a proper government should be: the idea of family, mutuality, the sharing of benefits and burdens for the good of all, feeling one another’s pain, sharing one another’s blessings—reasonably, honestly, fairly, without respect to race, or sex, or geography, or political affiliation,” Cuomo declared. “We believe we must be the family of America, recognizing that at the heart of the matter we are bound one to another.” This, he said, was the Democratic credo: “We believe in only the government we need, but we insist on all the government we need.”","120","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomos-finest-moment"
"On the floor, the speech brought catharsis. It was all the things that Democrats wished themselves to be but no longer felt they were as a party. It was bold, in its willingness to take on a popular President directly; it was unapologetic, stating its beliefs clearly and without equivocation; it drew its indignation from some inner store of strength and conviction, not from mere calculation. “Some old-timers said it was the greatest political speech they had heard,” wrote the Times columnist Anthony Lewis. “It was as electrifying as any I remember, and I have been going to political conventions for thirty years.” Cuomo’s speech underscored just what was missing in Mondale, who, in November, nearly managed the feat of losing all fifty states to Reagan.","121","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomos-finest-moment"
"Cuomo’s performance, coupled with Mondale’s loss, rendered the Governor an instant front-runner for the next Democratic nomination. Cuomo ceded that opportunity—and, with it, much of his influence—in February 1987, when he declined, inexplicably, to run. He pulled back again in December 1991. The Democrats chose, in his stead, two successive anti-Cuomos. In 1988, Michael Dukakis heralded “competence” as a core value, like a man running to be the nation’s chief operating officer. In 1992, Bill Clinton galvanized the middle class, as Cuomo had, but challenged the orthodoxies that Cuomo by then had come to represent: chiefly, the old Democratic faith in the efficacy of government. That impression cost Cuomo some measure of his popularity—and, with it, his bid for reëlection in 1994, to a state senator named George Pataki. “I think a lot of people are saying government doesn’t appear to be using my money well, therefore I resent their taking it,” Cuomo reflected a few days after his defeat. A decade after his triumphal appearance in San Francisco, he had come to seem like something of an anachronism.","122","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomos-finest-moment"
"No longer, it seems. The nation’s economy is growing today, as it had been in 1984 when he gave his speech. But for many Americans, what Mario Cuomo called “the struggle to live with dignity” remains our defining challenge. It is “the hard substance of things.” Its stubborn persistence is why we hear, increasingly, echoes of Cuomo in the ardency of Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats; Mayor Bill de Blasio, of New York, has even revived “a tale of two cities.” These echoes affirm what Daniel Patrick Moynihan said about Cuomo’s convention speech: “He created a memory.” Now that Cuomo has died, it is the work of his extended family—the country—to determine what that memory means for our future.","123","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomos-finest-moment"

"In the midterm elections last year, the G.O.P. picked up nine seats, to move to a fifty-four to forty-six majority; for the first time in Barack Obama’s Presidency, Democrats had lost control of both houses of Congress. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, not only won his own reëlection but assumed the role of Majority Leader, which he had long sought. McConnell is the perfect Senate leader for the modern Republican Party. Though he began his political life as a moderate, he has evolved into a fierce conservative warrior, dedicated to obstructing the President’s agenda in every possible way. Thanks in significant part to McConnell’s maneuvers, the use of the filibuster has become so pervasive that it’s now assumed that sixty votes are required for any Senate action.","125","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"

"In his most brazen act so far, McConnell has prevented a confirmation vote for Loretta Lynch, the President’s choice for Attorney General, even though a majority of Senators have indicated publicly that they will vote for her. It is almost unheard of for a nominee for a major cabinet position like Attorney General to be kept waiting for so long. Especially when her confirmation is assured, this kind of manipulation of Senate processes signals McConnell’s determination to humiliate the President and his nominees seemingly just because he can.","127","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"

"As a matter of principle, Republicans believe in a government of limited powers—one that governs best by governing least. Democrats are activists by inclination and by ideology, which means that they are always trying to do more, not less. A Senate that does nothing, or next to nothing, suits the broader Republican agenda as well as it suits the Party’s anti-Obama inclinations.","129","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"
"In the last days of his tenure as Majority Leader of the Democrats, Harry Reid grew so frustrated with Republican obstruction that he changed the Senate rules, doing away with filibusters on lower-court judicial and Administration appointees, like cabinet members. This destroyed what little was left of the once-famous comity of the Senate, where the right to filibuster (for better or worse) has usually been regarded with reverence. Still, Reid’s move was enormously effective, too. President Obama owes his stamp on the federal judiciary to Reid’s aggressive use of his own power.","130","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"
"McConnell has been as fierce in his desire to stop things from happening as Reid was to accomplish them. Since McConnell took over, just after the first of the year, the Senate has been bogged down in a futile effort to defund the Department of Homeland Security (in protest of Obama’s actions on immigration), to fund the Keystone XL pipeline (which Obama was always going to veto), and to pass an anti-human-trafficking bill (which has become derailed by a fight over abortion). In more than three months, the Senate has approved just a single judicial nominee, a district judge from Texas.","131","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"
"As Alec MacGillis notes in his recent e-book biography of McConnell, the new Majority Leader is, above all, a tactician, always thinking about the next vote, the next chance to force his adversaries into a difficult political predicament. But that’s the limit of McConnell’s political imagination. His broader agenda consists entirely of afflicting Democrats rather than passing legislation.","132","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"
"But McConnell’s cramped vision is well suited to his current post. In one way, this has worked to Obama’s advantage. McConnell, like most Republicans, has been intensely critical of the Administration’s preliminary accord with Iran. But McConnell and his Republican colleagues are also reluctant to take responsibility for killing the deal altogether. Despite all of their complaints about the deal, their actual legislation on the subject, in the end, looks as though it will not really limit the President’s authority at all. Indeed, the proposal turned out to be so anodyne that Obama indicated on Tuesday that he would sign it.","133","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"
"Still, the retreat on Iran notwithstanding, there can be little doubt that McConnell will extend himself to obstruct what’s left of the President’s agenda. Judicial confirmations, which remain the exclusive province of the Senate, will continue at their slow pace, especially for appellate-court nominees. Major fights loom about the budget and the debt ceiling. McConnell will keep the government open—barely. By the soft bigotry of our lowered expectations about what was once known as the world’s greatest deliberative body, that will count as success.","134","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"

Barely two months after his party suffered a shattering defeat in the midterm elections, Obama walked into the House chamber looking like a quarterback just returned home from a Super Bowl triumph. “Good to see you,” he said, joshing with Democrats who had arrived early to get an aisle seat. “How are you?” If he noticed some prominent absences on the Democratic side, including such stalwart supporters as Kay Hagan and Mark Udall, two senators who lost their seats in the fall, he didn’t let on. Entering enemy terrain, the President was clearly determined to make it his own—at least for one night.","January 21, 2015","135","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"

"Although Obama ended with one of his trademark calls for unity, the address he delivered was forceful and politically charged. As expected, the heart of it was a populist economics plan that challenges virtually everything today’s Republican Party stands for. “Middle-class economics,” the President called it, and without delving into too many details he made a pretty good fist of laying it out: tax breaks for working families, a higher minimum wage, expanded child care, two years’ worth of free community-college tuition guaranteed, investments in infrastructure—and much of this to be financed by raising taxes on the rich and the big banks. “Let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one per cent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth,” Obama declared. “We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the economy.”","137","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"
"That part of the speech, which echoed some of the themes that were raised by the Occupy Wall Street movement, and that have since been further elucidated by Thomas Piketty, was well trailed. What came as more of a surprise was the President’s over-all tone, which clearly reflected his recent successes in doing an end run around Congress on immigration policy, reaching a deal on climate change with China, reversing U.S. policy toward Cuba, and seeing his approval ratings rise on the back of good economic news. From the beginning, his language was much more celebratory than in his previous State of the Union speeches. “We are fifteen years into this new century,” he said. “It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page.” There followed a litany of indicators showing that things are going right in the Union: a growing economy, shrinking deficits, a falling unemployment rate, millions fewer people without health insurance, an end to the combat mission in Afghanistan. “America, for all that we have endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: the shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong,” he said.","138","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"
"The President wasn’t merely upbeat. He was self-assured, glib, and, at times, bordering on bumptious. “Well, we’ve been warned,” Karl Rove complained on Twitter. “POTUS will spend rest of year campaigning.” In the chamber, the Republicans, some of whom had perhaps been expecting a more humble Obama, sat mostly in silence. (As is usual on these occasions, John Boehner, the Speaker of the House, looked like he was suffering from chronic constipation.) At one point, after reciting another encouraging economic development, the President turned to the Republicans and said, “This is good news, people.” It wasn’t until near the end that he acknowledged the results of the elections—the elections he triumphed in, that is. “I have no more campaigns to run,” he said. And then, departing from his prepared remarks in response to some applause from Republicans, he smiled and added: “I know, because I won both of them.”","139","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"
"In a speech that lasted about an hour, Obama devoted barely ten minutes to foreign policy: here, too, his interpretation of recent events was highly positive. Without providing much evidence to support his assertion, he said, “In Iraq and Syria, American leadership—including our military power—is stopping ISIL’s advance.” He also asked his hosts to pass a resolution authorizing the use of force against the jihadists in Iraq and Syria, and, addressing the nuclear negotiations with Iran, promised to veto a sanctions bill if Congress passes one. Turning to Russia and Ukraine, he didn’t quite declare victory over Vladimir Putin, but he came pretty close, mocking those who suggested, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea last year, that Putin had outmaneuvered the West. “Today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters,” Obama said. “That’s how America leads: not with bluster but with persistent, steady resolve.”","140","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"
"By then, he was rolling toward the finish. He welcomed home Alan Gross, the American who had been held prisoner in Havana until the recent détente; hailed efforts to fight Ebola in West Africa (in truth, he could have made more of the efficacy of the government’s response here at home); pledged, once again, to shut down Guantánamo; and slipped in a stretcher about how restrained the United States has been in its deployment of drones. After declaring climate change to be the biggest threat to future generations, he went into a closing spiel that drew on a familiar Obama trope, saying that there’s no such thing as a liberal America and a conservative America, or a white America and a black America—only a United States of America, in which both parties should come together and embrace a “better politics.”","141","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"

"As the President is well aware, his ambition of transcending partisanship has been frustrated. In fact, he now seems quite comfortable with embracing partisanship and economic populism. Until the end of the speech, when Obama circa 2004 put in a cameo appearance, he had provided a welcome glance of the Obama whom many Democrats believed they had elected in 2008: progressive, impassioned, and persuasive. “Where was this economic Obama in 2009?” the documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney asked on Twitter. That’s a question that historians will certainly ponder.

"In early November, Loretta Lynch, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, was nominated by President Barack Obama to be the next Attorney General. The Senate Judiciary Committee has taken its sweet time considering Lynch, who would be the first African-American woman to serve as the nation’s chief law-enforcement officer. She has made the most of the interlude by meeting privately with all twenty of the senators on the committee—both Republicans who have already declared their opposition to her confirmation and those who are more favorably disposed. Given her strong support among the committee’s Democrats, she needs only two Republican votes for her nomination to move forward. She seems to have those votes. Still, it is unclear when, or even if, her nomination will reach the Senate floor. On Tuesday, Ted Cruz, Republican Senator of Texas and a member of the committee, demanded that Lynch’s nomination be blocked until the Administration changes its immigration policies.","February 5, 2015","148","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"

"The new Senate majority, despite its stated intention to show that Republicans can govern, seems to be off to a wobbly start. At the same time that Cruz was defying a promise made by the new majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, to give Loretta Lynch “the courtesy of a vote on the floor,” the House of Representatives, with its large Republican majority, was sending up a Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill that had attached to it provisions that would reverse the President’s most significant executive actions on immigration. Senate Democrats, rediscovering a fondness for the filibuster, killed the bill, leaving Republicans with the unhappy prospect of having Homeland Security go broke on their watch before the end of February. Governing is not for the fainthearted. House Speaker John Boehner’s troops continued to not show the way on Tuesday, by voting to repeal Obamacare for the fifty-sixth time.","150","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"
"There were, finally, two days of committee hearings on Lynch’s nomination last week. The proceedings had their circus touches. No fewer than three of the witnesses called by Republican senators are pursuing litigation against the Administration. One of them, Sharyl Attkisson, a conservative investigative journalist, is seeking thirty-five million dollars in damages from the Department of Justice and Eric Holder, the present Attorney General, for allegedly hacking into her phone and computer. Another, Catherine Engelbrecht, the founder of an election-watchdog group called True the Vote, is suing the Internal Revenue Service for allegedly targeting her for her political views. The testimony of such witnesses seemed to have little to do with Loretta Lynch. At least the Baptist minister from her North Carolina home town, called by her supporters on the committee, knew her family.","151","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"
"“You’re not Eric Holder, are you?” Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, asked her. Lynch smiled, and said, “No, I’m not, sir.” If confirmed, she added, “I will be Loretta Lynch.”","152","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"
"Still, actual serious questions were raised in the hearings. Republican senators were intent on establishing the degree of Lynch’s independence from the President who nominated her. Did she differ from Obama on any issue? This question, although it can be posed as pure partisan gotcha—and Lynch did her best to avoid answering it—actually goes to the heart of the Attorney General’s dual role: Presidential adviser and cabinet member on one hand, impartial law officer on the other. (Holder infuriated his conservative critics by describing himself as Obama’s “wingman.”) Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, finally succeeded in creating some daylight between Lynch and the President by quoting from remarks that Obama made last year, to this magazine, about his youthful pot smoking and the fact that he doesn’t consider marijuana any more dangerous than alcohol. Lynch the federal prosecutor firmly disagreed with that last bit. She also expressed an old-fashioned belief in the effectiveness of the death penalty.","153","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"
"But the main topic of the confirmation hearings was immigration policy. Did Lynch believe that President Obama’s executive action, in November, 2014, to defer the arrest and deportation of large categories of undocumented immigrants—which Cruz, Sessions, and their fellow would-be minutemen call “unconstitutional amnesty”—was legal? Lynch, unable to dodge this question, which came at her from many angles, said that she found the opinion issued on the matter by the Justice Department, analyzing the government’s powers with respect to deportation enforcement, “a reasonable discussion of legal precedent.” That was not good enough. If Lynch did not intend to defend the Constitution, her nomination would not receive the votes of the hard-liners on the Judiciary Committee. To Cruz, Lynch’s rather mild allusions to prosecutorial discretion amounted to an alarming assertion that any category of lawbreaker might be arbitrarily amnestied under the rogue regime that the Obama Administration has become.","154","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"
"Of course, Ted Cruz is running, more floridly than most potential candidates, for President. After the first day of hearings, he told CQ Roll Call, “She could not give any instance of a limit on the President’s authority. That is profoundly dangerous to have [in] an Attorney General, who, by her own testimony, is prepared to rubber stamp unconstitutional conduct by the President.” Well, maybe that wasn’t Lynch’s testimony exactly, Senator. But we take your point. This nomination shall be blocked for as long as you need to get a few more wild remarks off your chest.","155","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"

"The tension between big-tent inclusiveness and ideological purity has bedevilled our two major political parties for many years, but for Democrats it became especially vexing in the middle decades of the twentieth century. From 1932 to 1964, the Democratic Party won seven out of nine Presidential elections and enjoyed an almost continuous majority in the House and the Senate. But who, exactly, was winning and what did victory mean? The answer was clear in only two intervals. The first was the initial phase of the New Deal, when Franklin Roosevelt’s economic-rescue proposals were swiftly passed into law by Congress and embraced by a nation traumatized by the Great Depression. The second came during the three-year period after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, when Lyndon Johnson and Congress went on a legislative spree that ended with the midterm election in November, 1966.","157","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"“The Fierce Urgency of Now” (Penguin Press), Julian E. Zelizer’s account of wins and losses in the Johnson years, combines history with political science, as befits our data-happy moment. The information comes at us steadily—there are useful facts on almost every page—but the narrative is spartanly furnished. There’s little portraiture, not much drama, and only enough mood-setting context to let us know what America was up to while L.B.J. and Congress were contriving new ways to strengthen the social safety net and exhaust the national treasury. The emphasis falls instead on the high, and sometimes low, workings of legislative government, as bills inched through committees and subcommittees, nicked and scarred in “mark-up” sessions; the feint-and-parry of parliamentary maneuver; and, above all, the votes.","158","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"This patient no-frills approach offers illuminations that a more cinematic treatment might not. And if Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton, at times betrays the head-counting instincts of a House whip, well, head-counting is the nuts and bolts of congressional lawmaking, as scholars like Nelson Polsby and David Mayhew pointed out a generation ago, and as Ira Katznelson, Sarah Binder, and Frances Lee have done more recently. “Overshadowed by presidents and social movements, legislators remain ghosts in America’s historical imagination,” Zelizer observed in “The American Congress,” the large and very useful anthology he edited in 2004. Its analyses, by him and thirty-nine others, begin with the Continental Congress and go all the way up to the Clinton and Bush years—not likely to be known as the Gingrich or DeLay years, even as these scholars cut the Leaders of the Free World down to their proper constitutional size.","159","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"The idea of an imperial Presidency was always an exaggeration. “A President, these days, is an invaluable clerk,” Richard Neustadt, the dean of Presidential theorists, pointed out in 1960.The clerk at the time was Dwight Eisenhower, the general and war hero twice elected in landslides, only to be frustrated, like so many popular Presidents before and since, in skirmishes with well-organized adversaries on Capitol Hill. Congressmen were the heavies then, just as they are today. And yet, however much we say that we dislike our representatives, we keep sending many of them back to Washington. Together, Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid, each his party’s leader in the Senate, have spent fifty-eight years there. In the House, John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi have logged a combined fifty-two. These four, and some others, compose our democracy’s only long-term elected class.","160","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"What distinguished L.B.J. from almost all his predecessors and successors was his profound rootedness in Congress, where he spent a dozen years in the House and another dozen in the Senate. As Majority Leader, he became as famous as a senator could be, thanks to his resourcefulness and his genius for compromise and his almost feral magnetism. But it was seldom clear what L.B.J. really wanted, apart from dominating the game and intimidating the other players. Robert Caro has turned the question over on a spit in four immensely detailed volumes and still seems undecided. Real-time observers were mystified, too. “The test will come when he runs out of ideas,” Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., remarked in August, 1964. “Up to this point he has been living intellectually on the Kennedy years.” A year later, L.B.J. had signed Medicare and the Voting Rights Act into law, seven days apart.","161","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"But in politics the truly new idea is a rarity. Much of the agenda presented with such fanfare in the nineteen-sixties, first by Kennedy and then by Johnson, had been in congressional circulation since the nineteen-forties and fifties, and Johnson was well versed in its fine points. As early as 1949, Senator Hubert Humphrey, who had a master’s degree in political science, was proposing one bill after another on national health insurance, Social Security extensions, and federally financed school construction. Not one had a chance of becoming law then, because the votes weren’t there. They’d gone missing in F.D.R.’s second term, when an alliance of Republicans and Southern Democrats formed “the conservative coalition,” a bloc that functioned as an autonomous congressional party, supplanting the two nominally major ones. By the time L.B.J. became President, Congress had been, as Zelizer says, a “graveyard of liberal legislation” for more than a quarter century.","162","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"As late as 1960, some thought a vigorous new President might single-handedly revitalize Congress. This was a delusion. In August, a few weeks after Kennedy promised a “New Frontier” in his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, the Times’ Tom Wicker cautioned that if Kennedy won he would meet the fearsome “roadblock in Congress,” the House Committee on Rules, which, under the control of a “six-man conservative junta,” was “virtually a third branch of Congress—equal to and sometimes superior to the Senate and the House.” It was controlled by its chairman, Howard Smith, of Virginia, who decided which bills reached the floor for a general vote and which did not.","163","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"In the Senate, Southern domination was even greater. Johnson had spent his years as Majority Leader in continual negotiation with the chamber’s true “master,” Richard Russell, Jr., the Georgia segregationist whose weapon was the filibuster—not the lone-wolf stunts performed recently by Rand Paul and Ted Cruz but martial epics, involving a “platoon” of men who delivered four-hour monologues on a rotating basis. “The Senate might be described without too much violence to fact as the South’s unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg,” the journalist William S. White wrote in “Citadel,” a best-selling account of the Senate published in 1957. White, a Texan, was by no means a critic of the Senate. He was enamored of its rituals and thought it had a “touch of authentic genius.” At a lunch organized by Johnson, not long after the book was published, each freshman senator found a copy of “Citadel” at his place setting with two inscriptions, one by White, the other by L.B.J., who urged them all to study it “as a sort of McGuffey’s Reader,” one of the freshman, Joseph Clark, recalled.","164","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Clark, who called Congress “the sapless branch,” belonged to the growing and restive corps of liberal Democrats who found the Senate less the genteel club that White described than a mildewed establishment. Part of the problem was bipartisanship. “L.B.J. has no idea of his own but consensus,” Schlesinger noted. The criticism rings strangely today, when consensus and bipartisanship have become the holy grails of government, but in the mid-twentieth century they seemed symptoms of stasis and even atrophy. Humphrey, who was in the vanguard of a fresh style of Democratic politics—“issues-based” rather than interest-group-appeasing—inveighed against the “rotten political bargain” that Southern Democrats, including Johnson, had sealed with Republicans. Genuine political progress, he maintained, had to begin with institutional reform.","165","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"There had been talk of overhauling Congress, within the institution and outside it, for generations. In 1879, when Woodrow Wilson was a senior at Princeton, he wrote a celebrated essay advocating a British-style “cabinet government,” in which the heads of State, Treasury, and so on would simultaneously serve in the Senate, thus linking the legislative and executive branches in a unified system of majority rule. He elaborated on the idea in his dissertation, “Congressional Government,” printed fifteen times between 1885 and 1900. Its targets included the House’s many committees and their ducal “elders.” Whenever a bill “goes from the clerk’s desk to a committee-room it crosses a parliamentary bridge of sighs to dim dungeons of silence whence it will never return,” Wilson wrote. “The means and time of its death are unknown, but its friends never see it again.” It is impossible to imagine anyone today writing such a book and wishing to enter politics, much less being elected President twice. Yet when Wilson arrived at the White House, in 1913, he tried to improvise the “straightforward, inartificial party government” he had championed. He went to Congress to deliver the State of the Union address rather than submit a written message, as every President since Jefferson had done. He also made the “President’s room” in the Capitol an actual office for meetings with committee chairmen. But the institutional friction was too great. Later, when a proposal was held up by filibuster, Wilson urged a cloture rule cutting off debate. The Senate adopted one, but it set the bar unreachably high: a two-thirds-majority vote, which stayed in place until 1975.","166","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"In 1941, the American Political Science Association appointed a “Committee on Congress” to explore possible wide-ranging reforms. Some in Congress were amenable and put the leader of the A.P.S.A. team in charge of a Joint House-Senate Committee. After many hearings and much delay, a “reorganization” was approved in 1946. It eliminated lots of committees, taking the House from forty-eight to nineteen and the Senate from thirty-three to fifteen. (Today, there are twenty-one and twenty, respectively.) But the reorganization didn’t include the A.P.S.A.’s most important suggestions: changing the rigid next-in-line “senility system” of chairmanships, reducing the power of the Rules Committee, taming the filibuster with a less onerous cloture rule. The streamlining concentrated even more power in the hands of those who already had it.","167","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Nor did the reforms address the muddled identities of the two major parties. In 1944, reflecting on the legislative stalemate of the prewar years, F.D.R. concluded that the two parties were dysfunctional, “split by dissenters.” That year, he suggested to Wendell Willkie, the moderate Republican he had run against in 1940, that the two form a new “liberal” party. (A decade later, Eisenhower, under attack from isolationists who threatened his ability to conduct his foreign policy, talked of a new party of “progressive moderates,” perhaps one modelled on Theodore Roosevelt’s Bull Moosers.) But a second and even more influential A.P.S.A. report, “Toward a More Responsible Two-Party System,” published in 1950, sifted through the problem of party discipline. This report grew out of a project supervised by E. E. Schattschneider, a professor at Wesleyan and a leading exponent of Wilsonian party government. A political party that “does not capitalize on its successes by mobilizing the whole power of the government is a monstrosity reflecting the stupidity of professional politicians who are more interested in the petty spoils of office than they are in the control of the richest and most powerful government in the world,” Schattschneider had written.","168","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"This argument became the overriding theme of the 1950 report. Schattschneider’s team of fifteen scholars and policy experts had talked to congressional leaders, to officials in the Truman Administration, and to state and local politicians. It concluded that the two major parties were “probably the most archaic institutions in the United States”—scarcely more than “loose associations of state and local organizations, with very little national machinery and very little national cohesion.” The Republican or Democrat sent to Congress was seldom screened by the national party and so felt no obligation to support the party’s program, if he even knew what it was. Once in office, he delivered patronage and pork to his constituents back home. He operated free of a coherent agenda and belonged to no “binding” caucus. The parties, in other words, were failing because they weren’t sufficiently ideological, partisan, and polarizing.","169","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"The solution was a “responsible party system”—centralized, idea-driven, serious-minded. Each party needed stronger central “councils” that met regularly, not just in Convention years, to establish principles and programs. Candidates should be expected to campaign on these platforms and then to carry them out, with dissidents punished or expelled. The party in power would enact its program, and the minority party would provide strong criticism and develop alternatives to present at election time.","170","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Schlesinger, for one, glimpsed “the shadow of an infatuation with the British party system.” He was right. Some drafters of the A.P.S.A. report had admired recent events in England, where the Labour Government elected in 1945 had nationalized the railroad and coal industries and, over Tory opposition, introduced a national health service. Labour had campaigned on the promise of a welfare state, and voters had known what they were getting. By comparison, American government looked sluggish and ineffectual. President Truman got nowhere with his health-care proposal, largely because of vehement and well-funded opposition from the American Medical Association. Schattschneider had something to say about that, too. As he had written in his 1942 book “Party Government,” the two parties “let themselves be harried by pressure groups as a timid whale might be pursued by a school of minnows.”","171","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"To the rising generation of liberal legislators, party government made sense. At the 1948 Democratic Convention, Hubert Humphrey spoke in passionate support of a civil-rights plank. (Its provisions included an anti-lynching law and a fair-employment-practices commission.) Instead of trying to appease the party’s Southern bloc, he met it head on. “The time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states’ rights, and to walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights,” Humphrey said.","172","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"It was an electrifying speech; some sixty million people heard it on the radio, and as many as ten million more saw it on television. The plank was voted in, and the entire Mississippi delegation, along with half of Alabama’s, stalked out. Humphrey, suddenly famous, won his Senate race in November and in 1949 landed on the cover of Time. Truman paid heavily. The Southerners went ahead with their threat to form their own party. The States’ Rights Democratic Party nominee, Strom Thurmond, won a million votes, and captured four states in the South. Humphrey had created a wedge issue within his own party. It was the beginning of the liberal insurgency that climaxed in the Great Society and gave rise to a new politics.","173","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Purging dissidents was the first step toward building a new congressional party. A second was drawing together like-minded legislators and voters who for the time being were kept apart by the two-party system. If Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans could form a congressional majority, Northerners in both parties might do the same. By the time L.B.J. became President, this possibility had been tossed around for years. In 1958, after the Democrats’ victories in the midterms cut into G.O.P. strongholds from New England to California, Richard Rovere, this magazine’s political correspondent, predicted “a coalition of Northern Republicans and Northern Democrats, led by the latter.” The two groups contained members who were “ideologically indistinguishable,” he wrote. But the moment hadn’t yet come for them to unite. Zelizer does the arithmetic: “In 1957 and 1958, southern Democrats and midwestern Republicans controlled 311 out of 435 seats in the House, and they held 71 out of 96 seats in the Senate. Even after the midterm elections of 1958, which increased the number of northern liberals in both chambers, the conservative coalition retained a ninety-two-vote majority in the House and an eighteen-vote majority in the Senate.” This was why the Speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn, though sympathetic to the liberal contingent, tamped down talk of a new majority dominated by “bomb-throwing liberals,” as they were called in the press.","174","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Matters didn’t much improve in 1960. Kennedy was elected President, but he only just squeaked in, and the Democrats actually lost nearly two dozen members of the House, many of them liberals. And Kennedy’s métier was not legislation but foreign policy and soaring rhetoric. The visionary flights of the New Frontier excited intellectuals and the young, but in Congress Kennedy’s proposals—a tax cut, a major education bill, civil-rights legislation—fizzled back to earth like dud rockets.","175","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Congressional Democrats were the ones who set about trying to push through a progressive legislative agenda. And L.B.J., who had steadily backed away from the Dixie contingent, was helping to coax the new agenda along. In 1959, when he was still in the Senate, he had put together a committee on unemployment and assigned a freshman liberal, Eugene McCarthy, to lead it. After holding more than two dozen hearings in a dozen states, the committee issued its report, in March of 1960. As the historian Dominic Sandbrook has written, the report “called for federal assistance and public works in areas suffering from chronic unemployment, national standards of unemployment insurance, action to fight racial and other discrimination, a youth conservation corps, expanded vocational training and federal funding for retraining the jobless.” (The last of these proposals was enacted as the Manpower and Development Training Act, in 1962.)","176","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"The paramount cause for liberals was civil rights. The movement was gaining momentum in arenas far from Washington. Like other contemporary historians, Zelizer stresses the importance of Martin Luther King, Jr., and other black leaders, who boldly calculated that the drama of the freedom rides and lunch-counter sit-ins, and, later, of clashes with white law enforcement in Birmingham and Selma, would force the President and Congress to act. He similarly gives credit to the efforts of Republican congressmen, including William McCulloch, of Ohio, an indispensable advocate for civil-rights legislation. The layer that Zelizer adds involves the Democratic Study Group, a coalition of liberal House members (some of them well versed in the A.P.S.A.’s 1950 report), led initially by Eugene McCarthy and then by such people as the Missouri Democrat Richard Bolling, who turned it into the first modern congressional caucus.","177","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"These “de facto lobbyists” for institutional reform, as Zelizer wrote in his 2004 book “On Capitol Hill,” became the model for later Republican insurgencies. The strategies identified today with the Tea Party Caucus (closed-door meetings, public-relations blitzes, bloc voting, continual pressure on weak-kneed House leaders) were pioneered by the D.S.G., which originated with twenty-eight signatories to a liberal manifesto in 1957 and grew to an estimated hundred and twenty-five members—almost half the Democrats in the House—by 1964. The D.S.G. pushed the House to increase the size of the Rules Committee in 1961, weakening the conservative junta. And when the Rules Committee sat on the Civil Rights Act, Bolling collected enough signatures on a petition to force a hearing in January of 1964, the first step in a long march; the obstacles included a sixty-day team-relay filibuster orchestrated by the Senate’s Southern bloc.","178","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Johnson’s landslide victory gave him the liberal mandate he needed to push through the agenda for the Great Society, but he couldn’t have done it if the right hadn’t been undergoing its own ideological sorting—a convulsion within the G.O.P. that transferred power from the East Coast to the Sun Belt in the person of Barry Goldwater. Goldwater was a gift to liberals. One of just six Republican Senators to vote against the Civil Rights Act, he seemed the iron-jawed tribune of antigovernment extremism. He warned that the new bill would lead to a “federal police state,” turning citizens into informers, an opinion shared by the John Birch Society. Zelizer is probably right to say that Goldwater “built the Great Society,” if only because he accomplished what the liberals couldn’t: he made civil rights, and the liberal causes that followed, seem intrinsic to American idealism.","179","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"One measure of the new order was the D.S.G.’s rising influence. The group had backed forty House incumbents, of whom thirty-nine won. It also picked forty successful challengers. The membership was now larger than the entire Republican caucus, and it exulted in its power. Two Southern Democrats who had supported Goldwater were stripped of seniority rights, the kind of “sanction” the A.P.S.A. report had called for. The Democratic Study Group successfully pressed for another reform that the report had recommended: changing the makeup of committees to favor the majority party. The “Goldwater Congress,” in James Reston’s phrase, became the first instance of unlimited majority rule since the beginnings of the New Deal. “F.D.R. passed five major bills in the first one hundred days,” Johnson boasted to an aide before the 1966 midterms. “We passed two hundred in the last two years.” Actually, Roosevelt had passed fifteen. But Johnson had one enormous advantage that Roosevelt lacked: a booming economy. “We may now turn to issues more demanding of human ingenuity than that of how to put an end to poverty in the richest nation in the world,” Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an architect of the War on Poverty, wrote in a 1965 essay titled “The Professionalization of Reform.” Such issues might include “the problem of perfecting, to the highest degree possible, the quality of our lives and of our civilization.”","180","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Moderate Republicans, afraid of being branded Goldwaterites, fled to the sanctuary of the Johnson program. Most “believed that the President’s measures were in the national interest,” Geoffrey Kabaservice points out in “Rule and Ruin,” his history of the modern Republican Party. That’s one reason Medicare passed, despite the strenuous lobbying of the American Medical Association. “Approximately thirty-seven legislators who had been considered ‘friends’ of the A.M.A. were defeated” in 1964, Zelizer writes. Wilbur Mills, the tightfisted Arkansas Democrat and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, had been blocking health-care proposals since the fifties, but had come around. He dropped hints of a compromise. L.B.J., with his instinct for congressional politics, deferred to Mills. Years of dismantling bills had made Mills expert in their intricacies, and many of the wrinkles had been worked out in advance. When committee members submitted alternative versions of the program, Mills adroitly mashed all the proposals together. The committee had only thirteen days to draft a final version. That was all the time it needed.","181","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"No modern Presidency follows the arc of classical tragedy as neatly as Johnson’s. He began as awkward steward to a slain hero he resented, grew into full command of his powers while beset by self-doubt and self-loathing, and finally seemed to will his own descent. The story has been told many times, but Zelizer is especially good on the unravelling of the Great Society. At the start of 1966, L.B.J. could reel off mouthwatering numbers on jobs and wages, yet brace for losses in the midterm elections. It had happened to F.D.R.; it could happen to him. He chose to push ahead for more programs, more agencies, rather than to scale back. This heavy-handed style invited suspicion. The social critic Paul Goodman said that L.B.J.’s government, instead of safeguarding citizens, was reducing them to the status of “clients.” “Dependency” became the new term of art.","182","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Four days before the midterms, Zelizer writes, Johnson stood “in front of a turquoise backdrop, ideal for broadcasts on color television,” and in three ceremonies signed eight bills that would funnel huge sums into Great Society programs, including $6.1 billion into schools. The Democrats lost seats, in part thanks to a group of constituents many had taken for granted: working-class, pro-union, Northern whites who remained loyal to the New Deal but suspected that Great Society programs weren’t meant to help them—were, in fact, coming at their expense. Zelizer again has the numbers: “Only thirty-eight out of seventy-one Democrats elected” in 1964 “were reelected to the House in 1966.

"Two years earlier, the conservative coalition seemed finished. Now the liberal one did. Emboldened conservatives attacked “Great Society play money,” rallying votes against a modest bill to exterminate rats in city neighborhoods. Moynihan was now jeering at antipoverty programs in the pages of The Public Interest: “Toss a rock in the lobby of the Office of Economic Opportunity headquarters in Washington today, and one will hit, at random, a steely-eyed budget examiner intent on a systems analysis of health services in Hough, a bearded youth determined to overthrow the ‘entrenched autocracy’ of the Democratic Party machine in some Eastern industrial slum, a former regional director of the Peace Corps worried about Comanche reaction to the latest batch of VISTA volunteers, and a Negro lawyer concerned how to double the number of Head Start projects in his home state before the next election.”","184","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"

Against the best advice, he had been sending in more troops; ultimately, the number exceeded half a million, and total Pentagon spending reached Second World War levels. Johnson was afraid to pull out, for fear of being labelled soft on Communism. Still a creature of Congress, he remembered the convulsions over the “loss” of China and the Korean War. Johnson had been Minority Leader during much of Joe McCarthy’s rampage and found himself powerless to stop it. This time, the protest was coming from the left on campuses and among the intellectuals and the press.","185","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"The broad public hadn’t yet turned against the Vietnam War. It was the battle at home that was cause for alarm. Strife over civil rights was moving west and north. Protests in Birmingham and Selma had given way to riots in Watts, which erupted less than a week after L.B.J. signed the Voting Rights Act. Riots in Detroit and Newark followed, in the summer of 1967. Such conflict delayed the “third civil-rights bill”—a housing law that would have redressed discriminatory real-estate practices in the North. The bill cleared the House, but it was killed in the Senate by Everett Dirksen, the Illinois senator who had been instrumental in passing the first two bills. The bill passed the following year.* There had been racial violence in Chicago, and although whites had committed most of it, Zelizer explains that “Dirksen, like a growing number of Republicans, blamed civil rights activists tied to the black power movement.” After losing a skirmish with Wilbur Mills over taxes, L.B.J. muttered, “I’m not master of nothing. . . .

"Former allies turned against him, too. Eugene McCarthy, who had helped him mount an eleventh-hour run at the 1960 Presidential nomination, became the Pied Piper of the “Dump Johnson” movement organized by antiwar Democrats. College students converged in New Hampshire for the 1968 primary, and McCarthy’s strong second-place finish proved crippling to Johnson. After Robert Kennedy jumped in, Johnson concluded that he might not even get nominated. He withdrew, and the leaden mantle passed to his Vice-President, Humphrey. Captive to his own rotten bargain, Humphrey insisted that the calamitous war policy was working and so was lumped in with his party’s despised establishment elders. Humphrey and McCarthy, both Minnesotans and pioneers of the new liberal politics, battled through to the nominating Convention in Chicago.

"But, like the Beatles, they left an enduring legacy, if not one that they had envisioned. Even as the new liberal party had been forming, a new conservative party had been, too—along the axis that united the Dixie states and the Southwest. Lasting majority rule, however, would elude conservatives just as it had Democrats. Beginning with Richard Nixon, in 1968, Republicans won five of the next six Presidential elections, only to be repeatedly thwarted in Congress, outnumbered and bullied and kept off committees, just as the liberals had been. Like the liberals, they were exasperated by the deals their leaders kept making with the other side. In 1973, House bomb-throwers, following the example of the Democratic Study Group, formed the Republican Study Committee. Forty years later, it helped orchestrate a government shutdown.","188","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"To date, the most ingenious practitioner of responsible party politics has been Newt Gingrich. All its principles can be found in his “Contract with America”: the stark agenda (balance the budget, cut back welfare), the institutional reforms (term limits, limits as well for committee chairs), the implicit threat to discipline heretics. With it came the ideologically unified party that progressives had once dreamed of, complete with caucusing, late-night strategy sessions, and political-action committees. The result was not only a House majority, won in 1994, but British-style cohesion. Under Gingrich, the House of Representatives became, at last, the American House of Commons. “The Republican Party in the House is the most disciplined political party we have ever seen in the history of America,” Barney Frank said at the time.","189","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Gingrich’s reign was short-lived, but many of his reforms went forward. In 2004, House Speaker Dennis Hastert announced a new House rule: no bill would go to the floor for a vote unless “a majority of the majority” supported it. He meant a majority of Republicans, in order to reduce the danger of bipartisan passage. (This is what stopped the immigration law passed by the Senate in 2013 from reaching the House.) And when the numbers weren’t there the conservative party remained firm in its opposition. L.B.J. had mustered as many Republican votes as possible for Medicare, lest it be seen as a “Democratic bill.” President Obama didn’t have that option. It was gone from politics, though it took him a while to realize it.","190","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"

The report, drawing comfort from the very consensus it wished to do away with, confidently insisted that sharpening their disagreements wouldn’t put a forbidding “ideological wall” between the two parties. The Second World War had destroyed all the colossal isms save one, Communism, and it had no future in America. Even as Democrats and Republicans became more partisan, both sides would gravitate toward the center, where most voters were, and both would offer competing solutions to problems most voters could agree needed solving, such as securing voting rights and providing health care for the elderly.","191","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"

In the last Congress, when the House was under Republican control and Democrats ran the Senate, the House Republicans easily passed dozens of bills on party-line votes that were then ignored by the Senate.

They also have a strong incentive to work together to move legislation: going into 2016, they want to show that the G.O.P. is unified and capable of governing. But after those bills pass both chambers, they will reach Obama’s desk.

"The first test of whether this new dynamic will lead to a more productive Congress comes this week, with the debate over Keystone XL, the Canadian pipeline project that has been mired in political controversy for six years. Republicans in both the House and Senate declared that approving Keystone XL, which would carry oil from Alberta, Canada, to U.S. refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, would be their first order of business, and the House approved its version of the legislation on Friday afternoon.","198","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"At first glance, it’s absurd that approval of a Canadian corporation’s pipeline project is the new Republican Congress’s highest priority. The benefit to the U.S. economy from the construction of the pipeline would be modest—a few thousand temporary jobs created during its construction and a few dozen permanent jobs once it’s up and running. Republicans have long argued that the pipeline would help reduce fuel prices, a tenuous claim that is now beside the point because the price of a gallon of gas is at a five-year low.","199","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"Still, there is a scenario in which Boehner and McConnell’s decision to start with Keystone might be encouraging. The Obama Administration immediately announced that the President would veto the legislation. But the veto statement was silent on the merits of the project itself. Obama simply objected to Congress interfering with the pipeline-approval process, which has historically been left to the executive branch. The President’s exclusive right to approve cross-border pipelines may be such a fundamental principle to the Administration that the veto statement is the beginning and end of the debate. (Republicans don’t have the necessary sixty-seven votes to overturn an Obama veto.)","200","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"But what if the White House saw the fight over Keystone as an opportunity for a larger deal? Keystone XL is one of the few G.O.P. priorities in which the philosophical gulf between Obama and congressional Republicans is relatively narrow. In private, Obama has been dismissive of environmentalist claims that building Keystone XL would significantly affect climate change, and his State Department, with some caveats, came to the same conclusion in an environmental-impact statement. In U.S. and Canadian diplomatic circles, officials regularly discuss whether there could be some kind of a deal between the two countries. For example, Canada might make a more ambitious pledge to reduce carbon pollution in return for U.S. approval of the Keystone XL pipeline.","201","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"So why doesn’t Obama have that discussion with Congress instead? What would the G.O.P. be willing to trade to get Keystone approved? A carbon tax? A large infrastructure project? Codifying the E.P.A.’s climate regulations into law? From the White House’s perspective, the Keystone XL pipeline should be an ideal policy to give away in a trade: it’s a major issue that Republicans care a great deal about but one that Obama seems to view as a sideshow. (And if world oil prices remain low, Keystone may be entirely moot because production in the expensive-to-develop Canadian oil sands might not be economically viable.)","202","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"Obama’s final decision on the matter is fast approaching. The last major bureaucratic step is a State Department review of the “national interest” in the project, which had been postponed while a Nebraska court considered a challenge to the route of the pipeline through that state. On Friday, the court ratified that route, clearing the way for the State Department to complete its work. It is possible, and perhaps even more likely than not, that soon after Obama vetoed congressional legislation forcing approval of Keystone XL he would then approve the project on his own. But will he get anything in return? If the Republican Congress and President Obama can’t figure out a way to cut a deal on this issue, don’t expect the next two years to look much different from the last two.","203","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech before Congress was conceived as a political stunt, and it is hard to imagine commentators resisting the question of how the event is playing. We are likely to hear a great deal about how many Democrats show up, how often they applaud, and whether they stand when applauding. But Netanyahu will also be making a case to the American people. He will tell us that an Iranian bomb constitutes an existential threat to Israel, and that the U.S. and its allies should impose even harsher economic sanctions on Iran, presumably to force the “dismantling” of its nuclear infrastructure. He will tell us that, in the negotiations that the U.S. and other leading powers are currently conducting with Iranian leadership, Congress should refuse any deal that, as he puts it, “cements” Iran’s place as a threshold nuclear power. To make this case plausible, there are certain facts that he won’t be able to admit.","March 3, 2015","204","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"Netanyahu will almost certainly begin by acknowledging, and claiming to regret, tensions with the Obama Administration, praising Democrats and stoking an old spirit of bipartisanship. Israel has gotten almost reflexive support—diplomatic cover and military assistance—from both Democrats and Republicans when its security has been at stake. Given the circumstances of Israel’s founding, no Israeli leader can appear to take this support for granted, and no American President would want to appear cavalier about it. (Yesterday, Samantha Power, the American Ambassador to the United Nations, was dispatched to the conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to review the Administration’s record of support and promise a continuation of that support.)","205","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"","206","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"But because both American political parties are so deeply concerned about the security of the state, Netanyahu has a permanent incentive—as does AIPAC, for that matter—to present Israel’s policies as necessary to fend off urgent existential threats. Netanyahu will claim that any Iranian nuclear capacity is proof of genocidal intentions toward Israel—we have heard the same argument about the Palestinian claim to “a right of return”—so why would supporters of Israel accept the reciprocal approach that may emerge from negotiations? This gambit should not work this time. Clearly, Netanyahu is representing one side of a policy debate, with supporters and detractors in both the United States and Israel, where American lives and regional interests are also at stake, and where the Obama Administration has taken a very different position.","207","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"The big threat that Netanyahu will raise is that of Islamist extremism. The Middle East is rife with armed insurgent groups that have proven themselves capable of horrific acts of violence. Sunni groups have been backed by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States allied with the U.S.; Shiite groups have been backed by Iran, and tacitly by Russia, the chief military sponsor of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria. These extremists are united in their hatred for Israel and the West, not necessarily in that order. More immediately, however, they are waging war against each another, more or less along sectarian lines. These rifts may create openings for American diplomacy; it is hard to see, for example, how the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) could ever be defeated without Iran’s coöperation. Netanyahu, unlike Obama, refuses to admit this, presenting these groups as a single military front that the West must beat back.","208","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"For Netanyahu, in other words, Iran should be seen as the most powerful example of this extremism. He speaks, reasonably enough, of Iran’s past sponsorship of terrorist acts, its bloody suppression of the popular uprising that followed the election of 2009, and former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s call to “wipe Israel off the map.” But Netanyahu also wants his audiences to understand a point that his own former chief of staff denies: that Iran’s ruling clerics are fundamentally irrational and share a self-sacrificial mindset with terrorists.","209","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"It is more reasonable to see Iran’s clerics, like the Saudis, as a brutal, pragmatic, authoritarian theocracy with a tenuous hold on power. The regime is likely to go through serious upheavals in the coming years. The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is seventy-six years old. The Guardian Council, which elected him, is filled with both reformers and reactionaries. The powerful and rich Revolutionary Guard could conceivably carry out a coup. A rising generation, which was shaped by the protests and repressions after the elections of 2009, could once again take to the streets. Iran, in other words, is less a terrorist state than a turbulent one, and its continued isolation poses far greater dangers to the international community than a process that draws it closer to the rest of the world—with monitors on the ground, regular diplomatic exchanges, and greater economic integration.","210","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"Most vexing in this context is Netanyahu’s conception of how economic pressures might influence the regime. In his view, stiffening sanctions would put stress on the Iranian middle and educated classes; notionally, these groups would, in turn, force embattled and xenophobic clerics to change their priorities. Yet Netanyahu derides this logic—that economic forces matter—when it is used to envision the moderating influence of a deal. Obama has reason to believe, but cannot say, that relaxing sanctions will bring the middle class into the global economy—exposing élites to foreign travel, and to scientifically trained entrepreneurs and scholars. This opening to the international community might well create new national interests for the regime to protect, and perhaps ultimately transform it.","211","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"The countries currently engaged in negotiations with Iran—not only the U.S. but also China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, even Russia—are a formidable diplomatic bloc, which has reason to deny Iran the capacity to make nuclear weapons, if only to prevent a regional nuclear-arms race. This group has proven its ability to maintain Iran’s economic isolation and force its comparative impoverishment. Netanyahu has been speaking about the negotiations as if they were being conducted by people who, lacking the Jewish people’s sense of dread, engage in wishful thinking—and who are entertaining the relaxation of sanctions before Iran’s nuclear capacity is taken down more or less completely.","212","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"Netanyahu is appalled, he says, that Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are willing to formally approve Iran as a threshold state, with the scientific and infrastructural capacity to assemble a nuclear weapon. In fact, Iran has been a threshold state for some time, and when Netanyahu focusses on this issue he elides the achievement that appears likely to come out of the ongoing negotiations; reportedly, to increase to at least a year the time that Iran would need to assemble a bomb. A year, as President Obama told Reuters last night, would be enough time for the U.S. and its allies to react, first by imposing economic sanctions and finally by taking military action.","213","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"This, for Netanyahu, amounts to appeasement. To be clear, what he really seems to want is war. Netanyahu speaks of “dismantling” Iran’s nuclear infrastructure: demolishing all its nuclear installations and disbanding its scientific groups and programs. He has come to Congress to ask that it increase sanctions until, presumably, Iran accedes to this. But he cannot really think that Iran would completely abandon its nuclear program. Instead, sanctions would not only preëmpt continued negotiations with the great powers, and the humiliation of Iranian reformers, but guarantee a “break-out,” with Iran going for a bomb.","214","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"If this happened, the international community (read, the U.S.) presumably would abandon diplomatic efforts and attack Iran, with the very high risk that this would entrench the regime and create an escalating war with Iran and its proxies in the Persian Gulf. American and perhaps NATO forces would almost certainly be drawn into the conflict. The great powers are entertaining military action as a last resort, and, unlike Israel, they have the military means to intervene at the eleventh hour. Why would they even consider making the last resort the first?","215","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"Ultimately, Netanyahu wants Americans to believe that Iranian leaders are so fanatical in their hatred for Israel that, once armed with a nuclear weapon, they would use it unexpectedly against Tel Aviv. Even if the threat is merely hypothetical—incinerating Tel Aviv would, after all, irradiate the Palestinians for whose sake a bomb would be dropped—no Israeli government can ignore it. That’s why the Israelis have been working for years on a “second-strike capacity,” with the means to retaliate against all Iranian cities. It is an open secret that Israel is in possession of at least a hundred nuclear warheads of its own, and has deployed submarines (acquired from Germany), bombers, and missiles. To believe Netanyahu, you must believe that Iranian leaders are out to secure a nuclear-suicide vest. It is easier to believe that they are trying to secure what Israel has, a hedge against invasion.","216","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"Just before getting on the plane to Washington, Netanyahu went to the Western Wall and prayed before the cameras. He wants to seem, or at least dares others to deny, that he carries the fate of a persecuted Jewry on his shoulders. He imagines that he, unlike other world leaders, has learned from history; John Boehner will present him with a bust of Winston Churchill.

Nominating judges to the federal judiciary was low on the list. The President filled two quick vacancies on the Supreme Court with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. As for the dozens of vacancies on the federal circuit and district courts, Obama’s attention was fleeting. He didn’t even submit nominees to fill many judicial vacancies, including on the D.C.

But the Senate, which is responsible for confirming judges, remained in Democratic hands—and in 2013, Reid took charge of the issue. The Senate had confirmed only five Obama appointees to the federal appeals court in the election year of 2012, but Reid moved to double the pace in 2013. Republicans responded by filibustering almost every judicial appointment to the appeals court and slow-walking appointments to the district court, which had been routine and uncontroversial under earlier Presidents. Reid fought back, and kept pushing the President’s nominees. In time, though, Reid came to a crossroads.","221","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-harry-reid-changed-the-federal-courts"
"Reid had fifty-five Democrats in the Senate—enough for a majority but not enough to beat back Republican filibusters. So, in December, 2013, Reid invoked what became known as the nuclear option. With Reid’s blessing, Senate Democrats changed the rules so that only a majority would be required to move lower-court judgeships to a vote. Freed from the threat of filibusters, Reid pushed through thirteen appeals-court judges in 2013 and 2014, a group of exceptional quality. They included Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard, and Robert Wilkins on the D.C. Circuit. For the first time in decades, that court now has a majority of Democratic appointees. Other confirmations included such luminaries as Pamela Harris (a noted professor and advocate) on the Fourth Circuit, Jill Pryor on the Eleventh, and David Barron (a Harvard law professor and Obama Administration lawyer) on the First. None received more than sixty votes, meaning that they would not have been confirmed had Reid not changed the rules. In future decades, many of these judges will be candidates for promotion if a Democratic President has a Supreme Court vacancy to fill. At the same time, Reid pushed through more than a hundred district-court judges in his last two years as Majority Leader. Of course, almost all of these judges will serve long after Barack Obama and Harry Reid have left office.","222","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-harry-reid-changed-the-federal-courts"

Congress is famous now mostly for its dysfunction, but as Reid has shown the Senate can be made to work.

"On Tuesday night, for once, the policy contents of the speech may well dominate things. Over the weekend, White House aides let it be known that President Obama will propose raising taxes on the very rich, to pay for tax breaks for the middle class. More specifically, he wants to increase the tax rate on capital gains for high earners, from 23.5 per cent to twenty-eight per cent, and he also wants to remove the so-called “step up in basis” loophole, which allows rich families to reduce, often greatly, the amount of taxes they pay on their estates. The money generated by these changes would be used for a variety of purposes, including a modest tax cut for middle-class married couples, an expansion in wage subsidies to low-paid workers, and an expansion of tax credits for students in higher education.","226","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"This is a good plan. Explaining the thinking behind it, Dan Pfeiffer, a senior White House official, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” “It’s the simple proposition that, now that the economy is in a stronger place than it’s been in a very long time, we need to double down on our efforts to deal with wage stagnation and declining economic mobility.”","227","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"Of course, with the Republicans in control of the House and the Senate, the chances of the proposals being enacted anytime soon are practically nil. Speaker John Boehner immediately dismissed them as old-fashioned tax-and-spend liberalism. Since the plan isn’t going anywhere, it’s perhaps tempting to dismiss it as meaningless. But that would be an error. Simply advocating tax cuts for the masses will reshape the politics of the next couple of years, and, particularly, the 2016 Presidential election.","228","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton, assuming she gets the nomination, will come under pressure to match and top the White House proposals. After all, she can hardly run for President while saying that her big idea is to carry out a plan proposed by her predecessor. I would be willing to wager that Clinton, or any other Democratic candidate, will subsume the President’s proposals in a bigger and bolder plan to help the sagging middle class. And there is plenty of room to expand upon Obama’s ideas. In a seventeen-and-a-half-trillion-dollar economy, thirty-two billion dollars a year, on average—which is roughly the sum that tax hikes and a new levy on big banks would raise, according to Obama Administration officials—is a very modest sum. In fact, it’s equivalent to only about a fifth of one per cent of G.D.P. Any Democratic candidate who is flying around the country talking about the need to offset decades of rampant growth in inequality will surely be tempted to increase the stakes.","229","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"

To be sure, there’s very little chance that any of the Republican candidates will embrace the idea of raising tax levies on the rich. Many of those expected to run have signed Grover Norquist’s pledge never to raise taxes under any circumstances; reneging would plunge them into an unholy war with the right. “Raising taxes on people that are successful is not going to make people that are struggling more successful,” Senator Marco Rubio, who also appeared on “Face the Nation,” said. “The good news about free enterprise is that everyone can succeed without punishing anyone.”","230","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"But just because Rubio and his fellow Presidential hopefuls won’t support the first half of Obama’s plan doesn’t mean they can’t embrace the tax-cutting half. To the contrary, it’s easy to imagine middle-class tax cuts emerging as a central issue in the G.O.P. primaries, with the candidates vying to outdo one another. And, unlike Hillary and her economic advisers, the G.O.P. hopefuls are unlikely to be overly concerned with how to pay for the giveaways they propose.","231","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"Such unconcern would represent a bit of a change. Ever since the Great Recession sent the budget deficit soaring to ten per cent of G.D.P., Republicans have struggled to reconcile their old Reaganite religion of supply-side economics with their claims that Obama was bankrupting the country. When Mitt Romney, in 2012, said that he would cut everybody’s taxes by twenty per cent without raising the deficit, but didn’t identify spending cuts, his plan was widely ridiculed. Famously, the Tax Policy Center, a recognized non-partisan authority on such matters, described the proposals as “mathematically impossible”—a judgment from which Romney’s campaign struggled to recover.","232","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"But the economic environment is changing, which means that the political environment is also shifting—and not in the direction that tends to prompt concern for fiscal responsibility. In fiscal 2014, which ended on October 1st, the deficit was just 2.8 per cent of G.D.P. That means that it is nearly back to its average level over the past forty years. With G.D.P. growth buoyant, the deficit is likely to fall further this year. When deficits are low, they begin to recede from the public consciousness, and charges of fiscal recklessness carry less heft.","233","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"Neither party has fully adjusted to this new reality. Obama’s plan is a model of financial rectitude: modest tax cuts and spending programs financed by clearly identified increases in taxes and fees. That’s very laudable. However, recent history suggests that Washington, except in an economic crisis, doesn’t operate in this way. As deficits fall, the temptation to introduce another big tax cut often becomes overwhelming.","234","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"The Democrats may try to resist the temptation. Al Gore did so in 2000. But if Hillary, or another Democratic candidate, is serious about introducing tax and spending programs that would make a serious dent in wage stagnation and inequality, she (or he) will be faced with the choice of introducing bigger tax increases on the rich than Obama is proposing, or forgoing tax hikes and making some optimistic projections about the deficit. With the Republicans ever eager to portray the Democrats as inveterate tax-raisers, the choice will be a tricky one.","235","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"On the Republican side, there could well be a free-for-all. Jeb Bush has, in the past, positioned himself as a deficit hawk, even suggesting that he would be willing to accept modest tax increases in return for big spending cuts. As the primaries approach, will he stick to that position? Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee have both endorsed a flat tax. Rubio, together with Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, recently proposed a two-tier tax system in which most people would pay a rate of just fifteen per cent. Romney, if he does run, will doubtless have another tax-cutting scheme in his pocket. Even Chris Christie, if he enters the race, will need to find a way to avoid being portrayed as a governor who raised taxes.","236","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"

In lieu of a list of predictions, here are twelve geoeconomic and geopolitical lessons that we learned in 2014, and that will shape the new year.

"1. The American economic model is back. Repent, all ye declinists and secular stagnationists: the U.S. economy is growing at an annual rate of more than four per cent, leaving other advanced economies, and also many developing ones, in its wake. Hiring is accelerating, corporate capital spending is rising, and the long-awaited escape velocity required to emerge from recession has been achieved. Although productivity and wage growth have been disappointing, these indicators may pick up in 2015, as the unemployment rate falls toward five per cent.","240","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"
"2. Monetary policy works. If a central bank keeps the cost of lending low enough, for long enough, a depressed capitalist economy will eventually regain its strength—especially if the authorities supplement rock-bottom interest rates with direct injections of money into the financial markets via quantitative easing. Several years ago, this would have been a controversial claim. Even today, some economists dispute it. But the Bernanke-Yellen recovery in the United States, which has already lasted five and a half years, has surely settled the issue.","241","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"
"3. The markets aren’t experiencing a bubble. On March 9, 2009, the Dow closed at 6,547.05. It closed out 2014 at 17,983.07. The market has risen for six years in a row, and there hasn’t been a significant correction (a fall of at least ten per cent) in more than three years. On the Nasdaq, technology I.P.O.s are coming thick and fast following the September début of Alibaba, which was the biggest Internet I.P.O. yet. However, this doesn’t all amount to a bubble. Many of the newcomers generate real profits, and, on the broader market, share prices relative to earnings are much lower than they were in the late nineties.","242","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"
"4. Cheap gasoline is here to stay. Thanks to the shale-oil boom, the days when oil traded at a hundred dollars a barrel are gone for good. OPEC can no longer control the output of its own members, let alone that of other big producers, such as the United States and Brazil. By the time the cartel regains the power to control the world’s oil supply and set prices, technological changes, such as the development of electric cars, may well have fatally undermined its power. The age of OPEC is at an end.","243","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"
"5. The European Union remains a tragedy in the making. Thanks to an outmoded rulebook and a lack of leadership, about all that stands between the nineteen-member currency zone and ruin is Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. But with Greece once again in crisis and the German government seemingly determined to prevent Draghi from following the example of the Federal Reserve and start buying government bonds in large quantities, it’s far from clear that the urbane Italian will be able to save the euro zone. The optimistic scenario is for continued stagnation and another lost half decade; a disorderly breakup remains a serious possibility.","244","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"
"6. Abenomics is a bust. Despite the reëlection last month of Shinzo Abe, the reformist Prime Minister, Japan’s bold experiment in Keynesian economics has failed to halt two decades of economic stagnation. Abe has already fired two of the three arrows in his quiver: a fiscal stimulus and large-scale monetary expansion. The third element of his policy strategy, structural reform of Japan’s moribund economy, remains an aspiration rather than a reality. While Abe’s decision to postpone another increase in the national sales tax may enable G.D.P. growth to pick up a bit—the first increase, last spring, knocked the economy back into recession—hopes of a U.S.-style rebound are fast dissipating.","245","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"
"7. Russia is Saudi Arabia with nukes and snow. The imposition of Western sanctions, which followed Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea, hobbled the Russian economy, which had previously enjoyed a decade of strong growth. But it was the collapse in the oil price that illuminated Moscow’s real weakness. For all his bluster, Putin still presides over an economy that is dangerously dependent on oil and other commodities. Talk of diversifying into manufacturing and services proved to be just that. Now that the commodity boom has turned into a bust, the Russian economy is heading for a deep recession, or, possibly, a depression.","246","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"

In Iraq and Syria, Americans, Iranians, and personnel from many other countries are coöperating in a military campaign that has arrested the advance of the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). This year, at some point, the allies will probably go on the attack, in support of a counter-offensive by the forces of the Iraqi government and the Kurds. In West Africa, meanwhile, a long overdue international effort to tackle the Ebola outbreak is having some success. According to the latest update from the Word Health Organization, incidences of the disease are declining in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Under the leadership of Nigel Farage, a privately educated former commodities trader who portrays himself as a beer-supping everyman, UKIP is taking votes from both major parties. But the Conservative Party, which, with its junior coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats, currently holds power, stands to lose the most from a right-wing populist revolt. And that will allow Ed Miliband, Labour’s low-key and lowly rated leader, to become the head of the largest party in the House of Commons, and to replace David Cameron at 10 Downing Street.","248","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"

In politics, demography may well be destiny, but the Republican Party, which, only a couple of years ago, was being written off as too white, too reactionary, and too old, is defying reports of its imminent demise. Following November’s midterm elections, the Republicans control both houses of Congress, thirty-one governors’ mansions (including those in Maryland and Massachusetts), and sixty-seven of ninety-eight state legislative chambers (a record). And although the G.O.P. still faces a formidable task in winning the Presidency in 2016, when high turnout will favor the Democrats, the Republican candidate Democrats fear most, Jeb Bush, has already all but entered the race.","249","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"

Today, things look very different. According to the latest official figures, about 6.7 million people had signed up for new plans by the middle of October, which is pretty close to the Obama Administration’s target figure. The proportion of Americans who are uninsured has fallen sharply—by close to five percentage points, according to Gallup. Meanwhile, predictions that the Affordable Care Act would destroy jobs and/or bankrupt the federal budget have proved to be off the mark.","250","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"
"12. President Obama is far from a lame duck. After being humiliated in November’s elections, he exploited the power of the Oval Office to introduce his own version of immigration reform, to reach an unexpected climate-change agreement with the Chinese, and to take a big step toward the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba. In his year-end press conference, he promised more of the same in 2015. Doubtless, he will spend a lot of time tussling with the Republicans and vetoing some of their loonier pieces of legislation. But the fact that the Republicans know that he is willing and able to defy them will strengthen his bargaining position and enable him to push through one or two of his own legislative priorities.","251","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"

I have a lot of trouble believing the ones about the stock markets, the price of oil, Abenomics, and the rise of Labour in the U.K. I’m also skeptical about the decline of the euro zone and the strength of the G.O.P.

"Friday’s employment report for January confirmed what has been clear to objective observers since the middle of last year: the American economy is growing strongly, with employers creating jobs at a healthy clip in most major industries. As always, one month’s figures shouldn’t be overemphasized: the payroll number is a volatile data series with a large standard error.

In the past year, job growth has averaged more than two hundred and thirty thousand jobs a month; today there are about 3.2 million more Americans working than there were this time last year.

"Given the lacklustre rates of job growth that we saw in the early stages of recovering from the 2007–09 recession and in the recovery from the dot-com bust of 2000–01, under the Bush Administration, that’s quite an achievement. Employment growth is “astonishingly strong,” Ian Shepherdson, a Wall Street economist, commented.","256","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"So, what does all this mean?","257","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"For Americans looking for work—and with the unemployment rate at 5.7 per cent, there are still nine million of them—it’s obviously a welcome development. It’s also good news for people with jobs. More vacancies means more competition for workers, which should eventually lead to a sustained increase in wages. Indeed, contrary to popular perception, wages are already rising more than prices. Not by much, it is true, but in the year leading up to January, according to the Labor Department, average hourly earnings in outside the farm sector rose by 2.2 per cent. With energy prices falling, the over-all rate of consumer price inflation is just 0.8 per cent.","258","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"For investors, the immediate issue is what the job figures imply for Federal Reserve policy. (The obvious and correct answer is that it makes an early rise in interest rates somewhat more likely.) For economists, there is the tricky task of reconciling the surge in employment with the latest G.D.P. report, which showed the rate of economic growth slowing down a bit during the last three months of 2014. (My guess is that the G.D.P. figures will be revised upward.)","259","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"As for the political implications: What impact will a stronger economy have on the 2016 Presidential election?","260","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"History (and James Carville) teaches us that it is likely to be a big one. If healthy employment growth continues throughout this year—which is a big if, to be sure—the G.O.P. will be robbed of one of the most potent arguments any political party challenging for power can have: that the incumbents have screwed up the economy. Should trends continue, 2016 could end up looking more like 1988, when George H. W. Bush scored a third successive victory for the Republicans, or 2000, when the Democrats, under Al Gore, won the popular vote for the third time in row. And it would look a lot less like 2008, when John McCain, burdened by a recession, failed to pull off a party three-peat.","261","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"To oversimplify things a bit, Bush, Sr., and Gore both promised voters more of the same, but with a different face in the White House. In 2008, with the economy in recession, McCain didn’t have the option of running on his predecessor’s domestic legacy, and he had great difficulty articulating a coherent alternative. Of course, many other factors affected the race, including George W. Bush’s disastrous war in Iraq and McCain’s shortcomings as a candidate, but the comatose economy was a big burden on the Republicans, just as it would be on the Democrats in 2016 if job growth were still lagging.","262","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"A buoyant economy changes the whole environment. If Hillary Clinton (assuming she gets the Democratic nomination) can wholeheartedly embrace President Obama’s domestic record rather than have to equivocate and point out what, if anything, she would have done differently, her task will be much easier. The Democrats aren’t there yet, but things are going in the right direction for them, and the improved economic situation is already having an impact on public opinion.","263","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"During the past few months, there has been a notable uptick in Presidential Obama’s approval rating. The numbers vary from survey to survey, but the Real Clear Politics poll average shows Obama’s rating rising from a low of 41.3 per cent in October to a high of 46.2 per cent on February 2nd. One or two individual polls have seen the President hit fifty per cent. If the economic news stays positive, the upward move will almost certainly continue. “Americans’ ratings of Obama appear to be catching up with their improved economic views,” Gallup’s Lydia Saad noted.","264","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"The economic argument shouldn’t be pushed too far, however. In 1988, Bush, Sr., was facing an uninspiring opponent in Michael Dukakis. In 2000, Gore, for all his success in winning the popular vote, still lost the election (with the assistance of the Supreme Court). Plus, the electoral environment is changing. A new update from Gallup shows that Americans are more polarized than ever where the Presidency is concerned. The gap in Obama’s approval rating among Republicans and Democrats has averaged seventy per cent, higher than George W. Bush’s average of sixty-one per cent, Clinton’s fifty-six, and Reagan’s fifty-two. Come 2016, there may be fewer centrist voters who will cast their ballots on the basis of their own material welfare.","265","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"Pace Carville’s famous dictum, the economy isn’t necessarily everything.

"When Hillary Clinton left the State Department, in 2013, she put her name on the William J. Clinton Foundation. She didn’t have to do it; she had a résumé that required no institutional validation. Now, as she prepares for a possible Presidential campaign, she has to deal with half a dozen new reports on the finances of the Bill, Hillary, & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. In the latest, the foundation acknowledged to the Washington Post that it violated an ethics-review agreement with the State Department by taking half a million dollars from the government of Algeria for Haitian earthquake relief. At the time, Algeria was spending hundred of thousands of dollars to lobby the State Department. The foundation, in its response, said that its donor’s motivation was addressing “critical global challenges.” Algeria just wanted to help Haiti.","February 26, 2015","270","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"The first round of stories, in the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post last week, also had to do with the money that the Clinton Foundation took from foreign governments—more than twenty-five million dollars from the Dutch national lottery, between ten and twenty-five million from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an unspecified amount of that in 2014. A few days later, the Wall Street Journal did some rough connecting of three dots: first, corporate donations to Clinton-linked charities; second, the lobbying disclosures by those donor-corporations; third, Hillary Clinton’s travels and initiatives as Secretary of State. “At least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during her tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation,” it found. While Clinton was “pushing governments to sign deals and change policies to the advantage of corporate giants such as General Electric Co., Exxon Mobil Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Boeing Co.,” all were among the foundation’s donors. ExxonMobil gave about two million dollars to the Clinton Global Initiative, after Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State. It gave more than sixteen million dollars to Vital Voices, a charity she co-founded, which promotes women in leadership around the world.","271","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"The Journal says that it did not find evidence of a quid pro quo, or any illegality. There are only narratives—Clinton “went to bat” for Boeing in Moscow; Russia bought planes; Boeing made a donation. A Boeing spokeswoman told the Journal that advocating for businesses is what the State Department was supposed to do. The Clinton Foundation, in a statement last Thursday, said, “Contributions are made because the Foundation’s programs improve the lives of millions of people around the globe.”","272","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"The foundation does improve lives. But so do a lot of other charities. Why did Algeria or ExxonMobil choose to give this money here? Are the pictures in the annual reports, and at the meetings of the Clinton Global Initiative, more wrenching than in the marketing materials of any other charity, to the point of softening the King of Saudi Arabia’s heart? The Clintons might at least concede the personality-driven nature of the transaction.","273","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"When Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State, the Obama Administration asked the foundation to stop soliciting new donations from foreign governments. It agreed, and then, after she left office, without announcing it, started going out and soliciting from those sources again. Those foreign governments know that Hillary Clinton is almost certainly running for President, as does the rest of the world. In its statement last week, though, the foundation said, “Should Secretary Clinton decide to run for office, we will continue to ensure the Foundation’s policies and practices regarding support from international partners are appropriate, just as we did when she served as Secretary of State”—that is, not yet.","274","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"And the new Washington Post story shows the limits of that “just as we did when she served as Secretary of State.” The Clintons’ ethics agreement allowed existing donors to keep giving, with clearance from the State Department. And so the foundation “accepted millions of dollars from seven foreign governments during Hillary Rodham Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state.” The countries were Algeria, Australia, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Oman, and Qatar. The Post noted that, in the same period, Qatar “spent more than $5.3 million on registered lobbyists.” The foundation, in its response, said that its donors’ motivation was addressing the world’s problems “in a meaningful way.”","275","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"As John Cassidy recently wrote, much of the foundation’s work involves not direct programs (although, along with its affiliates, it does those, too): “Instead, it identifies specific challenges somewhere in the world, solicits commitments from governments and nongovernmental organizations to meet them, finds corporate sponsors willing to finance the projects, and undertakes to help out with expertise, contacts, and encouragement.” This means that a lot of its charitable work consists of making and maintaining connections—Cassidy cites Tom Watson’s suggestion that it operates like an investment bank.* The foundation’s leveraging, though, adds another step that can remove transparency and make it harder for outsiders to get a clear idea of who might be obligated to whom. It also multiplies the amount of money involved. The Journal noted, in its story on the sixty lobbyist-donor companies, “At least 44 of those 60 companies also participated in philanthropic projects valued at $3.2 billion that were set up though a wing of the foundation called the Clinton Global Initiative, which coordinates the projects but receives no cash for them.”","276","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"The Clinton Foundation talks about how it is more transparent, as a charity, than it legally needs to be. But it is not a normal charity, in its resources or its functions. The argument in defense of all this is that, if Bill and Hillary have been clumsy, the only ones who have gained anything are the neediest people in the world. (“If the biggest attack on Hillary’s going to be that she raised too much money for her charity, okay, I’ll take that,” Terry McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia and a longtime Clinton associate, told the Post.) In other words, the Clintons owe their donors nothing—they’ve peddled only their charm and their glamour, not their influence. But the foundation also propagates the Clinton brand (Chelsea is vice-chair), and is a place to keep people close and form more connections, or, perhaps, entanglements. One is left hoping that the Clintons are exceptionally ungrateful to their donors.","277","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"All this seems terribly unnecessary. The foundation does a lot of good, and can do more; so can the Clintons, with all their fine talents and intentions, in and out of office. Why push for the marginal, possibly questionable donation or favor, particularly given the scrutiny of a potential campaign? But then, that has always been the mystery of the Clintons.","278","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"The stories do not feel exhaustive. There will be questions about other ways in which the extensive foreign travels in which Clinton took such pride as Secretary of State may have doubled as donor-development drives for the foundation. Democrats may decide not to worry, figuring that the Republican candidate is bound to have his own compromising financial connections. That’s a somewhat sad surrender. When questions about possible improprieties come up, those around the Clintons tend to say that no two people have ever been as vetted as they have, and that was true—around 1998. Pictures can change, with one day or one deal. As far as the Journal could tell, the 2014 donor numbers have not been completely disclosed, and we are two months into 2015. It’s not just the foundation: more stories will be written about paid speeches and consulting contracts. (Politico had one on Wednesday.) A year ago, a Washington Post accounting showed that Bill Clinton had been paid more than a hundred million dollars for speeches since leaving office.

"Big news from Blighty: With just two and a half weeks until the May 7th election, the Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband, a politician who, not long ago, was being lampooned as “Edweird” and “Red Ed,” is now the favorite to become Britain’s next Prime Minister. At the online-betting sites, which are very popular in the U.K., Miliband is odds-on to replace David Cameron, the leader of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition.","April 20, 2015","282","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"

"No one is expecting Labour to win an over-all majority in the House of Commons, mind you, and Miliband is only slightly favored over Cameron. At least in public, senior Conservatives are still expressing optimism that the prospect of Miliband entering 10 Downing Street will generate a last-minute swing in favor of the government. But a long series of opinion polls have shown the two major parties more or less tied, with about a third of the vote each. If that trend holds up until May 7th, the electoral map will almost certainly insure that Labour emerges as the largest party in parliament. Miliband could then form a coalition with the Scottish National Party or the Liberal Democrats, if the latter agrees to switch allegiances. He might also establish a minority government that looks to put together voting majorities on a bill-by-bill basis.","284","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"To constitutional historians, psephologists, and electoral-reform advocates, the uncertain situation, which reflects a generation-long decline in support for the two major parties, is a source of great excitement. To many ordinary Britons, it looks like a bit of a mess. But whatever happens in the next couple of weeks, one thing is certain: there will be no fundamental retreat from the austerity policies that Cameron and George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have inflicted on the British economy for the past five years. Desperate to shed Labour’s reputation as a party that overspent wildly in the run-up to the Great Recession, Miliband and his sidekick, Ed Balls, Labour’s economics spokesman, are promising to cut the budget deficit every year and to balance the books in the next Parliament, even if it means raising taxes to do so. They are marketing this set of policies as a “budget responsibility lock.”","285","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"Indeed, far from lambasting Cameron and Osborne for starving the British economy of public investment—according to some estimates, it has fallen by almost half since the government took office in 2010—and confining the country to a low-growth trap, Miliband and Balls are accusing the Tories of fiscal profligacy for unveiling a series of last-minute spending boosts, including one for the National Health Service, that they claim are unfunded. “You can’t fund the N.H.S. with an I.O.U.,” Miliband said at a campaign appearance last week. “Every promise we make is paid for. That is the difference between the Conservative Party and the Labour Party.”","286","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"To be sure, the two major parties’ budget plans aren’t identical. The government has promised to eliminate the deficit, which is currently running at about four per cent of G.D.P., by 2017-18, while Labour is giving itself until 2020-21 to meet that target. But, in insisting that his party’s spending plans would be “paid for without a single penny of extra borrowing,” Miliband has effectively conceded that Labour has lost the political argument over using Keynesian policies to boost the U.K.’s economy. Even as some erstwhile skeptics, such as the folks at the International Monetary Fund, have discovered the arguments for employing the public treasury to offset persistent weakness in private-sector investment, the country of the Master’s birth has largely abandoned his teachings.","287","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"I should emphasize that I am talking about the politics of the issue, not the economics. An illuminating article by Tim Harford in the Financial Times over the weekend made it clear that many British economists favor taking advantage of record-low interest rates to borrow money, rebuild Britain’s crumbling infrastructure, and invest in sustainable energy sources. That is a traditional Keynesian position, but one that the public doesn’t appear to support. Focus groups have showed that the promise of eliminating the deficit was one of the most popular elements of Labour’s manifesto, which was released last week. Despite the fact that the deficit has fallen by more than half, relative to G.D.P., since 2010, many Britons still think that their country is going broke, a proposition for which there is virtually no evidence. And many of the same voters still blame the last Labour government, which was led by Gordon Brown, for mismanaging public finances.","288","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"In these dire circumstances, it is easy to see why Miliband and Balls, rather than trying to educate the public about fiscal multipliers, the paradox of thrift, and other staples of Keynesian economics, chose to adopt the political strategy of “if you can beat them, join them.” In seeking to rebrand Labour as the party of fiscal responsibility, they have undercut the main accusation that the Tory press makes against them. “Clearly the Tory charge that Labour and its leader, Ed Miliband, were not to be trusted on spending and borrowing has hit home,” Simon Jenkins, one of Britain’s most astute political commentators, wrote in The Guardian last week. “Labour’s manifesto is an in-your-face rebuttal. Miliband has at least got the point. And no one even dares to breathe the word austerity.”","289","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"But, in signalling its break with Keynes, the Labour Party has not undergone a big shift to the right, and it would also be a mistake to conclude that its progressive tax-and-spend policies have been discredited. To the contrary, in eschewing the free lunches (or cheap lunches) that deficit financing might offer, Miliband and Labour have nonetheless adopted an explicitly redistributive policy agenda. They propose to tax the rich in order to pay for initiatives like expanding day care, reducing university-tuition fees, and hiring tens of thousands more doctors and nurses for the N.H.S. While Keynes was being unceremoniously booted out the front door of Labour’s headquarters, Thomas Piketty was being ushered in through the side entrance.","290","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"In its manifesto, Labour promised to raise the top income-tax rate from forty-five per cent to fifty per cent. (The income threshold for being subjected to this tax would be about two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars a year.) Labour also pledged to introduce a “mansion tax” on houses valued at more than three million dollars, of which there are many in London, in particular. And the Party promised to crack down on wealthy people who live in the United Kingdom but claim official residence elsewhere, to avoid paying their full share of British taxes—the so-called non-doms, as in non-domiciled.","291","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"Opinion polls suggest that the idea of cracking down on rich tax avoiders, who include some of Britain’s top business leaders, is particularly popular. It was after Miliband announced the new policy, a couple of weeks ago, that Labour first moved ahead in the polls. But the other two tax proposals, and the way that Labour is selling them, are equally important. Rather than just announcing the new taxes in isolation, the Party is saying explicitly what the monies they raise would be used for.","292","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"In pledging to restore the top tax rate to fifty per cent—the current government had lowered it—Labour said that it would use the proceeds to cut the tax rate paid by low earners to ten per cent. According to a poll carried out by YouGov last week, fifty-nine per cent of the public supports this policy and twenty-seven per cent opposes it. In announcing that it would introduce a new tax on luxury homes, Labour said that it would pay for new nurses and doctors in the N.H.S. Sixty-one per cent of voters said they liked this proposal; twenty-seven per cent said they didn’t. It’s worth pointing out that some of the Conservative Party’s policy proposals also proved popular in the poll, particularly its ideas to relieve people who earn minimum wage of having to pay income tax, and to place a limit on the total value of welfare benefits that a household can receive in a year. But, YouGov concluded, over all, “British people give better marks to Labour’s policy offerings.”","293","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"There may be a message here for other countries, the United States included. Although British voters are suspicious of deficit financing and welfare spending, they seem to welcome the prospect of redistributive policies that target the rich and benefit those on modest incomes in identifiable ways that are spelled out in advance. As I argued over the weekend, something similar might well be true in this country.","294","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"Israel’s last pre-election poll shows that Isaac Herzog, the head of the Zionist Union—a center-left coalition of the Labor Party and former Minister of Justice Tzipi Livni’s Hatnuah—is likely to win twenty-four seats or more, opening a four seat lead over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party. Neither is remotely close to winning the sixty-one seats needed to form a government after Tuesday’s election—leading parties build coalitions with smaller parties—but the Zionist Union’s surge has inspired excitement among liberals that is harder than usual to restrain. Although about ten per cent of voters are still undecided, Herzog seems to be trending up, with Netanyahu trending down. President Reuven Rivlin is required by law to award the mandate—the right to attempt to cobble together a government—to the leader who is most likely to succeed. Unless the ten or more parties that are expected to win seats declare a preference for Prime Minister in advance, and Netanyahu emerges as most likely to make a majority, Herzog’s projected plurality should be enough to compel Rivlin to award the mandate to him.","March 16, 2015","295","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israels-new-political-center"

"Netanyahu could still emerge triumphant; Israeli polling is not as reliable as one might hope. Even if the polls are accurate, Herzog will need support from some uncertain sources—most importantly, from Moshe Kahlon, the leader of the Kulanu party, who came from Likud. Yet Herzog’s likely strong showing, and the new coalition he represents, portends some long-term shifts in the political map. Netanyahu has polarized the country, much as the former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir did in the early nineteen-nineties. Netanyahu has declared Likud the anchor of the Israeli right, repudiated the feasibility of a two-state solution, brazenly defied the White House (Likud robocalls refer to “Hussein Obama”), and rallied mainstream conservative voters to identify with ultra-nationalist settlers and ultra-Orthodox communities. Netanyahu assumed, when he called for this early election, back in December, that, like Shamir, he could rely on Likud’s traditional base. Manifestly, he cannot. Instead, Netanyahu and Herzog are enacting an enormously significant battle between two political camps: the parties of Greater Israel and the parties of Global Israel—and the latter has the social momentum. Even if this election does not produce an immediate change at the top, it will almost certainly be pivotal.","297","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israels-new-political-center"
"Since 1977, when Menachem Begin’s Likud first won power from the Labor Zionist parties that founded the state, Israel has had twelve national elections. Likud has won eight times, and Labor just twice. In 1984, even after former Prime Minister Begin’s failed war with Lebanon and Defense Minister Ariel Sharon’s forced resignation, and with inflation at four hundred per cent, Likud still pulled out a tie. In all, Labor leaders have commanded Knesset majorities for just about six years out of thirty-eight. Meanwhile, Likud seemed to have assembled a near-permanent conservative majority. After Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination by a far-right law student, in 1995, liberals felt that they were witnessing an unfolding tragedy, in which time and rage were working against them. They struggled to compete with Likud’s self-reinforcing ideology: occupation produced violence, and violence strengthened Jewish xenophobia, which resonated with Likud’s hawkish rhetoric. Likud’s neo-Zionist orthodoxies gave rise to a rapidly expanding West Bank settler population, whose towns many began taking for granted. Likud also benefitted from inescapable identity politics, which ran in families, and largely reflected resentments against the once dominant Labor Zionist parties for the centralized way that they ran the state in the fifties and sixties. If (as I’ve written elsewhere) Israel were to be divided into five roughly equal demographic voting groups—pioneering Zionists from Europe, Arabs who became Israeli citizens, Jewish refugees from Muslim countries, national-Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox theocrats, and immigrants from the former Soviet Union—Likud has appeared to have a lock on the last three.","298","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israels-new-political-center"
"This election suggests that globalist liberals are now at least in contention. One important change has been the full emergence of the Israeli political center, once considered a passing political force, but now clearly the product of younger, more cosmopolitan voters who have come into their own—connecting with peers abroad through entrepreneurial ventures, cultural and scientific networks, and travel—and who have not remained altogether loyal to the party identities of their parents. These centrists tend to consider themselves socially progressive: distancing themselves from settlers and theocrats. They are economically liberal: positive about global markets but wary of both capitalist oligarchs and socialist tinkering. And they are diplomatically skeptical: open to the peace process, but indignant about terrorism and the criticism of the Israel Defense Forces by the world press. Yair Lapid, the former minister of finance, leads Yesh Atid, the first centrist party to draw large numbers of young voters; he will almost certainly support Herzog over Netanyahu. Moshe Kahlon, the former minister of communications under Netanyahu, who is largely credited with opening the cell-phone market to new competitors, reportedly resents Netanyahu for reneging on a pledge to make him the head of the Israel Land Authority, and he refuses to rule out joining Herzog. Together, Lapid and Kahlon are likely to win at least twenty seats, nearly as many as the two major parties. They are drawing votes especially from young people in Russian and Mizrahi families—votes the Likud was counting on.","299","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israels-new-political-center"
"The most striking proof of the rise of the center, however, is Labor’s efforts to transform itself into a centrist party. Herzog electrified the campaign by making common cause with Livni; he has promised to hand over the Prime Minister position to her two years into his term.* Herzog and Livni both have backgrounds in military intelligence, but are not decorated warriors like Rabin or other past Labor leaders. They boast instead about their teamwork—about coöperation that has larger implications for politics and diplomacy—and the gender equality among their Knesset candidates. Together they have focussed on Israel’s economic inequality and have presented a plan to mitigate the crushing cost of housing for young couples. Neither has suggested negotiating a two-state solution without the support of the U.S., Europe, and some members of the Arab League. Nor have they talked about taking on Hamas, Iran, and Hezbollah alone. They speak of rebuilding Gaza, not just deterring rocket fire. They raise the prospect of a regional alliance with the Palestinian Authority, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, based on the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002, which they are counting on the Obama Administration to consolidate. Herzog and Livni have solicited former intelligence and military figures to warn of the dangers of alienating American Democrats and the European Union. They are trying to bring off in Labor something like what President Bill Clinton and the Democratic Leadership Council achieved in the United States in the nineties: transforming the party from welfare advocacy and anti-war activism to private entrepreneurship and foreign-policy realism.","300","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israels-new-political-center"
"Signalling another change in the electoral map, the Arab parties have strengthened Herzog’s position. They’ve combined into the blandly named Joint List, led by Ayman Odeh, a forty-year-old lawyer who seems comfortable identifying himself as an Israeli and is less involved in Palestine Liberation Organization diplomacy than his predecessors. Odeh’s coalition includes former communists, Islamists, and bi-nationalists, but it has converged on a single democratic platform and includes Jews on its roster, including the former Knesset speaker and Labor party leader Avraham Burg. I spoke with the Joint List chairman, Jamal Zahalka, a week ago. He told me that, in early February, a senior member of his list had reached out to Meretz, a party to the left of Labor, to try to arrange a vote-sharing agreement. At the time, Meretz refused. Later, when Meretz, prodded by Herzog, tried to revive the deal in early March, Zahalka refused, causing many observers to conclude that the Joint List was continuing a policy of non-coöperation with parties that have their roots in historic Zionism. Zahalka adamantly denied this when we spoke. “Meretz supported the Gaza bombing during the first week,” he said, referring to last summer’s confrontation between Israel and Hamas. “So I concluded—and I had to decide quickly—that we’d lose thousands of votes.” Still, he anticipates coöperating with Herzog, Livni, and Meretz on the fight for civil equality. Would he agree in the coming years to merging with existing parties? “If we could agree on a political platform, I would also support a joint list with Meretz,” he said.","301","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israels-new-political-center"
"The growing influence of the Joint List is encouraging in the long term, but it will not make it easier for Kahlon, a former Likud member from a Mizrahi family, to join with Herzog in the days ahead. Kahlon would be choosing a coalition that rests on the support of Arab members over settlers and the Orthodox. He would be choosing, in effect, an Israel that is a Hebrew-speaking state of all its citizens, rather than the Jewish state that Likud has stridently proposed with its Jewish Nation law. Netanyahu knows this, and speaking on the radio on Sunday morning, he taunted the center parties for entertaining a government with “the Arabs,” sounding more like George Wallace than Winston Churchill. This past Sunday, he publicly offered Kahlon the position of finance minister should he lead the next government. Herzog is counting on Kahlon to overcome these threats and seductions. Talk around the candidate suggests that he might. The veteran journalist Raviv Drucker told me that, behind closed doors, Kahlon is making it clear that his preference is for Herzog. Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told me that Kahlon wants to see Netanyahu out of office, which Kahlon’s close advisor, former Israel Defense Forces general Yoav Galant, has all but admitted publicly. Kahlon has also recruited Michael Oren, the former Israeli Ambassador to the United States, who rebuked Netanyahu for his speech to Congress two weeks before the election. Oren implied in a recent meeting that he believes the settlement project to be a disaster and would like to see it ended; he fears for Israel’s relations with the U.S. and Europe.","302","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israels-new-political-center"
"Still, there is no way around this: if Kahlon chooses Herzog, supported by the Joint list, over Netanyahu, his decision will be as historic for the country—and personally difficult—as Rabin’s recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in 1993. Again: Kahlon, of all people, would be signalling that, under the new government, the Arab minority should be considered integral to Israeli democratic governance, and that Arabs—twenty per cent of the Israeli population—should accept their Israeli identity in return. Kahlon would much rather avoid this. He’d prefer a national-unity government, made up of both Labor and Likud, with his party in the middle. But this seems unlikely given the acrimony between the Labor and Likud. Kahlon would also settle for the ultra-Orthodox parties abandoning Likud, and winning enough votes from it, making Herzog and Livni’s reliance on “the Arabs” unnecessary. Current polls, however, suggest that this is unlikely.","303","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israels-new-political-center"
"Nothing illustrates Kahlon’s choice as starkly as the personalities of Naftali Bennett, the head of the Jewish Home Party, and Erel Margalit, one of the economic leaders of Herzog’s Labor Party. Bennett is running a campaign bordering on fascist incitement: he says that the whole of the country’s land belongs to the Jews and mocks liberals for supposedly apologizing to the Western world. If the world wants to isolate Israel, he argues, let them do without Israeli inventions like drip irrigation and flash memory. For Margalit, who earned a doctoral degree in philosophy at Columbia and founded the highly successful venture-capital firm Jerusalem Venture Partners, Bennett is a dangerous simplifier. “He thinks we should be a fort, but Israel must be a hub,” Margalit told me. “Water, bandwidth, trade, agriculture trade, tourism, technology—people don’t really care where the borders are. There’s a whole region incubating a new middle class. Could Israelis and Palestinians be a part of this? Yes! The Oslo model has caused democratic forces in Israel to play defense. We need to play offense, offer a new language—which is regional coöperation.”","304","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israels-new-political-center"
"Whoever puts together the governing coalition, Herzog or Netanyahu, will not have an easy time of it. Netanyahu, should he try holding to the status quo, will not be able to ignore the growing reproach of the Obama Administration and international community, or the shunning of Israel by European universities and companies. Herzog, should he advance the peace process, will have to contend with the streets of Jerusalem—its fanatic Orthodox extremists, infuriated Arab residents, and the roads radiating out to expanding West Bank settlements. Still, much is at stake tomorrow. Mohammad Mustafa, the vice-premier of the Palestinian Authority, told me last month that the gross domestic product per capita in the Palestinian territories was a third greater than Egypt’s in 2006; now it is a third less. Teachers and police officers are being paid partial salaries. Others in Ramallah fear that coöperation with Israel may lead to an explosion against Palestinian security forces. Jordan’s King Abdullah insists that no regional coalition with Israel is conceivable without a solution to the Palestine question. Under Netanyahu, the settlements, and the sentiments behind them, get more time.","305","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israels-new-political-center"
"Yet, the settlers are no longer the only ones who benefit from time, and who create facts. A new generation of moderates—building business and technology centers—is rising alongside them. For two generations, since 1967, Israelis with ordinary democratic impulses thought that their task was to restore a lost, more beautiful little Israel, separate from their Arab neighbors. Now they are claiming a more global, more integrated future—one that the Zionist pioneers could never have envisioned. Liberals fought election after election, saw how they were outnumbered, and, like Sisyphus, went back down to the rock, resigned to pushing as an end in itself—“the price paid for the passions of this earth,” as Camus wrote. But the terrain has changed, and Herzog and his hopeful supporters want to believe that the push might be different this time. This year, Kahlon must decide.","306","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israels-new-political-center"

"On one level, Paul’s prediction may prove correct. Many viewers of Hannity and other Fox programs will probably seize on the new book in order to confirm their view that Hillary Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency. But none of these people were going to vote for her anyway. Politically, the important question is what impact, if any, the book’s allegations will have on independent voters, who may or may not vote for Clinton, and also on liberal Democrats who are inclined to vote for her, and maybe even to campaign for her, but who still have some reservations.","312","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"On this front, my guess is that “Clinton Cash” (whose full title is “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich”) could end up benefitting Hillary. With Hannity and other conservative media figures piling on, the Clinton campaign will be able to portray questions about the Clinton Foundation and the family’s finances as a political witch-hunt rather than a legitimate exercise in vetting Presidential candidates. And if that happens, many Americans may end up dismissing the whole thing as a partisan squabble.","313","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"Obviously, this is speculation. Not having read the book, which comes out on May 5th, I am relying on accounts from journalists who have. But if their versions of what the book contains are accurate, then Schweizer doesn’t back up his suggestions of wrongdoing with much in the way concrete evidence, which would allow the Clintons’ defenders to go on the offensive. Indeed, this is already happening. On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Tuesday, David Brock, the founder of Media Matters, the liberal-leaning media watchdog, who recently appears to have morphed into a Clinton campaign spokesman, said, “I think this is a political put-up job, and I can smell it from a mile away.”","314","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"Schweizer is a former fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of several conservative policy tomes as well as books about the Bush family and the Reagan Administration. According to the biography on his Web site, he served as a speechwriting consultant to the Bush Administration from 2008 to 2009. He is now the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative research organization based in Florida that, during the 2012 campaign, issued a report accusing the Obama Administration of illegally soliciting foreign donations. On the other side of the ledger, he has written two books about money and politics that criticized politicians from both parties, including Dennis Hastert, the former Republican Speaker of the House. One of them, published in 2011, was titled “Throw Them All Out.”","315","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"But most of Schweizer’s writing appears to have been directed at Democrats, and he is clearly a man of the right. In 2011, the Times reported that he was advising Sarah Palin on foreign policy. Brock, during his appearance on MSNBC, claimed that the Government Accountability Institute has received funding from entities affiliated with the Koch brothers, adding, “It’s subsidized by Hillary Clinton’s enemies.” On Tuesday night, according to Politico’s Gabriel Debenedetti, Brian Fallon, Clinton’s press secretary, circulated a memo to the campaign’s surrogates and allies, echoing Brock’s charges. “The book was backed by a Koch Brothers–linked organization and a billionaire family that is bankrolling Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign,” Fallon wrote.","316","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"It will be one thing if Schweizer has the goods on the Clintons—i.e., detailed evidence supporting his claim that policy decisions were influenced by financial donations and speaking fees. But, despite Rand Paul’s claims, it doesn’t sound as though the book will supply that level of detail. Reportedly, Schweizer relies heavily on timelines, linking the dates of donations to the Clinton Foundation and speaking fees paid to Bill Clinton with actions by the State Department while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. The Times’s Amy Chozick, for example, writes that Schweizer cites a free-trade agreement with Colombia that benefitted a major donor to the Clinton Foundation, and payments to Bill Clinton by a Canadian bank and a big shareholder in the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which the State Department was studying at the time.","317","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"The timelines are suggestive, but are they anything more than that? Many interested parties and institutions were weighing in on issues like trade deals and the Keystone pipeline, and former Obama Administration officials have already dismissed any suggestion that the Colombia agreement was altered to reward a Clinton Foundation donor. In a blog post published on Tuesday, another person who got hold of Schweizer’s book, Aviva Shen, a senior editor at Think Progress—which is published by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank with ties to the Clintons—writes, “Schweizer makes clear that he does not intend to present a smoking gun, despite the media speculation. . . . Schweizer explains he cannot prove the allegations, leaving that up to investigative journalists and possibly law enforcement.” Shen also quotes Schweizer on the Clintons: “We cannot ultimately know what goes on in their minds and ultimately provide the links between the money they took and the benefits that subsequently accrued to themselves, their friends, and their associates.”","318","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"Of course, given the wealth that the Clintons have accumulated since Bill Clinton left office, it is perfectly legitimate, and, indeed, imperative, for journalists to examine their finances and try to identify possible conflicts of interest. News outlets such as the Post, the Times, and the Wall Street Journal have been delving into these issues for months, generating lots of stories and quite a bit of critical commentary. (Back in February, I published a long post on Hillary Clinton’s money issues. My colleague Amy Davidson has also been following the story closely.)","319","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"In this context, it is neither surprising nor scandalous that several news organizations, including the Times and the Post, have reportedly made deals with HarperCollins, Schweizer’s publisher, to view the book in advance of its publication date. “We are always willing to look at new information that could inform our coverage,” Cameron Barr, the Post’s national editor, said in a statement reported by Politico’s Dylan Byers. “Mr. Schweizer’s background and his point of view are relevant factors, but not disqualifying ones. What interests us more are his facts and whether they can be the basis for further reporting by our own staff that would be compelling to our readers. There is no financial aspect to this arrangement.”","320","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"To repeat, there is nothing untoward about this. The job of news organizations is to ferret out newsworthy stories, check their veracity, and publish them. In this instance, they were on the case well before Schweizer’s book landed.","321","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"From here on out, however, things could get tricky for journalists covering the Clinton donations. Every word they write will be doubly scrutinized for evidence of political bias, and Hillary Clinton’s campaign operatives will be on hand to dismiss as part of a G.O.P.-inspired vendetta anything that is critical of the candidate. Until this week, it was easy to label such tactics as political spin, and few fair-minded people questioned the credibility of the Clinton money stories or the motivations of those writing and publishing them. Now that Schweizer has entered the fray, with the likes of Hannity and Paul to ballyhoo what appear to be largely unsubstantiated allegations, partisan politics is likely to color the views of the broader public. If and when Hillary Clinton falls back on the old argument that it’s all a right-wing conspiracy against her and her family, many people might well be prepared to take her at her word.","322","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"

Today, the story of a young person from Middle America moving to the left while at an élite college is familiar, and back then it was probably even more nearly universal.

"After Lyndon Johnson obliterated Barry Goldwater in the 1964 Presidential election, lots of people assumed that American conservatism was dead—including, who knows, maybe a seventeen-year-old Hillary herself. Then came the 1966 midterm elections, when, riding the “white backlash” against events like the 1965 Watts riots, in Los Angeles, the Republicans made big gains in Congress. In 1968, they took back the White House, in an election that looked closer than it was because a conservative third-party candidate, George Wallace, had siphoned off 13.5 per cent of the vote from Richard Nixon. By the time that Hillary made her celebrated Wellesley commencement speech, endorsing the student protests of the age in a measured, campus-leader tone, she had to have registered that the country was moving in the opposite direction.","332","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"

"Hillary Clinton is the least instinctive of politicians; you can almost see her thinking her way through a situation. The master situation for her, from the time of her political awakening through her early sixties, when she first ran for President, was the difficulty of winning in American politics as a liberal. This may help explain her much-disputed decision to bring in Mark Penn, who made his early reputation by figuring out how to achieve Democratic victories in a Republican era, as her chief strategist in the 2008 campaign. Clinton was obviously not looking for a strategist who could help her connect with voters on the left. If you were writing fiction, it would be too heavily ironic to deal her the fate of being defeated by someone who felt less constrained about owning up to a youthful admiration for Alinsky.","334","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"In the early phases of the 2016 campaign, there is no form of high-end political expertise that Clinton doesn’t have at her disposal—including much of the leadership of the campaign staff that defeated her in 2008. One can only imagine the polls, the focus groups, and the staff retreats that underlay her runic two-minute announcement video—a high-gloss little movie that was devoted to “everyday Americans,” included a bit of rhetoric about the deck being stacked against them, and hardly showed the candidate herself. The clear message was that Clinton has gone from decades of being spooked by the right to, now, being spooked by the left. The video had none of the old, formerly magical symbolic touchpoints of baby-boom liberal politicians who wanted to win: there was no mention of tax cuts, crime-fighting, militarism, or religion, and there were hardly any white males. The only arguably centrist notes struck were a couple of glowing mentions of small business and a very veiled possible reference to charter schools.","335","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"The United States is a big country with a miraculously durable two-party system, which means that each party has to be an unnatural coalition of disparate elements. The Republicans won their big battle of the late twentieth century, which took up most of Hillary Clinton’s adult life, to persuade social conservatives to leave the Democratic Party. But in the process they drove many who were more socially liberal away. And, because the political system is in constant flux, even as the Democratic and Republican parties have become more efficiently liberal and conservative, generating the hyper-partisanship that everyone claims to despise, each has begun to show a new set of internal strains. The Republicans have to try to unite affluent economic conservatives with financially struggling evangelicals. The Democratic Party that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama made, and that Hillary Clinton now inherits, encompasses minorities, labor unions, and single women, plus significant portions of Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and the broad professional upper-middle class in big metropolitan areas, especially on the coasts. (The historic home of the Bush family, Greenwich, Connecticut, is now represented in Congress by a Democrat.) The Democrats’ diversity enables them to achieve rough financial parity with the Republicans, but it has to be tricky to manage.","336","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"The announcement video indicates that the Clinton campaign believes that in this cycle, the core appeal to Democratic and potentially Democratic voters has to be based on economics. Voters want to hear that the generation-long stall-out of the American working and middle classes’ fortunes is somehow going to end. The problem is that, right now, the Democratic coalition seems to be in agreement on the formerly radioactive social issues—ethnicity, sexuality, values—but not on the economic issues that will define the election. In the video you can detect the hope that it will be possible to declare that the campaign is all about economics, and then to spend it talking mainly about other things. Does Hillary Clinton want to raise taxes on the rich? More heavily regulate financial institutions? Make unions more politically powerful? Throw some sand in the gears of globalization by restricting free trade? These are the kinds of questions that have historically gone along with an overriding concern with the welfare of “everyday Americans,” but they are not pleasant ones for the campaign, because in each case, a clear answer would alienate an element of the Democratic Party.","337","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"Don’t think of this problem as being only about Clinton’s keeping the Elizabeth Warren wing of her party on board through the nomination. Last week, John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio, who’s thinking of jumping into the Presidential race, made a point of going on national television and complaining at some length about “greed” on Wall Street. That indicates that he thinks there may be a way to run against both Clinton and Jeb Bush on what might be called Main Street economics, from within the Republican Party. Exactly what to say about the tough economic situation faced by most Americans could be as tricky for Clinton in the general election as it will be in the primary season. Her policy team is no doubt as well stocked as her message team, and it may have the tougher job.","338","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"The last hope for bringing some rationality to the 2016 Presidential field died Tuesday night when Jon Stewart announced that he would be leaving “The Daily Show.” He didn’t say when—he muttered the names of a few late-2015 months, and something about working out details—but it sounds like it will be before the earliest primary. This is the first good argument that I’ve heard for making the New Hampshire and Iowa contests even earlier. Someone needs to sort out who is clumsy and who is absurd, who is semi-serious and who is wholly alarming; the Republican base isn’t going to do that on its own. And one of those characters—as Stewart might put it, the guy from Jersey, the Dr. Seuss fetishist, the Aqua Buddha ophthalmologist, the little brother of the other guy—has to get the nomination. Stewart, in his Tuesday night announcement, said, “This show doesn’t deserve an even slightly restless host, and neither do you.” What about the poor G.O.P.?

Many will be petty, and some, for Democrats, may be painful. Bill Clinton will also be out on the campaign trail. Picture that, even before you picture him back in the White House, but without a proper job. Even last time, with an abbreviated campaign, he said things that got his wife in trouble. He might also do things that have profound comedic and political implications (he has before).

He made Elizabeth Warren, whom he had on as a guest many times when she was still a Harvard professor, seem most serious not by being grim himself but by making clear to the audience that the reason he so enjoyed her company was that it was awfully fun listening to someone so smart.

"Early today, my editor e-mailed to ask if I’d write about Mitt Romney’s upcoming announcement. The e-mail contained a link to a story from Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin, which said that Romney was planning to hold an 11 A.M. conference call with some financial donors, to “update” them on his thoughts about running for President a third time.","350","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Halperin wisely avoided reaching a definitive conclusion on whether Romney was going to confirm his entry to the 2016 contest. He did suggest, however, that this was the likeliest reason for the conference call: “Based on all the conversations I have had with Romney World this week, I would bet that Mitt and Ann Romney’s proposition, that if he runs he will become the Republican nominee, is about to be tested.”","351","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"","352","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"By the time I’d had breakfast and subjected my Twitter followers to a few thoughts about the new G.D.P. figures, the online mulching machine had converted Halperin’s qualified wager into a general consensus that Romney was all in. The Daily Beast, evidently convinced that it had the inside track, published a story headlined “Romney Will Run For President,” which it tweeted out with an “EXCLUSIVE” label.","353","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"The Daily Beast story was picked up everywhere, and as eleven o’clock approached, the tension was palpable. (O.K., I made up that last bit.) What, exactly, would Romney say? On January 9th, he had said—to another group of donors, of course—“I want to be President.” A few days after that appearance, the Washington Post reported that he was “almost certain” to enter the race. Just this past Wednesday, talking at Mississippi State University, he took a jab at Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, noting, “How can Secretary Clinton provide opportunity for all if she doesn’t know where the jobs come from in the first place?”","354","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Reading all of this, it would be just about possible to imagine, if you tried hard enough—or if you were a Republican political operative looking for another well-paid gig—that the idea of Romney entering the G.O.P. race and winning the nomination for a second time was a realistic proposition rather than a fantasy.","355","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"To take this position, you would have had to convince yourself that New Romney would be able to live down his “forty-seven per cent” comment and the fourteen-per-cent tax rate he paid in 2011; that Jeb Bush hadn’t already occupied the role of wise establishment elder; and that it was of no consequence that many influential people connected with the Republican Party regard Romney as an out-of-touch loser, whose presence on the ticket would guarantee the Democrats another victory in 2016. (Rupert Murdoch, in describing Romney a few weeks ago as “a terrible candidate,” was only voicing publicly what many other Republicans were saying privately. Just this week, David Kochel, one of Romney’s key operatives in 2012, joined Bush’s political-action committee.)","356","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Romney, during his long and successful business career, wasn’t known for flights of fancy. These days, though, he’s a semi-retired but still ambitious politician. Perhaps he had convinced himself to give us wretches in the press corps what we so badly wanted: a Mitt–Jeb showdown.","357","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Alas, it was not to be. About ten minutes before eleven, Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio presenter, posted on his Web site the very remarks that Romney was about to deliver. They began with a few sentences of thanks for the people around the country who had encouraged him to run. Then came the lede: “After putting considerable thought into making another run for president, I’ve decided it is best to give other leaders in the Party the opportunity to become our next nominee.”","358","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"So that was that, then? Not quite. In fact, Romney’s statement went on for another eight paragraphs. After citing a poll showing him leading the other putative G.O.P. contenders by nearly two to one, the statement said, “So I am convinced that we could win the nomination.” It went on, “I also believe . . . I would have the best chance of beating the eventual Democrat nominee.”","359","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Why, then, wasn’t he running? Because it was time to make way for the young—or for the younger, anyway: “I believe that one of our next generation of Republican leaders, one who may not be as well known as I am today, one who has not yet taken their message across the country, one who is just getting started, may well emerge as being better able to defeat the Democrat nominee. In fact, I expect and hope that to be the case.”","360","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"If you interpret that paragraph as a parting shot at Jeb, who is already in his sixties, you weren’t the only one. With several minutes still left until Romney was due to speak, the Twitter hordes, myself included, were already busy parsing the text and handicapping the remaining G.O.P. field, which, despite the sad departure of the Mittster, appears to be growing by the day. Mostly, though, we were trying to make jokes at Romney’s expense.","361","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Eric Boehlert, of Media Matters, tweeted, “Team Mitt: the US is dangerously off course. US under attack around the globe and US economy cratering…but Mitt doesn’t feel like running.” The political analyst Jeff Greenfield offered, “So Romney’s not running; this really opens the door for George Pataki….” And, from John Podhoretz, of the New York Post: “Mitt Romney could also have won the Super Bowl but he decided to let other, younger people deflate the balls.”","362","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"In fact, Romney made the only sensible decision, for both himself and his party.","363","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"On a personal level, Romney’s chance of becoming President came and went in 2012; running again would merely have subjected him to more torment. From the Republican Party’s perspective, the 2016 race is already shaping up to be another extended exercise in the art of drilling a circular firing squad. Adding a Romney-versus-Bush element to the emerging narrative would have benefited only the media and the Democrats. On Thursday, we learned, via a leak to Politico’s Mike Allen, that Hillary Clinton is considering waiting until July to announce her candidacy. That’s smart. With little serious opposition on the Democratic side, why not sit back for a while, and join the peanut gallery watching the Republicans go at each other?","364","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"

"Whatever happened to Marco Rubio? In February, 2013, his picture appeared on the cover of Time magazine, accompanied by the headline “The Republican Savior.” At the time, many political analysts—Bill Clinton reportedly among them—viewed the Florida senator as a big threat to the Democrats in 2016. Now, following his announcement on Monday in Miami, he’s officially in the race for the Republican nomination, but as a rank outsider. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, just 7.5 per cent of likely Republican voters consider him their first-choice candidate. That puts him in seventh place, behind Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ben Carson, and Mike Huckabee.","April 14, 2015","366","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"Of course, it’s early in the process. Having gone all in, Rubio might get a boost, just as Cruz, the junior senator from Texas, has since he announced his candidacy last month. Right now, though, it’s hard to see how he could challenge the front-runners. Although Rubio was elected to the Senate in 2010 as part of the Tea Party wave, and although he still espouses extreme views on issues like climate change (he’s a skeptic) and same-sex marriage (he opposes it), many people in the conservative movement don’t view him as a true believer. In any case, the right-wing end of the Republican field is very crowded. Rubio’s best hope is probably to position himself as a center-right candidate and hope for a slipup on the part of Jeb Bush, his fellow Floridian.","367","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"

"The proximate cause of Rubio’s current problems is well known: his role in co-sponsoring a bipartisan immigration-reform bill that would have established a lengthy pathway to citizenship for law-abiding undocumented immigrants. With the support of Rubio and thirteen other Republicans, the Senate passed the bill in June, 2013. After the bill generated a backlash among conservative and anti-immigration groups and died in the House of Representatives, Rubio backtracked, disavowing the legislation and saying that it wasn’t realistic. But the damage to his reputation on the right had been done. And so, as the race to 2016 began to shape up, Rubio found himself outflanked by other conservative hopefuls, such as Cruz and Walker.","369","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"In the past year or so, Rubio has been trying to regain the trust of his party’s hard-liners, saying that nobody has an automatic right to immigrate to the United States and stressing that improving border security should be the first priority. He’s had some success in this enterprise. “I think that Sen. Rubio has done something that most politicians don’t do,” Jenny Beth Martin, the president and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots group, told Politico. “He evaluated what went wrong … [and] is working to make sure he doesn’t make the same mistakes again. I think that neutralizes his mistakes.”","370","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"But what use is a Marco Rubio who panders to the right on his defining issue? The Republican Party is chockablock with supine politicians of this sort, and that helps to explain why it has lost the popular vote in five of the last six Presidential elections. The thing that made Rubio an exciting figure a few years ago, the reason he landed on the front of Time magazine, was that he seemed to combine youth, a compelling personal story, and conservative views with a willingness to reach out to parts of the electorate that the G.O.P. had neglected, particularly, but not exclusively, Hispanics. Immigration reform was supposed to be the test case for whether the Republican Party could adopt a more pragmatic and inclusive approach, and when it sunk, it took Rubio down with it.","371","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"The bigger story is that this Republican golden boy fell victim to what I refer to as the three-strikes theory of politics. If you look around, you will find that it generally takes not just one or two but three defeats for an unpopular political party to reform itself and abandon the things that made it unpopular. Because of the influence of established politicians, vested interests, and ideology, all democratic parties tend to resist change. Two strikes aren’t enough to overcome this inertia. Only after a third successive beating at the hands of voters can reformers overcome the ideologues and seize control of the party.","372","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"Of course, it’s only a theory, and it has its exceptions. But look at what happened to the Democratic Party in the nineteen-eighties. After losing to the Republicans for a third successive time in 1988, Bill Clinton and his business-friendly “New Democrats” gradually gained the upper hand and won the 1992 election. Something similar happened in the United Kingdom, when the Labour Party, after defeats in 1981, 1984, and 1987, jettisoned much of its ideological baggage: its commitments to public ownership, unilateral disarmament, and compulsory trade-union membership. The more recent experience in France, which saw the Socialist Party lose Presidential elections in 1995, 2002, and 2007, isn’t quite as stark, perhaps, in that the current President, François Hollande, could hardly be described as a great departure from previous Socialist leaders. But even Hollande, in the run-up to the 2012 Presidential election, advocated for some policies that had previously been considered off limits, such as raising contributions to the retirement system and making it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers.","373","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"Where are the Republican reformers? Despite talk about making the party more electable, the evidence suggests that the G.O.P. ultras, even if they don’t hold many very senior posts in the party, retain an effective veto over any efforts to modernize. With Rubio now parroting the immigration line laid down by Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, et al., the task of taming the right wing has passed to Bush, who, to his credit, has not yet backed down from his support for comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for the undocumented.","374","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"As I’ve mentioned before, Bush is hardly a moderate. During his eight years as governor of Florida, he pursued a stridently conservative agenda on spending, taxes, labor laws, and many other issues. Still, compared with the likes of Cruz, Walker, and Carson, he’s practically a Rockefeller Republican. But if you look at the surveys of Republican voters collected on Real Clear Politics that I cited earlier, you will find that Bush is stuck at well under twenty per cent. If you then add together the vote shares of Walker, Cruz, Paul, Carson, and Huckabee, all avowedly conservative candidates, you get a total of 53.1 per cent. Add in Rick Perry and Rick Santorum, and the conservative tally is even higher.","375","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"

"For about a century, economic inequality has been measured on a scale, from zero to one, known as the Gini index and named after an Italian statistician, Corrado Gini, who devised it in 1912, when he was twenty-eight and the chair of statistics at the University of Cagliari. If all the income in the world were earned by one person and everyone else earned nothing, the world would have a Gini index of one. If everyone in the world earned exactly the same income, the world would have a Gini index of zero. The United States Census Bureau has been using Gini’s measurement to calculate income inequality in America since 1947. Between 1947 and 1968, the U.S. Gini index dropped to .386, the lowest ever recorded. Then it began to climb.","377","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Income inequality is greater in the United States than in any other democracy in the developed world. Between 1975 and 1985, when the Gini index for U.S. households rose from .397 to .419, as calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau, the Gini indices of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Sweden, and Finland ranged roughly between .200 and .300, according to national data analyzed by Andrea Brandolini and Timothy Smeeding. But historical cross-country comparisons are difficult to make; the data are patchy, and different countries measure differently. The Luxembourg Income Study, begun in 1983, harmonizes data collected from more than forty countries on six continents. According to the L.I.S.’s adjusted data, the United States has regularly had the highest Gini index of any affluent democracy. In 2013, the U.S. Census Bureau reported a Gini index of .476.","378","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"The evidence that income inequality in the United States has been growing for decades and is greater than in any other developed democracy is not much disputed. It is widely known and widely studied. Economic inequality has been an academic specialty at least since Gini first put chalk to chalkboard. In the nineteen-fifties, Simon Kuznets, who went on to win a Nobel Prize, used tax data to study the shares of income among groups, an approach that was further developed by the British economist Anthony Atkinson, beginning with his 1969 paper “On the Measurement of Inequality,” in the Journal of Economic Theory. Last year’s unexpected popular success of the English translation of Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-first Century” drew the public’s attention to measurements of inequality, but Piketty’s work had long since reached American social scientists, especially through a 2003 paper that he published with the Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez, in The Quarterly Journal of Economics. Believing that the Gini index underestimates inequality, Piketty and Saez favor Kuznets’s approach. (Atkinson, Piketty, Saez, and Facundo Alvaredo are also the creators of the World Top Incomes Database, which collects income-share data from more than twenty countries.) In “Income Inequality in the United States, 1913-1998,” Piketty and Saez used tax data to calculate what percentage of income goes to the top one per cent and to the top ten per cent. In 1928, the top one per cent earned twenty-four per cent of all income; in 1944, they earned eleven per cent, a rate that began to rise in the nineteen-eighties. By 2012, according to Saez’s updated data, the top one per cent were earning twenty-three per cent of the nation’s income, almost the same ratio as in 1928, although it has since dropped slightly.","379","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Political scientists are nearly as likely to study economic inequality as economists are, though they’re less interested in how much inequality a market can bear than in how much a democracy can bear, and here the general thinking is that the United States is nearing its breaking point. In 2001, the American Political Science Association formed a Task Force on Inequality and American Democracy; a few years later, it concluded that growing economic inequality was threatening fundamental American political institutions. In 2009, Oxford University Press published both a seven-hundred-page “Handbook of Economic Inequality” and a collection of essays about the political consequences of economic inequality whose argument is its title: “The Unsustainable American State.” There’s a global version of this argument, too. “Inequality Matters,” a 2013 report by the United Nations, took the view—advanced by the economist Joseph Stiglitz in his book “The Price of Inequality”—that growing income inequality is responsible for all manner of political instability, as well as for the slowing of economic growth worldwide. Last year, when the Pew Research Center conducted a survey about which of five dangers people in forty-four countries consider to be the “greatest threat to the world,” many of the countries polled put religious and ethnic hatred at the top of their lists, but Americans and many Europeans chose inequality.","380","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"What’s new about the chasm between the rich and the poor in the United States, then, isn’t that it’s growing or that scholars are studying it or that people are worried about it. What’s new is that American politicians of all spots and stripes are talking about it, if feebly: inequality this, inequality that. In January, at a forum sponsored by Freedom Partners (a free-market advocacy group with ties to the Koch brothers), the G.O.P. Presidential swains Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio battled over which of them disliked inequality more, agreeing only that its existence wasn’t their fault. “The top one per cent earn a higher share of our income, nationally, than any year since 1928,” Cruz said, drawing on the work of Saez and Piketty. Cruz went on, “I chuckle every time I hear Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton talk about income inequality, because it’s increased dramatically under their policies.” No doubt there has been a lot of talk. “Let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one per cent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth,” Obama said during his State of the Union address. Speaker of the House John Boehner countered that “the President’s policies have made income inequality worse.”","381","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"The reason Democrats and Republicans are fighting over who’s to blame for growing economic inequality is that, aside from a certain amount of squabbling, it’s no longer possible to deny that it exists—a development that’s not to be sneezed at, given the state of the debate on climate change. That’s not to say the agreement runs deep; in fact, it couldn’t be shallower. The causes of income inequality are much disputed; so are its costs. And knowing the numbers doesn’t appear to be changing anyone’s mind about what, if anything, should be done about it.","382","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Robert Putnam’s new book, “Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis” (Simon & Schuster), is an attempt to set the statistics aside and, instead, tell a story. “Our Kids” begins with the story of the town where Putnam grew up, Port Clinton, Ohio. Putnam is a political scientist, but his argument is historical—it’s about change over time—and fuelled, in part, by nostalgia. “My hometown was, in the 1950s, a passable embodiment of the American Dream,” he writes, “a place that offered decent opportunity for all the kids in town, whatever their background.” Sixty years later, Putnam says, Port Clinton “is a split-screen American nightmare, a community in which kids from the wrong side of the tracks that bisect the town can barely imagine the future that awaits the kids from the right side of the tracks.”","383","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Inequality-wise, Port Clinton makes a reasonable Middletown. According to the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, Port Clinton’s congressional district, Ohio’s ninth, has a Gini index of .467, which is somewhat lower than the A.C.S.’s estimate of the national average. But “Our Kids” isn’t a book about the Gini index. “Some of us learn from numbers, but more of us learn from stories,” according to an appendix that Putnam co-wrote with Jennifer M. Silva. Putnam, the author of “Bowling Alone,” is the director of the Saguaro Seminar for civic engagement at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government; Silva, a sociologist, has been a postdoctoral fellow there. In her 2013 book “Coming Up Short: Working-Class Adulthood in an Age of Uncertainty” (Oxford), Silva reported the results of interviews she conducted with a hundred working-class adults in Lowell, Massachusetts and Richmond, Virginia, described her account of the structural inequalities that shape their lives as “a story of institutions—not individuals or their families,” and argued that those inequalities are the consequence of the past half century’s “massive effort to roll back social protections from the market.” For “Our Kids,” Silva visited Robert Putnam’s home town and interviewed young people and their parents. Putnam graduated from Port Clinton High School in 1959. The surviving members of his class are now in their mid-seventies. Putnam and Silva sent them questionnaires; seventy-five people returned them. Silva also spent two years interviewing more than a hundred young adults in nine other cities and counties across the nation. As Putnam and Silva note, Silva conducted nearly all of the interviews Putnam uses in his book.","384","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"“Our Kids” is a heartfelt portrait of four generations: Putnam’s fellow 1959 graduates and their children, and the kids in Port Clinton and those nine other communities today and their parents. The book tells more or less the same story that the numbers tell; it’s just got people in it. Specifically, it’s got kids: the kids Putnam used to know, and, above all, the kids Silva interviewed. The book proceeds from the depressing assumption that presenting the harrowing lives of poor young people is the best way to get Americans to care about poverty.","385","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Putnam has changed the names of all his subjects and removed certain identifying details. He writes about them as characters. First, there’s Don. He went to Port Clinton High School with Putnam. His father worked two jobs: an eight-hour shift at Port Clinton Manufacturing, followed by seven and a half hours at a local canning plant. A minister in town helped Don apply to university. “I didn’t know I was poor until I went to college,” Don says. He graduated from college, became a minister, and married a high-school teacher; they had one child, who became a high-school librarian. Libby, another member of Putnam’s graduating class, was the sixth of ten children. Like Don’s parents, neither of Libby’s parents finished high school. Her father worked at Standard Products, a factory on Maple Street that made many different things out of rubber, from weather stripping to tank treads. Libby won a scholarship to the University of Toledo, but dropped out to get married and have kids. Twenty years later, after a divorce, she got a job as a clerk in a lumberyard, worked her way up to becoming a writer for a local newspaper, and eventually ran for countywide office and won.","386","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"All but two of the members of Putnam’s graduating class were white. Putnam’s wistfulness toward his childhood home town is at times painful to read. The whiteness of Port Clinton in the nineteen-fifties was not mere happenstance but the consequence of discriminatory housing and employment practices. I glanced through the records of the Ohio chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., which included a branch in Port Clinton. The Ohio chapter’s report for 1957 chronicles, among other things, its failed attempt to gain passage of statewide Fair Housing legislation; describes how “cross burnings occurred in many cities in Ohio”; recounts instances of police brutality, including in Columbus, where a patrolman beat a woman “with the butt of his pistol all over her face and body”; and states that in Toledo, Columbus, “and in a number of other communities, the Association intervened in situations where violence flared up or was threatened when Negro families moved into formerly ‘all-white neighborhoods.’ ” Thurgood Marshall, the director of the N.A.A.C.P.’s Legal Defense and Educational Fund, spoke in Ohio in 1958, after which a sympathetic Cleveland newspaper wrote that Marshall “will never be named to the Supreme Court.” In 1960, the Ohio N.A.A.C.P. launched a statewide voter-registration drive. One pamphlet asked, “Are you permitted to live wherever you please in any Ohio City?” Putnam acknowledges that there was a lot of racism in Port Clinton, but he suggests that, whatever hardships the two black kids in his class faced because they were black, the American dream was nevertheless theirs. This fails to convince. As one of those two kids, now grown, tells Putnam, “Your then was not my then, and your now isn’t even my now.”","387","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"In any case, the world changed, and Port Clinton changed with it. “Most of the downtown shops of my youth stand empty and derelict,” Putnam writes. In the late nineteen-sixties, the heyday of the Great Society, when income inequality in the United States was as low as it has ever been, the same was probably true of Port Clinton. But in the nineteen-seventies the town’s manufacturing base collapsed. Standard Products laid off more than half of its workers. In 1993, the plant closed. Since then, unemployment has continued to rise and wages to fall. Between 1999 and 2013, the percentage of children in Port Clinton living in poverty rose from ten to forty.","388","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Silva found David hanging out in a park. His father, currently in prison, never had a steady job. David’s parents separated when he was a little boy. He bounced around, attending seven elementary schools. When he was thirteen, he was arrested for robbery. He graduated from high school only because he was given course credit for hours he’d worked at Big Boppers Diner (from which he was fired after graduation). In 2012, when David was eighteen, he got his girlfriend pregnant. “I’ll never get ahead,” he posted on his Facebook page last year, after his girlfriend left him. “I’m FUCKING DONE.”","389","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Wealthy newcomers began arriving in the nineteen-nineties. On the shores of Lake Erie, just a few miles past Port Clinton’s trailer parks, they built mansions and golf courses and gated communities. “Chelsea and her family live in a large white home with a wide porch overlooking the lake,” Putnam writes, introducing another of his younger characters. Chelsea was the president of her high school’s student body and editor of the yearbook. Her mother, Wendy, works part time; her father, Dick, is a businessman. In the basement of their house, Wendy and Dick had a “1950s-style diner” built so that Chelsea and her brother would have a place to hang out with their friends. When Chelsea’s brother got a bad grade in school, Wendy went all the way to the school board to get it changed. Chelsea and her brother are now in college. Wendy does not appear to believe in welfare. “You have to work if you want to get rich,” she says. “If my kids are going to be successful, I don’t think they should have to pay other people who are sitting around doing nothing for their success.”","390","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Aside from the anecdotes, the bulk of “Our Kids” is an omnibus of social-science scholarship. The book’s chief and authoritative contribution is its careful presentation for a popular audience of important work on the erosion, in the past half century, of so many forms of social, economic, and political support for families, schools, and communities—with consequences that amount to what Silva and others have called the “privatization of risk.” The social-science literature includes a complicated debate about the relationship between inequality of outcome (differences of income and of wealth) and inequality of opportunity (differences in education and employment). To most readers, these issues are more familiar as a political disagreement. In American politics, Democrats are more likely to talk about both kinds of inequality, while Republicans tend to confine their concern to inequality of opportunity. According to Putnam, “All sides in this debate agree on one thing, however: as income inequality expands, kids from more privileged backgrounds start and probably finish further and further ahead of their less privileged peers, even if the rate of socioeconomic mobility is unchanged.” He also takes the position, again relying on a considerable body of scholarship, that, “quite apart from the danger that the opportunity gap poses to American prosperity, it also undermines our democracy.” Chelsea is interested in politics. David has never voted.","391","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"The American dream is in crisis, Putnam argues, because Americans used to care about other people’s kids and now they only care about their own kids. But, he writes, “America’s poor kids do belong to us and we to them. They are our kids.” This is a lot like his argument in “Bowling Alone.” In high school in Port Clinton, Putnam was in a bowling league; he regards bowling leagues as a marker of community and civic engagement; bowling leagues are in decline; hence, Americans don’t take care of one another anymore. “Bowling Alone” and “Our Kids” also have the same homey just-folksiness. And they have the same shortcomings. If you don’t miss bowling leagues or all-white suburbs where women wear aprons—if Putnam’s then was not your then and his now isn’t your now—his well-intentioned “we” can be remarkably grating.","392","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"In story form, the argument of “Our Kids” is that while Wendy and Dick were building a fifties-style diner for their kids in the basement of their lakefront mansion, grade-grubbing with their son’s teachers, and glue-gunning the decorations for their daughter’s prom, every decent place to hang out in Port Clinton closed its doors, David was fired from his job at Big Boppers, and he got his girlfriend pregnant because, by the time David and Chelsea were born, in the nineteen-nineties, not only was Standard Products out of business but gone, too, was the sense of civic obligation and commonweal—everyone caring about everyone else’s kids—that had made it possible for Don and Libby to climb out of poverty in the nineteen-fifties and the nineteen-sixties. “Nobody gave a shit,” David says. And he’s not wrong.","393","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"“Our Kids” is a passionate, urgent book. It also has a sad helplessness. Putnam tells a story teeming with characters and full of misery but without a single villain. This is deliberate. “This is a book without upper-class villains,” he insists in the book’s final chapter. In January, Putnam tweeted, “My new book ‘Our Kids’ shows a growing gap between rich kids and poor kids. We’ll work with all sides on solutions.” It’s easier to work with all sides if no side is to blame. But Putnam’s eagerness to influence Congress has narrative consequences. If you’re going to tell a story about bad things happening to good people, you’ve got to offer an explanation, and, when you make your arguments through characters, your reader will expect that explanation in the form of characters. I feel bad for Chelsea. But I feel worse for David. Am I supposed to hate Wendy?","394","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Some people make arguments by telling stories; other people make arguments by counting things. Charles Dickens was a story man. In “Hard Times” (1854), a novel written when statistics was on the rise, Dickens’s villain, Thomas Gradgrind, was a numbers man, “a man of facts and calculations,” who named one of his sons Adam Smith and another Malthus. “With a rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication table always in his pocket, Sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature, and tell you exactly what it comes to.”","395","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Numbers men are remote and cold of heart, Dickens thought. But, of course, the appeal of numbers lies in their remoteness and coldness. Numbers depersonalize; that remains one of their chief claims to authority, and to a different explanatory force than can be found in, say, a poem. “Quantification is a technology of distance,” as the historian of science Theodore Porter has pointed out. “Reliance on numbers and quantitative manipulation minimizes the need for intimate knowledge and personal trust.” It’s difficult to understand something like income inequality across large populations and to communicate your understanding of it across vast distances without counting. But quantification’s lack of intimacy is also its weakness; it represents not only a gain but also a loss of knowledge.","396","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Corrado Gini, he of the Gini index, was a numbers man, at a time when statistics had become a modern science. In 1925, four years after Gini wrote “Measurement of Inequality of Incomes,” he signed the “Manifesto of Fascist Intellectuals” (he was the only statistician to do so) and was soon running the Presidential Commission for the Study of Constitutional Reforms. As Jean-Guy Prévost reported in “A Total Science: Statistics in Liberal and Fascist Italy” (2009), Gini’s work was so closely tied to the Fascist state that, in 1944, after the regime fell, he was tried for being an apologist for Fascism. In the shadow of his trial, he joined the Movimento Unionista Italiano, a political party whose objective was to annex Italy to the United States. “This would solve all of Italy’s problems,” the movement’s founder, Santi Paladino, told a reporter for Time. (“Paladino has never visited the U.S., though his wife Francesca lived 24 years in The Bronx,” the magazine noted.) But, for Gini, the movement’s purpose was to provide him with some anti-Fascist credentials.","397","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"The story of Gini is a good illustration of the problem with stories, which is that they personalize (which is also their power). His support for Fascism doesn’t mean that the Gini index isn’t valuable. It is valuable. The life of Corrado Gini can’t be used to undermine all of statistical science. Still, if you wanted to write an indictment of statistics as an instrument of authoritarian states, and if you had a great deal of other evidence to support that indictment—including other stories and, ideally, numbers—why yes, Gini would be an excellent character to introduce in Chapter 1.","398","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Because stories contain one kind of truth and numbers another, many writers mix and match, telling representative stories and backing them up with aggregate data. Putnam, though, doesn’t so much mix and match as split the difference. He tells stories about kids but presents data about the economy. That’s why “Our Kids” has heaps of victims but not a single villain. “We encounter Elijah in a dingy shopping mall on the north side of Atlanta, during his lunch break from a job packing groceries,” Putnam writes. “Elijah is thin and small in stature, perhaps five foot seven, and wears baggy clothes that bulk his frame: jeans belted low around his upper thighs, a pair of Jordans on his feet.” As for why Elijah is packing groceries, the book offers not characters—there are no interviews, for instance, with members of the Georgia legislature or the heads of national corporations whose businesses have left Atlanta—but numbers, citing statistics about the city (“Large swaths of southern and western Atlanta itself are over 95 percent black, with child poverty rates ranging from 50 percent to 80 percent”) and providing a series of charts reporting the results of studies about things like class differences in parenting styles and in the frequency of the family dinner.","399","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"In “The Age of Acquiescence: The Life and Death of American Resistance to Organized Wealth and Power” (Little, Brown), Steve Fraser fumes that what’s gone wrong with political discourse in America is that the left isn’t willing to blame anyone for anything anymore. There used to be battle cries. No more kings! Down with fat cats! Damn the moneycrats! Like Putnam’s argument, Fraser’s is both historical and nostalgic. Fraser longs for the passion and force with which Americans of earlier generations attacked aggregated power. Think of the way Frederick Douglass wrote about slavery, Ida B. Wells wrote about lynching, Ida Tarbell wrote about Standard Oil, Upton Sinclair wrote about the meatpacking industry, and Louis Brandeis wrote about the money trust. These people weren’t squeamish about villains.","400","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"To chronicle the rise of acquiescence, Fraser examines two differences between the long nineteenth century and today. “The first Gilded Age, despite its glaring inequities, was accompanied by a gradual rise in the standard of living; the second by a gradual erosion,” he writes. In the first Gilded Age, everyone from reporters to politicians apparently felt comfortable painting plutocrats as villains; in the second, this is, somehow, forbidden. “If the first Gilded Age was full of sound and fury,” he writes, “the second seemed to take place in a padded cell.” Fraser argues that while Progressive Era muckrakers ended the first Gilded Age by drawing on an age-old tradition of dissent to criticize prevailing economic, social, and political arrangements, today’s left doesn’t engage in dissent; it engages in consent, urging solutions that align with neoliberalism, technological determinism, and global capitalism: “Environmental despoiling arouses righteous eating; cultural decay inspires charter schools; rebellion against work becomes work as a form of rebellion; old-form anticlericalism morphs into the piety of the secular; the break with convention ends up as the politics of style; the cri de coeur against alienation surrenders to the triumph of the solitary; the marriage of political and cultural radicalism ends in divorce.” Why not blame the financial industry? Why not blame the Congress that deregulated it? Why not blame the system itself? Because, Fraser argues, the left has been cowed into silence on the main subject at hand: “What we could not do, what was not even speakable, was to tamper with the basic institutions of financial capitalism.”","401","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Putnam closes “Our Kids” with a chapter called “What Is to Be Done?” Tampering with the basic institutions of financial capitalism is not on his to-do list. The chapter includes one table, one chart, many stories, and this statement: “The absence of personal villains in our stories does not mean that no one is at fault.” At fault are “social policies that reflect collective decisions,” and, “insofar as we have some responsibility for those collective decisions, we are implicated by our failure to address removable barriers to others’ success.” What can Putnam’s “we” do? He proposes changes in four realms: family structure, parenting, school, and community. His policy recommendations include expanding the earned-income tax credit and protecting existing anti-poverty programs; implementing more generous parental leaves, better child-care programs, and state-funded preschool; equalizing the funding of public schools, providing more community-based neighborhood schools, and increasing support for vocational high-school programs and for community colleges; ending pay-to-play extracurricular activities in public schools and developing mentorship programs that tie schools to communities and community organizations.","402","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"All of these ideas are admirable, many are excellent, none are new, and, at least at the federal level, few are achievable. The American political imagination has become as narrow as the gap between rich and poor is wide.","403","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"“Inequality: What Can Be Done?,” by Anthony Atkinson, will be published this spring (Harvard). Atkinson is a renowned expert on the measurement of economic inequality, but in “Inequality” he hides his math. “There are a number of graphs, and a small number of tables,” he writes, by way of apology, and he paraphrases Stephen Hawking: “Every equation halves the number of readers.”","404","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Much of the book is a discussion of specific proposals. Atkinson believes that solutions like Putnam’s, which focus on inequality of opportunity, mainly through reforms having to do with public education, are inadequate. Atkinson thinks that the division between inequality of outcome and inequality of opportunity is largely false. He believes that tackling inequality of outcome is a very good way to tackle inequality of opportunity. (If you help a grownup get a job, her kids will have a better chance of climbing out of poverty, too.) Above all, he disagrees with the widespread assumption that technological progress and globalization are responsible for growing inequality. That assumption, he argues, is wrong and also dangerous, because it encourages the belief that growing inequality is inevitable.","405","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Atkinson points out that neither globalization nor rapid technological advance is new and there are, therefore, lessons to be learned from history. Those lessons do not involve nostalgia. (Atkinson is actually an optimistic sort, and he spends time appreciating rising standards of living, worldwide.) One of those lessons is that globalizing economies aren’t like hurricanes or other acts of God or nature. Instead, they’re governed by laws regulating things like unions and trusts and banks and wages and taxes; laws are passed by legislators; in democracies, legislators are elected. So, too, new technologies don’t simply fall out of the sky, like meteors or little miracles. “The direction of technological change is the product of decisions by firms, researchers, and governments,” Atkinson writes. The iPhone exists, as Mariana Mazzucato demonstrated in her 2013 book “The Entrepreneurial State,” because various branches of the U.S. government provided research assistance that resulted in several key technological developments, including G.P.S., multi-touch screens, L.C.D. displays, lithium-ion batteries, and cellular networks.","406","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Atkinson isn’t interested in stories the way Putnam is interested in stories. And he isn’t interested in villains the way Fraser is interested in villains. But he is interested in responsible parties, and in demanding government action. “It is not enough to say that rising inequality is due to technological forces outside our control,” Atkinson writes. “The government can influence the path taken.” In “Inequality: What Can Be Done?,” he offers fifteen proposals, from the familiar (unemployment programs, national savings bonds, and a more progressive tax structure) to the novel (a governmental role in the direction of technological development, a capital endowment or “minimum inheritance” paid to everyone on reaching adulthood), along with five “ideas to pursue,” which is where things get Piketty (a global tax on wealth, a minimum tax on corporations).","407","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"In Port Clinton, Ohio, a barbed-wire fence surrounds the abandoned Standard Products factory; the E.P.A. has posted signs warning that the site is hazardous. There’s no work there anymore, only poison. Robert Putnam finds that heartbreaking. Steve Fraser wishes people were angrier about it. Anthony Atkinson thinks something can be done. Atkinson’s specific policy recommendations are for the United Kingdom. In the United States, most of his proposals are nonstarters, no matter how many times you hear the word “inequality” on “Meet the Press” this year.","408","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"It might be that people have been studying inequality in all the wrong places. A few years ago, two scholars of comparative politics, Alfred Stepan, at Columbia, and the late Juan J. Linz—numbers men—tried to figure out why the United States has for so long had much greater income inequality than any other developed democracy. Because this disparity has been more or less constant, the question doesn’t lend itself very well to historical analysis. Nor is it easily subject to the distortions of nostalgia. But it does lend itself very well to comparative analysis.","409","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Stepan and Linz identified twenty-three long-standing democracies with advanced economies. Then they counted the number of veto players in each of those twenty-three governments. (A veto player is a person or body that can block a policy decision. Stepan and Linz explain, “For example, in the United States, the Senate and the House of Representatives are veto players because without their consent, no bill can become a law.”) More than half of the twenty-three countries Stepan and Linz studied have only one veto player; most of these countries have unicameral parliaments. A few countries have two veto players; Switzerland and Australia have three. Only the United States has four. Then they made a chart, comparing Gini indices with veto-player numbers: the more veto players in a government, the greater the nation’s economic inequality. This is only a correlation, of course, and cross-country economic comparisons are fraught, but it’s interesting.","410","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Then they observed something more. Their twenty-three democracies included eight federal governments with both upper and lower legislative bodies. Using the number of seats and the size of the population to calculate malapportionment, they assigned a “Gini Index of Inequality of Representation” to those eight upper houses, and found that the United States had the highest score: it has the most malapportioned and the least representative upper house. These scores, too, correlated with the countries’ Gini scores for income inequality: the less representative the upper body of a national legislature, the greater the gap between the rich and the poor.","411","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"The growth of inequality isn’t inevitable. But, insofar as Americans have been unable to adopt measures to reduce it, the numbers might seem to suggest that the problem doesn’t lie with how Americans treat one another’s kids, as lousy as that is. It lies with Congress. ♦","412","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"At work and at play, Senator Robert Menendez, of New Jersey, is a man of the world. Departing the confines of Union City, where he grew up and where he first entered politics, Menendez rose to become the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, travelling frequently, receiving foreign dignitaries, and moving easily between English and Spanish. In the view of federal prosecutors, his capacious appetite for life beyond New Jersey has carried him past too many boundaries.","April 14, 2015","413","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/american-vice-bob-menendezs-global-reach"
"On April 1st, the Department of Justice charged Menendez with fourteen counts of corruption, accusing him of accepting nearly a million dollars in gifts and contributions from Salomon Melgen, an eye doctor in Florida. Menendez and Melgen, who was also charged, have pleaded not guilty. The sixty-eight-page indictment contains a list of indulgences, which reads like the what-you’ve-won moment on a game show: “domestic and international flights on private jets . . . use of a Caribbean villa, access to an exclusive Dominican resort, a stay at a luxury hotel in Paris, expensive meals, golf outing.” Worldly gifts flowed the other way as well. Menendez allegedly helped to secure visas for three women in Melgen’s life, identified in the indictment as “Girlfriend 1,” “Girlfriend 2,” and “Girlfriend 3”—Brazilian, Dominican, and Ukrainian, all models.","414","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/american-vice-bob-menendezs-global-reach"

"But the most substantive charge against the senior senator from New Jersey is that he used his position as one of the most powerful Democrats in Washington to lobby and bully government officials into serving the private interests of a friend and a benefactor (who, not incidentally, didn’t even live in New Jersey). According to the Times, in 2012, Melgen received the highest Medicare reimbursement of any doctor in America but still felt he was being shortchanged. That August, Menendez summoned Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and advocated for Melgen, accusing the agency of treating him unfairly in a billing dispute. (Sebelius has said that she did not share his view.) Two months later, Melgen contributed three hundred thousand dollars to a political-action committee intended to support Menendez’s reëlection. In another case, Menendez deployed his staff to lobby the State Department to protect Melgen’s investment in a Dominican cargo-screening company. A State Department official who did not adopt Menendez’s sense of urgency on the matter told colleagues that the Senator threatened to compel him to testify at a Senate hearing.","416","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/american-vice-bob-menendezs-global-reach"
"Prosecutors say that Menendez “used the prestige, authority, and influence of his status as a United States Senator” to do the grubby business of helping a friend. But looking at how this case has been received around the world, it’s striking that, in the current era of big-money politics, nobody is terribly surprised to learn that a U.S. Senator has been accused of trading cash and favors. Most of the coverage has been about how Menendez’s troubles will affect an influential lawmaker’s ability to push one issue or another. He is co-sponsoring a bill aimed at holding up, if not scuttling, the Administration’s draft of a nuclear deal with Iran, and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, in an op-ed in the Jerusalem Post, wrote, “It is imperative that the Jewish community remember, stand by and speak up for its true and trusted friends.” Radio Free Europe called him a “friend of Armenia,” because of his support for the Armenian-American community in his home state.","417","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/american-vice-bob-menendezs-global-reach"
"Meanwhile, for some in the Chinese government, the Menendez case is welcome news. A headline in the state-run People’s Daily proclaimed, “U.S. SENATOR’S CORRUPTION CASE ONCE AGAIN EXPOSES HOW MONEY RULES POLITICS.” It said that Menendez’s story of “rising from blue-collar life to the political élite was regarded as the epitome of the American Dream” but turns out to have the “typical characteristics of American-style corruption.” There was a time when the Chinese press hyped cases of American political corruption, in order to highlight the perils of liberal democracy. Today it simply needs to narrate recent events: the flood of money unleashed by the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision; the disgrace and conviction of Bob McDonnell, the former governor of Virginia. The Global Times, a Beijing-based government tabloid, remarked on the “public apathy” in America surrounding the Menendez revelations at a time when voter turnout was declining. “Americans who do not vote are saying, basically, ‘Elections are all manipulated by different interest groups, so it’s no use.’ ” It’s a fair point—even if it’s an opportunistic one, from a newspaper that praises the virtues of the one-party system. (On Chinese social media, some questioned whether Chinese papers should be crowing: “American corruption can’t even match the tip of the iceberg of Chinese corruption,” a Weibo user wrote.)","418","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/american-vice-bob-menendezs-global-reach"
"In court, the case’s prospects are mixed. The strongest charge may be a felony accusation of making false statements, because, from 2007 to 2012, Menendez failed to report any of Melgen’s gifts. But unlike the McDonnell case, prosecutors have not revealed a coöperating insider or a pattern of smoking-gun e-mails, which would lay out a quid pro quo, and Menendez is calling the whole thing a case of a friendship misconstrued. Andrew McBride, a former federal prosecutor, told Bloomberg News, “There’s less than a fifty-per-cent chance of conviction. This is going to be a donnybrook.”","419","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/american-vice-bob-menendezs-global-reach"
"In the end, for all his globetrotting, Menendez may find that he is most at home in New Jersey, where the indictment has done little damage to his reputation. “There’s an unprecedented show of support for him, more so than I’ve ever seen for any other indicted public official,” the veteran criminal attorney Joe Hayden told the news site PolitickerNJ. When Menendez emerged for his first press conference after the charges, he said, “I’m angry and ready to fight.” He was no longer at the Park Hyatt Paris Vendôme. He was at the Hilton in Newark, greeted by applause and shouts of “Viva Bob.”","420","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/american-vice-bob-menendezs-global-reach"

"Set aside, for a moment, his repeated refusal, in the past few days, to say whether he believes that President Obama loves America, or whether he believes that the President is a Christian, and look instead at Walker’s record running what used to be one of America’s more progressive states. Having cut taxes for the wealthy and stripped many of Wisconsin’s public-sector unions of their collective-bargaining rights, he is now preparing to sign a legislative bill that would cripple unions in the private sector. Many wealthy conservatives, such as the Koch brothers, who have funnelled a lot of money to groups supporting Walker, regard him as someone who’s turning his state into a showcase for what they want the rest of America to look like.","422","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"But just how threatening is he? If you’ve been following the political news during the past week, you may well have the impression that he’s stumbling in his campaign for the 2016 G.O.P. nomination. Among the political commentariat, the consensus of opinion is that Walker’s repeated refusal to distance himself from Rudy Giuliani’s incendiary comments about Obama, and his subsequent encounter with the Washington Post’s Dan Balz and Robert Costa, during which he appeared to question Obama’s religious faith and took some shots at the media for asking him silly questions, weren’t merely reprehensible: they were serious gaffes that raised questions about Walker’s political abilities.","423","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"It wasn’t just liberal columnists who piled on. In a column at the Daily Beast, Matt Lewis, who also writes for the Daily Caller, said that Walker’s comments raised the question of whether he “might not be ready for prime time on the national stage.” Lewis went on: “Conservatives should be worried that Walker hasn’t proven capable of navigating these land mines.” MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, who is a former G.O.P. congressman, wrote at Politico: “Good candidates know how to make dumb questions look, well, dumb.”","424","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"Rather than deflecting the reporters’ queries about Obama’s beliefs, as other Republicans had done, Walker used them to send a none-too-subtle message to Republican voters. His refusal to say whether Obama was a Christian wasn’t merely a shot at a hostile media. As Dana Milbank, of the Washington Post noted, it allowed Walker to “wink and nod at the far-right fringe where people really believe that Obama is a Muslim from Kenya who hates America.” Milbank also wrote that Walker was “refusing to grant his opponent legitimacy as an American and a Christian.”","425","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"In a more just world, Walker’s indecent and craven antics would disqualify him from playing any further role in the Presidential race. But in the current political environment, his tactics, far from hurting him, may well bolster a candidacy that is already thriving.","426","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"Having cemented his reputation as an economic conservative, Walker is busy making a concerted effort to win over social conservatives and evangelical Christians, some of whom apparently believe that Obama is the Antichrist (or perhaps the Seventh King). Earlier this month, during a trip to London, he refused to say whether he believed in evolution, commenting: “That’s a question a politician shouldn’t be involved in, one way or the other.” In addition to making that hat tip to the Book of Genesis brigade, Walker has been reiterating his opposition to gay marriage and taking a notably harder line on abortion than he did during his gubernatorial reëlection campaign, last year. In a recent meeting with Iowa Republicans, the Times reported earlier this week, he stressed his support for a “personhood amendment” that would define life as beginning at conception and effectively outlaw the termination of pregnancies.","427","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"Evaluated in this context, Walker’s comments, or refusals to comment, about Obama’s beliefs look less like gaffes and more like carefully considered elements of a larger plan—and one that’s working for him. On Tuesday, the research firm Public Policy Polling released the results of a new national survey of Republican voters, which showed Walker leading the G.O.P. race, with twenty-five per cent of the vote. He was seven percentage points ahead of the candidate in second place, Ben Carson, the author and neurosurgeon, and eight percentage points ahead of Jeb Bush. “Walker is climbing fast in the polling because of his appeal to the most conservative elements of the Republican electorate,” said P.P.P. “Among ‘very conservative’ voters he leads with 37% to 19% for Carson, 12% for Bush, and 11% for Huckabee.”","428","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"This is just one poll, and the sample size was small—three hundred and sixteen—but recent state-level polls also show Walker near or in the lead. In California, according to the highly respected Field poll, he’s favored by eighteen per cent of Republicans. Bush is in second place with sixteen per cent, and Rand Paul is in third place with ten per cent. In Texas, a survey carried out by the University of Texas at Austin shows Walker running second, but he’s trailing local boy Ted Cruz by just one percentage point. When a previous poll was taken, in October, only two per cent of Texan Republicans favored Walker; now, he’s standing at nineteen per cent. In South Carolina, according to another P.P.P. survey, he’s also running second, just one point behind Bush, and leading Lindsey Graham, the state’s senior representative in the U.S. Senate.","429","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"It’s still early, very early, of course. But Walker is an ambitious and determined politician who has already been through one tough race—his 2012 recall election—that subjected him to a great deal of media attention and hostility from Democrats. Thanks to his ties to the conservative plutocracy, he’s almost certainly going to have some serious money behind him, and he is trying to pitch his campaign in the sweet spot of G.O.P. primaries, where conservatism and antagonism toward coastal élites meets electability. He has the advantage of youthfulness, at age forty-seven, and, finally, as he pointed out to a convention of Christian broadcasters on Monday, he is, “unlike some out there,” a self-made fellow who “didn’t inherit fame or fortune from my family.” That jab was presumably aimed at Jeb Bush, but if Walker were to get the G.O.P. nomination, it could be modified and directed at Hillary Clinton, assuming that she wins the Democratic nomination.","430","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"

We have a tendency to forget the history of laws that extended the obligations and commitments of the federal government.

"When Medicare was first proposed, in the late nineteen-fifties, national health insurance had been a losing cause for decades. In the thirties, Franklin Delano Roosevelt had chosen not to add health care to his Social Security proposal because he believed that it would be too controversial, and would damage the prospects of other programs. Whereas most Western democracies had adopted some form of national health-care program, the United States relied on a private system that revolved, as the sociologist Paul Starr has recounted, around a sacred understanding of the doctor-patient relationship. When liberals talked about giving the government a bigger role in health care, stakeholders in the existing system always fought back, protecting their authority and autonomy by warning that Washington would sever the ties between doctors and their patients. It was one thing to distribute old-age pensions but quite another to allow the government to intrude into intimate medical affairs. When one senator suggested in 1937 that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was prepared to expand the government’s role in medicine if doctors did not do more to help the needy, Time magazine asked in its June cover story, “Nationalized Doctors?”","434","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"When President Harry Truman proposed national health insurance for every American in 1945, and again in 1949, as part of his effort to move forward with domestic policies that had been left out of the New Deal, he and allied liberals came to see why F.D.R. had avoided the issue of health care back in the nineteen-thirties. The American Medical Association conducted the most expensive lobbying effort to that date in opposition to Truman’s health-care plan, which it branded as “un-American” and “socialized medicine.” Charging that the Truman Administration consisted of “followers of the Moscow party line,” the A.M.A. worked closely with the conservative coalition in Congress to kill the measure in committee. By 1950, the proposal was dead.","435","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Meanwhile, during the forties and fifties, the government solidified the private health-care system through corporate tax breaks that subsidized companies offering their workers insurance. More workers were brought into the private system through this indirect and hidden form of government assistance, creating even greater resistance to the idea of the federal government directly providing insurance.","436","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Still, many Democrats remained convinced that the health-care system left too many Americans without access to affordable care. In 1957, Congressman Aime Forand, an ardent New Deal liberal who had quit school after seventh grade to take care of his ailing father, came up with the idea of a smaller and more targeted program as a first step toward national health insurance. With Congressman Cecil King, a California Democrat, Forand proposed covering some of the medical costs of the growing number of Americans over the age of sixty-five. The problem of elderly Americans who lacked health care was acute, according to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Older Americans required more than twice as much hospital care as people under the age of sixty-five. Even with Social Security benefits, most could not afford the cost of hospitalization, which was rising rapidly during these years as a result of medical advances. Forand and King made the tactical decision to propose that the program fall under the Social Security Administration. Liberals would be able to argue that they were simply expanding the popular program and paying for the new benefits through the Social Security payroll tax.","437","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"In the House and Senate, the proposal, which the media called Medicare, received strong support from a new cohort of Democrats including Richard Bolling, of Missouri, and Hubert Humphrey, of Minnesota, whose numbers had been steadily growing since the 1946 election and exploded in the 1958 midterms. They were a new generation of Northern liberals who, while slightly younger than Forand and King, had been deeply influenced by the New Deal and were committed to extending its benefits in areas like health care, civil rights, and education. In their minds, the economy was booming, so the U.S. could afford to have the federal government alleviate all kinds of social problems that, until then, had been ignored. They were aligned with Walter Reuther, the president of the United Automobile Workers, who said to the program’s critics that it was time to “quit fighting ideological windmills and deal with basic human needs.”","438","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Organized labor, a powerful player in American politics at this time, when thirty per cent of the workforce was unionized, threw its support behind Medicare. Labor leaders cheered when Massachusetts Senator John Kennedy announced his support for Medicare during his 1960 Presidential campaign against Richard Nixon. Kennedy was no radical, but he believed that health care was one area where the government needed to have an expanded role. Kennedy saw the revised health-care bill as attractive in principle, as well as fiscally responsible, because workers would pay for the benefits that they would eventually receive. On August 14, 1960, Kennedy visited Hyde Park to celebrate, with Eleanor Roosevelt, the twenty-fifth anniversary of Social Security, and he used the occasion to promote Medicare. The program was desperately needed in “every city and town, every hospital and clinic, every neighborhood and rest home in America—wherever our older citizens live out their lives in want and despair under the shadow of illness,” the candidate said.","439","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Despite his reputation for being dispassionate about domestic policy, Kennedy, as President, authorized an all-out public-relations effort in support of Medicare. While there were many areas of policy, like civil rights, where Kennedy avoided action for fear that congressional conservatives would kill his ideas, the President believed that the bill stood a decent chance of passing, because so many voters loved their Social Security. On May 20, 1962, the President delivered a spirited address at a rally in Madison Square Garden, with more than seventeen thousand people in attendance and many more watching on television. “The fact of the matter is that what we are now talking about doing, most of the countries of Europe did years ago,” Kennedy said. “The British did it thirty years ago. We are behind every country, pretty nearly, in Europe, in this matter of medical care for our citizens.”","440","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"The A.M.A. launched an aggressive campaign in opposition to the President. Edward Annis, the president of the A.M.A., delivered a televised response to Kennedy’s address: Medicare would “put the government smack into your hospital.” A new A.M.A. political-action committee offered campaign support to candidates who opposed the bill. The A.M.A. women’s auxiliary launched Operation Coffee Cup, in which doctors’ wives hosted living-room discussions about the dangers of socialized medicine. Ronald Reagan produced a record to be played at these events, “Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine,” in which he warned that “one of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine.” The A.M.A. also had strong allies, such as the insurance lobby, which preferred to work behind the scenes to combat the bill.","441","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"In the House of Representatives, A.M.A. officials were counting on Wilbur Mills, an Arkansas Democrat and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. At five foot eight and a hundred and eighty pounds, with slicked-back hair and thin silver-rimmed glasses, Mills didn’t look like a congressional giant, but he was a key player in the insular world of tax and security experts. A graduate of Hendrix College, in Arkansas, he had attended Harvard Law School and was rumored to spend evenings reading the tax code. He had lived with his wife in the same modest apartment, near the National Zoo, for almost twenty-five years, and was renowned for his grasp of abstruse fiscal issues.","442","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"What drove Mills most was his belief in fiscal conservatism. He understood that the federal government was a permanent part of American life, but he was determined to contain the growth of the federal budget and to limit the tax burden that fell on working Americans. What most troubled Mills about the Medicare proposal was that its costs would grow rapidly, especially when voters learned that physicians’ bills were not covered by the program and pressured legislators to add those benefits as well. With Medicare, Congress could be forced to raise Social Security taxes beyond reasonable levels, resulting in a backlash against the entire program.","443","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Each time liberals had pushed for Medicare over the six years since Forand and King first proposed it, Mills had refused to let it up for a vote in his committee. In 1960, working with Oklahoma Senator Robert Kerr, Mills had attempted to stifle the drive toward Medicare by passing a limited program that provided means-tested health insurance to elderly citizens who were poor. As with public welfare, the program would be administered by state and local governments that chose to participate. Although Congress passed Medical Assistance for the Aged, known as the Kerr-Mills Act, only twenty-eight states had adopted it, and the guidelines for participation were so stringent that only one per cent of the elderly received benefits. Still, when Kennedy sent the proposal to Congress and rallied support on television, Mills would not bring Medicare up for a vote.","444","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"When Lyndon Johnson became President, in November, 1963, he made it clear that he was determined to pass Medicare. His overriding goal was to persuade Congress to pass a series of major bills that would constitute a second New Deal. Along with civil rights, Medicare was at the top of his list. Johnson urged Wilbur Cohen, a leading figure in the Social Security Administration, to work with Mills to come up with a Medicare proposal that was acceptable to the Ways and Means chairman. “If labor will buy it, that he can call a Mills bill,” Johnson told Cohen.","445","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"The negotiations didn’t get far. Even as Johnson called on Congress to fulfill the unfinished agenda of the slain President, Mills refused to hold a vote. He said that the cost problems had not been solved, and that there were not enough votes in the House to pass a bill if he sent it out of committee. In October, Medicare proponents in the Senate made a bold move by attaching Medicare as an amendment to legislation increasing Social Security benefits. Mills killed the proposal in conference committee. “I don’t know whether we can pass it next year or not,” Johnson told Senator Hubert Humphrey.","446","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"

"When the eighty-ninth Congress convened, in January, 1965, the emboldened liberals drove through a series of reforms and reorganization to further strengthen their hand. One of the important changes was to alter the party ratios on each committee to reflect the new majority. The Democrats added two pro-Medicare legislators to Ways and Means, while the G.O.P. assigned one. Democrats also instated the “twenty-one-day rule,” a procedure that offered a mechanism for moving a bill out of the House Rules Committee if the conservative chairman, the notorious Howard Smith, was refusing to allow it out for a vote. With these changes, House Majority Leader Carl Albert told Johnson, it wouldn’t matter if Mills was “for Medicare or not.”","448","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"On January 5th, Mills told the White House that Medicare would be the first order of business. The chairman knew that even if he continued to oppose the bill, pro-Medicare Democrats would be able to pass it without him, and without consulting him. Mills understood that his best option was to craft a Medicare proposal that would contain costs as much as possible and would allow him to take credit for a major legislative victory.","449","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Republicans, too, wanted to be part of the debate, and offered alternative proposals. Congressman Thomas Curtis, of Missouri, and A. Sydney Herlong, a Florida Democrat, proposed an expansion of Kerr-Mills that had the backing of the A.M.A. The ranking Republican on Ways and Means, John Byrnes, of Wisconsin, offered a more ambitious plan. Byrnes, who shared Mills’s fiscal conservatism but also believed in the importance of social policy, proposed a voluntary program that would cover the costs of physicians for older Americans. Those who elected to participate would contribute a monthly premium toward their care, while the federal government would finance the rest through general tax revenue.","450","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Medicare proponents had to make sure that there were not so many proposals that they siphoned off majority support for their bill. In closed-door hearings, Mills was now defending the fact that the Administration’s plan depended on Social Security taxes. “Haven’t we done a better job … of financing the cost of the Social Security program out of a separate fund, paid for by a payroll tax, than we have some other expenditures of government?” he asked.","451","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"As the discussions proceeded, the chairman had an even bigger idea, thinking of a way to put together a bill that would be almost impossible to defeat and which would satisfy some of his fiscal fears. On the afternoon of March 2nd, he leaned back in his chair and told Wilbur Cohen, “Maybe it would be a good idea if we put all three of these bills together.” Cohen, who had been negotiating with Mills for years, immediately had his staff draft a new bill.","452","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Based on Mills’ idea, which Cohen called a “three-layer cake,” the Administration revised its bill to include hospital insurance paid for by Social Security taxes, a voluntary program covering physicians’ costs paid for by a contribution from beneficiaries and general revenue from the federal government, and an expanded version of Kerr-Mills, later called Medicaid.","453","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Mills boasted that this plan satisfied everyone. Republicans couldn’t complain, because their ideas were part of the bill. Premiums and general tax money would pay for the part of the program covering doctors’ bills, so the future burden on Social Security taxes would be more predictable. Because private physicians fell under the voluntary part of the program, the A.M.A. could not as easily claim that this was “socialized medicine.”","454","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"On March 23rd, the Ways and Means Committee approved the bill by a vote of seventeen to eight. Republicans still voted for the John Byrnes bill, but did so knowing that the “three-layer cake” would pass. Cohen called Johnson to tell him about the outcome. “I think it’s a great bill, Mr. President,” Cohen said. “You got not only everything that you wanted but we got a lot more than—on this thing. It’s a real comprehensive bill.”","455","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"The American Medical Association knew that it had been beaten. Once it lost Wilbur Mills, it lost Congress. The House passed the final bill by a vote of three hundred and thirteen to a hundred and fifteen, on April 8th. The only remaining threat to Mills’s proposal came from liberals who tried to add amendments in the Senate, which would increase the cost of the legislation. But, in the conference committee, Mills systematically knocked down each amendment. He made only one major compromise, that hospitals and doctors would determine the “reasonable charges” for costs rather than the government doing so through regulated prices. He incorrectly assumed that this would not result in huge costs.","456","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"On July 30th, Johnson signed the Medicare bill, in Independence, Missouri, with former President Harry Truman standing beside him. For the first time, the federal government would play a direct role in the health-care system. Most liberals wanted much more, but they understood that passing Medicare and Medicaid was itself a historic step.","457","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"With the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, decades of obstruction came to an end. But turning a legislator like Mills was not easy. Persuasion and negotiation could only go so far.

"Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, seemed fired up on Thursday morning when he took his seat in room TW-C305 at F.C.C. headquarters. For months, anticipation had been building for the commission’s decision, planned for later that morning, on the fight over net neutrality—that is, whether Internet providers should be able to charge Web companies to get their content delivered to customers at faster speeds than usual, or whether all content should be treated equally. It would be an unusually high-profile, not to mention political, decision for the F.C.C., and the commissioners had got into the spirit; two of the Democrats who were expected to vote with Wheeler, also a Democrat, in favor of net neutrality—the equal treatment of content—had shown up wearing blue. Net-neutrality advocates were standing by, planning, after the expected decision in their favor, to fly a Grumpy Cat banner over the Philadelphia headquarters of Comcast.","February 28, 2015","459","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/fcc-municipal-broadband-ruling-matters-net-neutrality"
"Wheeler began the meeting by considering a different issue, one that has received far less attention than net neutrality but which could also have broad implications for how people in American cities use the Internet—and, that, like net neutrality, is expected to be disputed in the courts. It began when the cities of Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Wilson, North Carolina, petitioned the F.C.C. to take on laws in their states that restricted them from providing broadband Internet service, on their own or through a partnership, to neighboring towns. The F.C.C.’s decision would have implications beyond those cities, as other municipalities—from small towns to cities like Austin, Texas, and Provo, Utah, both of which have built networks in partnership with Google—are increasingly looking to build their own broadband systems, often using fibre-optic cables that can deliver Internet at much faster rates than the traditional broadband service typically offered by cable companies.","460","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/fcc-municipal-broadband-ruling-matters-net-neutrality"
"Currently, some twenty states ban or restrict municipal broadband. In certain states, these laws have been influenced by lobbying from traditional Internet providers, though lawmakers worry, too, that if local broadband systems fail, taxpayers will be forced to bear the cost of wasted investment. There have been high-profile failures in the past—or, at least, cases in which the investment hasn’t yet proven worthwhile.","461","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/fcc-municipal-broadband-ruling-matters-net-neutrality"
"With respect to the case before the F.C.C., Tennessee lets local electrical providers add telecommunications services such as cable and Internet anywhere in the state, but they’re allowed to offer the services only in places covered by their electrical system. In Chattanooga, this meant that the nonprofit, city-owned electricity provider, E.P.B., which provided high-speed Internet to the town’s residents, wasn’t allowed to do the same in some nearby places. North Carolina also allows local broadband, but imposes so many conditions on how it can be provided that Wilson, a small town an hour east of Raleigh, was precluded from expanding its broadband service into neighboring counties.","462","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/fcc-municipal-broadband-ruling-matters-net-neutrality"
"For some time, American cities haven’t been sure whether they could get around state-level restrictions like these. But in the past couple of years, there have been some hints that the F.C.C. might be able to help. The basis for this hope is a relatively obscure clause in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, known as Section 706, which deems that the commission should regularly look into “whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion.” It adds, “If the Commission’s determination is negative, it shall take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market.”","463","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/fcc-municipal-broadband-ruling-matters-net-neutrality"
"Recently, Wheeler has been invoking this concept to make the case that state restrictions on how localities can provide Internet service are exactly the sort of “barriers” that the F.C.C. is meant to remove. And on Thursday, he seemed to relish discussing the issue—his opinion on the subject has been much clearer, in the past several months, than on net neutrality, where he has been criticized for flip-flopping. He described what he considers “irrefutable truths” when it comes to broadband: “One is, you can’t say that you’re for broadband and then turn around and endorse limits on who can offer it. Another is that you can’t say, ‘I want to follow the explicit instructions of Congress to ‘remove barriers’… to infrastructure investment, but endorse barriers on infrastructure investment. I think, as they say in North Carolina, that dog don’t hunt. You can’t say you’re for competition but deny local elected officials the right to offer competitive choices.” He went on to argue that local business and residents were suffering the consequences of restrictive state laws. Finally, before moving on to the net-neutrality issue, he moved that the F.C.C. preëmpt the state laws in Tennessee and North Carolina. The other Democrats agreed with him, and the plan passed, as expected, by a vote of three to two. (Later, the commission voted in favor of net neutrality by the same margin.)","464","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/fcc-municipal-broadband-ruling-matters-net-neutrality"
"To those who support the growth of municipal broadband, the decision seemed eminently just. Some of the areas around Chattanooga and Wilson don’t have broadband Internet access at all, or else it exists only at low speeds; parents report driving their children to local churches or to McDonald’s so they can get online and finish homework assignments. Such efforts, proponents argue, demonstrate that, although the Internet may once have been a luxury, these days it’s a form of infrastructure, not dissimilar to water pipes or roads—and that towns lacking reliable access to it risk falling behind. “Why should it be the decision of Comcast or any company that the infrastructure that they happen to own in a community is good enough?” Joanne Hovis, the C.E.O. of the Coalition for Local Internet Choice, a group of businesses, cities, and others, told me. “Why shouldn’t a community be able to say, ‘We will work with another provider or work ourselves to be able to provide better infrastructure’?”","465","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/fcc-municipal-broadband-ruling-matters-net-neutrality"
"There is a straightforward answer to this question: according to federal law, states generally have the authority to write laws governing what their cities can or can’t do. The issues at hand are where the limits to that authority should be drawn, and where the F.C.C.’s jurisdiction begins and ends. With the decision, those questions are likely (as with the net-neutrality issue) to end up in the courts. The executive director of the National Conference of State Legislatures, William Pound, suggested in a press release on Thursday that the F.C.C. decision overstepped the commission’s bounds. He said that his organization “takes the preemption of states very seriously and will continue to pursue our options to ensure that any action taken by the FCC on municipal broadband networks are overturned by the courts.” Walter McCormick, the president of the United States Telecom Association, a trade group whose board members include executives from A.T. & T. and CenturyLink, said the vote “is a distraction from the hard work of improving the regulatory climate for all broadband providers to invest in new and improved infrastructure, and serves little purpose given the likelihood that it will be overturned by the courts.”","466","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/fcc-municipal-broadband-ruling-matters-net-neutrality"
"The likelihood of legal action risks slowing plans for expansion, in the short term. David Wade, the chief operating officer at E.P.B. in Chattanooga, who was born and raised in a nearby suburb, told me he doesn’t know yet how the decision will affect E.P.B.’s plans. “There are quite a few legal hurdles,” he acknowledged. But he told me he believed it was important for E.P.B. to pursue. When he was growing up, he said, he and his friends played in the streets—games like Capture the Flag and Kick the Can. Now he lives in Chattanooga, and when his granddaughters come over, they often spend their time playing games or watching videos on Internet-connected devices. Not far from Chattanooga, though, he said, “There are some areas that are really close to us that have no provider today. We’d like to provide service there as soon as possible.”","467","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/fcc-municipal-broadband-ruling-matters-net-neutrality"
"The F.C.C.’s ruling could also embolden cities in other states to move forward with their own broadband plans, but they will have to proceed carefully. The commission has now staked out its authority to overrule laws in those states that allow municipal broadband but employ restrictions. In cases where states have wholesale bans on municipal broadband, however, it could be tougher for the F.C.C. to supersede the principle of state sovereignty. In other words, in the states with the most severe restrictions on municipal broadband, the F.C.C. may, ironically, have less jurisdiction—or even none at all.","468","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/fcc-municipal-broadband-ruling-matters-net-neutrality"
"“We love Mississippi,” Jocelyn Pritchett wrote in a blog last month. “The people in this state are generous, kind and loving, and it’s a great place to raise a family.” No doubt that’s true, except that Mississippi refused to acknowledge that Pritchett, a civil engineer, was a married woman. In 2013, in Maine, she had wed Carla Webb, with whom she is raising a six-year-old girl and a two-year-old boy. Both women were born in Mississippi and live there, but the law in their home state said that only one of them had parental rights, so Pritchett and Webb, along with another couple, Andrea Sanders and Rebecca Bickett, the mothers of twin toddler boys, filed suit. In November, Judge Carlton Reeves heard the case in the United States Courthouse in Jackson. It was an unusually chilly day—down to thirty-six degrees—and one lawyer made a joke that turned on the possibility of certain regions freezing over. He said, “Your Honor, many have said that before a court in Mississippi seriously considered same-sex marriage it would be a cold day. It’s a cold day.”","469","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/05/southern-honeymoon"
"It’s been a year and a half since the Supreme Court declared, in United States v. Windsor, that the Defense of Marriage Act—which prevented the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, even if individual states did—violated the Constitution. The decision did not assert a larger constitutional right to marriage, but that didn’t stop lower-court judges from finding one in its reasoning. In October, the Court declined to hear challenges to such rulings from three circuits, thus bringing the number of marriage-equality states to thirty-five—including, remarkably, South Carolina. In November, however, the Sixth Circuit upheld bans in four states, and appeals to that decision may force the Court to finally rule in 2015 on whether same-sex couples in all fifty states have a constitutional right to marry.","470","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/05/southern-honeymoon"
"At this point, the marriage-equality map looks essentially like a CNN projection for a Democratic electoral landslide, with New England and the mid-Atlantic states, plus a good part of the Midwest, the Southwest, the lower Rockies, and the West Coast. But gays and lesbians can also wed in states that the Democrats can only dream of carrying: Utah (after a lawsuit brought by three couples, one of whom runs a hummus business in Salt Lake City, which sells “hummusexual” T-shirts) and Oklahoma (where two Tulsa women filed a suit a decade ago). The final fortress, with the exception of South Carolina, is the Deep South. That is where the last legal battles are likely to be fought, and it is precisely the sort of place that gay-marriage opponents say shouldn’t be rushed by the courts, because it’s “not ready.”","471","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/05/southern-honeymoon"
"Judge Jeffrey Sutton, who wrote the opinion for the Sixth Circuit, took up the not-ready argument, asking, “Who decides?” He meant the courts or the states, acting through their legislatures or ballot initiatives, which he called, echoing old states-rights arguments, “less expedient, but usually reliable.” He suggested that gays and lesbians, rather than fighting in a courtroom, would find it more rewarding to gradually win over “heads and hearts” in their communities and enjoy “earned victories” at the polls. The plaintiffs in the 1967 Supreme Court decision Loving v. Virginia would likely have disagreed. That decision struck down laws banning interracial marriage in sixteen states—many of them the states that currently ban gay marriage.","472","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/05/southern-honeymoon"
"One response to Judge Sutton’s question is that the courts are where the least powerful and the least accepted members of society can seek recourse. Mississippi has been a hard place for gays and lesbians: in 2004, the state’s marriage ban was approved by eighty-six per cent of voters. Recent polls indicate that the opposition has moderated; indeed, Southern traditionalism may make cases that involve families resonate all the more. (According to the Williams Institute, at the U.C.L.A. law school, seventeen per cent of same-sex couples in New York are raising children. In Mississippi, twenty-six per cent are.) But it takes real obstinacy to tell couples who can’t legally share custody of their kids that it would be best for all concerned if they waited until they were more popular.","473","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/05/southern-honeymoon"
"Judge Reeves, who heard the Mississippi case, graduated from Jackson State, a historically black college. When the lawyers for the state talked about the benefits of “orderly” change, not rushed by the courts, Reeves interrupted them. Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954 and, he said, “in Mississippi, it was 1970 before my first-grade class was integrated.” He then asked the lawyers to explain the “rational basis” for denying couples the right to marry—and their children the right to married parents—adding, “All a child wants is to be loved. They don’t care by whom or what.”","474","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/05/southern-honeymoon"
"The courts are not simply a check on the democratic process but a part of it. Across the country, men and women have filed declarations, testified, gone to trial, and appealed. If voting is an act of participatory democracy, so are those actions. Southerners with cases pending include a widow in Georgia, who doesn’t want her wife’s death certificate to bear a box checked “never married,” and two female Atlanta police officers, who want to be sure that each is recognized as a spouse and a parent in case one is killed in the line of duty.","475","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/05/southern-honeymoon"
"The great achievement of Windsor has been to force states to explain why same-sex couples should be treated differently. For lack of any logical argument, some opponents make the “irresponsible procreation” case, which holds, perplexingly, that marriage should be reserved for a man and a woman because only they can have sex that results in accidental pregnancy. As Judge Richard Posner has written, “Heterosexuals get drunk and pregnant, producing unwanted children; their reward is to be allowed to marry. Homosexual couples do not produce unwanted children; their reward is to be denied the right to marry. Go figure.”","476","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/05/southern-honeymoon"
"The lawyers in Judge Reeves’ s courtroom tried that argument, too. It didn’t work. Two days before Thanksgiving, Reeves ruled for the plaintiffs, writing,“ ‘Tradition’ will not suffice to uphold Mississippi’s marriage ban.” He cited the “overlapping” record of discrimination in America. (Bayard Rustin’s name appears in the decision twenty times.) “Gay and lesbian citizens cannot be subjected to such second-class citizenship,” he wrote. Reeves granted a stay, pending an appeal to the Fifth Circuit, to be argued on January 9th, when the Mississippi case will be joined with others from Texas and Louisiana. Otherwise, he saw no reason to wait. ♦","477","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/05/southern-honeymoon"
"The funeral of Mario Cuomo, the fifty-second governor of New York, will take place on Tuesday, at St. Ignatius Loyola Church, on Park Avenue. Since his death last week, at the age of eighty-two, many touching remembrances of Cuomo have been published (including three on this site, from Ken Auletta, Philip Gourevitch, and Elizabeth Kolbert). If a politician’s standing in history were based on the testimonies of the reporters who covered him, Cuomo’s reputation would be assured, safe to say. Even when he was berating journalists in early-morning phone calls, his intelligence, down-to-earth manner, and patent humanity won them over.","January 5, 2015","478","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"
"But, after all the recollections and eulogies are done, what, if anything, will be Cuomo’s legacy? Once the great progressive hope of the Democratic Party, he ultimately failed to defy Enoch Powell’s famous dictum that “all political lives, unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture, end in failure.” In 1994, on seeking a fourth term as governor, he was ignominiously drummed out of Albany and replaced by the upstate Republican George Pataki, whom he regarded as a pygmy. Looking back, it is difficult to point to a single achievement that defined Cuomo’s three terms in office. One of the many articles published in the Times after his death suggested that his own son Andrew Cuomo, who has just been reëlected to a second term as governor, regarded him as “a more accomplished as a speech-giver than as a governor.”","479","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"

"Et tu, Andrew? Here in his home town, Mario Cuomo will inevitably be remembered along with the former mayor Ed Koch, his longtime antagonist, who died in February, 2013, as part of a double act that dominated New York politics for almost two decades. Like Abbott and Costello, though Cuomo and Koch barely spoke for long stretches they could never really escape each other. Somehow, during the later stages of New York’s gothic period, with crime rampaging, residents fleeing, and deficits enduring, the pair helped keep things together while also embodying some of the spirit of endurance, optimism, and benevolence that animates New York’s sense of itself. (To be sure, Hugh Carey, Cuomo’s predecessor as governor, also deserves a good deal of credit; he helped manage New York through the great fiscal crisis of the late nineteen-seventies.)","481","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"
"Koch, a New York parochialist from his toenails to his bald dome, would surely rest content with being lionized on his home turf. But Cuomo, the erudite son of Italian immigrants who operated a grocery store in the South Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, had higher aspirations—or so it seemed when you listened to his speeches. If not exactly a philosopher king, he was a politician with a broad, progressive vision. Even in the moments when he departed from that vision—for example, trimming spending to tackle the deficit or building prisons to hold New York’s swelling population of convicted felons—he never gave up on it; at least, not in his own mind.","482","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"
"Cuomo’s most famous speech, of course, is the one that he delivered at the 1984 Democratic Convention, in San Francisco, in which he addressed Ronald Reagan directly, saying, “Mr. President, you ought to know that this nation is more ‘A Tale of Two Cities’ than it is just ‘a shining city on a hill.’ ” The speech helped generate a decade of fevered speculation about whether Cuomo would run for President. But he had laid down his ideological marker the previous year, 1983, in his inaugural speech as governor, which included this defining passage:","483","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"
"As Cuomo readily pointed out, his governing philosophy, which he described as “progressive pragmatism,” wasn’t new, or even particularly partisan. It was the philosophy of Democrats like Franklin D. Roosevelt, Robert Wagner, and Hugh Carey, but also of Fiorello LaGuardia, John Lindsay, and Nelson Rockefeller, three liberal Republicans. (Lindsay eventually became a Democrat; LaGuardia and Rockefeller didn’t.)* “For more than fifty years, without dramatic deviation, whatever Party has been in power, New York has proven that government can be a positive force for good,” Cuomo reminded his audience that night in 1983.","484","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"
"What is noteworthy about Cuomo’s progressivism, and what will insure his place in the history books, is the moral urgency and scholastic intensity with which he defended and articulated it. In an era when Ronald Reagan was busy lambasting welfare moms, Keynesian economics was on the defensive, and many ambitious young politicians in his Cuomo’s Party were depicting themselves as “New Democrats” who had discovered the virtues of low taxes and free enterprise, Cuomo spoke up for the struggling and the excluded. In his 1984 convention speech, for example, though it was his reference to Dickens’s 1859 novel that stole the headlines, it was the paragraphs leading up to that bon mot which gave Cuomo’s message its ageless appeal:","485","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"
"To be sure, these were only words. In a political environment where, to this day, capital is mobile and many ordinary voters balk at paying higher taxes, Cuomo wasn’t immune to the political currents—sometimes they swept him along. During his twelve years in Albany, he increased state spending on things like education and health care, but he also engaged in a big prison-building program and cut taxes on several occasions, usually at the prodding of Republicans in the legislature. (His son Andrew has gone further in the direction of the New Democrats, capping property taxes and proposing budget cuts.) And, after the voters turfed him out, the liberal lion moved to Sutton Place, where he took up his long-abandoned law career, as he put it, “representing wealthy people, trying to make them wealthier.”","486","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"
"Cuomo wasn’t a saint, nor was he a great builder or policy innovator. But if he didn’t create a new template for progressives he stood up doggedly for the old one, which included many things—such as creating anti-poverty programs and investing in public infrastructure—that had fallen out of fashion. And this in itself was a historic achievement. Milton Friedman once remarked that the role of economists is to “develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.” Cuomo was no economist, but he helped to preserve a great political tradition that goes back to the New Deal and even beyond, to the Progressive era. Today, with issues of inequality and social exclusion once again dominating the political agenda, and with a mayor in City Hall who got there, in part, by borrowing his line about “Two Cities,” Cuomo’s legacy is secure.","487","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"

"Last month, Saudi Arabia abruptly cut ties with Sweden, recalling its ambassador and announcing that it would issue no new visas to Swedish business travelers. The cause, according to Saudi Arabia, was some remarks made by Margot Wallström, the foreign minister of Sweden.","April 15, 2015","489","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Wallström, a sixty-year-old Social Democrat who has spent almost her entire career in politics, was appointed foreign minister last fall, when Prime Minister Stefan Löfven took office. She immediately announced that she intended to pursue a feminist foreign policy and went on to explain, in a talk in the U.S., that “striving toward gender equality is not only a goal in itself but also a precondition for achieving our wider foreign, development, and security-policy objectives.”","490","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"On February 11th, Wallström, speaking before the Swedish parliament, stated what may appear to be a few facts about Saudi Arabia: she said that women are not allowed to drive, that their human rights are violated, and that the country is a dictatorship in which the royal family has absolute power. Like representatives of several other European countries, she also criticized the public flogging of the blogger Raif Badawi and later called it “medieval.”","491","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Wallström, whose government recognized the State of Palestine last year, had been asked to deliver a speech at an Arab League summit in Cairo in late March, but Saudi Arabia intervened, and Wallström was disinvited. On March 9th, Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador to Sweden, saying that Wallström had “unacceptably interfered” in the country’s internal affairs. The United Arab Emirates followed suit a week later. Due to Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic wrangling, Wallström was also condemned by the Gulf Cooperation Council (which consists of Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the U.A.E.), The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which includes fifty-seven countries, and the Arab League itself. Finally, Saudi Arabia leveled a more serious charge against Wallström: that by commenting on the punishment of public flogging, the Swedish foreign minister had criticized Sharia law and Islam.","492","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"In the midst of an escalating diplomatic crisis, the Swedish government was due to decide on another issue that concerned Saudi Arabia, a very sticky one. Sweden is not only one of Europe’s largest per-capita donors of foreign aid (its foreign ministry likes to describe the nation as “a humanitarian superpower”) but also one of its largest per-capita arms exporters. Even with strict laws meant to prevent exports to countries involved in violent conflicts or suspected of committing human-rights offenses, some loopholes made it possible for Sweden to retain Saudi Arabia as a long-standing and lucrative arms client. In recent years, though, the relationship became increasingly uncomfortable for Swedish public officials; in 2012, the defense minister was forced to resign when public radio revealed a secret plan to build a weapons plant in Saudi Arabia.","493","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Sweden’s Social Democrats have historically taken a pragmatic view of the government-subsidized arms industry and its often-opaque dealings abroad. But when a new, left coalition government came to power last fall, its Green Party members insisted that the relationship with Saudi Arabia conflicted with Sweden’s values, as well as with the image it wants to project abroad. Political commentators on both the left and right asked the obvious question: How did providing arms to a country that subjugates women fit with the bold idea of a “feminist foreign policy?” The day after Wallström was supposed to have appeared in Cairo, on March 10th, the government announced its decision not to renew a bilateral arms agreement with Saudi Arabia. No official explanation followed, but the subtext was clear both in Sweden and to Riyadh (which had likely received some advance notice): Saudi Arabia was no longer viewed as an acceptable buyer of Swedish weapons.","494","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"This was Wallström’s “feminist foreign policy” in practice, and it did not sit well with some of Sweden’s most powerful industrialists, who stood to lose significant income from a break in relations with Saudi Arabia. It seems likely that the government also became concerned about sparking a wider conflict with the Arab world. One week later, a delegation of Swedish officials travelled to Riyadh, carrying letters from Prime Minister Stefan Löfven and King Carl XVI Gustaf, to try to soften relations, explaining that Wallström had not intended to criticize Islam and offering official regrets for any misunderstanding. The Saudi ambassador to Sweden is now set to be reinstated. Wallström’s political opponents came down hard on what they saw as a clumsy performance. Still, the Swedish foreign minister refused to back down, referring only to a misunderstanding, and stressing that no apology for her specific remarks had been, or would be, issued.","495","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"When Wallström announced her feminist foreign policy last fall, she was met with a few smirks and some confusion even within her own diplomatic corps. How would this benefit, rather than just complicate, Sweden’s relations with the rest of the world? Robert Egnell, a visiting professor at the Georgetown Security Studies Program and an advisor to the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace, and Security, explained that, to foreign-policy traditionalists, “a feminist perspective would be idealistic, naïve—and potentially even dangerous—in the realpolitik power struggles between nations.” Within the diplomatic community, where words are carefully chosen so as not to offend, “feminism” is usually avoided, as it risks being perceived as inflammatory and indicative of a stand against men.","496","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"“If the term bothers you, you can call it gender equality,” Wallström told me in a telephone interview in late March, when I asked if it would have been more strategic to choose another word for what she seeks to achieve. “I think feminism is a good term,” she said. “It’s about standing against the systematic and global subordination of women.”","497","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Wallström, who was formerly a European Union commissioner, also served as the first United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. She told me that, in that role, she observed how often crimes against women in conflict are overlooked or ignored, how foreign aid routinely fails to take into account the needs of women and girls, and how seldom women are allowed to participate in peace negotiations. Those experiences stuck with her—as did the often all-male composition of U.N. delegations assigned to solve conflicts. A decade after the U.N. adopted Security Council Resolution 1325, which speaks to the necessity of including women in peace agreements, ninety-seven per cent of military peacekeepers are still men, and less than one in ten participants in peace negotiations are women.","498","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Like Hillary Clinton, who has often argued that “women’s rights are human rights,” Wallström has embraced the concept of “smart power” as articulated by the American political scientist Joseph Nye: that is, when a country invests in solving global-scale problems, such as health and economic development it will benefit that country in the end. For example, as one of the European countries receiving the most Syrian asylum seekers, Sweden would do well to address refugee issues beyond its borders. Women’s rights is another such global issue, and Wallström has found common ground on the topic with some foreign colleagues, from across the political spectrum, such as the U.K.’s First Secretary of State William Hague, from the Conservative party, who, during his tenure as Foreign Secretary, stated that “the full social, economic, and political empowerment of women is the great strategic prize of the twenty-first century.”","499","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Wallström also cites a growing body of research showing that women’s security is directly related to both national and international security. In the 2012 book “Sex and World Peace” a team of four researchers (Valerie M. Hudson, Bonnie Ballif-Spanvill, Mary Caprioli, and Chad F. Emmett) present data indicating that the more violent a state and its citizens are toward women, the more violent that state is likely to be over all, both internally and in its dealings with outside world. “In fact, the very best predictor of a state’s peacefulness is not its level of wealth, its level of democracy, or its ethno-religious identity; the best predictor of a state’s peacefulness is how well its women are treated,” Hudson wrote in a piece for Foreign Policy.","500","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Politicians rarely see women’s rights as having a direct impact on problems of war and peace. But according to this school of thought, a foreign policy that strives to address global gender inequity should in fact be on the agenda of any politician concerned with global security. Particularly at a time when the overwhelmingly male foreign-policy establishment, including international organizations such as the United Nations, appears to have run out of ideas for how to manage or even approach violent conflicts, a more gendered perspective on foreign affairs may in fact be a pragmatic strategy. The authors of “Sex and World Peace” go so far as to suggest that, in the future, “the clash of civilizations” will be based not on ethnic and political differences, but rather on beliefs about gender.","501","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Sweden hardly constitutes a threat to anyone, but Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic show of force against the small Scandinavian country may indicate that it would prefer for Wallström’s ideas not to spread beyond Stockholm. As for other countries, they likely will not want to follow Sweden’s example of angering the world’s largest oil exporter and one of the most important players in the Middle East. But there is an obvious double standard in how Western leaders stress the importance of both human rights and women’s rights but mostly fall silent on these issues as soon as immediate economic interests and political alliances are at stake.","502","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Wallström plans to continue her experiment of not only championing women’s rights but also putting actual policy behind them, calculating, presumably, that Sweden can afford to do this. Most recently, she has proposed that the E.U. appoint a special representative for women’s issues.","503","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"“It’s time to become a little braver in foreign policy,” Wallström told me. “Does anyone seriously mean that Sweden should apologize for what we say about democracy and human rights? We’re not backing down from that.”","504","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"A year ago, on a bleak and chilly February morning, North Carolina’s Forward Together movement, a coalition of progressive groups with broad support among liberal-minded Carolinians, held its eighth-annual rally at the state capitol in Raleigh. The movement had begun drawing national attention, and the march through downtown was widely called the largest civil-rights gathering in the South since the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery; estimates put between fifty thousand and eighty thousand people there.","February 18, 2015","505","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"","506","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"At the time, a sense of momentum gripped Forward Together, which had swollen from small vigils of conscience to something not seen for decades—a sweeping alliance of the religious and the secular, attached to no candidate and not beholden to a major party, with members from far outside the usual-suspects list of professional and recreational full-time citizens. The main event was Moral Mondays, a weekly vigil at the capitol building that grew from dozens of participants to thousands after a new Republican governor, Pat McCrory, and the state legislature marched through abortion restrictions, limits on voting, a rejection of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, environmental rollbacks, and such symbolic enormities as the repeal of the Racial Justice Act, a law that commuted the death penalty to life without parole when race had influenced the original sentence. Those first rallies were often hurried in order to finish ahead of thunderstorms, which form over the Blue Ridge Mountains, two hours to the west, and sweep across the Piedmont toward the piney coastal plane that runs from Raleigh to the coast.","507","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"At this time last year, the midterm elections were coming up, and Forward Together planned to send organizers into every county in the state, to register tens of thousands of new voters and turn the election. The movement was particularly focussed on defeating Thom Tillis, the Senate candidate who, as speaker of North Carolina’s House of Representatives, was the figure most associated with the recent spate of conservative legislation. The organizing and registration drives happened; the victories didn’t. Instead, Tillis narrowly but decisively beat the sitting Democratic Senator, Kay Hagan. Republicans kept their nearly two-to-one advantage in the state legislature and picked up a seat in the House of Representatives.","508","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"Forward Together’s leaders had explanations, almost too many. North Carolina’s political map is a triumph of gerrymandering: the Republicans’ lock on the state legislature rests on a mere fifty-five per cent of votes, and the same goes for their ten-to-three advantage in the federal house. After two Obama campaigns, there are few unregistered voters waiting to be reached and cajoled to the polls. New laws cutting back on early voting and eliminating same-day registration may have inhibited students and black voters. Everyone knows that midterms are hard on Democrats, with a baseline electorate that is older and whiter than during Presidential contests.","509","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"But, as the political cliché has it, the person explaining is probably not winning. The Forward Together activists tried and lost. Last November, disappointment and exhaustion were palpable in liberal towns like Durham and Chapel Hill. What else was there to do?","510","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"This year’s rally, held on Valentine’s Day, under one of the clear skies that locals describe as tarheel blue, was visibly smaller, though other marchers and I took more than an hour to weave through six long blocks. The Reverend William Barber, a North Carolinian child of civil-rights activists who earned a master’s degree at Duke’s divinity school, and who has been the movement’s central figure since he launched the annual march, in 2007, was full of energy. The marchers were into it, and were as visibly diverse as they have been all along. There were students and other young people, many retirees, and plenty of people between them in age. The crowd looked like North Carolina, which is about sixty-five per cent white, twenty-two per cent black, and nine per cent Latino. All the same, there was a quieter energy and a sense of settling in for a long game, along with hints of uncertainty about what a long game means, these days, for a progressive movement in the South.","511","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"Maybe to their credit, the speakers at this post-defeat rally were not doing much explaining. Instead, they—and, above all, Reverend Barber—doubled down on rhetoric that was unmistakably Southern, even Carolinian, and deeply rooted in the region’s history.","512","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"The first note that strikes the ear at these events is a religious one. In North Carolina, the N.A.A.C.P. has a core of clergymen (mainly, in fact, men) at the heart of its leadership. The Prophet Ezekiel and John the Revelator are contemporaries and companions in Reverend Barber’s addresses. No oration is complete without a call for justice to roll down like a mighty stream. Speakers from outside the N.A.A.C.P. are often other ministers or rabbis. Although there is always a perfunctory reference to “those who have no faith but believe in a moral universe,” or some similarly awkward phrase of inclusion, the movement’s claims are transcendent, and that transcendence is rooted in the clapboard churches and red-clay roads of a devout region with few other civic institutions. (Organized labor is always present and name-checked, but North Carolina has long had the lowest rate of union membership in the country.)","513","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"The second attribute of the rhetoric at Moral Mondays rallies is constitutional. The Declaration of Independence and North Carolina’s 1868 Reconstruction constitution are constant reference points, for their announcement of the “self-evident” truth that all men are created equal. In American political discourse, the Constitution stands for principles whose authority outruns and outlives all partisan divisions. If the Constitution says it, it must be good and true; if it is good, it must be in the Constitution. At this year’s rally, one speaker used her brief time to argue that denying Medicaid coverage and labor-organizing rights violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of “equal protection of the laws,” not a doctrinally sound position but part of a long tradition of calling on constitutional principles to dignify political claims. Here, too, the movement’s claims to authority are transcendent, though only to an earthly, political transcendence.","514","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"The third theme that’s often invoked at the rallies is also the most regional: it is an appeal to a fraught local history. Reconstruction was a hurricane in North Carolina. Free blacks helped to write the 1868 state constitution, which established, at least notionally, equal and universal citizenship. For a time, black Republicans represented the state in Washington, and in alliance with mainly white Populists they held racist Democrats at bay and governed the state. Then, in 1898, a set of young Democrats staged an electoral upset that came to be called Redemption. They ran a well-financed, nakedly race-baiting statewide campaign, and launched an effort of extra-legal racial intimidation and terror to keep black voters from the polls. In Wilmington, a major coastal town whose officials were not up for election that year, the Redeemers drove a Republican government from office with a paramilitary force of five hundred armed men, who killed between ten and twenty blacks in a day of fighting. When the ballots were counted and the blood had dried, North Carolina had an overtly white-supremacist government that quickly consolidated its power, writing literacy tests for voters into the constitution and largely keeping blacks out of office until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.","515","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"In Barber’s telling, the Moral Mondays movement is trying to establish a Third Reconstruction: a new alliance of black voters with working-class whites, Latinos, other immigrants, and liberal élites to meld the formal equality of the civil-rights era (the Second Reconstruction) with economic opportunity and fairness. The state legislature, on the other hand, is hellbent on a Second Redemption, rolling back the right to vote and undercutting democratic representation through gerrymandering. Of course, these interpretations of history, morality, and constitutionality are not simply true or false. They are the kinds of things that become true when people start living as if they were.","516","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"I went to jail for the first time—not for long at all, and not in hard conditions—in June, 2013, for an act of peaceful civil disobedience that the Forward Together leadership had asked of its supporters. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggested that upward of a thousand North Carolinians would die that year because the state had refused the Medicaid expansion. I felt the need to amplify my objection in a way that a vote, an op-ed, or a political donation (at least one that an ordinary person can afford) doesn’t allow. Civil disobedience is the American idiom for that kind of objection, a respectful but emphatic way of raising the stakes.","517","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"As I presented my wrists for the police cuffs, my mind bristled with misgivings. I wasn’t comfortable with the movement’s religious language, which sometimes slid into a suggestion that the legislature was sinful and illegitimate. It troubled me to consider that the Tea Party legislators inside the building where we were protesting were equally sure that God, the Constitution, and history were on their side. I disliked the way that putting myself silently on the line for a movement indicated that I identified with it totally, when I could have ginned up a dozen demurrals just from the speeches I had heard that day. I felt, as I did at this year’s “march for love and justice,” that, really, justice would be enough. Love sounds good, but I’m not at all sure what it means in a political community, or whether I would like it there.","518","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"Then again, high-minded principles and dry realism have never been enough. American democracy depends on its austere legalists and cautious pragmatists, but also on those like Walt Whitman, an ecstatic prophet of democratic community as a kind of mystery and joy, and Frederick Douglass, who turned slave revolt into a mode of constitutional interpretation. Douglass, who claimed February 14, 1818, as his birthday, was the hero of Barber’s Valentine’s Day address this year: “A righteous troubler of America,” he was called. There is also something of Whitman’s sensually democratic mood in Barber, for whom words seem to carry a blend of idea and sensation. A feeling of being in something together is a great part of what the movement gives to its members—often in challenging ways, as gay activists end up literally side by side with traditional churchgoers. The great changes of the past sixty years—civil rights, feminism, and gay rights—have depended on hard-nosed reforms, but they are also unimaginable without new modes of sympathy and moral imagination, new ways of gaining strength from being together.","519","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"Of course, those of us who attend these rallies go home to fragmented worlds. Some of us will see one another on campus and at the food co-op. Others will meet at church, but I won’t see them—nor will most of the white Episcopalians see the black Baptists, or vice-versa. Without common institutions, such as the unions we don’t have here, the urban spaces we mostly lack, and the integrated neighborhoods that are too few and far between, an episodic movement may be too thin and low-intensity to change political sensibility. If it only mobilizes what is already there, last November’s losses suggest that it will not be enough.","520","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"With more than nineteen months until the 2016 Presidential election, you’ll forgive me if I take a day off from wiped servers, efforts to woo evangelical Christians, and Bush-family history in order to focus on an election that is less than six weeks away and, at this stage, much more thrilling. Not only is the contest perilously close, it has more story lines than an episode of “Downton Abbey.”","March 30, 2015","521","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/an-exciting-election-beckons-in-the-u-k"
"I’m referring to the British general election, scheduled for May 7th, in which the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition that has run the country since May, 2010, will face the voters. The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are contesting the election as two separate parties, as are the opposition Labour Party and three smaller parties: the pro-independence Scottish National Party (S.N.P.), the anti-immigration U.K. Independence Party (UKIP), and the Green Party. After an initial television debate last week, featuring the Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron, and Labour’s leader, Ed Miliband, Labour moved ahead in one closely watched poll, generating alarm in some parts of the Conservative Party. But there still seems to be little chance that either major party will win enough votes to form a new government by itself. Indeed, with the smaller parties all holding significant support, the outcome of this election is more uncertain than any in recent British history.","522","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/an-exciting-election-beckons-in-the-u-k"
"These circumstances should offer some catnip for American political junkies, and there’s a local angle, too: David Axelrod, President Obama’s longtime political strategist, is advising Labour, while Jim Messina, who managed Obama’s reëlection campaign, in 2012, is advising the Conservatives. But the May 7th vote also has broader significance. The Conservatives have promised that, if they are reëlected, they will continue with their controversial austerity program, aiming to reduce the size of the British state, relative to G.D.P., back to levels not seen since the Second World War. As in its first term, the government has promised to focus its spending cuts on welfare programs. The Labour Party, by contrast, has pledged to relax austerity, at least somewhat, and to focus on the issues of income stagnation and inequality. The outcome of the election will therefore offer some indication of whether the shift toward conservatism that much of Europe experienced in the wake of the Great Recession was a temporary reaction to hard times, or something deeper and more disturbing.","523","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/an-exciting-election-beckons-in-the-u-k"
"The vote will also have important implications for the ancient British political system, which is based on first-past-the-post races in individual parliamentary constituencies, and which exhibits a clear bias against smaller parties. If the S.N.P., UKIP, and the Greens do well, the pressure for constitutional reform may become unstoppable. A shift toward proportional representation, and more devolution of power to Scotland and other regions, may result.","524","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/an-exciting-election-beckons-in-the-u-k"
"Going into last week’s television debate, the Conservatives and Labour were level-pegging in the polls, and the consensus was that Cameron and his colleagues were well-positioned. On the crucial question of managing the economy, voters were indicating that they trusted the Conservatives more than Labour. And, in terms of personal approval ratings, Cameron was running well ahead of Miliband, a reserved and untested forty-five-year-old who has been subjected to merciless attacks by the Tory media. In recent months, he has been dismissed as an idiot (“wally”) and a dangerous left-winger (“Red Ed”), as well as someone who can’t properly eat a bacon sandwich.","525","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/an-exciting-election-beckons-in-the-u-k"
"On this occasion, though, the low expectations surrounding Miliband played to his advantage. The television debate wasn’t so much a debate as an extended grilling at the hands of Jeremy Paxman, a veteran television presenter whose inquisitorial techniques have been known to make seasoned politicians tremble.* Cameron, during his turn at being subjected to the “Paxo treatment,” seemed nervous and, at times, unsure of himself. Miliband also had a few awkward moments, but he held up pretty well, and he fired off the most memorable line of the night, asserting, “Hell, yes. I’m tough enough to be P.M.”","526","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/an-exciting-election-beckons-in-the-u-k"
"Some voters appear to have been pleasantly surprised to learn that Miliband is an articulate fellow who is capable of defending himself, and who wants to move the country in a different direction. As the Labour Party quickly rushed out T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan “HELL YES I’M VOTING LABOUR,” an opinion poll in the Sunday Times showed Labour opening up a four-point lead—thirty-six per cent to thirty-two per cent—over the Conservatives. This would be enough to give Labour about sixty more seats than the Conservatives in the new Parliament, but not quite an over-all majority, experts reckoned.

Moving to quash rumors that he was already thinking about retiring to his country house in Oxfordshire, Cameron also promised to serve a full five-year term if he wins, saying that he wanted to “see the job through.” Miliband, meanwhile, launched Labour’s business manifesto, pledging to keep Britain inside the European Union and describing the Conservatives’ plan to hold a referendum on E.U. membership (a position it adopted in response to by-election gains by UKIP) as “a clear and present danger” to British jobs.","528","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/an-exciting-election-beckons-in-the-u-k"
"With the campaign now moving into full swing, it’s hard to predict what will happen. For the first time in a long time, Labour supporters are feeling encouraged, but some polls show the Conservatives retaining a narrow lead. The strength of the S.N.P. and the Greens, both of which are polling pretty well, complicates things on the center-left, just as the rise of UKIP complicates things on the right. The national polls, although interesting, don’t necessarily capture what is happening with closely contested seats, on which UKIP and the Greens are concentrating their efforts, or in Scotland, where the S.N.P., despite being on the losing side of the recent referendum on independence, is hoping to win at least thirty of the fifty-nine seats allocated to Scottish constituencies.

"“Our system is just not built for a scenario such as the one we have now: two strong parties polling in the low- to mid-thirties, with two others polling around ten per cent, or just under,” one well-connected Labour Party supporter told me in an e-mail. “The recent growth in the Green vote is also adding to the unpredictability and uncertainty. There will be all kinds of funny results on the night, although the iniquities of the electoral system help us (vis-à-vis the Tories) because a larger proportion of our MPs and target seats are in smaller constituencies. If we get the same percentage of the national vote as the Tories, we end up with about forty more seats than them. So it all hinges on the differential impact of the effect of the UKIP vote and whether, or, rather, to what extent the Lib-Dem vote holds up. We do not want a complete meltdown of the Lib-Dem vote and, actually, a stronger UKIP presence will also help us because—the theory goes—that hurts the Tories more than us, although there have been recent reports from Labour areas that they are now biting into our core vote.

"Back in 2011, the Texas economy was doing so well, and California’s so poorly, that the Democratic lieutenant governor of California, Gavin Newsom, travelled to Austin to seek advice from an unlikely mentor: the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry. When Newsom returned, he remarked, appreciatively, “They’re aggressive, we’re not. They know what they’re after, we don’t.”","January 8, 2015","533","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/california-bested-texas"
"Ten years earlier, in 2001, Texas’s G.D.P. was equal to about fifty-six per cent of California’s. By 2011, that figure had risen to sixty-seven per cent. After Newsom’s visit, the gap continued to narrow, and by 2013 it stood at seventy per cent. That year, Perry took out radio ads in California, telling business owners there, “Building a business is tough, but I hear building a business in California is next to impossible. This is Texas Governor Rick Perry, and I have a message for California businesses: Come check out Texas.”","534","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/california-bested-texas"
"California Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, dismissed the ad as “barely a fart,” but some observers assumed that he was only feigning nonchalance. By then, a narrative had been established about the states’ differing fortunes, thanks partly to Perry’s bid for the Republican Presidential nomination the previous year, during which he made much of the “Texas Miracle.” While California was struggling to recover from the recession, Texas was thriving. Along with faster G.D.P. growth, Texas boasted a much lower unemployment rate, and from 2009 to 2012 it was responsible for the most new business establishments in the U.S.—more than a fifth of the country-wide total—while California’s number fell. In October, 2013, Time magazine published a cover article by the economist Tyler Cowen proclaiming that Texas represented “America’s future”; the accompanying illustration showed all the fifty states rearranged, like puzzle pieces, into the shape of Texas. Commentators chalked up the state’s success to factors like affordable housing, a business-friendly regulatory environment, and the lack of a state income tax. By contrast, California’s top income-tax rate and its housing costs were among the highest in the nation, and its business regulations—particularly those having to do with the environment—were seen as especially onerous and costly.","535","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/california-bested-texas"
"These days, though, no one is talking about the lessons California should learn from Texas. California’s economy is improving, and its budget is finally balanced—partly because of budget cuts and a voter-approved tax hike in 2012, and partly because the stock-market boom has translated into more tax receipts from California’s wealthiest residents (the ones with those high income-tax rates). These changes happen to come as Texas, the nation’s biggest oil-producing state by far, is grappling with a collapse in oil prices, which has depressed the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil to under fifty dollars a barrel for the first time in more than five years. It will be several months before the government publishes figures on G.D.P. and business creation for the period coinciding with the drop in oil prices, but already there are signs of trouble. Michael Feroli, the chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in December, “We think Texas will, at least, have a rough 2015 ahead, and is at risk of slipping into a regional recession.” The Texas budget, too, could be hurt by lost oil and gas taxes.","536","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/california-bested-texas"
"Brown, who was sworn in on Monday for a second consecutive term as governor of California (his fourth, including a stint from the late seventies to the early eighties), must have enjoyed a moment of schadenfreude if he happened to scan the Wall Street Journal on his way to the inauguration. In an article on how the oil slump could hurt Texas, Jon Hilsenrath and his colleagues wrote, “Some Texans sobered by memories of past energy busts are bracing for a fall. The argument among economists and business leaders isn’t whether the state will be hurt, but how badly.”","537","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/california-bested-texas"
"The concerns about Texas’s fortunes speak to a misperception of the state’s recent boom, and of California’s bust. Texas’s outperformance of California had a lot to do with factors beyond the control of politicians like Perry and Newsom—namely, the importance of real estate to California’s economy, and the importance of oil to Texas’s. In 2008, the real-estate and rental-and-leasing sectors were responsible for about sixteen per cent of California’s G.D.P., almost double the proportion in Texas. So it was inevitable that California was hit harder by the housing crash that sparked the recession than Texas was. At the same time, Texas benefitted disproportionately from a rise in oil prices in recent years. Oil and gas extraction makes up about eleven per cent of Texas’s economy, compared with one per cent of California’s. In 2008, the year the recession began, the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil hit a record, topping a hundred and forty dollars a barrel; the price fell later that year, but it recovered relatively fast, reaching a hundred dollars again by 2011. Mark Muro, the policy director at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program, told me that the recent natural-gas boom, coupled with rising oil prices, has been largely responsible for Texas’s growth, in G.D.P. as well as in employment and new business establishments, since the recession. The role of policy measures like low taxes and the light regulation of businesses was probably overstated, he said.","538","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/california-bested-texas"
"If all the booms and busts of recent years have taught states anything, Muro said, it’s that it is dangerous to rely too much on one industry for economic growth—especially if that industry is as volatile as real estate or oil. After the last time oil prices crashed, in 1986, bringing the Texas economy down with them, the state government made a point to broaden its economy into other areas. In the wake of the recent recession, the governor’s office and others claimed that Texas has successfully expanded into industries outside of the oil sector—especially the kinds of newer, fast-growing ones, such as tech, that have made places like Silicon Valley so successful. The Internet scene in Austin was particularly celebrated. “Texas has made a concerted long-term effort to build a broadly diversified economy that allows job creators from a wide variety of sectors and industries to thrive here,” Lucy Nashed, a press secretary for Perry, told me. She said that “will allow the state economy to weather the inevitable ups and downs of the economic cycle better than less diversified economies.” But, Muro noted, “The question is, given what is happening in oil and gas, how far along has that diversification proceeded in Texas?”","539","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/california-bested-texas"
"The simplest way to gauge Texas’s diversification is to look at the current percentage of G.D.P. from oil-and-gas extraction compared with the level prior to the last oil crash. In 1985, the year before the crash, about fourteen per cent of Texas’s G.D.P. derived from oil-and-gas extraction—three percentage points higher than the level in 2012, the most recent year for which data is available. That’s not a huge change, but it’s certainly significant. Muro and his colleagues at Brookings wanted to explore the nature of this diversification further, though, so they compiled a list of fifty “advanced” industries—the kind that invest a great deal in research and development, and that attract highly educated workers from science, technology, engineering, and math fields—and tried to find out where these industries are concentrated geographically. (Such industries are important because they tend to grow faster than more established sectors, pay high wages, and have long supply chains, which means their growth ripples into other parts of the economy.)","540","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/california-bested-texas"
"The researchers’ findings were somewhat surprising. Texas has a significant presence in five of the fifty advanced industries. That makes it the twelfth most diverse state—less diverse than California, which is involved in fourteen advanced industries, but more so than New York, the third-most-populous state. But three of the five advanced industries present in Texas are related to the energy sector—for instance, manufacturing of petroleum and coal products—which means they could be vulnerable to the oil crash, too. “By this measure, Texas is not monolithically tied to oil and gas, but it’s highly oriented towards it,” Muro told me. “One would have to wonder about the implications of the gas crash.”","541","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/california-bested-texas"
"To be fair, Texas is better prepared than it was in 1986—partly because of policy measures by Perry and his predecessors. The economy has become more diverse, even if it hasn’t progressed as far as some might hope. Plus, the state gets a smaller proportion of its budget revenue from oil and gas taxes than it did before 1986. Texas is also more reliant on the sales tax nowadays, which could be helpful if lower gas costs lead people to spend more money elsewhere.","542","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/california-bested-texas"
"California, meanwhile, still has plenty of problems of its own. For all of the wealth Silicon Valley has produced, even since the recession, its businesses employ remarkably few people—about eight thousand at Facebook, for example—and those workers tend to come from elite backgrounds. That’s one reason why, despite the success of Facebook and others, California’s unemployment rate is still among the highest in the nation, and why unemployment varies so astonishingly across the state, from about four per cent in Silicon Valley to twenty-three per cent in Imperial County, which borders Mexico and Arizona. The state’s cost of living also remains high. Brown’s inaugural address skimmed over these issues, but Newsom, standing in a hallway outside the chambers where the speech took place, was available to comment. It seemed that he was no longer concerned about California’s relative weakness when compared with Texas but rather about the inequities within his own state. There are “two Californias,” he told the Sacramento Bee—“a very wealthy coastal economy, in contrast to a struggling inland economy.”","543","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/california-bested-texas"
"“I just didn’t even realize until this weekend that it had the kind of momentum that it had,” Senator Bob Corker, a Republican of Tennessee, told The Hill yesterday. He was talking about the letter “to the Leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran” that had been signed by forty-seven Republican senators, including Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, who led the effort. It was an open attempt to disrupt the Obama Administration’s negotiations with Iran on nuclear policy by telling the mullahs that the President of the United States wasn’t someone they should trouble themselves with. Even some Republicans seem a little embarrassed about it now. Megyn Kelly, of Fox News, reflecting conservative criticisms, asked Cotton what the point could be of corresponding with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. (He said that “experts” told him that the Iranians didn’t understand the American Constitution.) No Democrats signed the letter. Corker was one of only seven Republican senators who didn’t.","March 12, 2015","544","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"

"The other Republican non-signers were Susan Collins, of Maine; Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee; Dan Coats, of Indiana; Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska; Jeff Flake, of Arizona; and Thad Cochran, of Mississippi. There was a certain amount of curiosity about why they hadn’t—as if sending a Dear Ayatollah letter was a fun group activity that they had skipped out on. Collins’s answer was fairly sensible: “I don’t think that the ayatollah is going to be particularly convinced by a letter from members of the Senate.” Others, meanwhile, were more circumspect. “I just didn’t think it was appropriate” (Flake). “I just don’t think we ought to be discussing it in public” (Cochran). Maybe they just didn’t think that the Republican Party had become quite so lacking in leadership. The real question, though, isn’t why the seven didn’t sign, but how Cotton, a freshman senator with a well-known habit of engaging in flights of destructive rhetoric, had persuaded forty-six colleagues to join him.","546","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"As he often points out, Cotton, who is thirty-seven, is both a veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq and a graduate of Harvard Law School. In 2006, when the Times published a piece revealing that the government, in the name of fighting terrorism, had collected the private financial information of Americans who had nothing to do with terrorism, Cotton, then an Army lieutenant stationed in Baghdad, sent a letter to the newspaper, saying that the editors should be put “behind bars.” The “next time I hear that familiar explosion—or next time I feel it,” he wrote, “I will wonder whether we could have stopped that bomb had you not instructed terrorists how to evade our financial surveillance.” He added, “I am well-versed in the espionage laws” that could be used to prosecute people at the paper. The Times didn’t publish the letter, but the conservative Web site Power Line did. Cotton was rewarded with praise from conservatives and, after he left the military and returned to his family’s cattle farm in Arkansas, a chance to run for Congress.","547","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"In 2012, he was elected to the House, where one of his first acts was to call for an amendment to a sanctions bill that would impose penalties not only on those who broke the law but also on their relatives, including their “great-grandkids,” “to the third degree of sanguinity.” The amendment failed—as the Washington Post pointed out, it was blatantly unconstitutional—but Cotton didn’t have much time for regret, because he had already decided to run for the Senate against Mark Pryor, the two-term Democratic incumbent, with the backing of the Tea Party Express, the Club for Growth, and national Republican figures who regarded his future as limitless. (Last September, the Atlantic ran a profile of Cotton entitled “The Making of a Conservative Superstar.”)","548","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"Cotton campaigned by opposing abortion rights and Obamacare, and by appealing to fellow veterans and foreign-policy hawks, while touring the state, as the AP reported, “in a bus decorated with a giant boot print on the front, the Arkansas flag and camouflage.” Last spring, on “Morning Joe,” when asked about suggestions that he was “extreme,” Cotton replied with a reference to Pryor’s record: “The only thing that’s extreme is casting the decisive vote for Obamacare five years ago.” He beat Pryor by seventeen points. In addition to trying to scuttle the Iran talks, during the two months that Cotton has been in the Senate he has attempted to block the release of any more detainees held at Guantánamo, even though nearly half of them have been determined to pose no threat to the United States. Cotton’s recommendation was that the prisoners should “rot in hell.”","549","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"Something seems to be out of kilter in the political marketplace that yielded Tom Cotton. How are younger legislators with assets like military experience—something in too short supply in Congress—deployed and, more crucially, developed, and which talents are rewarded? In last year’s campaign, Cotton had to answer charges that he was “reckless.” Recklessness now seems to be treated as a charm. Extremism, clumsiness, anger—other Republican members of the Senate, with a few hundred years of tenure between them, took a look and jumped on board. What was so appealing? Or what were they afraid of?","550","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"John McCain told Politico, “I saw the letter, I saw that it looked reasonable to me and I signed it, that’s all. I sign lots of letters”—as if he didn’t have to worry about anyone actually reading them. McCain told Greta Van Susteren, of Fox, that the Iranians needed to know that Congress had a serious role, but conceded, with what might be taken as a hint of regret, that the letter “maybe … wasn’t the best way to do that.” Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, said that he wished that he could sign Cotton’s letter and that he hoped that other potential 2016 Presidential candidates would, too. Senators Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz, of course, already have.","551","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"Cotton reportedly lobbied the senators personally and strenuously. And yet perhaps it wouldn’t have taken much for someone to stop him. Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declined to sign the letter because he had been trying to organize a bill that would undermine the Iran talks in a more dignified way. (“I just don’t view that as where I need to be today,” he told Politico. “My goal is to get 67 or more people on something that will affect the outcome.”) His fellow-Tennessean, Lamar Alexander, told the Knoxville News-Sentinel that he was guided by his colleague’s expertise. Murkowski’s spokesman noted that she was co-sponsoring the Corker bill. It may be relevant that, last year, Thad Cochran, though by traditional measures an archconservative, was targetted by Tea Partiers during a bitter campaign that involved a break-in at his wife’s nursing home and a suicide. Then again, the non-signers might just have had a sensible conversation on the subject before saying yes. If that were the case, perhaps it’s no surprise that so many others signed. The odds of having a chance encounter with rationality in today’s Senate are vanishingly small.","552","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"The view from where I’m sitting, in San Francisco, is of the small patio in front of the house whose bottom floor my husband and I rent. Beyond the patio stands a fence hugged by a plant sprouting delicate white-and-purple flowers, and beyond that, there’s a terraced garden where our former landlords planted shrubs and succulents. I’m aware that California is in the midst of its worst drought in decades—I’ve read and written about it, and I’ve seen the same bleak photographs that anyone with an Internet connection can see—but, from this vantage, its effects aren’t at all apparent. Nor have a series of recent home water-use restrictions affected us much, since our landlords pay our water bill and handle the gardening, such as it is; in any case, my husband and I consume little water. This puts us in line with much of San Francisco, one of the places that uses the least water, per resident, in the state. And yet, the city is subject to many of the new restrictions. When we went out to dinner with my husband’s visiting parents over the weekend, the waiter kept taking forever to refill our water glasses, because the state had approved regulations that restrict restaurants to offering water only if customers request it. I kvetched a little at this: Shouldn’t the state be imposing its rules on the real water abusers?","April 8, 2015","553","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whos-to-blame-for-californias-drought"

"I haven’t been the only one to complain. California’s drought, which began in 2011, is suddenly turning a lot of uninterested laypeople into the most serious of water experts, each certain that someone else is to blame. The sinners tend to fall into at least one of three categories, depending on who is doing the categorizing: selfish Californians whose yards are over-landscaped, selfish farmers whose crops are over-produced, and selfish environmentalists whose pet causes are over-indulged. Studies exist to support the cases against each of these groups: there’s the one showing that richer, more sprawling parts of Los Angeles are using more water than poorer, denser parts; the one showing that agriculture is using up most of the state’s water; and the one showing that environmental demands are responsible for making much of our water unavailable for human use.","555","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whos-to-blame-for-californias-drought"
"The reason that these perceptions and statistics are so mixed relates to the complexity of California’s water situation. The state has access to both surface water, from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and other aboveground places, and to groundwater, which people—particularly farmers—pump from underground. Of all the water that is typically used, about half goes toward environmental purposes, according to the Public Policy Institute of California—for instance, because it is found in protected “wild and scenic” rivers, or because it is used to preserve wetlands and the habitat within streams, or because it’s circulated in order to maintain the quality of water sent to agricultural and urban users. Half of the state’s water sounds like a lot. But, according to P.P.I.C., more than half of the water designated as environmental is concentrated in rivers along the state’s north coast, which are cut off from major agricultural and urban areas and couldn’t be used for other purposes anyway. Elsewhere in California, more water is reserved for the environment than for cities and towns, but less than for agriculture.","556","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whos-to-blame-for-californias-drought"
"Those inclined to blame farming for abusing the state’s water resources sometimes cite a statistic holding that agriculture takes up eighty per cent of the state’s water, but, to be clear, that’s eighty per cent of human use, which doesn’t count environmental use. (The other twenty per cent comes from municipal use.) Much has been made, too, of the fact that large farms were excluded from an executive order signed by Governor Jerry Brown last week requiring municipalities across the state to reduce their water use by a total of twenty-five per cent, compared to 2013 levels, by February next year. Some have suggested that the exemption may be politically motivated; the agriculture lobby is powerful in California, and one man in particular, a farming magnate named Stewart Resnick, is a major Democratic donor who has made campaign contributions to Brown and other influential politicians. When I ran that argument by a spokesman for Brown, he replied, in an e-mail, that “reducing this to politics . . . simplifies very complicated / multi-layered issues and ignores all of the action / impacts that preceded” last week’s executive order.","557","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whos-to-blame-for-californias-drought"
"It’s not unusual, of course, for politics to influence policy decisions, and the farm lobby’s influence may well have played a role in shaping Brown’s executive order. But the spokesman was alluding to the fact—elided in some critics’ analysis of the situation—that farms, like cities, have already been hit by water restrictions. Farms and cities get their water differently. In cities, local water agencies generally send surface water and groundwater to residents and businesses through pipes; during the drought, that water has continued to flow, though some agencies have restricted how residents can use it. (For instance, lawn watering has been restricted, in many places, to twice a week.) Farms, on the other hand, are allotted rights to surface water based on a complex seniority system. During this drought, many junior rights holders—but not senior ones—have had their access to surface water diminished or shut off. Big swaths of farmland have gone fallow as a result—about five per cent of agricultural land statewide. It’s worth noting, however, that farmers have two additional options for acquiring water. They can buy water rights from one another, and they can pump as much groundwater as they like. As a result, the state’s groundwater has been depleted considerably. Governor Brown recently signed a law restricting groundwater use, but it doesn’t require that groundwater basins become sustainable until 2040, though certain planning milestones have to be met before then. The drought has compelled some experts to suggest that timeline be significantly accelerated.","558","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whos-to-blame-for-californias-drought"
"That brings us to cities, which will bear the immediate brunt of the regulations in Brown’s executive order, even though they use far less water than the environment or agriculture. There’s a simple logistical reason for this, beyond the political explanations: when it comes to imposing short-term water restrictions, cities provide some of the lowest-cost opportunities. That’s because about half of the water used in urban areas goes toward watering lawns and other residential and commercial landscapes—things that have little social benefit, compared with environmental uses, which help the planet and its residents, and agricultural functions, which nourish people around the world and boost California’s economy and provide jobs. On Tuesday, the state sketched a preliminary plan for how cities will be told to meet the mandated statewide reduction of twenty-five per cent; it calls for big water guzzlers—including Beverly Hills, Newport Beach, and Palos Verdes, where a disproportionate number of houses sit on large, elaborately landscaped lawns—to decrease their water consumption by thirty-five per cent, while communities that already use water efficiently would be asked to make smaller reductions. San Francisco, for its part, whose residences tend to have small or nonexistent lawns, would face only a ten-per-cent decrease.","559","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whos-to-blame-for-californias-drought"
"The state also revealed figures showing that water use in cities was only three per cent lower in February than in February of 2013—a figure that Felicia Marcus, the chairwoman of the state water-resources control board, called “totally disheartening” on a call with reporters. (Last year, cities were asked to reduce their water use voluntarily.) The state asked some communities in Southern California, which actually saw an increase in water use, to explain themselves. They responded, according to the board, that the hotter weather had inspired more landscape watering (“not a great reason,” Marcus said), and that economic growth and tourism had prompted more general water use.","560","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whos-to-blame-for-californias-drought"
"As the drought continues, the state may well have to further adjust how it treats the use of water for environmental and agricultural purposes. In the meantime, reducing outdoor irrigation in municipalities is “the low-hanging fruit,” Marcus said. While it may appear to those of us in cities as though we’re being targeted, and it might feel good to complain about others, the situation is complex and the reality less satisfying: we all need to change.","561","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whos-to-blame-for-californias-drought"

Set aside, for a moment, the question of whether this is a wise venture. On the basis of the Constitution and the subsequent laws governing the declaration of war, it’s clear that, before the executive branch can launch any large-scale military action, Congress must grant its approval.","February 11, 2015","562","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"

"All too often in recent decades, Presidents have flouted this legal requirement, relying on flimsy arguments about executive authority or, since 2001, on the overly broad mandate that Congress granted President George W. Bush to pursue his war on terrorism. Indeed, according to many constitutional scholars, the actions that the Obama Administration has already taken against the Islamic State, which have included launching air strikes by U.S. fighter-bombers, have gone beyond the law. “The war against the Islamic State is now illegal,” Bruce Ackerman, of Yale Law School, wrote on November 7th. “The War Powers Resolution of 1973 gave President Obama 60 days to gain consent from Congress and required him to end ‘hostilities’ within 30 days if he failed to do so. This 90-day clock expired last night.”","564","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"As a former lecturer on constitutional law, Obama knows this stuff all too well. During a press conference in November, he asked Congress to grant him a new legal authorization. Commendably, if a bit belatedly, his Administration has now sent a written request up to Capitol Hill. On Wednesday morning, the White House released the text of its resolution, which would authorize “the limited use of the United States Armed Forces against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.” The group, it says, “poses a grave threat to the people and territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria, regional stability, and the national security interests of the United States and its allies and partners.”","565","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"Despite the Administration’s use of the word “limited,” the resolution is a broad one. It would authorize military action for up to three years, contain few geographic restrictions, and approve the deployment of Americans on the ground. More specifically, the resolution says that, subject to some limitations, “The President is authorized … to use the Armed Forces of the United States as the President determines to be necessary and appropriate against ISIL or associated persons or forces.”","566","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"In fact, the only limitation spelled out in the resolution is that it “does not authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces in enduring offensive ground combat operations.” Clearly, this phrase stops well short of restricting the use of U.S. ground troops, or even placing any limitations on their numbers. Current and former military officials have been warning for months that, even if the Administration persists with the idea of using the Iraqi Army to attack ISIS, the battle plan would demand the extensive involvement on the ground of U.S. target spotters, trainers, and logistics personnel. The suggested resolution would clearly allow this. Indeed, it seems like it would allow the President to deploy entire battalions of U.S. infantry troops, should the Iraqi Army struggle to advance, which is what some military experts think is likely to happen. As long as the U.S. offensive operations were intended to be short-lived, the resolution would appear to cover them.","567","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"As written, it would also grant the President the power to extend the fight against the Islamic State beyond Iraq and Syria, and even to take the war to other entities. Referring back to the request for authority to strike ISIS and “associated persons or forces,” Section 5 of the resolution says that this “means individuals and organizations fighting for, on behalf of, or alongside ISIL or any closely-related successor entity in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.” But to what and where is this language referring? An official told the Times that it is meant to cover the possibility of striking at members of ISIS or allied groups in Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Yemen, or other unnamed Middle Eastern and North African countries.","568","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"If this resolution doesn’t amount to granting the President a free hand, it comes close. And it goes beyond what some senators and Congress members seem inclined to approve. In response to the Administration’s request, Speaker John Boehner issued a statement saying that he would organize hearings, adding, “Ultimately, our objective is to show the world that the United States is resolute in our commitment to destroy” the Islamic State. Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who serves on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees, welcomed the resolution, telling the Washington Post, “We’re in our seventh month of war, and we’re going to finally have this discussion.” But Kaine added that the language about ground troops “is too vague for me. We learned from the 2001 authorization that vagueness is bad.”","569","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"Kaine’s points are well taken. In the coming weeks, Republicans and Democrats will be forced to approve, strike down, or modify the Administration’s request, which is what is supposed to happen. (The would-be Presidential candidates in 2016, by virtue of their ambitions, will also have to adopt a public stance.) Right now, Congress seems likely to end up approving some sort of resolution. Still, the debates will provide an opportunity for people to consider the stakes, and to think hard about the conflict. A ground war against ISIS is likely to be bloody and extended. And, even if it succeeds militarily, the United States and its allies will face the same task they goofed up the last time around: putting together a stable and democratic Iraq.","570","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"The politics of all this aren’t entirely clear-cut. On the one hand, there is little enthusiasm in the country, or in Congress, for another extended war in the Middle East.

"Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, explained his approach to the Legislature as we flew in a state plane from Albany to Westchester County. At fifty-seven, Cuomo still has an athletic build, and, at two hundred pounds distributed over a six-foot-one-inch frame, he fits into an airline seat with some difficulty. It was mid-December, and he was on his way to Manhattan to continue a vigil. His father, former Governor Mario Cuomo, was at his apartment on the East Side, with end-stage heart disease. Mario Cuomo defined his three terms as governor with oratory; Andrew Cuomo has sought to build his reputation in a different way. He made clear that his primary inspiration when it came to dealing with legislators was Bill Clinton, not his father. During Clinton’s second term, Cuomo served in his Cabinet, as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. “I was watching, and they were impeaching the guy, and he was still there every day, asking them how they were doing, trying to make deals,” Cuomo recalled, his voice bearing the hard consonants of Queens, where he grew up. “My job is to get to yes,” he said. “If I don’t make a deal, I get nothing done. If I get nothing done, I am a failure. If the objective is to make a nice speech, it means nothing.”","574","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Because New York State’s government had long been controlled by “three men in a room”—the Governor; Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Speaker of the Assembly; and Dean Skelos, the Republican Majority Leader of the Senate—Cuomo often found occasion to praise the other two. “I’m very big on giving other people credit,” he told me. “It’s the whole collegial thing. That’s how I get what I get done done.” Most recently, in his State of the State address, on January 21st, Cuomo said that he would soon be going on a trade mission to Mexico, and he displayed a PowerPoint slide of himself, Skelos, and Silver, all wearing sombreros. “We are going to be our own version of the three amigos!” Cuomo declared, to appreciative laughter from Skelos and Silver, who were seated on the stage beside him. A perfunctory shout-out like this would ordinarily draw little notice, except that, the following morning, federal agents led Silver off in handcuffs.","575","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Silver was charged in a baroque scheme to exploit his office for personal gain. According to the prosecutor’s complaint, he arranged for state funding of a research laboratory at Columbia University for victims of an asbestos-related cancer. The director of the lab referred his patients to Silver’s personal-injury law firm, which, in turn, filed lawsuits on their behalf. From this and a related arrangement, Silver is said to have netted more than four million dollars.

"Cuomo’s solicitude for Silver and others in the Legislature was longstanding. In the summer of 2013, Cuomo created what became known as the Moreland Commission, a bipartisan group of leading citizens, who were to spend up to eighteen months investigating public corruption in the state. The commission’s inquiries focussed in particular on whether the outside business activities of state legislators should be subject to tighter regulation. By early 2014, Silver and his colleagues had come to loathe the commission, and went to court to thwart its inquiries. Around the same time, Cuomo was seeking to pass his annual budget, and he hoped to do that on schedule. So, just nine months after Cuomo created the commission, he abruptly shut it down. Silver passed Cuomo’s budget; Cuomo rid Silver of the meddlesome commission.","577","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"On the day after Silver’s arrest, I met with Cuomo in his New York City office, on Third Avenue. I asked him about the widespread contention that the charges against Silver showed that Cuomo should have let the Moreland investigation run its course.","578","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"“They’re exactly wrong,” Cuomo said. “What happened on the Moreland Commission is they subpoenaed the outside info of the Senate and the Assembly, in a fairly aggressive way. The Senate and the Assembly join together, the Republicans and the Democrats, in a motion to quash the subpoenas. And they are successful in the lower court. And we’re stuck for, like, four months.”","579","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Closing down Moreland, in Cuomo’s view, broke the logjam. After the shutdown, the Legislature passed modest ethics reform, which increased penalties for bribery and established a pilot program for public financing in the next state comptroller’s race. Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, demanded the Moreland files and used them to make the case against Silver and, perhaps, others. “We get the legislation I wanted in the first place,” Cuomo told me. “Moreland takes the same cases and the same subpoenas and hands them to local D.A.s and to Preet.” Cuomo disclaims any responsibility for Silver’s possible misdeeds. “If Anthony Weiner shows his private parts, do you blame Obama? These are criminal acts of individual legislators. What would you have me do?”","580","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Each step in Cuomo’s analysis makes a kind of tactical sense. But he shut down the investigation even though the Legislature failed to make significant political reforms. Bharara and the other prosecutors obtained the commission’s files only because Bharara publicly expressed his outrage at Cuomo’s action. * Cuomo’s explanation ignored the symbolism: How could there ever be a legitimate reason, in a state long beset with corruption in its Legislature, for the governor to short-circuit his own marquee attempt to clean it up?","581","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"For better and for worse, Cuomo views his work as a series of transactions. He disdains rhetoric; he prizes results. He has had several accomplishments in his first four years. Against heavy odds, he pushed through a marriage-equality bill in the Legislature; he banned fracking; he tightened the state’s gun-control laws; he closed thirteen prisons; he started construction on the first major bridge in the state in fifty years, a replacement for the Tappan Zee, across the Hudson; and he passed four balanced budgets in a row, all on time. Deeds, not words—that might as well be the motto of Cuomo’s administration. In nearly every speech, and in many conversations, Cuomo dismisses the importance of political talk. As if adopting a typical voter’s view of President Obama, Cuomo told me, “Beautiful rhetoric, beautiful vision—I’m sold on the vision—and what happens? There was no product. There was no actualization of the vision. Now I’m more disillusioned than I was when we started. You brought me up with that beautiful language, and you got me excited and I thought it was possible and then it wasn’t.”","582","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"I mentioned that Cuomo seemed especially pleased to be identified with clearing snow after storms. “Because talking about clearing the snow, talking about doing any of this crap, doesn’t work,” he said. “They’ve heard it before. They’ve heard it all. You’re not going to say anything that moves the jury. I believe that fundamentally. Show me, it’s show-me time. Show me results. Build a bridge, build a train to LaGuardia, clear the snow, save lives. Huh? A little competence. Work with the other side, not this crazy partisan gridlock, huh? You can actually work together. Balance the budget. Really? Get a budget passed on time.” By his own method of accounting, his first term as governor ranks as a considerable success. It also stands in notable counterpoint to that of his father, who died on January 1st, the day Andrew was sworn in for his second term.","583","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"For decades, the political calendar in Albany followed a predictable pattern. The governor gave his State of the State address shortly after the first of the year and submitted a proposed budget by February 1st, in time for the Legislature to act before the current budget expired, on April 1st. When we spoke in his office, Cuomo offered a dramatic rendering of what usually happened next. “All you knew about state government in this state was what you saw for one week a year—four days leading up to April 1st,” he said. “The newscast would start, ‘Well, this year, do you think we’re going to have a budget on time?’ They go to a legislator: ‘I think some people are optimistic. I think it might.’ April 1st: ‘Here we are! Waiting for midnight, let’s see if we have a budget deal. And here the Governor’s coming out. Governor! Are we going to have a budget on time?’ ‘No, the Senate is an ass and the Assembly’s an ass, and they’re all asses.’ The budget winds up four months late, five months late.”","584","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo, who took office in 2011, was determined to end this syndrome. Thanks to a constitutional amendment ratified in 1927, New York State has what’s known as “executive budgeting,” which means, in rough terms, that the governor alone has the right to submit a budget, and the role of the Legislature is limited to voting it up or down. Over the years, though, the power of the Legislature expanded, and the terms of the budget became subject to extensive negotiation and, often, delay. This practice offended James McGuire**, who was chief counsel to Governor George Pataki, the Republican who served from 1995 to 2007, and McGuire led a crusade to restore the governor to preëminence in budget matters. Sheldon Silver challenged McGuire, and Pataki, on behalf of the Assembly. The fight went to the Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, which, in 2004, handed the governor a major victory. The court made clear that the Legislature “may not alter” the governor’s budget proposal in any way.","585","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Still, it took some time for the significance of Silver v. Pataki, as the case was known, to be fully appreciated in Albany. There was only one on-time budget in the Pataki years; the Legislature kept state government functioning after April 1st by passing “extenders”—stopgap measures to fund the operations of the state until the actual budget was passed. “Cuomo was the first one who really used the full extent of the governor’s power over the budget under the constitution,” McGuire told me.","586","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"When Cuomo submitted his first budget, he laid down a challenge to legislators. If they refused to pass his budget on time, he would submit the entire budget as an extender. A Cuomo aide said, “We said to them, ‘Here’s your extender, it’s called the budget. If you don’t want to pass it, you will close the whole government—not just the parks, the whole thing.’ ” The aide went on, “We had to face the question of what we would do if the Legislature didn’t blink. We thought we would have to make good on our threat. But we never got there. They understood that we meant business. They passed the budget, and they did it on time.” Cuomo had tamed the Legislature on the centerpiece of state government.","587","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s obsession with the timing of the budget can obscure the larger issue of state spending. “He fixates on on-time budgets, but he never says why the budgets were delayed in the old days,” Dan Cantor, the national director of the Working Families Party, told me. The Party, a left-leaning consortium of labor unions and others, has had a contentious relationship with Cuomo. “The budgets were delayed because the left held them up, because they wanted more money for things that were important—for schools and roads and libraries. Cuomo is not some kind of progressive. He rejects the view that the middle class in America was built by unions pushing up and the progressive income tax pushing down. His attitude is we have to keep rich people happy. It’s trickle-down economics.”","588","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"To a certain extent, Cuomo would not dispute this view, at least when it comes to taxes. His liberalism manifests itself in initiatives that entail relatively little government spending, such as marriage equality, the fracking ban, and gun control. Cuomo has made a point of cutting some taxes every year, which he regards as crucial in retaining and courting jobs for the state. He also dismisses the idea that the state tax code can address the problem of inequality. “You keep raising taxes, raising regulations, they will leave,” he said in a recent speech in Albany. “Business is more mobile, people are more mobile, and they will leave. And they have left. So that was a cultural shift for us in New York—we’re in a competition with all those other states. Our friends say, ‘Well, we should use the tax code to address social inequities and raise the taxes on the rich.’ If that’s going to happen, that has to happen at the federal level, because we here in this state, we are in a competition, we are in a footrace with every other state. And our taxes and our level of taxation and our regulations are going to say whether we come in first, second, third, or fourth in that race.”","589","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"It’s sometimes said of certain politicians that they love humanity but hate people; Andrew Cuomo does not appear especially fond of either. He is the uncommon elected official with a streak of misanthropy. Cuomo rarely sees ordinary people, and they rarely see him, except in television commercials. “Andrew doesn’t like meeting with voters,” someone who is familiar with his campaigns told me. “He’ll do parades, but that’s about it.” In his 2014 race for reëlection, which he won with fifty-four per cent of the vote, Cuomo outraised Rob Astorino, the Republican candidate, by forty-five million dollars to six million, and thus dominated the airwaves with his advertisements. Cuomo agreed to a single debate with Astorino and none with Zephyr Teachout, his opponent in the Democratic primary.","590","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Except during weather crises or after transportation accidents, Cuomo hardly ever consents to be interviewed on television. When he does answer questions on the air, it is often by telephone rather than on camera. Unlike most of his predecessors, Cuomo has given his inaugural addresses to small, invitation-only audiences. (This year, at the World Trade Center, a guard at the front door shooed away the curious with the words “Not open to the public.”)","591","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo has a tense and distant relationship with the Albany press corps. His news conferences, which are sometimes just “gaggles,” or scrums in a hallway in the capitol, can be contentious. (Reporters have demanded that Cuomo explain the poor sales of his memoir, “All Things Possible,” which was published last fall.) Cuomo does make semi-regular appearances on an Albany-based public-radio interview program, and he used to be a frequent guest on the radio show of Fredric U. Dicker, the longtime Albany correspondent for the New York Post, but the relationship between the two men soured. On the window of Dicker’s office, which faces a well-travelled corridor in the capitol, there is now a photograph of the Governor with a Pinocchio nose and the words “Come clean on Moreland.”","592","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Behind a lectern, Cuomo can sound like an American tourist abroad, speaking loudly and slowly in order to make himself understood. At closer range, he’s a more formidable presence. His speech comes in aggressive, self-confident bursts, especially when he’s sizing up the state of political play. He is relentless. “When he wants to hire you, he starts calling you all the time and acting like you already work for him,” a former aide said. “He just assumes he can persuade you.” His interactions with state legislators also tend to be one on one, and his early success with them on the budget created another opportunity for him. “What people forget is when the budget is months late there is no time to do anything else,” a senior aide told me. “But we knew by March that we were going to get the budget, and that meant that we had time to do marriage equality right away, in 2011.”","593","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Today, same-sex marriage is legal in thirty-six states and the District of Columbia; it would be inconceivable for New York not to be among them. But in 2011 success was a long shot. New York’s Senate had voted down a marriage-equality law two years earlier, when the Democrats controlled the chamber. In the 2010 elections, the Democrats lost the Senate, which meant that getting the issue voted in would be even more difficult. (Passage in the Democratic-controlled Assembly was assured.)","594","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"“I didn’t know that I could pass it,” Cuomo told me. “I’m not a big fan of fighting the good fight and losing, because one of the Democratic Party’s problems is, I think, it’s done that too often. You know, we were oversaturated with good intent, no action, no results.” Still, he decided to press ahead.","595","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The plan was detailed and methodical, focussed entirely on winning in the Senate, which was run, then as now, by the Republican Skelos. “L.B.J. used to talk about how, in legislative relations, people sort of have a pattern,” Cuomo told me. “They talk about, in certain card games, people have a pattern. Clinton used to talk about, you know, people have a tell.” He went on, “Skelos never goes first, and Skelos never says anything until the last minute.” At first, Skelos would not even commit himself to bringing the issue up for a vote. As Cuomo recalled, “Skelos said, as a put-off, ‘Don’t ask me what I’m going to do. You never get to me until it gets past the Democrats, and it hasn’t gotten past the Democrats. So I’m not responding, because it’s moot. Call me when it gets past the Democrats. And, by the way, it never will.’ ” (Skelos declined to comment.)","596","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo and his allies tried to establish Democratic unity, which proved elusive. In the cynical calculus of Albany, failure on marriage equality looked better to some Democrats than victory. “If they kept the issue alive, year after year, they could continue to fund-raise against Republicans on it, and then blame the Republicans for its failure,” one person involved in the process said. Cuomo personally lobbied the holdouts. His staff kept a stash of Pepperidge Farm cookies (as well as Kosher cookies for the observant) for when the lawmakers came to meet with him. “All governors—Pataki, Spitzer, his father, me—let the legislators get on our nerves,” David Paterson, Cuomo’s predecessor, told me. “Andrew maintains a poise of not letting that get into the conversation. Many would have thought that his temper and his passion would get in the way. He has actually been the governor who has exercised greater patience and decorum than the rest of us.” When Cuomo grew frustrated by a few stalling Democrats, he called a press conference to demonstrate that all members of the Party were now united. Unwilling to embarrass the Governor, everyone fell in line.","597","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"He then needed at least three Republican votes, a task made considerably more difficult by a public promise from the leader of the state Conservative Party to mount primary challenges against any Republican senators who voted for same-sex marriage. “It was just good old-fashioned political personal persuasion,” a Cuomo aide recalled. The marriage bill was the last bill of the session, and Cuomo had few options for horse-trading about other legislation. “He used the governor’s mansion. He used his office. His daughters were around. You were greeted. You were given refreshments. You were talking with Andrew, your friend, alone. ‘Which side of history do you want to be on?’ ‘I won’t forget you.’ ‘Have another cookie.’ ”","598","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Roy McDonald, a longtime Republican state senator from a district around Saratoga County, had voted against marriage equality in 2009. “I think with some of these social issues, it becomes so adversarial that it hurts our country,” he told me. “But I began to think, If someone is pursuing happiness, God bless them. It’s not our business to be telling people what to do.” Cuomo met with McDonald repeatedly. “He talked to me, but I don’t think it was a matter of convincing us,” McDonald said. “He was respectful. I commended him for being a leader on the issue.” In time, Cuomo gathered four Republican commitments for his side. (Four was ultimately deemed necessary, because no one wanted to be “the vote” that turned the issue.)","599","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Marriage equality passed by thirty-three to twenty-nine. In 2012, Roy McDonald was defeated for reëlection in the Republican primary.","600","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s contempt for the power of words alone seems especially notable coming from the son of perhaps the best-known political speaker of his generation. He often uses the same phrase to dismiss comparisons between him and his father. As he put it in his eulogy for Mario, “Over the years, the press would love to give their dime-store psychoanalysis of our quote-unquote ‘complex’ father-and-son relationship, which was all a lot of hooey.” Still, the relationship was complex, and, like most sons, Andrew was formed both by emulation and by rejection of his father’s example.","601","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"During Andrew’s childhood, his father was not a famous man. For most of those years, Mario Cuomo was a work-obsessed lawyer with a modest practice in downtown Brooklyn. He first came to some prominence in 1972, when Mayor John Lindsay asked him to mediate a dispute in Queens. The Lindsay administration had proposed building a large public-housing project in Forest Hills, which was then a mainly Jewish and middle-class neighborhood. The community rebelled, and the fight, which pitted African-Americans against Jews, became both a symptom and a cause of the breakdown of the civil-rights coalition of the nineteen-sixties. Cuomo brokered a compromise (the project was built in a scaled-back form), and he then published a thoughtful diary of his efforts to resolve the controversy. Readers of the diary, which recounted his seven-day work weeks, could be forgiven for concluding that the author had no children. In fact, he had five.","602","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Mario and Matilda Cuomo married in 1954, while Mario was a student at St. John’s law school, and they had their first child, Margaret, the following year. She is now a prominent radiologist and cancer specialist. Andrew was born in 1957. In a later edition of Mario’s diaries, he wrote, “Margaret and Andrew Mark took the brunt of the early years of our marriage, years of financial insecurity when I was a law student and young lawyer, and Matilda taught school.” The next child was Maria, a philanthropist married to the designer Kenneth Cole; then Madeline, a lawyer; and, finally, Chris, born in 1970, who is a news anchor at CNN, where we are colleagues. Andrew Cuomo notes in his memoir that protesters in the Forest Hills controversy sometimes came to the Cuomo family home, in Queens, but they wasted their time: “He often left before my sisters and I got up and came back after we were asleep. To make their point, the demonstrators would have had to march at 7 P.M. on a Sunday, the one time of the week that my mother insisted he be home for dinner. And when he was home, he was usually working.”","603","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Andrew went to Archbishop Molloy*** High School, in Queens, and, the week before he graduated, his father’s close friend Fabian Palomino asked Mario how Andrew was doing. “You know, I really don’t know,” Mario replied, as recounted in Robert S. McElvaine’s 1988 biography. “I’ve been so busy running around the office for a long time—I really don’t know. I haven’t spent a lot of time with him in the last four years. I guess I’ve taken him to two or three ball games. Matilda made me take him.”","604","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After the mediation in Forest Hills, Cuomo became a more or less perpetual candidate for elective office, usually an unsuccessful one. In 1973, he considered a run for mayor of New York, but backed out. In 1974, he lost the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor; the following year, the new governor, Hugh Carey, named him secretary of state. In 1977, Cuomo entered a seven-way Democratic primary for mayor of New York, a contest that remains a classic in New York politics. As Andrew writes in his book, “I learned early that if I wanted to spend time with my father I had to tag along.”","605","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"So Andrew, then in his second year at Fordham, in the Bronx, volunteered to be Mario’s driver in the mayor’s race. “Andrew was the ‘body guy’—he was always with his father,” Bruce Gyory, an Albany-based political consultant who worked on the campaign, told me. “His job was to get his father in and out of events on time. It was not easy, because Mario was warm and gregarious, and he didn’t have that inner clock that most politicians have about when their next meeting is.” In the fall, Andrew returned to college, and organized the borough for his father. Mario finished second to Ed Koch in the primary, lost to him in a runoff, and then ran unsuccessfully as the Liberal Party candidate in the general election. (The race poisoned relations between Mario Cuomo and Koch for the rest of their lives, mainly because Koch blamed Cuomo for campaign signs that supposedly said “Vote for Cuomo, not the homo.” Over the years, Andrew has also been blamed for the signs. Though the signs figure largely in New York political folklore, there is no evidence that they even existed.)","606","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The following year, 1978, Mario ran as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor—a largely powerless position—and won. Andrew was then a student at Albany Law School, and while the Legislature was in session he and Mario were roommates at the Hotel Wellington. Mario kept a diary during this period, and Andrew is a frequent presence, usually as the object of his father’s affectionate exasperation. December 6, 1980: “Andrew is looking for another car: he has a real fascination with automobiles that comes higher on his list of priorities than many other things, including studying for his classes. He’ll pass anyway; he always has. But he has never tested himself intellectually. I think if he did he’d be surprised at his own ability.” (Andrew still collects and tinkers with sports cars.) January 22, 1981: “Andrew is working at the gas station for the week he’s home. He’s going to need the money. He ran up $165 in tickets in Albany for leaving his car parked overtime while he was studying for exams. The car is in his mother’s name, so they ran a story in the Times-Union referring to Matilda Cuomo, scofflaw!”","607","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In 1982, Cuomo and Koch ran against each other again, this time in the Democratic primary for governor. The race was widely seen as a last chance for Cuomo, who was earning a reputation as a perennial loser. In his diary, on January 5, 1982, he noted that a political associate “suggested Andrew would make a good campaign manager. . . . I’m leery about his being too distracted from his law studies, though, and will have to think hard about it.”","608","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"It appears, in retrospect, that Mario praised his son more in his diary than to his face. “As our conversations began to center on the upcoming 1982 election, my father never mentioned that he had any particular confidence in my political acumen,” Andrew wrote in his memoir. “Expressing feelings and pride in their children was not something the men of his generation did.” Still, at this moment of political life or death, Mario turned to his son. February 18, 1982: “Andrew is doing an excellent job organizing the campaign. He, more than any of us, has appeared to profit from the political involvement of the last 8 years. He is competent, respectful, dedicated—and liked.”","609","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"That last point was debatable. During 1982, Andrew first gained a reputation as a political brawler, playing the bad cop to his father’s philosopher king. Koch began the campaign with a thirty-five-per-cent lead in the polls, and Mario, as well as his twenty-four-year-old campaign manager, had to struggle to be taken seriously. “Andrew is driven and intense, and he was smarter than people gave him credit for when he was running his father’s campaign,” Howard Glaser, who worked for Mario in 1982 and has since been a close aide to Andrew, told me. “He’s never been a person who cared a lot about what the media thinks of him. He just wanted to get the job done.” Aided by a series of gaffes by Koch, including a Playboy interview in which the Mayor disparaged both rural and suburban life, Mario surged to a six-point victory in the primary. September 23, 1982: “Andrew is near exhaustion. He has a tendency to overwork himself. It’s a syndrome I recognize and understand.” In the general election, Mario defeated Lew Lehrman, a corporate executive who lavishly financed his own campaign, by three per cent. December 5, 1982: “Andrew loved the beautiful gold pocket watch his family bought him for his 25th birthday. Engraved on the inside of the front cover was the inscription: ‘We are proud of you. Even more, we love you. Your family.’ It was wonderful to be able to do it.”","610","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the state capitol in Albany, Andrew Cuomo sits at the same desk, in the same office, that his father did as governor. George Pataki used a grand space next door, but Andrew, like his father, prefers the cozier dimensions of Room 203. On a shelf opposite the desk is a photograph of the two men together, taken on a basketball court, shortly after Mario was elected governor. Though they are both smiling for the photographer, they also clearly know how to play the game—and are intent on the competition. Andrew, his hair styled in a swirling eighties bouffant, is dribbling, while his father leans in on defense. “I weigh two hundred, but he was two forty,” Andrew told me. “If he knocked into you, you hurt for a week.”","611","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Basketball is a team game. Mario preferred to play one on one, as Andrew recalled at his father’s funeral. “The basketball court remained for him the one place where he could allow himself to be his fully aggressive self,” Andrew said. “We had epic battles, he and I. He hated few things as much as a timid opponent on the basketball court, because you cheated him of a real contest. I was bigger than my father, and I was not intimidated by the fact that he was governor—he couldn’t fire me. We played in the state-police gym in Albany. He liked to play one on one because it was the purest form of competition. . . . He would make faces at you, he would taunt you, he would talk constantly, and it would distract me—a maddening banter, designed to unnerve you. He would hit you in places the human body did not have anatomical defenses.”","612","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The two men usually played ball at the end of long days in Albany, where Andrew worked for his father as an unpaid adviser. (The other aides called him Governor; Andrew called him Mario.) As Andrew notes in his memoir, it was around this time that he earned the nicknames “Prince of Darkness,” “Darth Vader,” and Mario’s “hatchet man.” (All undeserved, Andrew said.) In short order, though, Andrew escaped Albany, spending a brief period as an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan and then as a lawyer in a private firm. He retained a hand in his father’s political career, but soon went out on his own.","613","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the eighties, New York City, and the state as a whole, suffered an epidemic of homelessness. Many of the homeless had no shelter; others lived in shabby and dangerous hotels that charged the government exorbitant rates. Cuomo decided to help address the problem by establishing a nonprofit organization called Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, or HELP. The plan was to build transitional housing for the homeless and provide social services to the residents on site. The idea was also to provide a kind of tough love for the residents. In return for housing and assistance, including job training and day care, the residents had to observe a strict code of conduct, which set a 10 P.M. curfew. Cuomo built a successful demonstration project in the East New York section of Brooklyn.","614","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s next project for HELP proved more difficult. He sought to build a development for the homeless in Greenburgh, a town of eighty-five thousand in suburban Westchester County. The locals objected to housing for the poor in their midst, and Andrew found himself in an ugly fight reminiscent of Mario’s struggle in Forest Hills, nearly two decades earlier. He got some idea of what he was up against when he brought two dozen doughnuts to what he thought would be a small community meeting about the project, and seven hundred people showed up. Still, he approached the controversy much as his father had—with long neighborhood consultations, quiet negotiations, and scaled-back ambitions. It took four years, five lawsuits, and ten million dollars, but finally, in 1991, HELP opened its Greenburgh complex. (HELP still exists, with Maria Cuomo Cole as the board chair, and it has established thirty-two residential facilities for the homeless.)","615","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the meantime, Andrew began courting Kerry Kennedy, one of Robert F. Kennedy’s eleven children, who was working in Boston on a foundation dedicated to her father’s memory. In his book, Andrew describes his first visit to the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod. “I was dressed all wrong,” he writes. “These people were wearing cut-off denim shorts, ragged T-shirts, and no shoes. I looked like a designer logo smorgasbord. Not to mention the baggy psychedelic bathing suit and loafers. This was Saturday Night Fever meets Hyannis Port.” Andrew Cuomo and Kerry Kennedy married on June 9, 1990.","616","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After Bill Clinton was elected President, in 1992, his team recruited Andrew, by then a nationally recognized expert on housing, to become an Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. While in Washington, the Cuomos had twin girls and then another daughter. In 1994, when Mario Cuomo ran for a fourth term in New York, Andrew did not return to help him campaign. It was the first time he had not participated in one of his father’s races. Mario was swept out in the Republican landslides of that year by Pataki, an unheralded state senator. Andrew’s career continued to advance. Two years later, when Clinton was reëlected, he named Cuomo to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development. At thirty-nine, Cuomo was the youngest member of any President’s Cabinet since John F. Kennedy made Robert Kennedy the Attorney General, in 1961.","617","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"As the HUD Secretary, Cuomo presented himself as the spokesman for the nation’s poor, travelling around the country to show that, even in a time of prosperity, many people were left behind. He was given to fierce denunciations of those who, in his opinion, used federal dollars to mistreat the vulnerable. In 1997, the department sued A. Bruce Rozet, a HUD landlord, accusing him of taking kickbacks from a management company called Insignia Financial, which ran his buildings. According to a press release from HUD, which was cited in a 2006 Village Voice story, the department’s mission was to provide housing for the needy—“not to provide lives of luxury for con artists stealing from our programs.” Cuomo called the case “the largest ever brought by HUD” and condemned “the abysmal conditions” that he said tenants were forced to endure in projects that had been “poorly maintained” by Insignia.","618","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the period leading up to the 2000 Presidential campaign, Cuomo had grown close to Vice-President Al Gore, and he was mentioned as a possible White House chief of staff in a Gore Administration. But, with George W. Bush’s Inauguration, Cuomo returned to New York. And his life fell apart.","619","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo had not lived in New York State for eight years, but he had a famous father (and famous in-laws), along with an impressive résumé from his federal service, and in 2002 he decided to run for the Democratic nomination for governor. His opponent was Carl McCall, the state treasurer and a veteran of New York politics, who had been waiting his turn for a shot at the top job. McCall was also the highest-ranking African-American official in the state. The rationale for Cuomo’s candidacy, which he declared in a Kenneth Cole showroom, was never clear. Cuomo tried to portray himself as an insurgent outsider, but that was a tough sell from a governor’s son and veteran political operative. On April 17, 2002, Cuomo committed what was regarded as a fatal gaffe. Comparing the incumbent, Pataki, to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the aftermath of 9/11, Cuomo said, “He stood behind the leader. He held the leader’s coat.” This was regarded as an unforgivable politicization of the terrorist attacks. The governor’s race went so badly that Cuomo was compelled to withdraw even before the primary. (In the general campaign, McCall lost handily to Pataki.)","620","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After the election, Cuomo’s marriage disintegrated, in a rancorous battle chronicled in detail by the local tabloids. The divorce was eventually settled, without litigation, but Cuomo found himself an outcast—single, unemployed, and repudiated by the New York political establishment. His salvation began in an unlikely place. He was visiting a real-estate executive in New York, and another prominent businessman happened to be in the office—Andrew Farkas, who had been the chief executive of Insignia Financial, the company that Cuomo denounced in such strong terms as HUD Secretary.","621","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Farkas, an heir to the Alexander’s department-store fortune, who went on to make one of his own, was spoiling for a fight with his former adversary. Farkas’s company had paid more than seven million dollars to settle the charges in the HUD case. (Farkas was never personally charged.) “Our first interaction was somewhat combative,” Farkas told me. “We had a very difficult few hours together, then we went back to our respective corners.” Still, Cuomo got in touch to continue their conversation. “I was intrigued with the fortitude of a man who was walking into the hornet’s nest of dealing with me,” Farkas said. “Folklore and myth and legend are full of stories of people who meet on the field and go from combatants to allies. We became quite enamored of each other. We had a great deal in common—families with strong fathers, and we both had our problems with prior marriages.”","622","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo went to work for a new commercial real-estate venture that Farkas established, and, as the Times has reported, he was paid more than $2.5 million in three years. Also in this period, as Cuomo notes in his memoir, he remained an attentive parent to his daughters, in spite of the divorce—a point of great pride with him. (The twins are now in college, and the younger daughter will go next fall.) Cuomo also began seeing Sandra Lee, a food and life-style entrepreneur. They have lived together in Westchester for years. “We are not married, and everything is fine,” Cuomo told me. Lee has eschewed the role of First Lady, and continued a successful independent career.","623","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"When, in 2006, Pataki decided not to seek a fourth term, Eliot Spitzer, who had enjoyed great success as the state attorney general, had a clear shot at the governorship. Cuomo decided to run for attorney general. The finance chairman of his campaign was Andrew Farkas.","624","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo had learned from his 2002 defeat. Gone were the announcement parties at fashionable New York locales, replaced by humble entreaties to mid-level upstate pols. At the time, David Paterson was Spitzer’s running mate. Paterson told me, “I told him that I thought he should go around and visit some of the people in New York state politics, in a kind of mea-culpa kind of way. That doesn’t come naturally to Andrew, to say the least, but he did do it.” Notably, Cuomo did not seek the advice of his father on campaign matters. Campaign advisers tell of receiving phone calls from Mario Cuomo, who would report that Andrew wasn’t interested in his advice. Andrew, in turn, would ask the staffers what Mario was saying. Cuomo won the primary and the general election with ease.","625","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo and Spitzer, two ambitious New York politicians of the same generation and party, had eyed each other warily for years. Cuomo now had to figure out how to define himself in an office where Spitzer had become known nationally, as the scourge of Wall Street. His approach was different. “As lawyers, we are very interested in process,” a senior member of Cuomo’s staff in the attorney general’s office said. “But Andrew is not very interested in process. He didn’t care that much about how we put cases together and how we planned to litigate. He wanted, instead, to know what were we going to end with, and what’s the best way to get there.” According to Mylan Denerstein, another top aide in both the attorney general’s and the governor’s office, “He is fixated on accomplishments and results. He’d always walk around the office saying he wanted to hear ‘-ed’ words from his staff—‘completed,’ ‘filed,’ ‘accomplished’—not ‘-ing’ words—‘trying,’ ‘working,’ ‘hoping.’ ” In line with these priorities, Cuomo, as attorney general, succeeded more frequently in negotiating settlements in major investigations than in filing long-shot lawsuits. He obtained a major reform of student-loan practices from eight leading lenders and won an agreement for pharmacies to give prescription information in languages besides English. Since attorneys general can pick and choose among issues to pursue, and the public has few expectations for them, the job carries few political risks, and has been a common stepping stone to the governorship.","626","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo found ways to afflict Spitzer. After news broke that Joseph Bruno, then the Republican leader in the Senate, might have used state aircraft for personal purposes, Cuomo launched an investigation. He cleared Bruno of wrongdoing but excoriated Spitzer for using the controversy to gain political advantage over Bruno. And when Spitzer’s reputation imploded, in a prostitution scandal, forcing him to resign after little more than a year, Cuomo was one step closer to the top position. David Paterson, thrust suddenly into the top job, fared little better than Spitzer—again, without much help from Cuomo. Paterson was accused of covering for an aide accused of domestic violence and, in a separate matter, accepting free Yankees tickets. As the state’s chief law-enforcement officer, Cuomo might have offered a lifeline to the newly installed governor, but he let Paterson suffer. Amid chaos in Albany, and a fast-sinking national economy, Paterson decided against running for his own term as governor in 2010. Cuomo ran, and won by a wide margin.","627","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The design of the New York State Capitol, which was completed on the crest of an Albany hillside in 1899, borrows from most of the leading architectural styles of the previous millennia, none entirely successfully. But Andrew Cuomo loves the building in all its Romanesque-Gothic-neoclassical-Victorian glory. He’s been a regular in its corridors since his father became secretary of state, nearly four decades ago. Upon taking the governor’s office, in 2011, Cuomo insisted that a renovation, which had been creeping along for eleven years, be completed within a year. “The place smelled like a New York subway in the seventies,” he told me. “It was intolerable.”","628","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In 1995, George Pataki cut off public access to the corridors of the second floor of the capitol, where he and his staff worked. Cuomo reopened the space to the public and supervised a renovation of what’s known as the Hall of Governors. There are portraits of Cuomo’s predecessors (except Spitzer), cabinets of mementos from their tenures, and, stencilled on the walls, a time line of significant events in New York history. To wander that hallway is to recognize that for much of American history the governorship of New York served as a kind of proto Vice-Presidency, carrying with it the expectation of a run for the White House. Some governors won (Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Roosevelt), some lost (Charles Evans Hughes, Al Smith, Thomas E. Dewey, Nelson Rockefeller), and some went on to other forms of distinguished service (John Jay, Herbert Lehman, Averell Harriman). With a few exceptions, they were consequential men. (They have all been men.)","629","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the cabinet devoted to Mario Cuomo’s twelve years, there are three printed items: a 1988 message from Cuomo to the Legislature announcing the “Decade of the Child”; the first of Cuomo’s twelve vetoes of the reinstitution of the death penalty in New York; and a book of his speeches, which is open to a 1984 address at Notre Dame, in which he described his effort to reconcile his Catholic faith with his support for abortion rights. These are honorable achievements, but modest in scope. Mario was somewhat defensive about a legacy defined more by talk than by action; he called his book of speeches, with some exaggeration, “More Than Words.” Through the sleepy Pataki years, and the brief, chaotic reigns of Spitzer and Paterson, there are few landmarks noted in the Hall of Governors. There is already one for Andrew Cuomo, however: “2011: New York grants marriage equality for all citizens.”","630","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After the same-sex-marriage victory, Cuomo became a hero in the gay community, and he was invited to be honored at the annual dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, in Washington. His only obligation would have been an eight-minute speech, and the event presented a priceless opportunity for a politician with national ambitions to meet with some of the most important Democratic fund-raisers in the country. Cuomo declined.","631","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"“Maybe I’ve overdone it, but that Presidential phenomenon got my father into a lot of trouble,” Cuomo told me. (Mario Cuomo vacillated about running for President, especially in the 1992 cycle.) “There’s only one good way to deal with it: ‘I’m running for President, I’m telling you now, before you ask, that I’m running. Goodbye.’ ” He went on, “The protracted expectation, the flirtation, is very harmful, because fundamentally what I have is my relationship with the people in the state. And they’re suspicious of my ego and my ambition. And as soon as you put in their head, ‘Maybe he wants to be President and that’s why he’s doing this, to be President,’ I believe your whole relationship changes.” Speaking of the press, he said, “I have bent over backward not to give them anything, because that’s what they want to write.”","632","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The question of Cuomo’s ambition for the White House is largely moot for 2016, because Hillary Clinton, also a New Yorker (of sorts), is the presumed Democratic nominee. Cuomo has not officially taken himself out of the running, and he is stepping up his international travel, including a forthcoming trip to Cuba, but there is no Cuomo campaign operation, and there probably will not be one during this cycle. (A new biography of Cuomo, by Michael Shnayerson, will be published in March; the book is premised on a possible race for the White House.) Still, even among Cuomo’s friends and advisers there seems to be little enthusiasm for a Presidential run. The Governor’s reclusive public profile, many agree, makes him ill-suited to running for national office. “Andrew will not run for President,” a former aide told me. “He’d have to talk to too many people.”","633","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Silver’s arrest has already scrambled Cuomo’s plans for his second term. Political corruption in Albany has proved to be varied, as well as enduring; in recent years, legislators have been accused of taking bribes and kickbacks, and engaging in sexual harassment and assault, as well as, like Silver, exploiting their office in connection with outside earnings. Cuomo gave a speech last week promising (again) to tighten rules on legislators’ outside activities, but the culture of the capitol is notoriously resistant to change. Otherwise, Cuomo plans a strong push to remove failing public-school teachers, a move that is opposed by unions (and their allies in the Working Families Party). Cuomo will look for opportunities where he can find them. “I don’t operate in a vacuum,” he told me. “I deal one year at a time, in reaction to the times.”","634","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s transactional approach extends not only to issues but also to individuals; he tends to have nonaggression pacts rather than alliances. As HUD Secretary, Cuomo hired Bill de Blasio to be his New York representative, and, now that de Blasio is the mayor of New York City, the Governor appears determined to remind him of his continuing junior status. When the two men differed over charter schools (Cuomo is an enthusiastic backer, de Blasio is more skeptical), the Governor supported a multi-million-dollar television campaign against the Mayor’s position. Cuomo and Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, jointly control the Port Authority, which operates the bridges, tunnels, and airports of the New York metropolitan area. Cuomo refrained from attacking Christie during the scandal involving the closure of an approach to the George Washington Bridge; Christie, although he was chair of the Republican Governors’ Association, did not campaign for Cuomo’s opponent or offer him financial support. As part of a deal to obtain the endorsement of the Working Families Party last year, Cuomo promised to campaign for Democrats to take control of the Senate; he did almost nothing to that end. “It’s clear that Cuomo doesn’t really want a Democratic Senate,” Zephyr Teachout, his primary opponent, said. “He’d rather be the power broker between the two houses rather than see actual progressive legislation passed.”","635","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In light of his father’s illness, Cuomo’s celebration of his reëlection was muted, his attention sometimes distracted. One day in December, at a gaggle outside his office in the capitol, a reporter asked him a question about raising tolls on the Thruway. Cuomo dodged, saying that some people thought the rates should rise, and some people thought otherwise. A reporter in the back of the scrum yelled out, “But what does Governor Cuomo think?”","636","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo looked up and said, “I don’t know. I haven’t asked him.” Then, with a half-smile, he added, “I thought you were asking about my father.”","637","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"As Mario Cuomo’s life slipped away in the final days of 2014, his elder son was a frequent presence by his side. “He’d sleep for, like, twenty minutes and he’d be up, and this was the constant cycle,” Andrew told me. “So it actually worked, because I could go at five in the morning or I could go at two in the morning, but I was going every morning and every night.” Andrew wanted his father to be healthy enough to hold the Bible at his swearing-in, on New Year’s Day. “I said to him, ‘You have to exercise your upper body, because you have to hold the Bible. You have to hold the Bible.’ ” As father and son talked, Mario had a question: Which version of the Bible?","638","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Mario Cuomo was the rare politician who might actually have an informed preference on Biblical liturgy. “We used to argue about the versions of the Bible,” Andrew said. “We spent a lot of time separating the findings of the management of the Church from Jesus’ teachings. So what Bible we’re talking about was important, because some Bibles are more interpretive, some are purer. He wanted the more verbatim, from Jesus. Because that was his whole point—that he had issues with the management of the Church, but he had no issue with the owner of the franchise.” They settled on the King James.","639","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Andrew planned two inauguration ceremonies on New Year’s Day—the one at the World Trade Center, and the other in Buffalo. As the day drew near, Mario confessed that he was too weak to hold the Bible. Andrew recalled, “New Year’s morning—I’m on the way to the inauguration, and I stop by, I thought I’d take one more chance—I said, ‘Come on.’ I said, ‘Let’s go. You don’t have to hold the Bible, but why don’t you come?’ And he said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘I told you I can’t go. But I’ll be right here.’ ” So Andrew made him an offer. If Mario felt up to it, Andrew would take him along to Buffalo: “And he loved Buffalo, my father. Buffalo was probably the worst-off part of the state for a lot of years. And the Buffalo Bills were always an underdog, so he was very drawn to Buffalo, as am I.” Mario watched the World Trade Center speech on television, with Andrew’s sisters, but he didn’t say anything about going to Buffalo, so Andrew went on without him.","640","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After Andrew gave the second version of his inaugural address, in Buffalo, in the late afternoon, he stepped down to greet guests at the ceremony. “It’s a small room, you came off the stage, I had just gotten sworn in, I had to shake hands,” Andrew recalled. A state trooper approached him and said, “You have to go home right away.” When Andrew asked why, someone said, “Your father died.” Mario Cuomo was eighty-two.♦","641","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"

"By issuing a preliminary injunction blocking President Obama’s new immigration policy just a couple of days before it was due to go into effect, Judge Andrew S. Hanen, a conservative George W. Bush appointee who sits on a federal court in Brownsville, Texas, has dented the hopes of millions of undocumented aliens and turned himself into a hero of the right.","February 17, 2015","690","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"“President Obama abdicated his responsibility to uphold the United States Constitution when he attempted to circumvent the laws passed by Congress via executive fiat, and Judge Hanen’s decision rightly stops the President’s overreach in its tracks,” Greg Abbott, the new Republican governor of Texas, said in a statement hailing the ruling. “The District Court’s ruling is very clear—it prevents the President from implementing the policies in ‘any and all aspects.’ ” Late last year, when Abbott was serving as the state attorney general, he filed a lawsuit in which Texas and sixteen other states challenged the President’s announcement that the federal government would no longer seek to deport undocumented parents of children born in the United States—a policy shift that would have lifted the threat of forced removal from about four million people. (The number of states involved in the suit eventually rose to twenty-six, mostly G.O.P. run.) Ted Cruz, the junior senator from Texas, echoed Abbott’s comments, saying, “The Texas court decision … is a major turning point in the fight to stop Obama’s lawless amnesty…. Last summer, we saw a humanitarian crisis on our southern border that was a direct consequence of Obama’s previous amnesty. Republicans are now standing together to try to insure that it never happens again.”","691","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"

"If that last sentence was a shout-out to Judge Hanen, who was appointed to the bench in 2002, it was surely justified. Known in Texas as a vigorous enforcer of immigration laws, Hanen, contrary to Abbott’s suggestion, was careful not to get drawn into the question of whether President Obama has the constitutional authority to enact a big change in immigration policy without the approval of Congress. As I pointed out when Obama initially announced the plan, last November, most legal experts believed that the White House was on firm ground, constitutionally speaking.","693","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"Rather than ruling on whether Obama violated the Constitution, Hanen based his opinion, which runs to a hundred and twenty-three pages, on a much narrower issue: Did the Department of Homeland Security, in preparing to enact the President’s policy change, fully follow the laws governing the introduction of important new administrative rules by federal agencies? No, Hanen said, and argued that by failing to provide for a public comment period about the new deportation procedures, in which interested parties could register their support or their concerns, the department had violated the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. Therefore, the new procedures had to be halted before they went into effect.","694","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"On the basis of this narrow ruling, immigration policy is now on hold for an indefinite period. The Administration’s appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, could take many months to resolve, and whichever way that court rules the case may well go all the way to the Supreme Court. If D.H.S. decides to hold public hearings about the new policy, as Hanen says it should have done, it could take up to a year.","695","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"In Washington, where every day provides another opportunity to wage partisan warfare, twelve months is an eternity. The ruling had barely been issued when attention shifted to the battle du jour, which just happens to be over immigration reform and the funding of the Department of Homeland Security. Fearful that the new rules about deportations would go into effect before Hanen or anybody else had a chance to stop them, the Republicans have been threatening to defund the entire department unless the new funding bill includes measures designed to gut immigration reforms. Democrats, relying on a filibuster, have refused to allow such a proposal to advance.","696","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"On the basis of what passes for common sense outside the Beltway, you might suspect that the Republicans, once Judge Hanen had done their work for them, would declare victory and move onto other issues. But no. “We will continue to follow the case as it moves through the legal process,” Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. “Hopefully, Senate Democrats who claim to oppose this executive overreach will now let the Senate begin debate on a bill to fund the Homeland Security department.” Translated into English, this means that Republicans are still threatening to close down the department at the end of next week if they don’t get their way. Or, in the words of Ted Cruz, “At a time when we face grave national-security threats, at home and abroad, it is the height of irresponsibility for the Democrats to block this funding in an extreme attempt to save Obama’s amnesty, which a federal judge has just declared illegal.”","697","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"Only in the upside-down world of Washington does refusing to accept “you win” as an answer make sense. Boehner may have been reëlected handily at the start of the year, but he still needs the support of rank-and-file G.O.P. members, many of whom campaigned vigorously against any suggestion of amnesty for the undocumented. Just a few weeks into a new term, the Speaker can’t risk being outflanked on the right. And so it’s onward into battle.","698","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"It barely needs saying that, from a longer-term perspective, the Republicans’ attitude toward immigration policy is mightily self-destructive. If they shut down the Department of Homeland Security, an arm of government that a Republican President created to protect the citizenry from terrorist attacks, the public backlash will be immediate and savage. And if Republicans, in the months ahead, stick with a posture toward undocumented immigrants that Hispanics and other minority groups perceive as unremittingly hostile, they will be gravely undermining their prospects in 2016. The hopes of the Democratic candidate, whether it is Hillary Clinton or somebody else, rest on getting a big turnout. And in Hispanic areas, there is no surer way of generating a big turnout than by stoking concerns about immigration policy.","699","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"Many Republicans know this, of course. Jeb Bush, reacting to Judge Hanen’s ruling on his Facebook page (which serves as the principal communication vehicle for his nascent campaign), sought to shift the blame to Obama, accusing him of overstepping his authority and failing the leadership test. “The millions of families affected across the country deserve better,” Bush said. “Now, more than ever, we need President Obama to work with Congress to secure the border and fix our broken immigration system.”","700","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"The G.O.P. front-runner will need to do better than that. Back in June, 2013, the Senate, with the encouragement and involvement of the White House, passed a comprehensive immigration bill that had the support of fourteen Republicans, including John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Marco Rubio. The legislation included funds for twenty thousand new border-patrol agents and seven hundred miles of electric fencing. And it provided a convoluted, thirteen-year pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who could show that they had obeyed the law and paid their taxes. It died in the House of Representatives, and eventually the White House looked for a way to do an end-run around Congress.","701","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"If Boehner and his colleagues resurrected and passed the Senate bill tomorrow, Obama would sign it in an instant. It’s not going to happen, of course, and that’s why Hanen’s ruling, although it has given Republicans something to cheer about, could end up helping to deprive them of the White House. If the new deportation system were to go into effect as planned, it would have been up and running for more than eighteen months come Election Day, and there wouldn’t have been any real prospect of it being reversed. Like Obamacare, another Republican hate object, it would have become a fact on the ground.","702","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"

"In July, 1953, a former Communist named Manning Johnson testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee about the menacing implications of Bolshevism in American life. He warned that Communists had infiltrated civil-rights organizations, making it difficult to distinguish the movement for racial equality from the movement for centralization and wealth redistribution. The civil-rights movement was often accused of Communist subversion, so little about the appearance warranted particular notice, save for one fact: Johnson was African-American. Black critics howled accusations of racial betrayal, but Johnson was engaged in something subtly different and vastly more interesting: desegregating the American tradition of paranoia.","March 10, 2015","704","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"

"It’s tempting to see Ben Carson—neurosurgeon, notable black success, conservative pundit, and coquettish potential Presidential candidate—as this election’s Herman Cain: the black conservative whose mere presence inoculates other Republicans from charges of racism as they attack Obama. The ability to provide that kind of racial cover may be part of the reason for Carson’s prominence in the party, but it’s not its overriding rationale. Instead, Carson is heir to the tradition of people like Manning Johnson and George Schuyler, the black conservative who defended Joseph McCarthy even after McCarthy’s fellow Senate Republicans rejected his conspiratorial canards. To the broad public, Carson’s crackpottery—his argument that the sexual behavior of prisoners proves that homosexuality is a choice, his contention that Obamacare is the biggest travesty to befall the nation since slavery, his theory that Obama may declare martial law and cancel the 2016 elections—disqualifies him from being taken seriously. But, for the small segment of the population that he is concerned with, those statements are assurances that they are not monochromatically white. Carson is a black representative and standard-bearer, not for conservatives but for paranoid Americans.","706","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"Carson first attracted mainstream attention when, in February, 2013, he delivered the keynote speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, which he prefaced several times with warnings about his disdain for political correctness. Carson, as is his habit, opened with the impressive details of his personal biography: the impoverished childhood in a single-parent household, in Detroit; the moral values inculcated in him by his illiterate but fiercely protective mother; the against-the-odds success that validates his creed of hard work, godliness, and education. With President Obama seated just feet from him, he went on to warn of the dangers of the federal deficit, advocate a flat tax based upon Biblical tithing, and endorse private health-care accounts that would replace the Affordable Care Act.","707","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"While Internet commentators hailed Carson’s speech for “wiping the smile off Obama’s face,” the President’s countenance would have been more aptly described as expressing a default neutrality. None of Carson’s comments marked him as exceedingly conservative; it wouldn’t be difficult to find Democrats who share those sentiments. In fact, Carson’s Booker T. Washington-esque prescriptions of personal virtue as a cure for poverty are almost identical to the arguments that Obama himself deploys when talking to black audiences. Nor do these admonishments encompass the entirety of Carson’s thinking on matters of race. The National Prayer Breakfast speech became the basis for his book “One Nation,” in which he criticizes racial profiling:","708","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"Even with the false note of evenhandedness, in which Martin’s death is the product of shared racism, this marks a departure from the reactionary arguments made by other black conservatives, like Carol Swain, in which Martin was seen as essentially responsible for his own death. And, at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, Carson urged congressional Republicans to create an alternate plan to insure health benefits for poor people before dismantling Obamacare. He is not among those who feel that the government has no role in insuring that the poor have access to health care.","709","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"Yet if Carson is only moderately conservative, he’s radically paranoid. His rhetoric betrays a sweaty-palmed fixation on government power, and a fear that President Obama has made himself into an American Caesar. Those fears are most clearly manifested in his tendency toward hyperbolic comparison. From his somewhat nuanced take, in “One Nation,” on Trayvon Martin’s death, Carson goes on to argue that the liberal disdain for black conservatives is as pernicious as Jim Crow. At the Values Voter Summit in 2013, he compared the Affordable Care Act to slavery, and argued that both are mechanisms of government control. This is part of a world view in which homosexuality is a matter of volition and possibly a product of a willful, covert effort to subvert traditional values. This is why Carson is able to reconcile support of civil rights for African-Americans with their denial to gays and lesbians, as he stated on CNN last week. African-Americans are not, after all, black on purpose.","710","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"The most relevant comparison for Carson isn’t to Cain but to Michele Bachmann, the last Presidential aspirant who, despite membership in a group with a history as targets of discrimination, came to represent the twitchy ideals of American panic. Carson has written of his youth, “Many of the whites in those days found ways to rationalize their unjust treatment of fellow human beings, arguing that they were not racists but rather protectors of traditional values.” Carson’s presence as a potential Presidential candidate represents a triumph, albeit a cynical one, over those rationalizations. He’s moved the country one step closer to that moment when we will be measured not by the color of our skin but by the content of our conspiracy theories.","711","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"When Rand Paul launches his campaign for President today, in a speech in Louisville, he is unlikely to talk about serving as an Army general or, for that matter, saving the lives of Naval officers in the South Pacific. Nor will he speak of publishing a newspaper, leading one of the nation’s most prestigious universities, or directing the C.I.A. That, of course, is because he’s done none of these things; these were the qualifications of candidates in previous Presidential elections. What Rand Paul actually did in the years before 2011, when he took office as the junior senator from Kentucky, was to work as an ophthalmologist and to moonlight, in the off-hours, as an anti-tax activist.","April 7, 2015","712","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"

Whatever Paul’s liabilities might be in the battle for his party’s nomination, his lack of experience does not appear to be one of them. He is, after all, hardly alone; the field is full of neophytes. Other than Jeb Bush, not one of the serious Republican contenders played a meaningful role in our national life before 2010, the year that Paul and Marco Rubio—who will announce his own candidacy next week in Miami—ran for the Senate. Scott Walker was elected governor of Wisconsin that same year. Ted Cruz has been in the Senate only since 2013—though it seems longer, because he hasn’t stopped talking since he got there.","713","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"

"Sifting through these candidates’ speeches, one finds few indications of past experience—little use, even, of the past tense. To the extent that they have anything to say about their own lives, it concerns, in most cases, their childhoods. They stress, in practiced fashion, their modest roots. Rubio describes himself as the “son of a bartender and a woman who worked in a hotel.” Walker tells audiences that he is the “son of a small-town preacher and a mom who was a part-time secretary.” (In the opening passage of his budget address in February, he offered even humbler detail: “Mom was raised on a farm where they didn’t have indoor plumbing.”) Cruz, meanwhile, dedicated the first six minutes of his announcement speech last month to stories about his parents’ struggles, and said more about them than he did about himself.","715","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"Paul’s upbringing, by contrast, is double-edged. His father, Ron Paul, is, of course, an icon of the libertarian right, which confers, on the son, a certain kind of credibility—just not the hard-won, hardscrabble kind that candidates since Andrew Jackson have sought. At the Conservative Political Action Conference, in February, Rand Paul allowed a bit opaquely that “I was born into the America that experiences and believes in opportunity.” (If you thought he was from the America that doesn’t believe in opportunity, you were wrong.) He has had little else to say about his life, or life’s work, prior to his decision that it merits his leading the free world. The aptness of ophthalmology as a metaphor for national leadership (“I see a great nation,” as F.D.R. said) remains, at this point, unexploited.","716","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"Paul is not the only Republican who appears unsure whether, or how, to talk about his work experience. Ted Cruz has spent almost all of his adult life as a litigator—in private practice and as solicitor general for the state of Texas, from 2003 to 2008. In that role, Cruz helped lead the fight to establish an individual right to bear arms and to defend the constitutionality of a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. All in all, it is a career that would make him a strong choice for attorney general in somebody else’s Administration, a little lower on the org chart than he’s aiming. Marco Rubio could make something of his career as a state legislator (and stint as House speaker) in Florida, and probably will; it’s the only experience he’s got.","717","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"Scott Walker should have a stronger claim of executive experience than Rubio, Cruz, or Paul—governors, as a rule, are expected to decide things and do stuff (which is conduct unbecoming of a United States senator). And Walker does have a standard rap about what he’s accomplished in Wisconsin: mostly that he’s “put the power back in the hands of the hard-working taxpayers” (except the hands that hold union cards). Yet Walker’s attempts to inflate his credentials have only diminished them, comically so. His much-derided comment that battling public-sector unions is good training for fighting terrorists (“If I can take on a hundred thousand protestors, I can do the same across the world”) was a warmup, it turned out, for his also-derided claim that his tenure as a teen-age Eagle Scout led him to “be prepared” for the dispatch of soldiers into battle. There is not, alas, a badge for troop deployment, but there ought to be one for skill at self-parody.","718","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"Jeb Bush has plenty of experience, but admits it only under duress. In a Q. & A. session at CPAC, Sean Hannity pressed Bush to talk about his two terms as governor of Florida. “Here’s the record,” Bush answered a bit testily. “And it’s a record that may be hard for people to imagine, because it’s a record of accomplishment, of getting things done.” This is precisely the problem; some of the things Bush got done then or has supported since—immigration reform, Common Core standards—provoke fits in Republican primary voters. Bush’s reluctance to talk about his governorship—paired with his pained ambivalence about his family name—gives his candidacy a feeling of disconnectedness, an emptiness at its core. “It can’t be about the past, can’t be about my mom or dad or brother,” Bush told Hannity. What it can be about remains an open question.","719","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"The Republicans’ résumés—Bush’s excepted—are not notably thinner than Barack Obama’s was in 2008. For all his appeal as a candidate, plenty of Democrats did wonder whether a man who’d never run anything but the Harvard Law Review was actually prepared to be President. This was the thrust of Hillary Clinton’s campaign (“ready on Day One”) that year as well as John McCain’s (“I know how the world works”). Obama turned those opponents’ experience against them, rendering each one as a weary embodiment of the status quo. His inexperience underscored the entire rationale of his candidacy—its novelty, the break it represented with the past. Obama calculated, rightly, that he had little to gain by spending another term or two in the Senate.","720","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"But as Rand Paul and his peers hasten to point out, none of them is like Obama. The point of gaining experience is not to acquire credentials, or wear different, increasingly impressive hats, or learn how to do things like run a complex organization or operate heavy machinery, but to learn from it—to test ideas and abandon the dumb ones, to evolve, to improve. Some leaders, like Obama, gain that kind of insight by their mid-forties; others never do. The troubling thing about Rand Paul and the other Republican hopefuls is their indifference—indeed, their proud resistance—to the kind of experience that broadens one’s perspective and changes one’s mind. Paul “is exactly the same person he was 25 to 30 years ago,” a former aide to Paul’s father told a reporter on the eve of today’s announcement. “He hasn’t really changed.” Only at a high-school class reunion or in a Republican Presidential primary would that be meant as a compliment.","721","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"

On Tuesday, he launched jebemails.com, which hosts the first chapter of a new e-book featuring e-mail exchanges from his eight years as the governor of Florida. “Some are funny; some are serious; some I wrote in frustration,” Bush writes on the home page. “But they’re all here so you can read them and make up your own mind.”","February 10, 2015","722","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"

"Actually—just as you’d expect from a nascent campaign that is already showing considerable discipline—the e-mails appear to have been carefully selected to make Bush appear to have been attuned to the concerns of ordinary Florida voters. Nonetheless, the e-mails do highlight something important about Bush and how his Presidential campaign is likely to unfold. In the early stages of a contest set to feature Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, to name but two G.O.P. rabble-rousers, Bush has often been portrayed as moderate—someone willing to confront party ultras on issues like immigration and same-sex marriage. But that’s not necessarily how Bush sees himself, and, as his e-mails confirm, it’s not what he projected when he entered the Florida governor’s mansion in 1999. Then, as now, he viewed himself as an energetic conservative reformer, with the emphasis on conservative.","724","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"After being narrowly defeated in the 1994 gubernatorial election, Bush ran again in 1998, pledging to reduce the state’s tax burden, which was already low compared with that in some parts of the country, and to downsize the state’s payroll, which he described as a chronic drag on economic growth. “One of our goals should be to have fewer government employees each year we are serving,” he wrote in an e-mail to his staff, dated December 19, 1998. “Labor has huge potential to be reduced, possibly in half.” This animus toward public employees stayed with him. “I look forward to the time when these buildings of government are empty … silent monuments to the time when government played a larger role than it deserved or could adequately fill,” he said in his second inaugural address, delivered in January, 2003.","725","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"Indeed, Bush’s anti-government, pro-business instincts informed virtually all of his time as governor. He promised to get rid of regulations that restricted new developments. He said he’d take on the teachers’ unions by introducing choice and increasing the use of standardized testing in public schools. And he set out to reform the state-run Medicaid program. During his two terms in office, he followed through in all of these areas.","726","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"Bush also pushed through the biggest tax cuts in Florida’s history, vetoed spending increases that had been approved by the state legislature, and reduced the number of public-sector employees by about seven per cent. He required all schoolchildren to be tested regularly, initiated the performance-grading of their schools, and introduced a voucher system for charter schools, which the state’s Supreme Court struck down, in 2006. On the health-care front, he introduced a pilot program that allowed Medicaid recipients to select from a range of commercial health-care plans. Democrats, and some medical providers, accused him of following an ideologically driven agenda of privatization and cost-cutting that would end up harming patients. Conservatives hailed his reforms as a model for the rest of the country.","727","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"In short, Governor Jeb Bush wasn’t some sort of wishy-washy moderate. In a state traditionally dominated by a powerful legislature, he was, in the words of the University of North Florida political scientist Matthew Corrigan, “the first governor in Florida history to combine a strongly conservative agenda with an activist approach to government.” Last year, Corrigan published a book about Bush’s governorship, “Conservative Hurricane: How Jeb Bush Remade Florida.” It followed that of another academic, Robert Crew, of Florida State University, who published “Jeb Bush: Aggressive Conservatism in Florida,” in 2009. The two authors differ in their conclusions—Corrigan writes that Bush’s reforms were “long lasting and important,” while Crew is more skeptical—but they agree that, far from adopting the centrist template used by Mitt Romney and other moderate G.O.P. governors, Bush was a conservative whirlwind.","728","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"If he were elected President, there is no reason to doubt that he would pursue an equally activist and conservative agenda.

Bush.","729","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"The unresolved question is which policy areas a third President Bush would emphasize. Because of widespread opposition to the mathematics and English-language-arts standards known as the Common Core, which Bush strongly supports, education reform would present a problem for him. Immigration reform, another of Bush’s pet issues, is equally problematic. As for the old standby of pledging to cut taxes, which he did successfully in Florida, the Republican Party has been struggling for years to demonstrate that such cuts can be reconciled with balancing the budget. And the proposition that all deficits are bad isn’t one that any of the G.O.P. candidates in 2016 is likely to question.","730","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"In this environment, Bush’s task is to carve out an economic message that resonates with a wide swath of voters and also has some credibility. In Detroit, he spoke in generalities, earning poor reviews in some quarters, even as he was praised in others for being cagey. Still, the language he used was instructive. Accepting the terms of public debate set down by decades of wage stagnation, he identified an “opportunity gap” and said, “Far too many Americans live on the edge of economic ruin. And many more feel like they’re stuck in place, working longer and harder, even as they’re losing ground.”","731","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"Having identified the challenge, Bush, on this occasion, failed to meet it. As a way of boosting incomes and encouraging individual effort simultaneously, other ambitious Republicans, such as Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan, have proposed expanding the earned-income tax credit, which is effectively a federal wage subsidy for low-paid workers. If Bush knows about this proposal (and he surely does), he didn’t mention it. Indeed, conspicuously lacking from his presentation was any acknowledgement that a reformed tax and benefits system could help to tackle the economic problems he identified. Rather than engaging with a topic that is keenly discussed among self-identified “reform conservatives,” he fell back on G.O.P. boilerplate: bashing the government and raising the spectre of mass welfare dependency.","732","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"Citing the example of Detroit, he argued that “decades of big-government policies” had undermined the case for top-down measures designed to bolster economic opportunity. “Government inefficiency isn’t just irritating,” he said. “It’s instructive. If the government can’t collect parking fines or sell snacks on a train, why would government know how to enable every citizen to move up in life?” The answer, of course, was that supporters of government activism wouldn’t know how to help. “Instead of a safety net to cushion our occasional falls, they have built a spider web that traps people in perpetual dependence,” Bush continued.","733","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"To have a serious chance of becoming President, he will have to go beyond such applause lines. Under the banner of promoting more rapid and evenly divided economic growth, he’ll be forced to defend whatever proposals he offers for education, immigration reform, and free trade. He’ll also need to carve out a position on Obamacare and find a tax proposal that promises something to the broad middle class but also meets the test of plausibility that Mitt Romney’s 2012 plan failed.","734","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"Nobody should take seriously Romney’s barbed hint, in his announcement that he wouldn’t run for the Republican nomination, that Bush isn’t a genuine conservative. But a Bush plan, if he gets it right, would explicitly acknowledge that the Republican Party needs to adapt its thinking to the needs of the twenty-first century, while also encompassing some of the optimism and openness to outsiders that used to define Sun Belt conservatism.","735","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"

"In December, Jeb Bush posted an update on his Facebook page which began by reporting that, over Thanksgiving, he and his family had “shared good food and watched a whole lot of football.” He added, “We also talked about the future of our nation. As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States.”","737","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The wording of the announcement was oddly diffident. It was widely known that Bush had been “actively exploring” the possibility of a campaign at least since the spring, when he started showing up at the gym in the grand Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, where he keeps his office, with a personal trainer and new workout gear. But there had been as yet no signs of a commitment. “It’s the telegraph people have been waiting for,” Jim Nicholson, a former Republican National Committee chairman and Cabinet secretary under President George W. Bush, said.","738","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The announcement inevitably renewed questions about the desirability of political dynasties and about whether Jeb was being propelled to run, in part, by fraternal rivalry. “There’s always been a friendly competition among the siblings in the family, and that’s just human nature, I suppose,” George P. Bush, Jeb’s older son, told me. As Jeb, who was the governor of Florida for two terms, has followed his brother’s career, he has also stood apart from it. “There is kind of George W.’s world, and then there’s Jeb’s world, and frankly there’s not a lot of intersection,” Mark McKinnon, who was a senior adviser to George W.’s Presidential campaigns, said. Jeb is more introverted and more ideological than both his father, George H. W. Bush, whose politics are driven more by personal associations than by doctrine, and his brother, whose conservatism is more instinctual than considered. It was Jeb who signed the nation’s first “Stand Your Ground” self-defense law, and fought to keep Terri Schiavo on life support.","739","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Now, though, as a result of the rightward shift in the Republican Party, Bush is being viewed as a moderate in the emerging Presidential field. He has strong support among the Party’s establishment and donor class, but his popularity among the current conservative rank and file is difficult to gauge. Since he left office, Bush has maintained a national profile through his work on the issue with which, as governor, he had sought to make his biggest mark: education reform. But, after leading the way in pushing a conservative vision for America’s schools, Bush is now caught in the midst of an unexpected upheaval on the issue within his own party.","740","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"His level of enthusiasm for running has also been difficult to assess. He has often cited worries about the effect that a campaign would have on his family, especially on his wife, Columba, who dislikes the role of political spouse. George P. Bush told me that it would be hard for his father to relinquish the life in business that he has led since leaving office, in 2007. “People forget that before he went into public service he was in real estate and has always had a business mind,” his son said.","741","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The family that, over three generations, has served in the White House (twice), the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the governors’ mansions of two states is also a family of businessmen. Prescott Bush was a partner at the investment bank Brown Brothers Harriman, but, even as he thrived on Wall Street, with a house in Greenwich, Connecticut, and three live-in maids, he declined to run for a vacant House seat in 1946, because he didn’t think he could afford it. He was finally elected to the Senate in 1952, at the age of fifty-seven. His son George H. W. Bush didn’t enter politics until he had become a millionaire in the Texas oil industry; he was elected to Congress in 1966, when he was forty-two. Doug Wead, who served as an adviser to both Presidents Bush, told me, “I don’t think it’s about money for money’s sake. It’s a way of defining who I am and where I sit in the history of the family: ‘Can I do it? Can I be a real man?’ Just imagine the pressure. The first step in life in the Bush family is: Can I make a million?”","742","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"After college, Jeb worked for the Texas Commerce Bank in Venezuela before returning to join his siblings—George; their younger brothers, Neil and Marvin; and their sister, Dorothy—on their father’s 1980 Presidential campaign. Jeb campaigned mostly in Florida; having learned enough Spanish to court his wife, whom he met on a high-school exchange trip to Mexico, he had become fluent while in Caracas, an asset in Miami’s Little Havana. After George H. W. Bush lost to Ronald Reagan in the primaries, Jeb and Columba settled in Miami to raise their three children—George P., Noelle, and Jeb, Jr.","743","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Armando Codina, a Cuban-American real-estate developer who had supported George H. W. Bush’s campaign, offered Jeb a forty-per-cent stake, with no money down, in his company, Codina Partners. Bush’s role was to find tenants for commercial developments, and he easily won over colleagues and clients with his unassuming manner. A few separate deals he was involved in came under scrutiny, including one with a company that sold water pumps in Nigeria, but Bush was never accused of any wrongdoing. He considered running for Congress, but, according to Peter and Rochelle Schweizer’s biography “The Bushes,” his father persuaded him to wait until he had made more money. He served as the chairman of the Dade County G.O.P. and, in 1987, became the state commerce secretary under Governor Bob Martinez but left the post less than two years later to work on his father’s successful Presidential campaign. Around that time, he decided to run for governor, and, in 1992, with his father’s reëlection in doubt, he began to focus on a gubernatorial campaign for the 1994 election. (By then, he had a net worth of more than two million dollars.) In Texas, his brother did the same, which the family viewed as an intrusion on Jeb’s more serious effort. After Bush senior left the White House, he spent far more time campaigning in Florida than in Texas.","744","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Unlike George, Jeb embraced the ascendant right-wing orthodoxy: he declared himself a “head-banging conservative”; vowed to “club this government into submission”; and warned that “we are transforming our society to a collectivist policy.” On Election Night, he lost narrowly to the incumbent, Lawton Chiles. George Bush, having shown himself to be an unexpectedly able candidate, with a more modulated tone than his brother, beat the incumbent Texas governor, Ann Richards, by more than eight points.","745","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"After the loss, Jeb returned to business, working primarily with Codina Partners again. It wasn’t clear if he would continue to pursue a political career. Tom Slade, a former chairman of the Florida G.O.P. (who died in October), told me that Bush had said, “I don’t know if I’m going to run for governor again or not, because I’d rather go settle some stuff with my wife.” Campaigning had been a strain on the family, but, Slade added, “I remember having heard Columba say, ‘Jebby really loves politics,’ and kind of sigh.”","746","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"It became apparent to Bush that he had emphasized a conservative agenda at the expense of an organizing mission in his campaign. He had focussed mainly on crime and welfare reform, and, if he were to run again, he would need “to be sure his platform was palatable to a larger community,” as T. Willard Fair, the head of the Miami affiliate of the Urban League, put it. In 1995, Bush found that platform. Early that year, he called Fair and said that he wanted to contribute some money left over from his campaign to the Urban League. Fair thought that Bush would present a check, pose for a picture, and leave. But the two men spent ninety minutes discussing the failure of the Dade County schools to educate black students, who were twenty-four per cent more likely than white students to drop out. Fair, a garrulous man with a conservative bent, told me, “Jeb said, ‘Why don’t you start a charter school?’ I said, ‘What’s a charter school?’ ”","747","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"That year, Bush found a compatible source for ideas on education when he joined the board of the Heritage Foundation, which was generating papers and proposals to break up what it viewed as the government-run monopoly of the public-school system through free-market competition, with charters and private-school vouchers. Bush found school choice philosophically appealing. “Competition means everybody gets better,” he said.","748","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"He enlisted Fair to help promote a state law authorizing charter schools, which, unlike vouchers, were gaining some Democratic supporters, including President Bill Clinton, who saw them as a way to allow educators to innovate within the public-school system. The law passed in 1996, with bipartisan support, and that year Bush and Fair founded the first charter school in the state—an elementary school in an impoverished, largely African-American section of Miami, called the Liberty City Charter School. Bush brought his mother in for classroom visits and dropped by unannounced to make sure that things were running smoothly. If he found wastepaper lying around, he’d leave it on the desk of the principal, Katrina Wilson-Davis. The message was clear, she recalls: “Just because kids are poor and at risk doesn’t mean that their environment shouldn’t be clean and orderly.”","749","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Bush decided to make a second run for governor, in 1998. He chose Frank Brogan, Florida’s education commissioner, as his running mate, and railed against the state’s graduation rate, which was about fifty per cent, and fourth-grade reading scores that were nearly the worst in the country. He unveiled the A+ Plan, which relied heavily on Heritage Foundation proposals for holding schools more accountable; it imposed a strict A-F grading system at all levels, based on students’ scores on the state’s assessment test, the FCAT, and provided additional funding to schools with good grades and stipulated that students at schools with poor grades would receive taxpayer-funded vouchers to attend private and parochial schools. This time, Bush won easily. He faced a weaker opponent than he had in 1994, but his new agenda seemed to help: he doubled his share of the black vote.","750","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Brogan, a former fifth-grade teacher and middle-school principal, was nominally in charge of the education portfolio. But Bush’s most influential adviser was Patricia Levesque, a former legislative aide to the state House Republican leadership and a graduate of Bob Jones University, the fundamentalist Christian school in South Carolina. (She greeted a new hire in Bush’s administration by asking him if he had “found a church home” yet in Tallahassee.) Brogan had drafted the A+ Plan into a bill, but Bush called for revisions to give its accountability measures a harder edge. Within months, the Republican-led legislature had passed it, providing Florida with one of the highest-stakes testing regimens in the country, and the first statewide voucher program.","751","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Some friends and associates saw personal motivations behind Bush’s initiatives. Patrick Riccards, who, as counsel for the federal government’s National Reading Panel, discussed education reform with Bush, said, “As the father of Hispanic kids, you become far more sensitive to disparities—kids who look like your kids not getting the skills they need or getting into the right colleges.” (Bush’s children attended private schools in Miami and Jacksonville.) Others detected a competitive desire to surpass his brother’s agenda in Texas. Governors around the country were taking up education reform, but the Bushes were prominent in the field. George W. Bush had initiated his program four years earlier, but it essentially built on Ann Richards’s measures to help struggling schools, such as insuring that they got adequate funding, and it had bipartisan support. It was also far less aggressive—it emphasized testing, but included fewer penalties for failing schools and steered clear of vouchers. Sandy Kress, who was a senior education adviser to George W. Bush in the White House, said that he “really thought this is mainly about improving public schools.”","752","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Jeb’s program, by contrast, was of a piece with his larger agenda to privatize state-run services, from prisons to Medicaid. He also recognized the long-term political benefits of upending the system. According to Jim Warford, a county school superintendent in North Florida, whom Bush selected to be his K-12 schools chancellor in 2003, “He saw the teachers’ unions as one of the foundations of the Democratic Party, and he saw a great advantage—that anything he could do to undercut the teachers’ union would have a political return.”","753","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Advisers to both brothers saw little evidence that they discussed the issue. “They operated through their staffs,” Warford said. “If anything, a more accurate comparison would be two N.F.L. coaches trying to steal each other’s playbooks and game plans.” But if Jeb was envious when George was elected President, in 2000, he did not express it. “If he has any of that feeling, he doesn’t show it,” Lucy Morgan, who covered him for the St. Petersburg Times and knows him socially, said. Instead, he further immersed himself in education research, and brought in national experts, such as Reid Lyon, a brain-development researcher at the National Institutes of Health, for private briefings. Even his opponents concede that he was very well informed. Dan Gelber, a Democrat who served in the Florida legislature, recalls an e-mail debate with Bush about the rating system for test scores. “We ended up having this very esoteric exchange, and I remember thinking, He either has a roomful of experts writing these e-mails or he really knows something.”","754","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"During his first term, Bush’s agenda suffered some setbacks. Voters approved a referendum capping class size at twenty-five students in high school and required smaller classes in lower grades. Courts ruled his main voucher program unconstitutional, because it sent taxpayer money to religious schools. In response, he adopted a funding model in which corporations donated to the program in return for tax credits. Still, after a term that also featured a big tax cut for wealthy Floridians, he was easily reëlected, in 2002.","755","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"By then, President Bush was implementing his signature legislation, the No Child Left Behind Act, which required schools to meet gradually higher scores on annual tests, set by the states, in order to receive additional federal funding. Jeb Bush made it known that he thought his own approach superior, because it sought to grade schools on improvements in individual students’ scores, rather than just on schools’ performance in a given year. “There were lots of conversations about the work in Texas and how Florida had improved on that,” Warford said. According to education officials, Jeb’s team had little respect for Rod Paige, the former Houston schools superintendent whom George W. Bush had named Secretary of Education. “It was a little prickly in Florida,” Sandy Kress, who worked on the implementation of No Child Left Behind, said. “It was ‘We’re going to do it our way and can do it better.’ ”","756","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Florida’s population grew by 2.5 million during Bush’s eight years as governor—almost the equivalent of adding another Miami, Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando, and St. Petersburg. Suburbs colonized the former swamplands beyond the Miami airport, the orange and palmetto groves east of Tampa, and the farmland near Fort Myers. The growth, which created jobs in construction and real estate, was fuelled, notoriously, by lax mortgage-lending practices. But it was also fuelled by charter schools.","757","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Developers of new subdivisions teamed up with companies that were opening up charter schools less as a means to innovate than as a way to benefit from Florida’s boom. The “McCharters,” as they became known, were paid for with public money—not just their daily operations but often their buildings, too, since Florida was one of a few states that allowed taxpayer revenue to be used for the construction of charters. But, as charters, the schools were free of public oversight and collective-bargaining agreements. In Osceola County, outside Orlando, a charter school was built next to a traditional public school to absorb students from an expanding subdivision—a “win-win-win for everybody,” Bush said at the ribbon-cutting ceremony.","758","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Under the 1996 law, only nonprofit groups could apply to open a charter school. To get around that, for-profit charter companies set up foundations to file the application and then hire those companies to operate the schools. The St. Petersburg Times reported that by 2002 for-profit companies were managing three-quarters of the state’s newly approved charter schools. According to the newspaper, the companies typically took at least a twelve-per-cent cut of a school’s budget—about two hundred thousand dollars a year for an elementary school and double that for a middle school or a high school. At the same time, the charters were spending about two thousand dollars less per student than traditional public schools (which received relatively low funding, by national standards), a practice that often resulted in inexperienced teachers and spartan facilities. Still, many parents were attracted by the schools’ selective aura, smaller class size, and strict behavior codes. The principal of Ryder Elementary, which served families employed at the Miami headquarters of the Ryder trucking company, explained, “We really operate like a private school.”","759","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"This struck some people as being far from the spirit of charter reform. “Should we be paying money for real-estate companies posing as charter schools?” Sherman Dorn, an education-policy expert who taught at the University of South Florida, said to me. Teachers’ unions and some Democratic legislators spoke out against the for-profit schools. But, in 2002, Bush signed a law allowing charter operators who were denied approval by local school boards to appeal to the state. In 2003, he signed a law to eliminate the state’s cap on the number of charters, which had been set at twenty-eight in the largest counties. Republican lawmakers fought to increase the amount of taxpayer money available for charter construction, and to let developers build schools using the subdivision homeowner fees that they used for pools and other amenities.","760","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Bush, like other proponents of education reform, wanted parents to have the freedom to choose from various schools. “Florida has the largest, most vibrant charter-school movement in the country,” he said at the opening of a for-profit charter high school in Fort Myers. He had no personal financial stake in the school boom, a point that his spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, emphasizes. “Governor Bush does not personally profit in any way from his education-reform advocacy work,” she said. (Bush declined to be interviewed for this article.) But some of his political allies in the state did. In 1997, Jonathan Hage, a former Heritage Foundation staffer who had helped Bush set up the Liberty City Charter School, started Charter Schools USA. Hage told the St. Petersburg Times that he had simply identified a “classic business opportunity.” Charter Schools USA, whose headquarters occupy a building across from a Jaguar dealership in the Fort Lauderdale suburbs, now manages seventy schools in seven states and has nearly three hundred million dollars in revenue.","761","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In 2004, Robert Cambo, a former Codina Partners employee who had started his own building firm, worked with Hage’s company to develop two schools. Al Cardenas, who became the chairman of the Florida Republican Party in 1999, went on to be a lobbyist for Charter Schools USA and the Florida Consortium of Charter Schools. (Until recently, he was the chairman of the American Conservative Union.) Octavio Visiedo, a Bush family friend, was the superintendent of the Dade County school system. He retired in 1996 and started a company that evolved into Imagine Schools, which now has thirty-four thousand students nationwide. Cardenas, who advised Visiedo as he set up the company, told me that the Governor’s support for the growing industry was pivotal: “Bush was helping me get the movement going.” When asked about the money to be made in for-profit charters, Cardenas said, “I don’t care about how much money someone makes. I care about how they’re educating kids. It’s kind of socialistic to decry an organization for making money. What people should be concerned about is what’s the quality of it.”","762","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The quality was difficult to assess. By 2006, Jeb’s last year in office, there were more than three hundred charter schools (for-profit and nonprofit) in Florida, with more than a hundred thousand students, most of them in big metropolitan areas such as Miami and Tampa. But the state made only sporadic efforts to track their performance. The 1996 law called for annual statewide reports on the schools, but none were produced until November of 2006. Test scores in lower grades were found to be slightly higher than at traditional public schools, and slightly lower in the higher grades. The reading test-score gap between black students and white students in elementary grades decreased at about the same rate as in traditional schools, but in the charter high schools the gap widened. However, direct comparisons were difficult, because the charters took about twenty per cent fewer low-income and special-needs students. It was even harder to track the impact of vouchers, because the private and parochial schools that accepted them were not required to administer state tests.","763","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"As Bush saw it, some schools and companies were inferior, but that situation would sort itself out over time. Kristy Campbell told me, “Expanding school choice was a priority for his administration.” However, she added, just as with traditional public schools, Bush “believes charter schools should be closed if students aren’t learning.” Frank Brogan, Bush’s lieutenant governor, told me, “The Governor is a free-market guy.” But Andy Ford, the president of the Florida Education Association, the teachers’ union that was trying to halt the spread of for-profit charters, believes that although Bush “does genuinely care about trying to make kids’ lives better,” his approach created “a closed circuit of people making a lot of money on so-called ‘reform.’ ”","764","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"By the end of Bush’s second term, fourth-grade reading scores in the state had improved sharply, though eighth- and tenth-grade scores were more middling. (Since Bush left office, gains in test scores at all levels have been relatively incremental; graduation rates have steadily increased, but they remain among the nation’s worst.) Nevertheless, Bush saw his education record as his central accomplishment. “The fact is that more kids are learning now and we’re not dumbing down the curriculum,” he said.","765","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"When Bush left office, in 2007, he and Columba returned to Miami. He signed on with a commercial-real-estate brokerage, started a management-consulting firm—Jeb Bush & Associates, with Jeb, Jr.—and joined at least four corporate boards. Again, one of the ventures he was associated with—InnoVida, a startup maker of inexpensive building materials—ran into legal difficulties, but again he was not implicated. He also became a paid adviser to Lehman Brothers, just before the financial crisis, and gave the kinds of remunerative speech that former governors tend to give.","766","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Bush continued to stay active in education policy. In 2008, he launched the Foundation for Excellence in Education, a nonprofit that promoted his reforms and urged other states to adopt similar practices. The organization, led by Patricia Levesque, holds an annual two-day, expenses-paid summit for school administrators and elected state officials. The foundation also organized a half-dozen state education commissioners—called “chiefs for change”—to promote Bush’s agenda at conferences around the country.","767","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"By this time, school reform had become a bipartisan national movement. No Child Left Behind had made its mark across the country, as local leaders, such as the mayors Michael Bloomberg, in New York, and Cory Booker, in Newark, championed their roles in raising scores, and many Democratic leaders, including the newly elected President, Barack Obama, and his Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, accepted the necessity of testing-based accountability. (The Administration’s Race to the Top initiative rewarded states that engaged in aggressive reform.) Meanwhile, as teachers and administrators struggled to meet the law’s demands, the education industry responded. For more than a century, private companies had sold textbooks and other educational supplies to public schools, but now, particularly with the advent of the Internet, the marketplace exploded. The range of new offerings included the state tests. In Florida alone, the British publishing conglomerate Pearson was paid two hundred and fifty million dollars over four years, to administer the FCAT. Then there were test-prep products, mostly digital, that promised to improve scores by helping teachers track students’ progress. (Neil Bush had entered the field, with Ignite, an education-software firm geared toward middle-school social studies, science, and math, which he started in 1999.)","768","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In 2010, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. launched an education-technology division, called Amplify. It was led by Joel Klein, who had been the New York City schools chancellor under Bloomberg. Murdoch said, “When it comes to K through 12 education, we see a five-hundred-billion-dollar sector in the U.S. alone that is waiting desperately to be transformed.” Amplify’s products include digital tablets loaded with instructional programs and games (in one, Tom Sawyer battles the Brontë sisters), for use in K-12 classes. The company says that it has sold several hundred thousand tablets to schools across the country.","769","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Companies soon came to see the Foundation for Excellence in Education as an ideal platform to promote a range of ideas and products to state officials. Murdoch gave the keynote address at the 2011 summit. In 2012, the foundation earned revenues of ten million dollars, much of it donations from education companies. Those companies sent representatives to the summits, where foundation officials set aside time for them to have “donor meetings” with the chiefs for change.","770","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Sometimes, according to e-mails obtained by the watchdog organization In the Public Interest, Levesque pitched the state commissioners on behalf of the companies. In July, 2011, she encouraged Chris Cerf, the New Jersey commissioner, to accept an offer from Dell of a demo “teacher dashboard,” a digital classroom-management system. (“Public education is a public enterprise,” Cerf told me. “But it’s also true that, like all public entities, it also relies on collaborations.”) In 2012, Levesque e-mailed Tony Bennett, the Indiana commissioner, urging him to consider an overture from Reasoning Mind, which sells a math software program for grades two through six. She told Bennett that Jeb Bush “would really appreciate you and your staff taking time to meet with” the company’s president “when you get a chance to review his curriculum.”","771","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In 2010, Bush had used the foundation to launch an initiative called Digital Learning Now, which promoted the benefits of “virtual schools,” providing online instruction. Virtual schools had once been a fringe market for families that homeschooled their children. But, as more school districts faced budget cuts and overcrowded classrooms, some required students to take classes online—in all grades, but mostly in high school—and the industry surged. The quality of instruction is uneven. Classes are typically two or three times larger than in traditional schools, and teachers, who work from home, earn much less. In 2012, the National Education Policy Center studied one of the largest virtual-school companies, K12, and found that its students lagged in math and reading proficiency and had lower graduation rates than those in traditional schools. In a statement at the time, K12 disputed the N.E.P.C.’s methodology.","772","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Yet Bush, a longtime technophile, saw in virtual schools the same revolutionary potential to expand choice that he had seen in vouchers and charters. Unions consider virtual schooling “an even bigger threat than vouchers because it’s such a disruptive idea,” he told National Review. In 2010, he convened a “digital learning council” that included virtual-school executives from around the country. It issued a report urging states to adopt industry-friendly measures, such as eliminating limits on virtual-school enrollment. Several states proceeded to do so. In Maine, according to a 2012 investigation by the Portland Press-Herald, foundation staff members essentially wrote legislation backed by the Republican governor, Paul LePage, to expand virtual schools. “I have no ‘political’ staff who I can work with to move this stuff through the process,” Maine’s education commissioner had e-mailed Levesque, after meeting her at a foundation summit. Levesque replied, “Let us help.”","773","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"One entrepreneur who had seen the potential of the school-reform boom was Randy Best, a legendarily eccentric Texan with a knack for buying and selling. While a student at Lamar University, in the nineteen-sixties, Best started a class-ring and jewelry business, which he and his partners sold for twelve million dollars. That was followed by an eclectic array of ventures: art galleries, clinics, cattle yards, oil and gas, defense and aerospace, and Girl Scout-cookie manufacturing. He spent much of his wealth on a personal natural-history collection that included a seven-foot-long Egyptian sarcophagus lid, a Siberian cave-bear skeleton, and sabre-toothed-tiger skulls from the Pleistocene period.","774","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Best had perceived a vast potential market in school reform back in the mid-nineties, when George W. Bush was governor of Texas. “There’s nothing else as large in all of society. Not the military—nothing—is bigger,” Best later told Mother Jones. In 1995, he launched Voyager Expanded Learning, a for-profit chain of after-school tutoring programs in Dallas, and started donating money to George Bush’s 1998 reëlection campaign. That year, the Governor appeared at a photo op in front of a Voyager banner, calling for twenty-five million dollars in the next year’s budget to fund for-profit after-school programs.","775","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Best hired early-reading experts who had worked on Bush’s reforms to transform Voyager into a phonics-based early-literacy curriculum. No Child Left Behind created a billion-dollar Reading First program, with the aim of improving instruction in the early grades, and federal education officials held up Voyager as a curriculum that met the program’s standards. In Texas, legislators passed an unusual mandate that required school districts to spend twelve million dollars on Voyager. By 2005, Voyager was being used in more than a thousand districts in all fifty states.","776","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The company’s extraordinary success attracted scrutiny. A 2006 Department of Education inspector general’s audit and a 2007 report by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee found that Reading First officials had been paid generous “consulting” fees by some of the companies whose services they were recommending, including Voyager. George Miller, the Democratic chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, said that the situation was “very close to a criminal enterprise.” In 2007, a major comparison of reading programs conducted by the Department of Education found that Voyager had “potentially negative effects,” because students using it showed a decline in comprehension. Best says that neither he nor Voyager officials were contacted or questioned by any regulatory or investigative bodies.","777","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"By then, Best had sold Voyager to ProQuest, a Michigan company, for three hundred and sixty million dollars. In 2007, he started another Dallas-based company, Higher Ed Holdings, later renamed Academic Partnerships, which persuades public colleges to attract more students by outsourcing to the firm their master’s-degree programs in fields such as business and education. The company puts the courses online, recruits students from a call center in Dallas, and takes a large percentage of the tuition revenue—between fifty and seventy per cent. It has contracts with more than fifty colleges nationwide, although it hasn’t been welcomed everywhere. At the University of Toledo, the education faculty blocked the contract because, as Leigh Chiarelott, then the head of the department, told me, there were serious concerns that “we’d be almost like a diploma mill.”","778","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Best needed someone to lend credibility to the company. Florida had spent heavily on Voyager during Jeb Bush’s governorship, and, in 2005, when Bush was still in office, Best spoke with him about going into the education business. By 2011, Bush had joined Academic Partnerships as an investor and an adviser, and he became the company’s highest-profile champion. Best told the Washington Post that Bush’s annual salary was sixty thousand dollars, but he did not disclose the terms of Bush’s investment stake. For the first time, Bush was making money in an educational enterprise. But Campbell, Bush’s spokeswoman, is careful to draw a distinction between his work for Academic Partnerships and his education advocacy, noting that Academic Partnerships is involved in higher education, not K-12 schools.","779","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In July, 2011, Bush sent letters to college presidents inviting them to the company’s first big marketing conference, at the Four Seasons Hotel near Dallas. Speakers included Tony Blair and the former Australian Prime Minister John Howard. Last spring, Bush recorded an infomercial inviting people to attend another Dallas conference, in March. This time, the speakers were Thomas Friedman, Fareed Zakaria, and Hillary Clinton, who opened her remarks with praise for Bush’s work on education. He was, she said, someone who “really focused on education during his time as governor in Florida and has continued that work with passion and dedication in the years since.”","780","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"As governor, Jeb Bush had been among those who noted one of the biggest problems with the No Child Left Behind law: standards varied greatly from state to state, depending on how ambitiously officials designed their tests and defined their success. In 2009, a coalition of governors and state education officials came together and, with financial support from the Gates Foundation and the implicit backing of the Obama Administration, devised a new set of standards intended to raise the calibre of instruction nationwide. The states broke into two consortia, each of which designed a set of tests around the new standards, called the Common Core.","781","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The effort was bipartisan, and, at the beginning, all but four states signed on to it. Jeb Bush was not directly involved, but he was a vocal supporter of making tests and standards more consistent across the country, as part of his philosophy of full accountability for schools. The Common Core, he said, was a “clear and straightforward” path to “high, lofty standards.” In March of 2011, he appeared onstage at Miami Central High School with President Obama and Arne Duncan, who were in town to promote the Administration’s policy. “Education achievement is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue,” Bush said. “It is an issue of national priority.” Obama thanked Bush for coming to the event, adding, “We are so grateful to him for the work that he’s doing on behalf of education.”","782","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"To avoid the standards being viewed as a federal mandate, the Administration had left their creation to the states. But it initially made states’ acceptance of them a requirement for receiving funds under its Race to the Top initiative. Conservative activists quickly seized on the standards as another example of Obama’s big-government overreach, along the lines of the Affordable Care Act. (They referred to the standards, inevitably, as Obamacore.) The Koch brothers, the talk-radio hosts Glenn Beck and Michelle Malkin, and the Heritage Foundation joined the attack. (Bush had left the Heritage board when he ran for governor the second time, in 1998.) “The élites in the Republican Party and the Democratic Party don’t get this,” a lawyer for the American Principles Project, one of the groups leading the backlash, said.","783","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In June, 2011, Jeb Bush and Joel Klein, newly installed at News Corp., co-wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed headlined “The Case for Common Educational Standards.” A month later, an e-mail went out from the Foundation for Excellence in Education to the chiefs for change, alerting them that the upcoming convention of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, with which the foundation was usually allied, was going to take up a resolution against the Common Core. The e-mail urged the commissioners to lobby legislators attending the convention to oppose it.","784","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The campaign against the standards particularly threatened Tony Bennett, the Indiana commissioner, a rising Republican who was one of the chiefs for change. In many states, the commissioners are appointed, but in Indiana they are elected. In 2012, the Tea Party organized opposition to Bennett’s reëlection; e-mails between Bennett’s office and the foundation that summer are full of alarm about the “black helicopter crowd.” In November, Bennett lost to an anti-Common Core Democrat who had Tea Party backing. Several potential Republican Presidential candidates for 2016—including the governors Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, Bobby Jindal, of Louisiana, and Mike Pence, of Indiana, all of whom had supported the Common Core—backed away from the standards, as did Florida’s governor, Rick Scott. Last April, Bush told Fox News, “Others that supported the standard all of a sudden now are opposed to it. I don’t get it.”","785","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Meanwhile, several of the chiefs for change whom Bush was relying on to promote the standards were leaving office. Early last year, New Jersey’s Chris Cerf took an executive position at Amplify, which in 2013 had won a $12.5-million contract to develop a digital library of student-assessment tools from one of the state consortia that were developing the Common Core-based tests. Such movement from the public sector to the private is routine, but it underscored a central critique of the standards from both the left and the right: that, because the new testing regime required states to buy new test-prep materials, curricula, and even computers on which to take the tests, they were essentially another sales opportunity for the education industry. A headline on the Web site of the libertarian magazine Reason in July claimed that “Common Core Is Crony Capitalism for Computer Companies.”","786","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"A decade and a half earlier, Bush had been in the vanguard on conservative school reform. But, last September, he was not invited to the Values Voter Summit, the big annual event in Washington, D.C., for Republican politicians seeking to build support among religious-right activists. Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, which hosts the summit, explained at a news conference that “Jeb is a very nice guy, but he has a challenge among real conservatives for aggressively pushing for Common Core.” He added, “That’s a huge problem.”","787","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Since Bush left the statehouse, the for-profit charter-school industry in Florida has continued to grow; the two largest chains have doubled their enrollment, to more than fifty thousand students. For-profit charters now spend half a million dollars a year on lobbying, and they contribute heavily to political campaigns. Charter Schools USA alone gave more than two hundred thousand dollars to candidates for state office in the 2012 elections. The industry so dominates the field, particularly in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas, that it has discouraged the expansion in Florida of highly regarded not-for-profit networks, such as KIPP and Green Dot. But questions about for-profit operations continue to mount.","788","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"

The company, which was founded in 1999 by two brothers, Fernando and Ignacio Zulueta, has nearly a hundred charter and virtual schools in the state. The Miami Herald reported last April that the audit is examining the company’s practice of leasing space from development firms controlled by the Zuluetas. A 2006 Miami-Dade County audit determined that this arrangement, at one cluster of Academica schools, had cost taxpayers $1.3 million.

He reiterated his support for the Common Core and school choice in a speech that was full of education bromides (“poverty is not an excuse”; “states and local communities are where the best ideas come from”). It was hard to question the conviction underlying his remarks, but his delivery was phlegmatic. Todd Lamb, a former education adviser to President George W. Bush who now works for Engrade, the digital-learning division of McGraw-Hill, said that if Jeb “had grown up in, say, rural Northern California, he would’ve become a chief academic officer for a school district.”","794","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"

On November 8, 2014, the President sent her name to the Senate as a replacement for Eric Holder, and she has yet to be confirmed—the Republican leadership has simply failed to put her nomination up for a vote by the full Senate. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, made vague, wiggly gestures about getting it done this week, but he didn’t, and unless something remarkable happens over the weekend his next opportunity will be three weeks from now. The Senate is talking about the budget next week, and will take all its time to pretend that it is making a serious effort to do something about the nation’s finances; after that comes one of those mysterious two-week congressional recesses.","801","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/if-not-loretta-lynch-then-who"
"Lynch’s confirmation shouldn’t have been a stretch. She has spent years as a prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York, and her relations with the law-enforcement community are excellent—so excellent that on Friday Rudy Giuliani, of all people, was raging about the need to confirm her. (He called her not only qualified but “over-qualified” for the job.) She seems to be more conservative than Holder. She is the daughter of a minister and a librarian, and it appears, from her many confirmation hearings, that she has a reputation for probity. She has undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard. During her confirmation hearings, her sister members of Delta Sigma Theta sat in the audience, wearing the sorority’s signature red. It took until February to get her name through the judiciary committee, but she made it, with a 12-8 vote. At the moment, various reports suggest that she will be confirmed narrowly, with the votes of the forty-six Democratic senators, four Republicans (Jeff Flake, Orrin Hatch, Lindsey Graham, and Susan Collins), and Vice President Joe Biden, who would cast the tie-breaking vote. This is what it looks like when Obama proposes a nominee for a place in his own cabinet, who won’t be on the job any longer than he is, and who is a picture of moderation.

"The four months since Lynch’s nomination is not a normal interval. Ed Meese had a longer lag before his confirmation, in 1985, counting various stops and starts, but what held him up was a need to complete a couple of ethics investigations. (And there may have been more to find: another ethics problem led to Meese’s resignation before the end of Reagan’s second term.) According to FiveThirtyEight there have been only a couple of nominees in the past four decades who’ve had to wait as long. (One of them was Gina McCarthy, now the Environmental Protection Agency’s administrator, in 2013.) The ostensible delay this week was because the Democrats noticed that the Republicans had slipped a passage into an anti-human-trafficking bill stating that, if victims got money from a compensation fund, they couldn’t use it to terminate a pregnancy. That has nothing to do with Lynch, or with anything that she might be asked to adjudicate as Attorney General; but, when the Democrats asked for a change, the Republicans said that they couldn’t have one—or a vote on Lynch until the bill went through unchanged. Before that, it was immigration: Lynch wouldn’t tell the Senate that the President had run roughshod over the Constitution by deferring the deportation of so-called DREAMers—young people who had been brought to America illegally as children and built lives here—and the President wouldn’t revoke that order to get her a vote. On Thursday, The Hill reported that the gun lobby was mobilizing against Lynch. The National Rifle Association sent out an alert, talking about “the damage an Obama-appointed, agenda-driven, anti-gun Attorney General can do to our rights and freedoms as Americans.” Dudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, told The Hill, “Given her close personal and professional ties to this lawless administration, gun owners fully expect her to be Eric Holder 2.0.”","804","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/if-not-loretta-lynch-then-who"
"The vehemence of some of the opposition to Lynch, unmoored from anything about her record or her résumé, raises the question of who her opponents see when they look at her. (“Eric Holder in a skirt,” a draft letter from the Gun Owners of America, obtained by The Hill, said.) Senator Dick Durbin, of Illinois, said Wednesday, “Loretta Lynch, the first African-American woman nominated to be Attorney General, is asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar. That is unfair. It’s unjust.” Senator John McCain replied that Durbin’s remark was “beneath the decorum of the United States Senate,” and “serves no purpose but to further divide us.” Some commentators who are supportive of Lynch worried that Durbin was being tactically unwise. And focussing on Lynch’s race assumes that the Republicans would have let a white nominee with her qualifications breeze through—as though, if only the President had made them feel a bit more comfortable, everything would have been fine. It is no compliment to them to say that they are so frenzied in their obstructionism that they might, indeed, have stalled then, too. On Friday, Eric Holder said on MSNBC that “My guess is that there is probably not a huge racial component to this, that this is really just D.C. politics, Washington at its worst.” He recognized his own odd position—though hated by Republicans, he is still on the job because of their stubbornness, and may be for a while.

"It has recently been cold in California—not as cold as in New York, but a cold that makes lingering outside unpleasant. Weather anchors spoke about “these temperatures” and “a chill right down”; a weird, L.A.-like haze rested over the San Francisco Bay, and officials temporarily banned the burning of home fires. Everyone was waiting for the wind to change. It seemed apt in this moment that Senator Barbara Boxer, who has represented California in Congress for the past thirty-two years, confirmed what had been widely assumed: she will not seek reëlection in 2016. During her ten years in the House and twenty-two in the Senate, Boxer has been known for channelling the beliefs of a progressive mainstream—sexual equality, environmental preservation, and, often, anti-interventionism—at times when they seem to have too few powerful advocates. But she also embodies a particular generation of California liberal, and her retirement from Congress marks a shift in the progressive face of the state.","January 13, 2015","806","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/barbara-boxers-california"
"Boxer joined the Senate in 1993, after a ten-year term as the congresswoman for California’s District 6, which at that point included a large swath of Marin and Sonoma Counties. This was a young redoubt of merlot liberalism—comfortable, lefty, drawn to yoga and the raising of tomatoes—and Boxer entered politics representing its mores. Her first successful political campaign, for the Marin County board of supervisors, in 1976, promised “the new politics of the mid-70s, the politics of caring about people and their environment, with an equal concern about what happens to their money”—a perfect distillation of the region’s outlook, then and now. This local program became the template for her Washington years. In Congress, Boxer was known for her popularity at home. (She won seventy-four per cent of the vote in the 1986 congressional race and nearly seven million votes in her 2004 Senate run, a record at the time.) She was a candidate suited to Democrats seasoned by the sixties: those who took issues of identity politics and sexual rights as givens, who were categorically suspicious of big, wealthy institutions (less so of big, wealthy liberals) and who saw personal passion as more crucial to the course of civic life than coalition politics. The slogan of her first congressional campaign was “Barbara Boxer Gives a Damn.” She worked, from that moment on, to prove the point.","807","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/barbara-boxers-california"

"Her preferred theatre for this project has been the congressional floor. Though the Boxer voting record has its share of noteworthy outliers—she voted against the Iraq invasion, late-nineties financial deregulation, and the expansion of foreign surveillance, all of which placed her in opposition with the senior California senator Dianne Feinstein—her yeas and nays are not those of a maverick. Her reputation as a front-guard liberal rises instead mainly from her flair for the legislative process, which in many cases has involved causing a scene. Boxer is rightly celebrated for leading a march to call for a hearing on Anita Hill’s harassment allegations before the confirmation vote on Clarence Thomas. More than fifteen years later, she stirred up controversy with her verbal sortie with Condoleezza Rice during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the escalation of troops in Iraq. (“Who pays the price?” Boxer asked. “I’m not going to pay a personal price. My kids are too old, and my grandchild is too young. You’re not going to pay a particular price, as I understand it, within immediate family.”) Her articulation of her era’s liberal conscience—she didn’t mention Vietnam in that hearing, but she made the connection elsewhere—rests near the heart of her political dynamism. And it helps to account for why, in California, where that conscience took its firmest root, she’s been heralded not just as a senator but as a kind of soldier for the cause.","809","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/barbara-boxers-california"
"In the past few years, however, the dominant liberal power culture in California has started to change. And, with Boxer’s exit from Congress, its role in national politics will change, too. The state’s rising progressives are post-sixties people. While their political genes are from the same family line—they, too, rally voters around issues like environmentalism, gun control, marriage rights, and immigration—the liberalism of today’s California has different features. Gavin Newsom, the state’s lieutenant governor, was eyed as a front-runner for Boxer’s seat until publicly declining to run yesterday (presumably to stay free for a gubernatorial campaign in 2018). He is the author of a book, “Citizenville,” that argues for, among other things, deregulation of the tech-innovation sphere. Kamala Harris, the California attorney general, who now may be the leading candidate, is famous for her center-seeking reserve and ideological circumspection; it is hard to imagine her leading a march anywhere. Whereas Boxer’s California liberalism was largely about identity politics, prickly public activism, and institutional safeguards, the new generation tends toward meritocratic logic, integrated privatization, and innovation. Boxer writes literary-esque novels in her spare time. Newsom has sought to bone up on Bitcoin.","810","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/barbara-boxers-california"
"In a bizarre self-produced video announcing her Senate exit, Boxer allowed herself to be mock-interviewed by her grandson, who is wearing shorts. “I am never going to retire—the work is too important,” she says. “But you know what? I want to come home. I want to come home to the state that I love so much, California.” Is it the state she knows? West Coast liberals like to think of themselves as a unified, chai-drinking front.

"As the 114th Congress gathered in the Capitol, Boehner did just that, and, despite opposition from a number of ultra-conservatives who have long regarded him as too moderate and cozy with the Obama Administration, he won two hundred and sixteen of the four hundred and six votes cast. In part, he had the late Mario Cuomo to thank. With a number of Democratic congressmen missing the leadership vote to attend Cuomo’s funeral, in New York, the Speaker could have lost as many as thirty-five G.O.P. members and still achieved a majority—this according to the tallies of the folks at the Washington Post’s The Fix and at Politico, anyway. But Boehner’s success isn’t purely a matter of timing. With the departure of Eric Cantor, his former number two, to the sunnier and more lucrative climes of Wall Street, Boehner lacks an obvious successor. The Republicans, and the rest of us, are stuck with him.","813","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"Which, perhaps, isn’t the worst possible outcome. Although Boehner is hardly in the tradition of Henry Clay, Sam Rayburn, and Tip O’Neill, he isn’t nearly as bad as some of the possible alternatives, such as Louie Gohmert, the Texas congressman who announced over the weekend that he would offer himself as a candidate for Speaker. (He ultimately received three votes, including his own.) If you haven’t been watching Fox News and C-SPAN closely, Gohmert’s contributions to the civic discourse may have passed you by. They include comparing President Obama to Hitler, calling for higher taxes for the poor, claiming that America is being infiltrated by “terror babies,” and warning that the U.S. military is allowing gay soldiers to sit around all day and massage each other, thereby courting ruin. (No, really, he did say that, in a television interview. A helpful post at Mother Jones details this and other Gohmert contributions.)","814","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"Compared to Gohmert and his ilk, Boehner seems like a conservative but ultimately rational member of the Rotary Club. To be sure, he mouths all the usual G.O.P. lines about President Obama usurping the constitution with his immigration reforms, and about the Affordable Care Act destroying the economy. But he has shown little enthusiasm for responding to points of contention with the drastic measures that some Republican ultras favor, such as impeachment or shutting down the government. “I don’t do anger,” he told Politico’s Glenn Thrush, whose new profile of Boehner is well worth reading.","815","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"That quote sounds a bit self-serving, but it’s hard to have entirely negative feelings about someone who grew up working at his family’s bar, dresses like an extra from “Mad Men,” spends much of his time being harried by wingnuts, and, perhaps as a consequence, seems determined to smoke himself to an early grave. Boehner’s cancer stick of choice is a filtered Camel 99, and, according to Thrush, he “smokes more or less constantly when he’s out of the public eye.” He’s also on record as saying that he likes an occasional tipple. Who doesn’t?","816","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"The question, of course, is to what end the Speaker will exercise his reconfirmed authority, such as it is. In November’s midterm elections, the Republicans picked up another thirteen House seats. They now have a majority of more than fifty, the biggest margin in almost seventy years. Moreover, many of Boehner’s members, new and old, regard the election as a referendum on President Obama’s policies. There will be immediate pressure on him to secure some policy victories over the White House.","817","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"In all likelihood, the first showdown will come over the Keystone XL pipeline, an issue on which the Republicans rightly sense indecision in the White House. The House could pass a bill authorizing construction as early as Friday. Such a bill also seems certain to pass the Senate, which now has fifty-four Republican members. Obama would then be left with the decision of whether to veto it, and Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said on Tuesday that the President would, indeed, do that.","818","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"For Boehner, Keystone is an easy one. He’s a longtime supporter of the pipeline, and he knows it also has the support of a majority of Americans, including a fair number of Democrats, particularly in southern and western states. (Last April, eleven Democratic senators sent a letter to the White House urging approval of the pipeline.) But the Keystone votes are only the beginning. Republicans in the House won’t be content with pushing for an oil pipeline, and Boehner knows it. Before long, he will be facing calls to confront the White House on Obamacare, immigration, the debt limit, and other issues that animate the conservative base of the party. And urged on by the rabble-rousers like Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, the wingers will be in no mood to compromise.","819","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"After four years as Speaker, Boehner is under no illusions about any of this. Recounting a meeting in his office in late 2013, following the government shutdown, Thrush quotes the Ohioan as saying, “We got stampeded into a fight we tried to avoid. . . . These [Tea Party] people are crazy, crazy. . . . They just want a fight.” On that front, nothing has changed.","820","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"The optimistic take is that the Speaker and the President, each of whom is seeking to create a legacy for himself, will get together and make deals on issues like trade, infrastructure, and corporate taxation. The reality, however, is one of acute polarization on most issues, which leaves party leaders with little room to maneuver. If either one, but particularly Boehner, is seen to be compromising with the other side, the furies will descend on him.","821","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"

"OBAMACARE: The Supreme Court has now heard argument in King v. Burwell, which may be the most consequential case to come before the Justices since Bush v. Gore. As is well known, the plaintiffs argued that four words in the text of the statute mean that individuals who buy insurance in the federal exchange—that is, people in thirty-four states—are not eligible for federal subsidies. The oral argument went somewhat better for the Administration than might have been expected, but the outcome is anything but certain.","827","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-threat-to-obama-from-the-courts"
"IMMIGRATION: Early this year, President Obama used his executive authority to expand his program to allow certain undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children to remain here without the threat of deportation. Most of the plan was supposed to go into effect on February 18th, but twenty-six states filed a challenge before Judge Andrew Hanen, of the federal district court in Brownsville, Texas, a noted critic of the President’s immigration policies. Hanen issued an injunction stopping the program before it started, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (which is similarly hostile to Obama) has so far declined to lift the injunction. A hearing before the appellate court is not even scheduled until April 17th, and more delays, if not the outright defeat of Obama’s initiative, are likely to follow.","828","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-threat-to-obama-from-the-courts"
"NET NEUTRALITY: Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commissions issued its long-awaited rules on net neutrality. They were a big victory for those who sought utility-style regulation, which would prohibit cable and telephone companies from speeding up, slowing down, or blocking Web traffic. On March 23rd, however, the first of what is likely to be a torrent of lawsuits were filed against the F.C.C. initiative, even before it went into effect. Other lawsuits have followed.","829","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-threat-to-obama-from-the-courts"

Last June, the E.P.A. issued its Clean Power Plan, which is designed to cut greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants by twenty-six per cent by 2020. In short order, twelve states (all Republican-dominated and reliant on coal for power) sued the E.P.A. to stop the regulations from going into effect.","830","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-threat-to-obama-from-the-courts"
"Of course, all Administrations see some of their initiatives challenged in court. The Supreme Court repeatedly rejected George W. Bush’s attempts to limit the legal rights of detainees in Guantanámo Bay. But the number and scope of the legal threats to Obama appear unprecedented. This comes in part because, these days, the extreme polarization of political opinion in Congress is reflected in the federal courts as well. On the Supreme Court and on lower courts, the differences between conservative and liberal federal judges can lead to dramatic differences in results. Sometimes, it’s worth it for challengers to roll the dice in front of the right judge.","831","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-threat-to-obama-from-the-courts"
"When I interviewed President Obama about legal matters, last year, he made another point about why litigation has become so important in contemporary Washington. He noted that there was once a time when Congress actually did pass laws to address national problems. Legislators enacted a major reform of immigration laws in 1986 and a significant addition to the Clean Air Act in 1990. But Congress has been paralyzed by partisan gridlock in recent years; its inability, or unwillingness, to address immigration is only the best known of its failures. When Congress doesn’t act, the underlying problems don’t go away—and a President will try to address them on his own. This leads to lawsuits in response. And now there are lots of them, and their verdicts will pass judgment on President Obama as much as on any individual issue.","832","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-threat-to-obama-from-the-courts"
"During the early nineteen-thirties, Bolivia and Paraguay fought a war over an arid borderland called Chaco Boreal. Congress passed a resolution permitting President Franklin Roosevelt to impose an embargo on arms shipments to both countries, and he did. Prosecutors later charged the Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation with running guns to Bolivia. The company challenged the resolution, but, in 1936, the Supreme Court issued a thumping endorsement of a President’s prerogative to lead foreign policy. “In this vast external realm, with its important, complicated, delicate and manifold problems,” the majority wrote, only the President “has the power to speak or listen as a representative of the nation. . . . He alone negotiates.” In this respect, the Justices added, Congress is “powerless.”","833","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/dangerous-gamesmanship"
"U.S. v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp. has influenced law and the conduct of foreign policy for almost eight decades, but its admonitions have made little impression on the Republicans now on Capitol Hill. They have meddled in unprecedented fashion to undermine President Obama’s nuclear diplomacy with Iran, as he seeks—with Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China—to cap Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. The most egregious example came in March, when forty-seven Senate Republicans signed an open letter to Iranian leaders, which contained a dubious analysis of the Constitution and warned the mullahs not to rely on any deal that Congress failed to approve.","834","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/dangerous-gamesmanship"
"Now a framework for a deal is in place, and many Democrats, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, support Obama’s policy. Others, like Senators Tim Kaine and Michael Bennet, have pressed the call for a congressional review of a final agreement—due on June 30th—essentially on the ground that Congress should be heard. Last week, after reaching a compromise with the White House, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted unanimously for an act that sets prospective terms for such a review.","835","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/dangerous-gamesmanship"
"Is Congress within its rights to insist on a vote? The Constitution states that the Senate must approve treaties, but the Iran deal would not be a treaty; it’s a political agreement. Congress has voted on some political agreements involving nuclear issues as a matter of course. Yet the specifics of the Iran deal make it more closely resemble the scores of diplomatic bargains short of treaties that Congress has ignored, including such important arms-control deals as the one that created the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The Foreign Relations Committee act is a measured one—it may allow only for speechmaking and largely symbolic votes. That’s why the Administration went along with it. Nonetheless, it reflects a large measure of cynical partisanship.","836","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/dangerous-gamesmanship"
"It’s true that America’s faltering strategy in the Middle East could benefit from a more open and informed debate, but the increasing willingness of Republicans to entangle foreign policy in political gamesmanship has opened a new chapter in the fragmentation of American power.

Kerry and McCain were once friendly Senate colleagues. “That’s an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries,” President Obama said, of McCain’s remarks. “It needs to stop.” It probably won’t, although that may not matter in the short run. Obama is constrained by his congressional opposition, but, with less than two years left in office and no more elections to win, he is also freer to defy it.","838","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/dangerous-gamesmanship"
"Last Tuesday, the President informed Congress that he intends to remove Cuba from the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, a further step toward the normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations. According to the State Department, although Cuba harbors some violent fugitives, including a former Black Panther convicted of murdering a New Jersey state trooper, it no longer arms or funds terrorists. Since December, when Obama outlined steps to ease travel restrictions and other aspects of the anachronistic embargo on Cuba, he has outflanked his critics. American businesses want the embargo lifted, and many second-generation Cuban immigrants are open to policy change, as many Republicans well understand.","839","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/dangerous-gamesmanship"
"Obama’s announcement that he was taking Cuba off the list triggered a forty-five-day period during which Congress can vote to reverse his decision. The White House is in a position to prevail: Obama can veto any congressional resolution he doesn’t like, on either Cuba or Iran. If he does issue a veto, the White House would need the votes of only a third plus one of the members of the House or the Senate to uphold it. Still, departures in American foreign policy as momentous as making peace with the Castro regime or resetting nuclear diplomacy with Iran ought not to be constructed on narrow vote margins in Congress. U.S. v. Curtiss-Wright helped to establish what was referred to during the Cold War as the One Voice Doctrine. That is, despite shifting disagreements between Presidents and Congress, the country should seek to project unity abroad, in order to reassure allies and deter enemies. The doctrine has flaws; it can be used to rationalize an imperial Presidency during national crises, among other things.

"The conventional wisdom is that Cruz hasn’t got a chance, and, as far as the Presidency goes, it’s probably accurate. To many Americans, he is the loudmouth who, in the fall of 2013, less than a year into his first term as a senator, helped bring the federal government to a halt. Noted for railing against President Obama and denying the existence of climate change, he holds views that, according to an analysis by the Web site FiveThirtyEight, make him “more conservative than every recent G.O.P. nominee, every ’12 contender and every plausible ’16 candidate.”","844","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"But if Cruz’s ultra-conservatism rules him out as a serious Presidential contender, it won’t necessarily work to his disadvantage in the Republican primaries, where his first goal is to distinguish himself from other right-wingers who are leading him in the polls, such as Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee, and Ben Carson. As Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich demonstrated in 2012, the conservative G.O.P. electorate is a fluid one, which falls for articulate rogues who can package age-old nostrums and prejudices in rhetoric that vaguely resembles a coherent political philosophy. Although Cruz is off to a slow start, this weakness should play to his rhetorical skills, which are superior to those of the rest of the G.O.P. field.","845","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"At Princeton, Cruz was a national debating champion (and was, according to a roommate, known to carry a book entitled, “Was Karl Marx A Satanist?”). At Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1995, he was also known as a formidable public speaker. “He had brilliant insights and he was clearly among the top students, as revealed by his class responses,” the Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz told the Daily Caller last year.","846","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"About ten hours after sending out his tweet, Cruz took the stage at Liberty University, which Jerry Falwell founded, in 1971, in Lynchburg, Virginia, and which is now the world’s biggest college for evangelical Christians. The weekly convocation at Liberty has long served as a platform for conservative Republicans, and it’s less than two hundred miles from Washington, D.C., which means that it is within easy access for the media hordes. All in all, it’s an ideal location for a conservative candidate in need of a lift.","847","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"Cruz, clad in a conservative dark suit (what else?) and accompanied by his wife, Heidi, and their two young daughters, rose to the occasion. Prowling the stage, he talked for almost half an hour without notes, casting himself as the leader of a “grassroots army” of liberty-loving Christians who would pull America back from the jaws of secular damnation. Although most of the students in the crowd were obliged to attend, Cruz appeared to engage many of them, and he avoided making any slip-ups.

"He started out by talking about his background as the son of a Cuban immigrant who fought to bring down the dictator Fulgencio Batista during the Cuban revolution, but who subsequently turned against Fidel Castro and, at the age of eighteen, decided to move to the United States. “Imagine, for a second, the hope that was in his heart as he rode that ferry boat across to Key West and got onboard a Greyhound bus to head to Austin, Texas, to begin working, washing dishes, making fifty cents an hour,” Cruz said. But the thoughts of an immigrant fifty-odd years ago weren’t the only thing that he wanted the crowd to imagine. Indeed, as the speech developed, it sounded increasingly like he was channelling John Lennon.

"Appearing to be thoroughly enjoying himself, Cruz conceded that some of his wish list might be difficult, or even impossible, to imagine. He reminded his audience that, in 1979, when Ronald Reagan started his second Presidential campaign, it would have been equally impossible to imagine the Berlin Wall coming down and the Soviet Union collapsing. “Compared to that, repealing Obamacare and abolishing the I.R.S. ain’t all that tough,” Cruz said. Then he asked the audience members, most of whom weren’t born when Reagan left office, to text the words “Constitution” or “imagine” to the number 33733.","852","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"What did that mean? Most likely that Cruz intends to run as the Howard Dean of the religious right—a tub-thumping insurgent who uses social media to outmaneuver better-financed rivals. Speaking on Fox News, Joe Trippi, the Democratic strategist who ran Dean’s campaign in 2004, said after the speech, “I thought he did a great job.” Ed Rollins, the veteran Republican operative who was once Ronald Reagan’s campaign manager, was equally impressed.

"With stagnant wages and rising inequality already emerging as key issues in the 2016 Presidential race, there is, naturally, a lot of interest in how voters view the prospect of the federal government adopting more redistributive policies, such as raising taxes on the wealthy. Intuition and rational-choice theory would suggest that, as the gap between the wealthy and everybody else increases, support for redistribution goes up. But a number of empirical studies published in recent years have cast doubt on this theory, finding that support for redistribution has remained flat, or even that it has fallen.","April 17, 2015","856","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"

Enns, of Cornell University, concluded, “When inequality in America rises, the public responds with increased conservative sentiment.” In a 2013 paper by Matthew Luttig, of the University of Minnesota, backed up this finding, noting, “the absolute level and the changing structure of inequality have largely been a force promoting conservatism, not increasing support for redistribution as theoretically expected.”","857","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"

"In the Times on Wednesday, Thomas Edsall argued, “Redistribution is in trouble, and that is likely to tie America in knots for years to come.” The Economist’s Free Exchange column this week said that “politicians betting on their Robin Hood credentials” should be wary of voters, particularly older ones, because they “may be more inclined to back the Sheriff of Nottingham.” On Friday, the Times published another piece, by Neil Irwin, that was headlined “Why Americans Don’t Want to Soak the Rich.”","859","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"On the face of it, these warnings seem justified. In addition to citing some recent academic studies, Edsall points to data from Gallup showing that, between 2006 and 2014, support for the proposition that the federal government should guarantee health-care coverage to all U.S. citizens has fallen from sixty-nine per cent to forty-five per cent. The Economist article cites a more recent study by three economists—Ilyana Kuziemko, of Princeton, and Vivekinan Ashok and Ebonya Washington, both of Yale—which says that declining support for redistributive policies is largely due to a shift in sentiment among the elderly. In the nineteen-seventies and eighties, people aged sixty-five and over were more favorably disposed to redistributive policies than the rest of the population. Today, they are less supportive than other age groups.","860","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"

Fortunately, it’s not the entire story. Although the survey data mentioned above shouldn’t be dismissed, it needs to be placed in the context of other findings suggesting that Americans have a favorable attitude to redistribution, particularly when it is couched in terms of taking from the rich rather than giving to the poor.","861","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"Last year, for example, Gallup asked a random sample of people for their views on “the way income and wealth are distributed in the U.S.” Almost seventy per cent of the respondents said that they were “very dissatisfied” or “somewhat dissatisfied” with the status quo. Fewer than one in three respondents said that they were “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied.”","862","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"O.K., you might say, but that was just a snapshot, and the survey didn’t ask about redistributive policies. What does Gallup have to say about how attitudes toward redistribution have changed over time? Quite a lot, it turns out. For the past thirty years, the polling firm has been posing two questions that specifically concern this topic.","863","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"The first question is “Do you feel that the distribution of money and wealth in this country is fair, or do you feel that money and wealth should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of people?” Since 1985, a majority of people have said that income and wealth should be more evenly distributed. The numbers have fluctuated quite a bit over the years. In the most recent survey, from 2013, fifty-nine per cent of respondents favored redistribution—a similar proportion to the first survey, thirty years ago, which found sixty per cent in favor. Yet the 2013 number represents a recent drop in support: in 2008, sixty-eight per cent of respondents said they favored redistribution. That might provide more support for Edsall’s suggestion that the Obama Administration’s policies, particularly the Affordable Care Act, have produced a backlash among some voters. Or it might confirm the theory, supported by a number of recent studies, that these days, in contrast to the nineteen-thirties, economic recessions tend to erode support for any form of government activism.","864","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"The other Gallup question is more pointed: “Do you think our government should or should not redistribute wealth by heavy taxes on the rich?” In 1985, forty-five per cent of respondents chose the option “Yes, should,” and fifty-one per cent chose “No, should not.” By 2008, the numbers had flipped, and a majority had emerged favoring heavy taxes the rich: fifty-one per cent of respondents chose “Yes, should,” and forty-three per cent chose “No, should not.” Did this more liberal attitude survive the Great Recession and its aftermath? Yes, it did. In 2013, the last time Gallup asked the question, fifty-two per cent of respondents chose the “Yes, should” option. “At this point, the American public would generally agree with Obama that wealth should ideally be more evenly distributed—and a modest majority, consisting mainly of Democrats and independents, appears to support the idea of bringing about that redistribution through heavier taxes on the rich,” Frank Newport, Gallup’s editor-in-chief, noted.","865","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"Other survey data confirm Gallup’s findings. Last year, for example, the Pew Research Center found that sixty-five per cent of Americans believe the gap between rich and poor has increased during the past decade. Even more striking, sixty-nine per cent of respondents, including forty-five per cent of Republicans, said that the government should do “a lot/some” to reduce the income gap. Just twenty-six per cent of respondents said that the government should do “not much/nothing.”","866","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"In addition to considering these findings, it is worth parsing the numbers in some of the recent academic studies. The paper by Kelly and Enns as well as the one by Luttig both use a sophisticated statistical model derived from economics (an error-correction model, if you must know) that can be difficult to interpret. The new paper by Ashok, Kuziemko, and Washington looks directly at data from the General Social Survey, which is conducted by the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center and has been carried out every year since 1972.","867","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"Although the fitted trend line the authors present appears to show that the level of support for the proposition “The government ought to reduce the income differences between rich and poor” slopes slightly downward, the researchers acknowledge that they can’t statistically reject the hypothesis that it is actually flat—i.e., that support for redistribution hasn’t declined. Indeed, there is even a suggestion in the data that, since 2008, support might have increased a bit.","868","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"The researchers say that it’s too early to tell whether their findings reflect a sustainable trend, which is fair. Interestingly, though, the General Social Survey also asks people what they believe the government’s spending priorities should be. In recent years, “assistance to the poor” has been moving up the list. In 1996, it was ranked tenth, behind things like health care, the environment, and Social Security. But in the 2010 and 2012 surveys it moved up to second place, trailing only education—a finding that appears to contradict the idea that the electorate is getting more conservative.","869","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"Another important consideration in looking at attitudes toward inequality is whether voters adopt more liberal policy positions as they learn more about the issue. In an article collected in a 2013 book about political representation, the political scientists Jacob Hacker, of Yale University, and Paul Pierson, of the University of California, Berkeley, point to evidence from the American National Election Studies project, a long-running survey, that suggests having more information does change people’s attitudes. For many years, the survey has asked people whether it is the government’s responsibility to reduce the income gap between rich and poor. Typically, the positive responses were low—only about twenty-five per cent. In 2007, the survey changed the wording of the question, to detail how much money people at the top and bottom of the income distribution actually earned. “This time, 57 percent favored reducing income inequality,” Hacker and Pierson write.","870","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"In a 2013 paper, four economists—Kuziemko; Michael Norton, of the Harvard Business School; Emmanuel Saez, of Berkeley; and Stefanie Stantcheva, of Harvard—reported some less supportive evidence. Using Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk platform, which pays people to take part in surveys, the economists presented their subjects with some pertinent information about inequality, such as how much money the rich make compared with the middle class, and the fact that average family incomes have grown more slowly during periods when the top tax rate was low. Then they asked the subjects some policy questions. Perhaps surprisingly, the researchers found that supplying information didn’t increase support for redistribution to the poor. Support for taxing the rich did go up, but not by very much. “Of course, a single paper can only say so much,” Kuziemko wrote in an e-mail. “But I do think our results cast some doubt on the argument that if only Americans knew about the high levels of inequality, they would surely demand more redistribution.”","871","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"That sounds like a reasonable conclusion. However, it isn’t the only significant finding from the experiment. When the researchers presented to their subjects a slide showing that the estate tax currently affects only about 0.1 per cent of estates—the very richest ones—they found that this knowledge “has an extremely large positive effect on estate tax support, even increasing respondents’ willingness to write to their U.S. senator about the issue.” Since changing the way estates are taxed—by, for instance, eliminating the “step-up in basis” loophole—seems likely to be part of the Democratic platform in 2016, this result has immediate political implications. And, more generally, it suggests that giving people more information about specific inequities and policy proposals, as opposed to citing over-all statistics about inequality, can have a big impact on voters’ attitudes.","872","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"So what’s the takeaway from all of this? It is important to acknowledge that rising inequality doesn’t, by itself, generate a surge in support for redistributive policies. It’s also a concern that the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act appears to have undermined support for guaranteed health-care coverage—although it’s not absolutely clear to me whether this finding reflects a shift against the redistributive subsidies that are part of the act, or a lack of enthusiasm for the reform in general. (Polling data from the Pew Research Center, the Kaiser Foundation, and other organizations suggest that the public has been cool on the A.C.A. since before it was passed, in 2010.) But taking all of the evidence together, my take is that a progressive policy agenda, if carefully presented, can still win popular support.","873","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"To be sure, it isn’t enough to simply point to the rise in inequality and expect an outpouring of mass support for any and all liberal policies. The argument for each proposal has to be made on its own terms, and Americans still show little enthusiasm for anything that smacks of welfare. Would-be reformers also need to avoid alienating seniors, whose declining support for redistributive measures probably reflects a fear that such policies would come at their expense, in the form of cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Still, the polling data shows that a healthy majority of Americans believe that income and wealth should be more evenly distributed, and that a smaller, but steady, majority believe that the current situation justifies heavier taxes on the rich. That surely gives the Democrats something to work with.","874","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"It all comes down to individual policies. In the cases of the estate tax, the “carried interest” deduction enjoyed by hedge-fund managers and private equity, and other loopholes that benefit the very wealthy, would-be reformers can appeal to the voters’ sense of fair play, which remains undiminished. In seeking to expand support for working families—for example, by expanding the earned-income tax credit—progressives can appeal to the widespread sympathy for the working poor. When presented in general or ideological terms, redistribution has always been a tough sell. But when the debate gets down to specific proposals, redistributive arguments can still win out.","875","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"President Obama gave one of his strongest speeches on Saturday, in Selma, Alabama, on the fiftieth anniversary of “Bloody Sunday”—the day of the violently suppressed march that helped lead to the Voting Rights Act, the climactic achievement of the civil-rights movement. Standing in early-spring sunlight on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Obama praised the American spirit of striving and self-renewal embodied in the moral and physical courage of the marchers: “What greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this, what greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?”","March 10, 2015","876","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"
"Obama’s hymn to the America of constant change is encompassing enough to include every generation, including that of the first black children of a President to grow up in residence at the White House (Malia and Sasha Obama were among the marchers in Selma last weekend). The speech was inspiring, at moments soaring, but, in a sense, the President didn’t need to give it. His presence on the bridge alongside Congressman John Lewis, who had walked at the forefront of the original march and taken the first blows from Alabama state troopers, was eloquence enough. Here was change—here was the picture of a nation, still imperfect, but more closely aligned with its highest ideals. Obama could have spoken as briefly as when Lincoln said, “The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.” Between Gettysburg and Selma there’s a straight line of history and ideas and sacrifice.","877","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"

"A week after Bloody Sunday, President Lyndon Johnson addressed a joint session of Congress, as well as seventy million Americans watching on television. He urged Congress to pass a voting-rights bill, the second piece of landmark civil-rights legislation in less than a year. It was the greatest speech of his Presidency, and one of the greatest by any President. “I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy,” Johnson began, and from there he kept raising his aim, comparing Selma to Lexington and Concord and Appomattox, to the great turning points in American history. “There is no Negro problem,” he said. “There is no Southern problem. There is no Northern problem. There is only an American problem. And we are met here tonight as Americans—not as Democrats or Republicans—we are met here as Americans to solve that problem.” Johnson said that if America won all its wars and doubled its wealth and journeyed to the stars but failed to solve this problem, “we will have failed as a people and a nation.” He declared that the scene before him gave hope in American democracy: “For the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great government—the government of the greatest nation on earth.”","879","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"
"“All the majesty of this great government”—imagine that phrase being uttered without irony on Capitol Hill today. Or “the outraged conscience of a nation,” or “And we shall overcome.” Imagine a President addressing a joint session of Congress on an issue of such moment and framing it in such starkly moral terms, knowing that he could count on some solid support from the opposition leadership. Amid the cheers and applause, some senators and congressmen sat stone-faced, but no one shouted, “You lie!” Articles of impeachment were not drawn up. Southern committee chairmen didn’t invite George Wallace to come to Congress and rebut President Johnson, as Speaker Boehner recently invited a foreign leader to come embarrass President Obama.","880","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"
"As brutal as the Alabama state police and the Dallas County sheriff’s department were on Bloody Sunday, as violent as the vigilantes were who killed Jimmie Lee Jackson, James Reeb, and Viola Liuzzo in those weeks, as much progress as America has made in fifty years, something has gone seriously backward since 1965: the quality of American institutions. The flap over the historical accuracy of Johnson’s portrayal in the film “Selma” obscured this larger truth. “The real hero of this struggle is the American Negro,” Johnson told Congress, but the context for Selma was a country of functioning institutions. Martin Luther King, Jr.,’s desperate strategy was to dramatize white racism to such a degree that the institutions would have to respond.","881","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"
"There may still be ordinary Americans as brave and committed to justice as the civil-rights movement’s foot soldiers, but we no longer have a national government (or a federal bench, a press corps, labor unions, businesses, religious groups, universities) capable of coming together with the imagination, wisdom, and self-restraint necessary to achieve something on the scale of voting rights. These days, Congress can hardly keep the Department of Homeland Security open without tearing itself to pieces.

"On Monday, forty-seven Republican senators addressed an open letter to the Iranian leadership, declaring that “we will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.” The senators noted that Obama will leave office in 2017, while many of them will go on serving for decades—so why should the clerics pay any attention to the executive branch? The senators didn’t release classified U.S. intelligence on the nuclear negotiations, but it’s not altogether clear what stopped them. They’re doing all they can to sabotage their own country’s position in the talks, practically making themselves the de facto ally of hardliners in Tehran.

Perhaps that’s why, last Saturday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, President Obama spoke more about the daring spirit of the American people than the greatness of constitutional democracy. If solutions arise from this generation and the next, they seem unlikely to come from Washington.

"Ever since the dogs took the prize in last October’s New Yorker Festival debate “Cats vs. Dogs,” adjudicated by the nonpartisan judge David Remnick, I’ve been wondering why cats get such a bad rap. Was it really because, as Adam Gopnik put it, “All dogs are Democrats and all cats Republicans”? What about what Anthony Lane so wisely suggested, that the endless loyalty and good cheer of dogs is a dangerous misrepresentation of life, and that “truth is cats”? There’s an upcoming show at the Japan Society, “Life of Cats: Selections from the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Collection,” of woodblock prints from the Edo period (1615-1867), depicting the life of Japanese cats, from the cozy to the ferocious. The prints are divided into helpful subcategories like Cats and People, Cats Versus People, and Cats as People—in one piquant image, an elaborately berobed cat woman leans on the head of a giant octopus while swatting a soup ladle at some flying fish. (Cats as people is a popular fantasy in Japanese culture—the Kitty of Hello Kitty is apparently not a cat but a “little girl.”) One afternoon, while researching the Japan Society show, I typed “Japanese cats” into Google, hoping to find more Edo-period images. Instead, I unearthed this treasure: sushi cats. Or, if you want to sound like you know what you’re talking about: nekozushi.

"This week, Kenneth Goldsmith made a strong case for post-Internet poetry, writing on Page-Turner that the form has come into its own. This should come as no surprise, given that the Internet is a text-based medium, driven by code. What did surprise me was that Goldsmith restricted his argument to printed matter: a three-part volume, a book-length confession, an anthology. (In the past, he has championed YouTube’s jejune bard of ranting, Steve Roggenbuck.) The most radical aspect of post-internet art isn’t that it infiltrates old-media institutions like books and galleries; it’s that, as it does so, it continues to proliferate online like Tribbles on Star Trek.

"Van Morrison turns seventy this year, and he’s taking stock by re-recording a handful of his three hundred and sixty songs.

The resulting album, “Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue,” his thirty-fifth studio release, comes out March 23rd. Morrison, never one to go for the obvious, focusses on his lesser-known material, and over the past few weeks he’s been posting singles on YouTube.

This week saw Mark Knopfler lending his earthy voice to “Irish Heartbeat.” But my favorite so far was the album’s opening track, for which the late Bobby Womack joined Morrison on a dressed-up and slightly funky version of “Some Peace of Mind.” It’s one of Womack’s last recordings, and his voice gives the chorus an added poignancy.—John Donohue","889","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/this-week-in-cultural-clicks-sushi-cats-post-internet-poetry-and-more"
"There’s a noble tradition of directors exerting and even extending their art in commercials, and Nathan Silver is the latest one to rise to the challenge. The prolific filmmaker has made a feature a year since 2012. “Soft in the Head” came out last year; two (“Uncertain Terms” and “Stinking Heaven”) are still awaiting release. All three are harshly realistic, furiously histrionic glimpses into the harrowing lives of troubled people living in a variety of group homes—a mental-health facility, a home for pregnant teen-agers, a self-regulated rehab house. Silver’s commercial is an advertisement for a cell-phone camera and the processor that it runs on, and it’s both a work of great originality and a startling new direction for the filmmaker.","890","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/this-week-in-cultural-clicks-sushi-cats-post-internet-poetry-and-more"
"The commercial has a title, “Family Affair,” and it’s essentially a meta-film, one in which the making of the commercial—the commission and Silver’s uncertainty about it—is folded into the action. The director builds the commercial around a recorded phone call with its creative supervisor, who responds to Silver’s queries by describing, in sketch-like form, the kind of film he wants. Silver puckishly takes that recording as a wry voice-over that he brings to life with a freewheeling visual style—and he cuts that voice-over up and edits it into a sort of musical score that lends the film a lyrical, through-composed structure. Silver appears in the film, along with his mother, Cindy Silver, who often acts in dramatic roles in his films. But here she plays herself—and she’s quite an engaging character on her own. I was walking through Grand Central Station one morning when I ran into Silver and the two members of his crew. He seemed happy and excited as he told me that he was waiting for his mother to arrive so that he could shoot a film with her there. Clearly, Silver found the ostensibly commercial premise of his film a springboard for his inspiration.

"Few genres on television are more reliably disappointing than cable news and the late-night talk show. One delivers very little news; the other delivers very little pleasure. Yet when, sixteen years ago, the comedian Jon Stewart took over “The Daily Show,” he did something radical: he took the two formats and reformatted them, creating a series that was not merely useful and funny but emotionally powerful.","892","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/late-nights"
"In Stewart’s hands, “The Daily Show” levelled up, from a program that resembled “Weekend Update”—a delivery device for over-it potshots—to a consistently scathing and original media critique. For young viewers in particular, “The Daily Show” provided a more trustworthy daily news summary than almost any show on Fox News or CNN (a low standard, admittedly). But Stewart’s series also provided a psychic salve, especially during the worst parts of the past few elections and the run-up to the Iraq War. If you were driven nuts by the twenty-four-hour shouters, if you couldn’t bear to watch any more flashing chyrons and Sam the Eagle gravitas, here was your catharsis. Like “Get Your War On,” David Rees’s post-9/11 comic strip, “The Daily Show” became a gathering place for the disenchanted—a place that let viewers know they weren’t crazy.","893","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/late-nights"
"For Democrats, the final run of Jon Stewart, along with the retirement of the meta-version of Stephen Colbert (whose creator is now headed for David Letterman’s desk), is a loss. By stealing the role of the class clown from Rush Limbaugh and the like, Stewart and his cadre rebranded left-wing politics as sharp and outrageous, the hipper way to see the world. Over the years, Stewart changed, too, from a leather-jacketed Gen X wisecracker, into the equivalent, for many viewers, of Walter Cronkite. His brand was decency. For his generational cohort, those Olympic champions of eye-rolling, Stewart was a valuable corrective: he revived the notion that satire might be an expression of anger or sadness, the product of high standards, not a nihilistic game for know-it-alls.","894","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/late-nights"
"Early on, Stewart had a habit of making “little me” remarks, in which he’d shrug off his own influence. Such poor-mouthing never suited him, particularly as he began blurring boundaries, jumping from the fake fake news to the real fake news, visiting “Crossfire” to beg the talking heads to “stop hurting America.” (It must have been the cherry on the top of Stewart’s career to see that show cancelled, twice.)","895","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/late-nights"
"To some critics, this type of behavior turned him into a sanctimonious scold. (As Will Rogers put it, “A humorist entertains, and a lecturer annoys.”) Others, including Jamelle Bouie, in Slate, argued that Stewart’s show was not galvanizing viewers but in fact sedating them: watching the host vent about hypocrisy was enough social action for the day. Bouie, an early fan of “The Daily Show,” attended Stewart’s “Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear,” where he was frustrated to hear Stewart reduce Washington gridlock, in his speech, to “a case of bad manners and not deep-seated ideological differences about government and its place in the world.” Bouie felt let down: in his eyes, Stewart was not wrestling with complicated ideas but suggesting that debate itself was a dead end.","896","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/late-nights"
"The truth is that Stewart was often at his most exciting when he got down in the dirt, instead of remaining decent and high-minded, your twinkly-eyed smartest friend. Five years ago, when he confronted CNBC’s financial reporter Jim Cramer* over his coverage of Wall Street, Stewart refused to be collegial. He nailed Cramer on his manipulations, airing clip after damning clip, and shouting “Roll 212!” with prosecutorial glee. He was a good interviewer with people he admired, but in some of the show’s most memorable segments he relied on search technology—in particular, his staff’s ability to cull clips and spin them into brutal montages—to expose lies that might have gone unremarked upon. Over time, he became not merely a scourge of phonies but the nation’s fact checker, training others in the craft. You can see that influence not only among hosts who started out on “The Daily Show,” including Colbert, John Oliver, and Larry Wilmore, but everywhere online. Twitter, on its best nights (and they do exist, doubters), can feel like a universe of sparkling mini-Stewarts, cracking wise but also working to mob-solve the latest crisis, and providing access to a far wider array of perspectives than any one comic could.","897","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/late-nights"
"That kind of digging, of disrespecting authority, was a model for reinventing journalism, not comedy. In recent years, it became hard to distinguish Stewart from, say, the liberal cable anchor and jokester Rachel Maddow, separated as they were by a thin wall of genre. Last week, when the NBC anchor Brian Williams was suspended, after exaggerating stories about a helicopter incident in Iraq, the Internet began to joke that he should just switch places with Stewart, “Freaky Friday” style. It was easy to imagine Williams behind Stewart’s desk: he’s a funny, charismatic guy. But it was unnerving to imagine Stewart as the anchor on the nightly news. What would it mean to get Jon Stewart’s vision of journalism straight, no chaser?","898","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/late-nights"
"In his announcement that he was stepping down, Stewart told the audience that he didn’t want to force it to deal with a host who was checked out. He did seem unhappy at times, toward the end, as if bored by his own agility. There’s a long history of comics who rose to fame as truthtellers—from Lenny Bruce to Dave Chappelle—and then burned out or fled the scene. In an episode of the British sci-fi television show “Black Mirror,” titled “The Waldo Moment,” Daniel Rigby, playing a comedian on a nightly satirical show, is the voice behind Waldo, a foulmouthed cartoon bear who mocks politicians. When his producers suggest that Waldo intervene in an electoral campaign, the comedian, horrified, blurts out, “I’m not dumb or clever enough to be political.” He understands that the hazard he faces is a moral one: when you’re protected by the screen of deniability called a joke, it’s tempting to view the whole world as a game of gotcha.","899","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/late-nights"
"Stewart’s gift was that he didn’t fall into that trap—he grew more attached to reality, not less, over the years. Rather than keep his persona under careful control, he risked naïveté and earnest anger. It will be interesting to see what he creates, once he steps from behind the desk: more serious movies, like “Rosewater,” the one he recently wrote and directed? Investigative documentaries? Books? If he’s no longer the hippest figure on the scene, that’s not so bad. There’s something to be said for losing your cool. ♦","900","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/late-nights"

"In 1950, Bruno Pontecorvo, an Italian physicist who had been working on British and Canadian nuclear projects, vanished while vacationing on the Mediterranean. As Frank Close writes in a new book about him, “Half-Life,” Pontecorvo wasn’t heard from again until 1955, when he resurfaced in Russia. There were many wild rumors about what he was working on for the Soviets, among them an “atomic fog.” But Freeman Dyson, reviewing the biography in The New York Review of Books, asks how much rogue physicists like Pontecorvo really mattered: “Perhaps the spies accelerated the production of the first Soviet bombs by two or three years, but those bombs soon became obsolete and were superseded by new designs invented without the help of spies.”","902","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/atomic-clocks"

The time gained would be meaningless if Iran was not first fundamentally incapacitated and transformed, Netanyahu said. “A decade may seem like a long time in political life, but it’s the blink of an eye in the life of a nation.” (The two weeks between Netanyahu’s speech and the Israeli elections may seem like an indecorously short time in political life.) Speaking about Iran’s “tentacles” and its “gobbling up” of other countries, he suggested that President Obama didn’t know what he was doing. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who shook her head as she watched the speech (more than fifty Democrats stayed away), said that she was “saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States.”","903","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/atomic-clocks"
"And yet, despite Netanyahu’s posturing, there is a serious question about timelines. For several years, Iran has been said to be one, two, or three years away from having the capacity to build a bomb. The Administration’s goal is to prevent it from getting any closer. The rough outline of the deal, judging from leaks and the Administration’s briefings, is that Iran would allow intrusive inspections, limit its nuclear-fuel-production capacity, and give up fuel stockpiles. In return, the United States and its allies would lift sanctions. The deal, reportedly, would have a ten- or fifteen-year sunset clause, although the State Department has indicated that some improvements in inspections would remain. From Netanyahu’s point of view, Iran would then be able to pick up where it left off, and from a position of greater strength, with its economy “unshackled,” as he put it. Iran has cheated before and might try to again (although a deal would make it easier to detect any covert programs), and it could still be sponsoring militias and terror. There are legitimate concerns, but one thing that Netanyahu did not present was any real alternative to the deal.","904","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/atomic-clocks"
"“Folks, simply demanding that Iran capitulate is not a plan,” Secretary of State John Kerry said, after Netanyahu’s speech. He was in Montreux, Switzerland, where he and other representatives of the P5+1 (the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany) were engaged in talks with the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Obama spoke of America’s “unbreakable” bond with Israel, but he, too, emphasized that the deal was the best way to stop a bomb—“Nothing else comes close. Sanctions won’t do it. Even military action would not be as successful.”","905","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/atomic-clocks"
"A problem with the anti-diplomacy position is the one that Dyson confronts: building a bomb has ceased to be a great puzzle; nuclear programs no longer rely on physicists disappearing mysteriously from Italian beaches. When Netanyahu said that the deal, by freeing Iran to be more “aggressive,” would “spark a nuclear arms race” in the region, he was acknowledging that there are any number of countries that, without too much difficulty, could acquire a nuclear bomb if they had the money and the political will. (Saudi Arabia, certainly, has the budget.) At worst, hostile disruptions of the Iranian program could accelerate it by pushing the country’s leaders to abandon the restraints Iran has already accepted. At best, they would do on a small scale something that a deal would do better—create more time.","906","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/atomic-clocks"
"A key concept in the negotiations is “breakout time”; that is, how quickly Iran could assemble the materials for a bomb if it reneged on a deal. Mostly, this is a question of obtaining enriched uranium, or having the centrifuges to produce it. The more centrifuges a country has spinning, the shorter the breakout time. At the moment, Iran has about nineteen thousand, which it says serve only civilian energy needs; the expectation is that a deal would reduce that number, so that the breakout time would be a year or more.","907","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/atomic-clocks"
"Breakout time is a concept that might also be applied to politics. What difference can two or three—or ten or fifteen—years make? Between 1949, when the Soviet Union tested its first crude fission bomb, and 1953, when it exploded a hydrogen bomb (perhaps with help from Pontecorvo) the leadership shifted from Stalin to Khrushchev. The years from 1982 to 1991 saw four general secretaries—from Brezhnev to Gorbachev—and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In Iran, the relationship between Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, whose election held some promise for reformers, is opaque, though Rouhani seems to be pushing the talks. The terms are relative here, too; last week, Rouhani called Israel a warmonger. But the world made it through the decades of the Cold War in large measure because of imperfect arms agreements with dubious partners. If we rely only on financial and military threats, nonproliferation will fail.","908","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/atomic-clocks"
"In an indication of the complexity of the moment, Iran and the United States have a shared goal in Iraq: to take the city of Tikrit back from ISIS. Netanyahu warned Congress not to be “fooled” into thinking that Iran could be a friend in this fight. “One calls itself the Islamic Republic. The other calls itself the Islamic State,” he said. “In this deadly game of thrones, there’s no place for America or for Israel.” On the way back from Montreux, Kerry stopped in Riyadh, in part to reassure the Saudis about the operations in Iraq. (The Saudis oppose isis, but they, like ISIS, are Sunni, and Iran is Shiite.) If a deal were to be struck, all the other challenges related to Iran would remain, Kerry said, “except that we will have taken steps to guarantee that Iran will not have a nuclear weapon.” At least, for a useful period of time. ♦","909","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/atomic-clocks"

"John Podesta, the veteran Democratic official, is leaving the White House to join Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Presidential campaign, probably as its chairman. The move was hardly unexpected: Podesta is a Clintonite through and through. He served in Bill Clinton’s White House from start to finish, rising through the ranks to become Chief of Staff, a post he held from October, 1998, to January, 2001. For months now, Podesta has been telling people that if Hillary decided to run he would most likely join her.","January 14, 2015","911","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"

"","913","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"Even Podesta’s critics concede that he is an effective and experienced operator. Inside the Clinton Administration, he was known as a hard-working, intense figure with a caustic side. In a Times piece from September, 2000, Robert Pear and John Broder wrote, “Colleagues say, half-jesting, that he has an evil twin named Skippy, who is invoked to bring order to an unruly White House.”","914","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"A couple of years after the Clinton Administration ended, Podesta founded the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank that, in a little more than a decade, has become an important player in the Washington power game, providing detailed analysis and policy recommendations, a forum for conversations and debates, and daily commentary on everything from the job figures to Bill Cosby. (Full disclosure: in 2013, I led a panel discussion at the launch of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, which is housed at the Center for American Progress, and for which Podesta once served as chairman.) In January, 2014, Podesta left the Center for American Progress and joined the Obama Administration as a counselor to the President, focussed largely on environmental issues.","915","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"To the delight of environmental activists, when Podesta arrived back at the White House he championed the tactic of using executive power and the edicts of the Environmental Protection Agency to outflank Republican obstructionists on Capitol Hill. Last summer, the E.P.A. proposed a new rule designed to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants by up to thirty per cent. Other federal agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Emergency Management Administration, have also stepped up their environmental initiatives. “I think he”—Podesta—“has made a tremendous difference,” former Vice-President Al Gore told National Journal’s Ben Geman. “I don’t think it, I know it.”","916","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"Some conservatives regard Podesta as an environmental extremist. From the left, the rap is that he is too close to major corporations and to Wall Street. In the late nineteen-eighties, when Podesta was working on Capitol Hill, he and his brother, Tony Podesta, founded the lobbying firm the Podesta Group, which is now one of the most successful in Washington. John Podesta hasn’t had a role in the firm for many years. But the Center for American Progress has faced accusations that it does favors for its corporate donors, most specifically in a May, 2013, investigative report by Ken Silverstein for The Nation.","917","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"The Center vigorously denies this charge. In a letter to The Nation, it said, “The inference at the heart of the author’s story is that corporate donations shape or drive the content of CAP and CAP Action. That assertion is baseless and completely false.” In December, 2013, the Center released a list of its corporate benefactors, which included Apple, Google, Walmart, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. The Center also pointed out that more than ninety per cent of its annual budget was financed through donations from individuals and philanthropic foundations, and that corporate donations accounted for less than six per cent.","918","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"My take on this flap is that with the Center for American Progress, as with any other think tank (or newspaper or magazine, for that matter), it is well worth keeping an eye on whether the folks who pay the bills are dictating the message. The Center would enhance its credibility—and this also applies to its competitors—if it more often promoted findings and policies that some of its financial backers and its political allies disagreed with.","919","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"That said, there’s quite a bit to recommend the Center’s activities, particularly its research initiatives and its Web site, which includes the lively (and editorially independent) ThinkProgress blog. Podesta’s efforts in founding the institution and getting it up and running filled a gap in the Washington ecosystem. Other liberal-leaning think tanks, such as the Economic Policy Institute and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, have long done sterling work. But, until the arrival of the Center for American Progress, which is now headed up by Neera Tanden, another Clintonite, no left-leaning think tank had the heft, the resources, and the drive of the conservative Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute. (I am leaving out the Brookings Institution, venerable as it is, because it tends to stay above the fray, and also the New America Foundation, which is smaller and more narrowly focussed.)","920","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"Washington now has a big and well-financed progressive think tank that engages with the political debate on a daily basis. That’s a positive development—and not just for Democrats. On the basis of the theory of countervailing power, it’s good for democracy.","921","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"As Podesta sets out for 2016, it remains to be seen whether he will be an effective campaign chairman. Until now, most of his experience has been in administration and policy-making, rather than in political campaigning. But whatever services he provides to Hillary, he has already made a big mark on the political topography of the nation’s capital. And that, I’d wager, will be his longest-lasting legacy.","922","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"

When my turn finally came, a few terse questions from the guy in the blue uniform brought out that I was a journalist. He gave me a look with no trace of good humor. “You should do a report about this,” the official said, waving at the room. He briefly described what he saw as the long hours, the understaffing, the stress, the complaining passengers. Slightly ashamed, I agreed that it was an important story.

"You know the story—by now it’s what people in the news business call an evergreen. Congressional Republicans want something that they can’t get through the standard legislative process—this time, it’s the revoking of President Obama’s executive action temporarily exempting four million illegal immigrants from deportation. So a large faction of Republican legislators decides to hold a routine funding bill hostage to their demands. In this case, the House has passed a bill that would keep the D.H.S. from closing down only if the President’s immigration order is killed at the same time. Republicans on Capitol Hill are, as usual, divided between those who want to blow everything up and those who “understand” why their colleagues might be driven to threaten legislative suicide bombing but disagree with their tactics. The new Senate Republican majority’s fourth attempt at cloture failed on Monday, forty-seven to forty-six. That’s not even enough votes to pass the chamber bill by simple majority, which used to be the way legislation was enacted in the Senate, until Mitch McConnell, as minority leader, made the filibuster an everyday weapon. McConnell, now the majority leader, isn’t the first insurgent-turned-ruler to find himself cornered by his own history of abuses. Yes, the Democrats currently deploying the filibuster that they once denounced can be accused of hypocrisy.

"It’s unlikely that the Islamic State would be able to take advantage of the threatened thirteen-per-cent furloughs at the D.H.S. to carry out its stated objective of bombing the Mall of America, near Minneapolis. For years, ideological extremism fuelled by organized money has degraded our political system, and that brings troubles as serious and lasting as external threats—which are serious enough, and all the harder to confront intelligently in an atmosphere like the one that prevails in Washington. These internal forces have steadily weakened the defenses of the body politic, leaving a demoralized federal work force, a routinization of poor working conditions and inadequate services, a strategy of total war on every issue that comes before Congress, and a national government that is the last place you’d look to for solutions to the country’s most corrosive problems.","927","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/threats-homeland-security"
"Perhaps the Republicans have nothing to fear. They won their Senate majority last November, despite taking the blame for partially shutting down the government in October of 2013. After that shutdown, the public’s trust in government plummeted, to a record low of nineteen per cent. (It will be no comfort to the D.H.S. guy in Toronto that approval of government workers remained high.) But this effect tainted congressional Democrats and President Obama as well as the Republicans who brought it on. They’re playing a deeply cynical but effective game—counting on paralysis and destruction in Washington to turn voters against the entire federal government, a mood that usually benefits the anti-government party.","928","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/threats-homeland-security"
"On the other hand, this time McConnell and other Republican leaders seem genuinely concerned about their members’ brinkmanship. They came to power on the promise that they would prove themselves capable of governing, and now their party is poised to cripple the one agency that’s uniquely responsible for keeping Americans safe. No doubt Republicans can already imagine the ads that await them next year—a clever thirty-second spot could nail them for being soft on terrorism and anti-Latino. There might even be such an ad on the air already. That’s the way we do things here at home.","929","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/threats-homeland-security"

They’ve found power there for so long, in so many elections, that when the time comes the riders might discover that their horses are unwilling to turn back.

"Cuomo did not go all the way in baseball (he couldn’t hit a curveball). Nor did he go all the way in politics. He chose not to run for President in 1992 because his ambition was superseded by his distaste for the grovelling, the fundraising, the selling, the motels. He did, however, “go all the way” as a public man.","933","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/remembering-mario-cuomo"
"Mario Cuomo had a combination of skills rarely seen in public life. Unlike most pols, he had an active interior life. He spent hours reflecting on events and writing in his diary, not to tout his greatness but to formulate his own thinking. His bookcases were crammed with books he had read and annotated—works by Aristotle, Dante, Marcus Aurelius, and the Jesuit theologian Teilhard de Chardin. His ego was in check and, unlike such able contemporaries as Ed Koch and Hugh Carey, he did not treat others in a room as his audience. He had the rare ability to listen, and he could see four sides of an issue. In the early seventies, these talents allowed him to successfully mediate the seemingly unbridgeable Forest Hills housing divide—low-income public housing was moving into an upper-middle-class neighborhood—and in the process develop a citywide identity.","934","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/remembering-mario-cuomo"
"He was incapable of faking conviction and thus ran a terrible campaign for mayor against Ed Koch, in 1977. His heart was not in the race. On the eve of the mayoral runoff between Cuomo and Koch, I wrote a column that appeared on page 3 of the New York Daily News about how, for me, the real conflict in the campaign was not the one between Koch and Cuomo but the one between “Mario Cuomo the man and the reality of his candidacy.” I also noted that, for me, the campaign was about “falling out of love with Mario Cuomo.” Over the years, he told me more than once how that column wounded him. But he never lashed out or personalized it. He had an ability to laugh at himself.

When I asked about the wine, he responded like a pitchman for his state: “This is New York State’s finest.” I didn’t believe him and unfolded the linen. He watched with a twinkle in his eye as I held up the naked bottle of Corvo from Italy. His gubernatorial staff consisted of heavyweights like the press secretary Tim Russert, but the media narrative was that Cuomo was handicapped by an insular claque led by his son Andrew and his former law-school classmate Fabian Palomino. Yet what I witnessed in the five months I spent profiling Cuomo for this magazine was that Andrew and Palomino, who each called him Mario, confronted him with unpleasant truths that most of his staff often tried to duck.","936","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/remembering-mario-cuomo"

He opposed the death penalty and vetoed a bill that would have introduced it in the state. Then he took the time to publicly expound on his position, which was an unpopular one in New York at a moment when crime was rampant. It became a major reason he was defeated for a fourth term as governor. He defied his Catholicism by explaining that while he was personally opposed to abortion he defended a woman’s right to choose. Cardinal John Joseph O’Connor contemplated excommunicating him from the Church.","937","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/remembering-mario-cuomo"
"But my most vivid, and maybe most consequential memory of Mario Cuomo was his keynote speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, in San Francisco. He challenged President Reagan’s assertion that America was like a “shining city on a hill.” “Mr. President, you ought to know that this nation is more a ‘Tale of Two Cities’ than it is just a ‘Shining City on a Hill,’” Cuomo declared. “There is despair, Mr. President, in the faces that you don’t see, in the places that you don’t visit, in your shining city.” Three decades later, Bill de Blasio would echo that famous speech in his mayoral campaign.","938","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/remembering-mario-cuomo"

But rather than hang around to bask in glory, he snuck out of San Francisco that night and returned to Albany on a red-eye. I phoned him the next morning and asked what he planned to do the next night, when Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for President. He wife, Matilda, was not home and he would be roaming the forty-four-room mansion in Albany. He planned to watch the event on television. Alone.

Although the broadcast showed that his party was pumped up, Cuomo was not wistful. When asked by Mondale whether he was interested in being his Vice-President, he declined, saying that he had served just two years as governor and had vowed to serve a full four years. “Not many people hold positions as important as mine and have the opportunity to prove their word is good,” he told me. He was happy to be home. He hated travel. He boasted of wanting to sleep in his own bed, always. He disliked adulation, and felt it was too clingy.

"“The secret to contentment is reducing your needs and aspirations,” he said, as we sat on the couch. “I feel fulfilled in the job I have.

Proving that political prognostication was not his forte, he predicted, “We’re going to win.” I suspected that his deeper thoughts would congeal later, when he was alone with his diary and when he could admit that Reagan was nearly invincible because he was both likeable and comfortable in his own skin.","943","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/remembering-mario-cuomo"

And his flight from San Francisco, like his choice not to run for President in 1992, may have indicated a reticence that would not have served him well as President. Or maybe it camouflaged insecurity that was both disabling and wonderfully human. Unlike most politicians, who have no interior lives, he was worthy of a novel. He was not, as the scouting report also observed, “an easy chap to get close to but is very well liked by those who succeed in penetrating his exterior shell.” In the four decades I knew him, I tried to keep him at arm’s length.

There’s nothing very entertaining about super PACs, or Mike Huckabee’s national announcement of an imminent national announcement of whether he will run for President again. Jeb Bush’s ruthless approach to locking up the exclusive services of longstanding Republican political consultants and media professionals far ahead of the primaries doesn’t quicken my pulse. Scott Walker’s refusal to affirm Barack Obama’s patriotism doesn’t shock me into a state of alert indignation.

"Since I was eight years old, and the Republican candidates were named Nixon, Rockefeller, and Reagan, and the Democrats were Humphrey, Kennedy, and McCarthy, I’ve been passionate about American politics, as a student, a witness, and a partisan. Politics was in my blood, at the family dinner table, in my work and my free time. But at some point in the past few years it went dead for me, or I for it. Perhaps it was week thirty-eight of the Obama-Romney race (a campaign between “Forward” and “Believe in America”), or the routinization of the filibuster, or the name Priorities USA Action, or the fifty-eighth vote in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act—something happened that made it very hard to continue paying attention. I don’t take this as a sign of personal superiority: I’ve always disliked people who considered themselves to be “above” politics. I mourn my lack of political passion as I would if I were to lose interest in reading fiction, or to stop caring about someone who’d been important to me for most of my life. And I count on getting back the feeling—the intense mix of love, hatred, anxiety, astonishment, and gratification—because life, public life, is impoverished without it. Perhaps it will return sometime before November 8, 2016. But for now—I have to be honest—it’s gone.","956","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/american-politics-why-the-thrill-is-gone"
"The reason is the stuckness of American politics. Especially in the years after 2008, the worst tendencies of American politics only hardened, while remaining in the same place. Beneath the surface froth and churn, we are paralyzed. You can sense it as soon as you step out of the train at Union Station in Washington, the instant you click on a Politico article about a candidates’ forum in Iowa: miasma settles over your central nervous system and you start to go numb. What has happened is that the same things keep happening. The tidal wave of money keeps happening, the trivialization of coverage keeps happening, the extremism of the Republican Party keeps happening (Ted Cruz: abolish the I.R.S.; Rand Paul: the Common Core is “un-American”). The issues remain huge and urgent: inequality, global warming, immigration, poorly educated children, American decline, radical Islamism. But the language of politics stays the same, and it is a dead language.

"On Wednesday morning, little more than three months after California’s voters reëlected Governor Jerry Brown for another four years, Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor and former mayor of San Francisco, became the first person to declare his intention to take Brown’s place when he reaches the end of his final term at the start of 2019. “When Californians see something we truly believe in, we say so and act accordingly—without evasiveness or equivocation,” Newsom wrote in a letter to supporters, announcing that he is forming an official campaign committee to seek the governorship.","February 12, 2015","968","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/california-gavin-newsom-governor"
"The announcement came not longer after Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida and the first major candidate to declare that he will consider running for President in 2016, was experiencing one of the downsides of entering a race on the early side: it leaves you more time to screw up. Over the past few days, Bush’s political-action committee released e-mails that included some Floridians’ social-security numbers, and its newly hired chief technology officer had been forced to resign over several comments he had made in the past, including tweets that referred to women as sluts.","969","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/california-gavin-newsom-governor"
"","970","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/california-gavin-newsom-governor"
"In a phone call on Wednesday afternoon, Newsom acknowledged the potential pitfalls of his decision—he joked that he was giving opposition researchers more time to dig up dirt—but said that, rather than quietly open a fund-raising account that is purportedly meant to raise money for some other race, when everyone knows that he wants to be governor, he preferred to be forthcoming about his intentions. “Love me or hate me, at least you know where I stand,” Newsom said. “You can be coy, or you can be candid—I’d rather be candid and let people judge that. Obviously there’s not much precedent for jumping out this early, so it’s ripe for critique.” Newsom acknowledged, too, that announcing so soon lets him get an early start on raising money and articulating a platform. “So often, time and its constraints get in the way of good decision-making—like, ‘We have to get this policy paper out this week even though it might not be vetted, might not have the substance it otherwise would if we had taken more time.’ ” He added, “If I waited two years, it’d be all about raising money, raising money, raising money.” The Democratic establishment in California might be eager, too, to anoint a frontrunner early on; it’s unclear who will run against Newsom, though the state treasurer, John Chiang, and both the previous and current mayors of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa and Eric Garcetti, all Democrats, have been named as potential candidates, among others.","971","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/california-gavin-newsom-governor"
"From 2004 to 2011, when Newsom was mayor of San Francisco, he had—and sometimes nurtured—a spectacularly high profile. He issued licenses for same-sex marriages, in defiance of state law at the time, and instituted universal healthcare for city residents. He also slept with a top aide’s wife, went into rehab to address what he called “problems with alcohol,” and supported controversial real-estate development and homelessness programs. Nevertheless, Newsom’s legacy as mayor is one seen as having been substantial, if not universally admired. But he has barely been in the news since his election, in 2010, as lieutenant governor—a position that, he readily acknowledges, isn’t particularly powerful. “There are constraints to this office,” he told me. “You serve in these formal roles”—he sits on the University of California’s Board of Regents and on the State Lands Commission, among other positions—“and by the way those are very significant roles, they’re important, but beyond that you’re not negotiating labor contracts, you’re not signing executive orders, vetoing or approving legislation, or participating in that legislative process.” In California, the position is mostly seen as a relic of a time when, if the governor travelled out of state, it was important to have a backup in Sacramento to do business for him; now that governors can easily take care of state business even while travelling, it’s sometimes unclear what, exactly, the lieutenant governor is supposed to do.","972","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/california-gavin-newsom-governor"
"Newsom was made aware of the limits of the job early in his tenure, in 2011, when he decided to focus on economic development, even publishing a report, with input from the Brookings Institution and the McKinsey Global Institute, on how California should change its economic policies to better support growth. But Brown—the person in the best position to turn those recommendations into policies—didn’t seem much interested in adopting Newsom’s ideas, on the economy or on other matters. He cared more about balancing the state’s budget; plus, the two men, who ran against each other ahead of the 2010 gubernatorial primary, before Newsom dropped out and sought the lieutenant governorship instead, aren’t said to have a particularly warm relationship, and Newsom’s economic-development report was interpreted, in some quarters, as a challenge to Brown.","973","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/california-gavin-newsom-governor"
"Since then, Newsom seems to have settled for quieter moves—opposing proposed tuition hikes at the University of California, for example—while biding his time. When he ran for reëlection, in 2014, the Los Angeles Times editorial board preceded its endorsement of him by calling the position a “notoriously do-little job.” The board wrote, “Being lieutenant governor mostly serves as a perch for gubernatorial candidates-in-waiting. Nevertheless, voters are asked every four years to choose among the aspirants, so here goes.” It’s little wonder, then, that Newsom—who, love him or hate him, did more as mayor of San Francisco than most—is eager to start doing something again.","974","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/california-gavin-newsom-governor"
"By the time 2018 comes around, California will have changed tremendously since 2009, the last time Newsom campaigned for governor. In some ways, his race, and the way Californians react to it, will be a proxy for that evolution. Some of those changes bode well for Newsom. The last time he ran for governor, he recalls, even his friends questioned whether his gay-marriage stunt, in 2004, would hurt him. In 2008, after all, Californians had passed the Proposition 8 ballot measure, which defined marriage as being between a man and a woman. It wasn’t until 2010—after Newsom had dropped his bid for governor—that the percentage of Californians supporting gay marriage surpassed the percentage opposing it, and it wasn’t until 2013 that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed the legalization of gay marriage in the state. “His bet, and it was a courageous bet, when he was mayor, was that supporting gay rights would not be a career killer—he was right,” Bruce Cain, a political-science professor at Stanford University and a longtime observer of California politics, told me. “It’s going to be something that’s he’s going to be able to rightfully tout.” The idea of universal healthcare, once seen as radical, has also become more accepted, particularly in California, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.","975","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/california-gavin-newsom-governor"
"But the California electorate is also changing in ways that may not favor Newsom. The four counties that are expected to see the greatest population growth, in absolute numbers, from 2010 to 2020, are all in Southern California—Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, and Orange. The differences among the California electorate are blurry for those on the outside—they look like varying shades of blue—but they’re real; Democratic voters in some parts of the south, for instance, describe themselves as “conservative” at much higher rates than those in the Bay Area do. Southern Californians can also be mystified by—and resentful of—Silicon Valley and its solutionist ethos. Though Newsom has now won two statewide races, he is perceived as a distinctly San Francisco type, with the gel-enabled good looks, and the breezy confidence—in himself and in the power of technology to solve problems—of a venture capitalist. In 2013, he wrote a book called “Citizenville: How to Take the Town Square Digital and Reinvent Government,” which, as George Packer wrote, in a 2013 article about Silicon Valley’s politics, includes lines like: “What if you could create competition among city services . . . through a kind of government Yelp? Then we’d be on to something.” Newsom is also, of course, white, in a state with a growing non-white population; last year, the number of Latinos in the state was estimated to have surpassed the number of white non-Latinos.","976","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/california-gavin-newsom-governor"
"“From a distance, you think, He has matinee-idol looks, he’s kind of glossy—but he comes across, in university settings, as somebody who tries to dig into things,” Cain said. “I think Gavin is a person of substance. The question is whether the changing demographics of the state and the growing resentment from Southern California of Northern California dominance is going to be a problem for him.”","977","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/california-gavin-newsom-governor"
"When I ran the notion of a North–South divide by Newsom, he acknowledged that there’s some truth to it, but largely dismissed it as “just a lot of politics.” He told me, “I have, as lieutenant governor, a moral, ethical responsibility to represent everyone in the state—including people in the rural parts of the state.” Indeed, “Citizenville” aside, Newsom has spent his time as lieutenant governor on issues with broad appeal—economic development, higher education. He said that, as governor, he would continue to represent the interests of the state at large. In his letter announcing his bid for the governorship, he wrote, “We must continue to grow our economy and create private-sector jobs, we must invest in public education and keep college affordable, we must address the widening inequalities that separate our communities and we must maintain California’s historic leadership in meeting the climate challenge.” He also promised, “This won’t be an ordinary campaign.”","978","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/california-gavin-newsom-governor"
"Newsom’s language and the timing of his announcement were reminders of the dramatic tactics he once successfully deployed as mayor, but has avoided as lieutenant governor—surely calibrated with the headlines in mind (and, this time around, the tweets). It seems to have worked, attracting more attention than he has seen in at least half a decade, and donor money may well follow. But if, in the long, long run-up to the 2018 election, he’s to win over those voters who regard his legacy as mayor with suspicion and his time as lieutenant governor with apathy, he’ll have to use the time as he says he plans to, by making considered decisions about policy positions that appeal to all Californians—and that presumably don’t mention Yelp.","979","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/california-gavin-newsom-governor"

This might come as a surprise; just last week, Politico accused the President of “killing” the speech by rolling out pieces of it in the days and weeks beforehand. Obama’s “SOTU Spoilers,” as the White House insisted on calling them, were said, by other commentators, to have “robbed the event of suspense.” (The White House delivered the ultimate spoiler when, minutes before the speech, it released the full text on the Web site Medium.)","January 21, 2015","995","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"Never mind that the State of the Union usually has all the drama of the Queen’s annual Christmas message. Arguably, the spoilers—which included steps to normalize relations with Cuba and a proposal to finance middle-class tax cuts by raising capital-gains and inheritance taxes—kept President Obama and the speech at center stage over the past month, displacing the new Republican Congress. Of course, the Nielsen ratings, which will be released today, might show a further decline in viewership of the State of the Union; last year’s audience of 33.3 million was less than two-thirds that of Obama’s first address to Congress, in 2009. If so, it isn’t Obama’s fault so much as your own. The narrowing of the national attention span has not been kind to long speeches. Besides, the only proven way to gin up interest in the State of the Union is to gin up a preëmptive war in the Middle East, which is the approach that George W. Bush took in 2003. That year’s speech, which preceded the invasion of Iraq by several weeks, attracted sixty-two million viewers, the largest audience since 1993. Mission accomplished!","996","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"Since most of President Obama’s initiatives were already familiar, the most notable aspect of Tuesday’s address was his tone: upbeat, unapologetic. Obama did not sound like a man whose party had just lost the Senate. (Senator Harry Reid, however, looked like that man.) Nor did he appear at all prepared to accept the limits that Republicans want to place on his Presidency. Last night, Obama had the punchy, self-assured air of a President on a roll, freed of old encumbrances (a narrow, nervous Democratic majority in the Senate) and buoyed by both a big jump in his approval ratings and, most important, a growing economy. “We have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth,” he said.","997","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"In recent months, as job creation has heated up, some Democrats have warned the President against this kind of ebullience. “People are in trouble,” the political strategist Stan Greenberg told the Times, after reportedly saying the same thing to David Simas, the White House political director. Indeed, many are, as Obama acknowledged last night. “Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?” he asked. His legislative agenda—for example, his sixty-billion-dollar plan to make community college free for most students—shows his refusal to accept that reality, and aims squarely at the problem of income inequality. At the same time, Obama was unrestrained in his discussion of America’s economic progress—and the role that he has played in it. “At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,” the President said. “Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health-care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.” Here he paused, savored these statistics, then ad-libbed: “This is good news, people.” A wink, a smile, a sideways glance. This is a man who is pleased with himself.","998","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"For Obama, this constitutes a meaningful shift. Long constrained by his own overcautiousness, he has, for several months now, been parting by degrees with his reluctance to talk about economic growth and job gains. As recently as April, in a speech about the minimum wage, he offered no indication that the economy was improving, except to say—a bit accusingly—that “those at the top are doing better than ever.” By summer, as the midterm elections approached, he had warmed to saying that, “by almost every measure, we are better off now than we were when I took office.” Last night’s address featured his most full-throated expression of satisfaction about the recovery yet. He has, in his phrase of choice, “turned the page.”","999","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"The reason this matters is that it’s not, in the end, only about taking credit; it’s about credibility. President Obama won’t have much of the latter unless he claims more of the former. By reminding Americans how far the nation has come since the financial crisis of 2008, and what it took to get here, Obama can create at least a little more public confidence in his plans for the rest of his time in office. Of course, that doesn’t mean he’ll have much success getting his agenda through Congress. But, if he sticks to his own story, and tells it repeatedly, he might have at least a fighting chance of winning an argument with the G.O.P. over, say, what elements to include in a tax-reform deal, or which party can, in 2016, be trusted with the hopes of middle-class Americans.

"The annual PEN Literary Gala, in which writers, the male half badly dressed in once-a-year tuxedos, assemble under the big whale at the American Museum of Natural History to mutter about their advances and applaud their imprisoned confreres, has always had its comic aspects. Glamour and guys (or gals) who write are not two subjects that are often congruent. The tuxes sag, the chicken congeals, the novelist’s weary eyes turn toward the clock at ten. That this event should become the scene of a high-profile public squabble seems absurd. And yet the PEN gala feels essential, and for one reason above all: the writers are there to stand up for some other writers who can’t be there because some bad guy has locked them up for writing something that the bad guy didn’t like. The principle involved is that the free expression of ideas, including insulting ideas, is part of what writing is. If people aren’t free to insult authority in some distant country, then we aren’t entirely free here.

(I should say that I am one of those hosts; The New Yorker is also part of the Benefit Committee, and our cartoon editor, Bob Mankoff, will be onstage with the Charlie Hebdo editors.) Salman Rushdie, who speaks with some sad authority on such issues, was succinct, calling them “six authors in search of character.”","1002","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/pen-has-every-right-to-honor-charlie-hebdo"

"Two things, at least, need to be said. First, that the naysayers, some of whom this PEN member counts as very good friends, all doubtless intend to be on the side of the angels—that is, on the side of open society and free expression. They have an argument to make. It is, as best I can understand it, of what Louis C.K. memorably calls the “of course … but maybe” variety. Of course it was wrong for the cartoonists to be murdered. But maybe they should have seen how threatening their work was to other oppressed minorities, in this case Muslims in France? Of course we deeply mourn their deaths. But maybe we could find someone better to honor than those inclined to print cartoons of Muhammad sodomizing his followers? We can regret their deaths without honoring their views—which some find bigoted or, at least, to use the word of the decade, insensitive.","1004","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/pen-has-every-right-to-honor-charlie-hebdo"
"This badly misunderstands the actual views, history, and practices of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists. Their work, as I’ve written, was not for those who like subtlety and suavity in their satire—it was not entirely to my own taste—but they were still radically democratic and egalitarian in their views, with their one passionate dislike being, simply, the hypocrisies of any organized religion. Few groups in recent French history have been more passionately “minoritarian”—more marginalized or on the outs with the political establishment, more vitriolic in their mockery of power, more courageous in ridiculing people of far greater influence and power. They were always punching up at idols and authorities. No one in France has, for example, been more relentlessly, courageously contemptuous of the extreme right-wing Le Pens, père et fille.","1005","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/pen-has-every-right-to-honor-charlie-hebdo"
"But let’s imagine, for a moment, that the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists weren’t very good guys. Surely even bad guys should be safe from fanatics with machine guns. The crucial distinction is not between those we like and those we don’t (Solzhenitsyn hardly followed a checklist from the West Village Democrats club) but between acts of imagination and acts of violence. The imagination sees and draws and describes many things—pornographic, erotic, satiric, and blasphemous—that are uncomfortable or ugly. But they are not actually happening. The imagination is a place where hypotheses and conditionals rule, and where part of the fun, and most of the point, lies in saying the unsayable in order to test the truths of what’s most often said. When the Charlie cartoonists made Muhammad look foolish, they were not saying that Muslims were evil—they were questioning the entire business of turning a person into a prophet. Not to get this is not to get why they were cartoonists.","1006","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/pen-has-every-right-to-honor-charlie-hebdo"
"Their doubters, it seems, believe that this activity of imagination was wrong or condemnable. They believe, instead, in a kind of communal protection—that the comfort of communities is more important than the public criticism of ideas. It’s a legitimate thought, one with a history of its own. It just doesn’t seem to be a thought worth inspiring a boycott by a self-defined cosmopolitan community of writers. If literature has any social function, after all, it is premised on the belief that, in the long run, the most comfortable community is going to be the one that knows the most about itself. Criticism is always going to be uncomfortable for somebody. There is something to be said for group solidarity over unhindered expression. But writers are the last people on earth who ought to be saying it. (Writers ought always to be a little on the outside; that’s one reason they look so awkward when they come together as a group.)","1007","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/pen-has-every-right-to-honor-charlie-hebdo"
"Well, easy to say, the doubters would likely go on. But surely if some partisans had gone in and gunned down, say, the staff of the hideously anti-Semitic cartoon-heavy journal Der Stürmer back in the nineteen-thirties, well, one might have condemned the violence, but would one have honored those cartoonists? The right response here is that cartoons are not magic Rorschach blots. They speak just as lucidly as epigrams, and the actual content of Julius Streicher’s hideous cartoons of Jews was clear: they were not mocking Judaism; they were threatening the lives of Jewish people. “Your religion is ridiculous” is as different a message as can be from “You are a degenerated race, you want to rape our daughters and steal our goods, and we will do away with you.” An insult to an ideology is not the same as a threat made to a people. Nor does one in any sense, logical or historical, flow from the other—a truth we know exactly because the people most inclined to say that a religion is ridiculous are those who were brought up practicing it.","1008","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/pen-has-every-right-to-honor-charlie-hebdo"
"It is not merely that an assault on an ideology is different from a threat made to a person; it is that it is the opposite of a threat made to a person. The whole end of liberal civilization is to substitute the criticism of ideas for assaults on people. The idea that we should be free to do our work and offer our views without extending a frightened veto to those who threaten to harm us isn’t just part of what we mean by free expression. It’s what free expression is. The Charlie Hebdo staff kept working in the face of death threats, and scorning an effort to honor that courage gives too much authority to those who want that veto. The killers were not speaking for an offended community and explaining why, after all, someone might easily miss the point of the cartoons. They were responding to an insult with murder. The honored cartoonists, in turn, are not markers in an abstract game of sensitivities. They were elderly artists whose last view in life was of a masked man with a machine gun. If that is not horror, then nothing is horror. If that is not wrong, then nothing is wrong. If writers won’t honor their courage, then what courage can we honor?","1009","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/pen-has-every-right-to-honor-charlie-hebdo"
"And so, with all that can be said about the absurdity of trying to honor the aggressively impious with the rituals of liberal piety, the language of heroism does still belong to and with the martyred cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo. Liberal civilizations, open societies, try to stretch as broadly as they can, to be as tolerant as life allows. But they have limits. The real social contract at the heart of liberal civilization is simple: in exchange for the freedom to be as insulting as you want about other people’s ideas, you have to give up the possibility of assaulting other people’s persons. By all means, mock and belittle, sneer and be sour. We all expect no less. But you cannot knife or shoot someone, or even threaten to do these things. If you do, you stand outside the contract, and you are no longer a citizen of our city. And those who you do knife or shoot are our martyrs to the open society, and they are to be honored as such: they are carrying the flag of freedom, whose device isn’t noble, nor ever needs to be, but is more often a ridiculous caricature of an overrated ideologue, a mocking picture of a prophet.","1010","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/pen-has-every-right-to-honor-charlie-hebdo"
"How can we tell insults to ideology from threats to people? Well, as I’ve written before, that is why we have critics, courts, and laws. Hell, it’s why we have writers. It’s the work they do. And it’s the reason why they gather at galas, where they can argue with each other and look ridiculous, just as they ought to.","1011","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/pen-has-every-right-to-honor-charlie-hebdo"
"During his sixth State of the Union address, President Obama is expected to focus on “middle-class economics,” as his adviser Dan Pfeiffer put it on “Meet the Press.” The President will reportedly highlight a proposal to cut taxes for the middle class, raise capital-gains taxes for high earners, and close tax loopholes that largely benefit the wealthy. In his preview of the State of the Union, John Cassidy argues that Obama’s plan is both sound economics and sound politics. Even granting that it stands almost no chance of getting through Congress, Cassidy writes, “simply advocating tax cuts for the masses will reshape the politics of the next couple of years, and, particularly, the 2016 Presidential election.”","January 20, 2015","1012","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/stories-for-obama-sixth-state-union"

"The Obama Administration has just released its budget for the 2016 fiscal year, which begins on October 1st. I’ll write in a later post about the economics underlying the proposals. In the meantime, based on a reading of the budget documents and a fact sheet posted on the White House Web site, here are some initial takeaways:","February 2, 2015","1016","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"1. With the Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress, the budget is as much a political document as an economic one. The chances that it will be enacted in anything like its current form are nil. Instead, the White House is using it to frame the political debate for this year and for the run-up to the 2016 Presidential election—an effort that began with the State of the Union address. The budget fleshes out the populist political agenda that President Obama laid out in that speech.","1017","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"","1018","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"2. The Administration is proposing a series of tax cuts and spending programs aimed at working families, which would be largely paid for by raising taxes on the rich. This agenda is being marketed, as it was in the State of the Union, under the banner of “middle-class economics.” “The ideas I offer in this budget are designed to bring middle-class economics into the twenty-first century,” President Obama said in a statement. “They’ll help working families feel more secure with paychecks that go further, help American workers upgrade their skills so they can compete for higher-paying jobs, and help create the conditions for our businesses to keep generating good new jobs for our workers to fill.”","1019","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"3. In adopting an economic agenda that is explicitly redistributive, the White House is seeking to tackle the glaring problems of wage stagnation and rising inequality, while also daring Republicans to oppose some measures that are likely to be popular. These measures include a new five-hundred-dollar tax credit for second earners, an expansion of the earned-income tax credit, and an increase in the value of existing tax credits available to families paying for child care. In addition, the budget would increase funding for Head Start, Pell Grants, and Obama’s initiative to provide universal preschool, which he unveiled last year.","1020","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"4. The budget still includes the President’s plan to provide free tuition for two years of community college for all students who graduate from high school with decent grades. Under the original plan, his initiative would have been paid for by eliminating some of the tax benefits attached to college savings accounts, known as 529s, the benefits of which are largely enjoyed by affluent families. But, after objections from Republicans and Democrats, the White House dropped this proposal. Now the money for the community-college plan will come from general tax revenues.","1021","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"5. As indicated by No. 4, the White House’s definition of “middle class” is a bit hazy. The extra funds allotted to the earned-income tax credit, Head Start, community college, and Pell Grants would all be directed at households in the bottom half of the income distribution in the U.S. But it looks like all families, regardless of income, would be eligible for the second-earner tax credit, while families who earn up to a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year would be eligible for the tax credits tied to child care. If your family earns a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year, you are firmly in the top twenty per cent of the income distribution—it’s hard to describe that as middle class. Still, according to a detailed analysis by the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, by far the biggest beneficiaries from Obama’s proposals would be the working poor.","1022","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"6. The budget contains three significant tax increases, all of which Obama mentioned in his State of the Union address. The first would raise the estate-tax bills that very wealthy families face, and would do so by eliminating the so-called stepped-up basis for valuing investments in the federal tax code. The budget would also raise the capital-gains tax rate paid by high earners from twenty per cent to twenty-eight per cent. In addition, the Administration would levy a new surcharge on big, highly leveraged financial firms, reflecting the risks they present to the rest of the economy.","1023","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"7. Considered on their own merits, many of these policy proposals are well targeted and worthwhile. But nobody should pretend that they would make a big dent in inequality and wage stagnation. For the broad middle class—households situated between the twentieth percentile and the eightieth percentile of the income distribution—the measures, taken together, would raise after-tax incomes by just 0.1 per cent, or even less, according to the Tax Policy Center. (Households in the bottom quintile would see their after-tax incomes rise by one per cent. Households in the top quintile would see their after-tax incomes fall by 0.7 per cent.)","1024","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"8. The budget would abolish the sequester and raise domestic spending by about seven per cent in 2016, with the increase evenly split between defense and non-defense programs. The White House says that this increase in spending would be paid for by cuts to other programs, such as agricultural subsidies, and by the elimination of the “carried interest” deduction for hedge funds and private equity firms. These are also good ideas. It barely needs saying that there is no prospect of Congress going along with them.","1025","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"9. The White House is also proposing a one-off levy of fifteen per cent on corporate profits held overseas, the proceeds of which would be used to finance investments in road, airports, and other infrastructure projects. After years of neglect, the country’s infrastructure sorely needs upgrading. But this proposal is really just part of an opening bid in a larger debate about how to reform the corporate tax. Since this debate could lead to big corporations seeing their tax rates reduced from thirty-five per cent to twenty-eight per cent, or even less, this is one area where the Republicans may well be willing to coöperate with the Obama Administration.","1026","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"10. Rather than seeking to balance the books within ten years, which is what Paul Ryan always claims (with very little plausibility) that his budget proposals would do, the White House is aiming to stabilize the deficit at about 2.5 per cent of G.D.P. That’s not far from where it is now. Later on, I’ll address the economics of all this. From a political perspective, the White House’s budget projections are all of a piece with its over-all strategy. For years, Washington has been fixated on eliminating the budget deficit entirely. The Administration is betting that the American public, in its eagerness to see the fruits of the economic recovery more widely shared, is now willing to tolerate a modest deficit for the indefinite future.","1027","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"Late last month, above a pho restaurant on Grand Street, a group gathered around a life-size cutout of Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist of “The Hunger Games,” outfitted with wings, body armor, and the face of Elizabeth Warren, the senior senator from Massachusetts. This was the inaugural meeting of Artists for Warren, a progressive answer to Prayer Warriors for Sarah Palin and Yoopers for Rand Paul. The group aims to persuade Warren to run for President. “I see her like this in my dreams,” Laura Dawn, who runs a collective called Art Not War, said of Kat-Liz, as the group had dubbed the cutout. Warren has become an icon to certain progressives, and the party’s host committee included Julie Pacino, Al’s daughter, and Mark Ruffalo, who was in London filming a movie but sent a video: “Just think of the carbon that we’re saving by me not being there!”","1028","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/artist-vote"
"A hundred and fifty people mingled in Pacino’s loft, listening to speeches from Warren supporters. After one audience member posed a question about Warren’s stance on Palestine, the organizers decided that there had been enough dialogue, turned on the music, and told everyone to dance. Many of the attendees had been inspired to attend by Obama’s State of the Union address. “I felt the juice again,” Marc Levin, a filmmaker, said. Levin’s documentary “The Last Party” followed a political know-nothing—Robert Downey, Jr.—on the campaign trail in 1992. Levin filmed sequels in 2000, with Philip Seymour Hoffman, and 2004, with Andre 3000. (The rapper interviewed then State Senator Obama, who asked for his autograph, and President Bush’s daughters, who seemed to be angling for a phone number.) Levin was already mulling over contenders for a 2016 installment. “Who’s plugged into the youth culture but is ready to say, ‘I want to grow up! I want to take a stand!’ ” he asked, suggesting Justin Bieber and Katy Perry as candidates.","1029","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/artist-vote"
"Another option stood nearby. “I’m ready for Warren!” Chloë Sevigny, the actress, said. She had a “Run Liz Run” T-shirt tucked into her skirt, like a backward apron. Sarah Sophie Flicker wore a T-shirt declaring, “War on Women Is Over! If You Want It.” (“It’s Yoko-approved,” she said.) Flicker helps run a women’s-rights campaign called Lady Parts Justice, “to keep women up to date on what’s happening with their uteruses,” and she sees the Warren movement as “a bit of political theatre.” “I’m just interested in moving Hillary to the left,” she said. “But I’m Warren-curious—which I guess is like bi-curious.”","1030","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/artist-vote"
"“That’s what I am!” Kathleen Hanna, a musician, said, holding a veggie burger. (Also on offer: “Butterscotch Frozen Thing with Sour Apricot Sorbet.”) In the nineties, Hanna helped to launch the riot-grrrl movement; one of her songs features antiwar speeches by Al Sharpton and Susan Sarandon over a dance beat.","1031","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/artist-vote"
"The Ready for Warren Super PAC has an official song, by Jessie Murphy—lyrics: “Americans want our next President to be a woman / Hey babe, here’s looking at you, Senator Elizabeth Warren”—but it’s all tambourine and acoustic guitar. “They usually go with ‘Burning Down the House,’ or Bruce Springsteen,” DJ Spooky, a hip-hop producer in a fedora, said. Spooky said he likes Warren’s “cayenne-pepper vibe,” but isn’t sure how his genre might fit. “There’s Public Enemy, but that would be a little too much for Iowa,” he said. “Anything with a beat is gonna scare people.” He thought 2016 could be the year of the political mashup. “I bet if I sampled the Rolling Stones or Marvin Gaye—something that generation knows—it could work,” he said. “Maybe we can get Adam to rap over it.”","1032","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/artist-vote"
"“I personally got Obama elected!” Adam Horovitz, of the Beastie Boys, said, with a cup of Butterscotch Frozen Thing in hand. “When he was campaigning, we did a tour for people to come out and vote. I haven’t been properly thanked, but he e-mails me all the time. So does Michelle. I had to tell them to stop.” Horovitz was standing with Hanna—they’re married—who said that she likes Warren, but that her primary concern is a Democratic victory in 2016. “I just want to make sure some weird fucking Nader thing doesn’t happen.” Horovitz looked down. “I might have been responsible for that one, too,” he muttered. In 2000, the year Nader siphoned votes from Al Gore, Horovitz contributed a song to a Nader campaign compilation. “I mean, he had his moments!” Horovitz said defensively. “He just wouldn’t go away.” He shrugged and took another bite of the Frozen Thing. ♦","1033","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/artist-vote"
"The latest Hillary Clinton flap has begun, prompted by a story in Tuesday’s Times revealing that, during Clinton’s four years as Secretary of State, she used a private e-mail account rather than a government-issued one. The story raised the possibility that this practice may have violated federal record-keeping requirements, and also raised possible security concerns, especially if she was using an e-mail account that wasn’t encrypted. Jason Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Michael S. Schmidt, of the Times, “I can recall no instance in my time at the National Archives when a high-ranking official at an executive-branch agency solely used a personal email account for the transaction of government business.”","March 3, 2015","1034","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"

"I happened to be on Twitter last night, when the story broke, and the reaction must have almost crashed the site. After a couple of hours monitoring the responses, which included a tweet from Jeb Bush calling on Clinton to release all of her unclassified e-mails, I went to bed wondering: What the heck was that all about?","1036","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"

"Senior government officials are typically allotted official e-mail accounts. Evidently, Secretary Clinton chose not to use one. In a statement released overnight, her spokesman said, “Like Secretaries of State before her, she used her own email account when engaging with any Department officials. For government business, she emailed them on their Department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained. … Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government emails, as long as appropriate records were preserved.”","1038","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"The Times didn’t reveal which e-mail service Clinton chose, but, citing commercial records, Philip Bump, of the Washington Post, pointed out that, on January 13, 2009, the same day Clinton’s Senate confirmation hearings began, someone registered the domain name clintonemail.com with the technology firm Network Solutions.","1039","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Perhaps, this clears up a bit of the mystery—though knowing the domain name and registrar doesn’t say anything about what security measures, if any, Clinton took. Nor does it address the larger issue of whether legal counsel with the State Department signed off on the decision to use a private account. Did the Secret Service and the White House know about it? The Secret Service, in particular, is very concerned about security breaches. Early in President Obama’s term, we subsequently learned, its agents stripped him of his personal BlackBerry and provided him with a more secure version. (As far as I’ve seen, it hasn’t been revealed what sort of e-mail account the President uses.)","1040","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Now, to the question of why Clinton would have chosen to use a private account. There is a history here. In 2007, it emerged that some Bush Administration officials had been using non-White House e-mail accounts, the archives of which were subsequently deleted. At the time, Democrats and public-interest groups accused the Bushes of seeking to shield their correspondence from government record keepers, inquisitive Congressional committees, and journalists making Freedom of Information requests. (A story by Vox’s Max Fisher provides more details.)","1041","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"

"In light of the scandals and enmity that have surrounded them, the Clintons have long taken an assiduous approach to guarding their records and their privacy. On one level, that’s perfectly understandable. By the start of 2008, Clinton had been embroiled in bitter partisan warfare for more than a decade and a half. Upon agreeing to become the Secretary of State, she would have known perfectly well that her political enemies, on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, would be seeking to put her down at every turn—making allegations, holding hearings, and demanding internal documents, including records of her personal communications. It’s also fair to assume that Clinton had at least half an eye on another Presidential campaign, during which those same political foes would scrutinize every record and document available from her time at Foggy Bottom.","1043","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Clinton’s concerns, assuming she indeed had them, turned out to be justified. Since the deadly assault in September, 2012, on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, House Republicans and others have spent an inordinate amount of time and effort trying to pin responsibility for the attack on her, demonstrating, along the way, that there are few tactics that they won’t stoop to in order to tar her image. Now, doubtless, they will try to use the e-mail flap to resurrect the Benghazi controversy.","1044","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Whether there will be broader political fallout is another matter. As the Times article pointed out, and the Clinton camp’s statement repeated, previous Secretaries of State, Colin Powell among them, have used private e-mail accounts for some (but not all) of their communications. That gives Hillary some cover. Journalists and Republican opposition-research teams will continue to dig, but, unless they can come up with something juicier and more specific, such as a damaging e-mail that was withheld from Congressional investigators, the story may not go much further.","1045","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Of course, these revelations become part of a steady drip of negative articles that are doing some damage to Clinton’s nascent Presidential bid, starting with the various revelations about the fund-raising activities of the Clinton Foundation, which my colleague Amy Davidson wrote about last week. There is a widespread feeling, among political professionals and the commentariat, that Clinton, having chosen to delay the launch of her campaign, might be on the point of losing control of its narrative. “We have had our head up our ass,” a former senior Clinton aide told Politico’s Gabriel Debenedetti and Glenn Thrush.","1046","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"But it can also be argued that, by publishing these stories now, the media might end up doing Clinton a favor. In the public-relations industry, the standard method of managing potential crises is to get the worst news out early, seek to weather it, and then argue that subsequent revelations are mere wrinkles on a story that has already been told. In 2011 and 2012, Mitt Romney flouted this methodology. Instead of releasing his tax records, which showed that he had paid a very low tax rate, at the start of his campaign, he waited until a few months before the election. That hurt him, a lot.","1047","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"

"At a time when much of the American system of government, particularly the relationship between Congress and the executive branch, is characterized by dysfunction and partisan warfare, the Fed is a shining exception. As a quasi-independent institution that is shielded from day-to-day political pressures, it can concentrate on the actual business of governing, and on preventing economic calamities. Its existence in this form, which Congressional Republicans have been seeking to undermine, provides an invaluable backstop for the U.S. economy and, indeed, the world economy.","1050","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-fed-needs-defending"

"The Fed doesn’t always gets things right. To the contrary, it often makes serious errors. Over the years, I have written one book in which I argued that the Fed’s policies in the late nineteen-nineties paved the way for a damaging stock-market bubble, and another book arguing that its policies in the early aughts helped to bring about a ruinous housing bubble. Many people believe that the Fed made another blunder in September, 2008, when, in cahoots with the Treasury Department, it allowed Lehman Brothers to go bankrupt and unleashed a global financial crisis.","1052","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-fed-needs-defending"
"The transcripts of the 2009 meetings at the Fed reveal more dubious judgments on the part of individual policy-makers, but also some very sound ones. This was the period when the Fed turned its monetary spigots all the way on, launching a bond-buying program that came to be known as “quantitative easing.” Many members of the committee, including Ben Bernanke, its chairman, and Janet Yellen, who was then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, had reservations about quantitative easing’s efficacy and long-term implications. But with the U.S. unemployment rate reaching ten per cent in October, 2009, they were rightly convinced that the economy needed another boost. And since the Fed had already reduced its target interest rate—the federal funds rate—almost to zero per cent, injecting hundreds of billions of newly created dollars into the financial system via bond purchases was about the only option available.","1053","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-fed-needs-defending"
"Fortunately, the Fed’s emergency policies worked. In tandem with the Obama Administration’s eight-hundred-billion-dollar stimulus program, which was passed into law in February, 2009, the measures arrested a downward spiral. According to the statisticians at the Commerce Department, the economy started expanding again in the third quarter of 2009. The recovery turned out to be a weak and frustrating one, but the danger of another Great Depression was avoided.","1054","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-fed-needs-defending"

"As you read the discussions of the Open Market Committee, which is made up of a handful of Washington-based governors along with the presidents of the twelve regional reserve banks, it rapidly becomes evident that this is a knowledgeable group of people trying to make the best decisions they can based on the evidence available to them. Yes, the committee’s members have ideological and regional baggage. Reading through their comments, you can sometimes make a good guess about their politics, and which regions they represent. Ultimately, though, the committee, under the gentle but persuasive guidance of Bernanke, came to decisions based on what it perceived to be the long-term good of the economy.","1056","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-fed-needs-defending"
"This rational and relatively objective decision-making process is a major reason why U.S Treasury Bonds are considered a safe haven, and why the U.S. dollar, despite the country’s persistent trade deficits, remains strong. People around the world have confidence in the U.S. financial system and the institution that sits at its helm. However bad the political infighting gets elsewhere in Washington, the Fed will be on hand to provide some adult supervision.

"Republicans on Capitol Hill have put forth a bill, during past sessions, that would mandate an outside audit of the Fed’s banks and board of governors; last fall, they passed it in the House. Would full passage into law fatally undermine confidence in the U.S. system? By itself, no. But it would be a step in the wrong direction—toward placing the day-to-day operations of the Fed under the purview of headline-chasing politicians, to whom objective reality is sometimes merely an annoying inconvenience.","1058","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-fed-needs-defending"
"But that hasn’t stopped the Republicans from demanding more “transparency.” Enmity and skepticism toward the Fed, which was once restricted to Ron Paul and a few other critics on the right (and left), is now bolstered by an unhealthy openness to conspiracy theories, and has become a mainstream position in the G.O.P. It has won over some Congressional Democrats, too.","1059","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-fed-needs-defending"
"The great irony in all this is that the Fed is already one of the most transparent arms of government. As Janet Yellen pointed out to Congress last month, the financial statements of the Fed’s board of governors and the regional reserve banks are already audited by independent accounting firms. And which other agency, after each meeting of its leaders, immediately announces the decisions it has taken and, a few weeks later, publishes a detailed summary of its discussions?

Or what was discussed inside the Treasury Department when the then Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, decided to let Lehman Brothers sink? Of course we don’t. But, thanks to the Fed transcripts, we know exactly what Yellen said in March, 2009, when some Fed officials were worrying that the central bank might be trying to do too much. ”The economy is just a disaster area,” Yellen said. “In light of the outlook I would want to do everything we can.”","1061","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-fed-needs-defending"

"If you’re old enough to remember the beginning of the first Clinton Presidency, in 1993, you may remember a joke that circulated at the time. It went something like this: Bill and Hillary Clinton are driving near her home town. They stop to get some gas, whereupon Hillary recognizes the station attendant as a high-school boyfriend. After they drive off, Bill tells her, smugly, “See, if you’d married him, you’d be working at a gas station.” Hillary smartly replies, “If I’d married him, he’d be President.”","April 14, 2015","1063","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hillary-for-president-no-joke"
"","1064","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hillary-for-president-no-joke"
"The humor of the joke lay in its recognition of the distinctive characteristics of Hillary Rodham Clinton, as she was still known back then: she was a political spouse who didn’t pretend to be apolitical, a professional woman who hadn’t shelved her own career to support her husband’s, an unapologetic possessor of a steely intellect who didn’t restrict herself to traditionally female spheres. While campaigning for the Presidency, Bill Clinton actively touted Hillary as a potential asset in government, telling supporters that his slogan might as well be “Buy one, get one free.” That Hillary was her husband’s equal in ability and acuity—if not, at the time, in political charisma—was a given. What was new was the open acknowledgement that a man as driven, intelligent, and ambitious as Bill Clinton might want a wife who was his equal in all those dimensions, rather than one who was a helpful, pliable, even decorative subordinate.","1065","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hillary-for-president-no-joke"
"But the comedy of the gas-station joke also depended upon a deeper cultural assumption: that the closest Hillary was going to get to the Presidency was being married to a man who was President, not by inhabiting the role herself. If, during the 1992 campaign, some pundits were sufficiently impressed by Hillary’s mastery of policy to express the opinion that she should have been on the ballot instead of Bill, their saying so was a means of articulating admiration for Hillary, rather than describing a realistic scenario. Her Presidency was less plausible, even in humor, than the political ascendance of a gas-station attendant. Back in the early nineties, it felt like a tremendous advance in sexual politics that the nation had, at last, acquired a First Lady who—campaign-trail cookie-recipe posturing aside—didn’t have to pretend to be less formidable than she was. But Hillary Clinton’s Presidential candidacy, still less her Presidency, was imaginable only in an alternate universe.","1066","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hillary-for-president-no-joke"
"It turns out that to arrive at that alternate universe, we simply had to wait: with her announcement this weekend, Hillary becomes the Democratic candidate presumptive, and the strongest contender in the entire Presidential field. All policies and positions aside, her anticipated nomination is the belated righting of a historical wrong: a feminist landmark within reach, almost a century after women achieved the vote in the United States, with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, in 1920, one year after the birth of Dorothy Howell Rodham, Hillary’s mother. Two women have represented the major parties on Presidential ballots before now, but only in the role of Vice-Presidential nominee: Geraldine Ferraro, in 1984, seconding Walter Mondale, and Sarah Palin, in 2008, alternately supporting and undermining John McCain. The Vice-Presidency is frequently a route to the Presidency itself; Hillary’s nomination would present the first opportunity for a woman to be installed in the top job without having to use that side door.","1067","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hillary-for-president-no-joke"
"But Hillary has been in and out of the White House before, conducted by her husband. This means, inevitably, that her triumph would be a more ambivalent victory than that promised by the abstract idea—or ideal—of the first female President. What does it say to women that their first path to the Presidency is through marriage? What might it someday say to their daughters? For better or worse, President Obama, when running for office and when newly elected, offered a tabula rasa for the projection of hopes and aspirations; some of those dreams have turned out not to have been entirely unfounded. (Millions more Americans now have health insurance, for one thing.) Hillary Clinton, by contrast, reminds us that we’re still a long way away from gender equality. Her candidacy embodies the compromises and the qualifications that so frequently make a woman’s route to success more circuitous and perilous than those of her male peers.","1068","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hillary-for-president-no-joke"
"“Compromise” or “Settle” makes for a less grabby one-word lapel button than does “Hope,” but such words capture an important aspect of Hillary’s political and domestic persona—one that, in the end, may be no less persuasive and inspiring to those female voters for whom Hillary’s ascent is cause for celebration. In a way, the path that Hillary has taken to arrive where she is—within striking distance of having the job which, two dozen years ago, seemed so beyond her—is a confirmation, not a repudiation, of what most women already know: that a goal is more likely to be arrived at incrementally than it is to be accomplished sweepingly. Once we have elected the first female President whose husband is a former male President, we can elect the first female President whose husband has never held elective office. Eventually, perhaps, we will elect the first female President who is married to a woman, or who isn’t married to anyone—although, admittedly, the alternate universe in which that last might happen still seems many years away.

"President Obama has heard a lot of this sort of thing over the years, as he noted in a press conference Tuesday. “There’s a tendency, I think, in the reporting here to frame this somehow as a personal issue between myself and Prime Minister Netanyahu,” the President said. “And I understand why that’s done, because, when you frame it in those terms, the notion is, well, if we all just get along and everybody cools down, then somehow the problem goes away.” It was a day of problems, including a Wall Street Journal report that Israel was sharing information, “with U.S. lawmakers and others,” that it had obtained from spying on America to derail the Administration’s nuclear negotiations with Iran. (Israel denied that it spied on America; John Boehner said that he was “baffled” by the report, and that the Israelis hadn’t given him secret information.) There was also the continued anger in the White House about Netanyahu’s election rhetoric, and new anger outside of it about chief of staff Denis McDonough’s comment, at a J Street conference, that an “occupation that has lasted more than 50 years must end.” Obama wouldn’t comment on the spying story, but he made it clear that, even if he suddenly decided Bibi was brashly charming and lovable, the larger problems would still be there. Not that he gave any indication that he had a change of heart: “I have a very business-like relationship with the Prime Minister … I talk to him all the time. He is representing his country’s interests the way he thinks he needs to, and I’m doing the same.” He added, “This can’t be reduced to a matter of, somehow, let’s all hold hands and sing ‘Kumbaya.’ ”","1074","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/a-bad-day-in-american-israeli-relations"
"Obama has made this case before, in other contexts—for example, in response to complaints that, if he only drank more with Boehner, the Republicans would never shut down the government. He is not good at faking cheer, and, in this case, Netanyahu is not good at nurturing it in him. This was also not the first time that the President has invoked, or, rather, rejected, “Kumbaya” to explain his policies on Israel. At a 2013 joint press conference with Netanyahu, Obama said that he supported a peace deal with the Palestinians “not only because of some Pollyanna-ish views about ‘Can’t we all get along and hold hands and sing “Kumbaya”?,’ but because I actually believe that Israel’s security will be enhanced with a resolution to this issue.” (Generally, talk of “Kumbaya” seems to be a sure sign that someone is unhappy.) A moment earlier, Chuck Todd had tried, without success, to get the President to talk about why the Israeli people had not “embraced” him—not just Bibi but the whole country.","1075","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/a-bad-day-in-american-israeli-relations"
"The particular problem that wouldn’t go away to which Obama referred on Tuesday was the need to create “a process and a framework” for a Palestinian state, and thus, in the American view, a lasting peace. Netanyahu, as Obama saw it, had undermined that goal in the frantic days before the Israeli election, when he said that there would be no two-state solution on his watch. He has tried to footnote that since, saying that he was just being realistic about “conditions,” but, Obama said, that “corrective” didn’t do it for him: “I took him at his word that that’s what he meant, and I think that a lot of voters inside of Israel understood him to be saying that fairly unequivocally.” That second part is important: Obama is reacting to what he sees as the electoral mandate that Netanyahu asked for and was given. Obama was, by many accounts, also dismayed by an Election Day video in which Netanyahu warned that Arab citizens of Israel were coming to the polls “in droves,” drawing an analogy between their turnout and a military emergency. As David Remnick wrote in The New Yorker this week, the parallels between that move and some of the incidents in America’s racial history are all too painful. On Monday, as the damage those words had done, including among many steadfast Jewish-American supporters of Israel, became clear, Netanyahu said, “I know the things I said a few days ago hurt some of Israel’s citizens and hurt Israel’s Arabs. I had no intention to do that. I apologize for it.” Here, it is Netanyahu suggesting that there’s nothing personal—he just had to stoke fear of them to win the election, which surely they can understand; there’s no need to be “hurt.” (Arab-Israeli groups did not seem entirely moved.) If he is serious about making amends, there will have to be practical repair work. That will be all the harder if Avigdor Lieberman and his far-right party, whose rhetoric is more openly ugly, join the government. Otherwise, the political questions remain. If Netanyahu doesn’t want Arab-Israelis to vote, for example, what does he want them to do?","1076","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/a-bad-day-in-american-israeli-relations"
"On Wednesday, the Times reported that Ron Dermer, Israel’s Ambassador to the United States, was meeting with Democrats and others, making the case that American Presidents and Israeli Prime Ministers had always had their ups and downs. At the same time, Dermer has been unabashedly lobbying against the nuclear deal with Iran, or at least the terms that are reportedly on the table. He has been part of a shift in which the unbreakable bond, as it it often called, is between Likud and the Republican Party. Obama, in his press conference, said, “We are absolutely committed to making sure that the Israeli people are safe.” He has also said that he sees a deal that would keep Iran from getting a bomb (reportedly, for at least a decade) as part of his legacy. Success in negotiations with Iran might also lay the groundwork for a better relationship between the United States and Israel, as hard as that may be for Israel to see now. If there is a failure in the talks, and the Administration, rightly or wrongly, blames Israel, the situation will become still more tense. That would be a political tragedy, more consequential than anything body-language experts might glean from Obama and Bibi.","1077","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/a-bad-day-in-american-israeli-relations"

Ninety-eight of those countries offer paid leave for fourteen weeks or more. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Barack Obama vowed to make family leave and sick days a priority in the final two years of his Presidency. He has work to do. In the United States, where all sorts of powers are commonly attributed to the private sector, many people might imagine that employers take up the slack. But the majority of U.S. employers do not offer paid family leave, for the simple reason that they don’t have to.","January 22, 2015","1078","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paid-family-leave-obama-work"

"When it comes to unpaid leave, the picture is brighter, thanks to the Family and Medical Leave Act, which Congress passed in 1993. Remarkably little progress has been made in the two decades since then, despite the F.M.L.A.’s manifest weaknesses. The law allows workers to take up to twelve weeks’ leave without losing their jobs if they or their close family members fall ill, or when a baby arrives. But the leave is unpaid, so most low-wage workers cannot take advantage of it. And, because the law exempts workplaces with fewer than fifty employees, among other eligibility regulations, it only covers about sixty per cent of workers, anyway.","1080","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paid-family-leave-obama-work"
"The F.M.L.A. had all the hallmarks of a first step; the problem was that there was never a second or third one. The economic downturn made the expansion of family leave—or, for that matter, guaranteed sick days—look much too cuddly, and congressional Republicans tended to want nothing to do with it. Nor was it an issue that feminists and women’s-rights activists focussed on all that intently. In recent years, it seems, we’ve heard more about work-life balance among professional women than among the working classes—more about how the Sheryl Sandbergs and the Marissa Mayers might finesse the demands of a job and a family than how a nurse, a bus driver, or a cashier could. Women in managerial and professional positions are more likely to work for employers that offer paid leaves, and if you happen to be a new parent who works at a tech company like Google or Facebook you can count on generous policies. But most workers can not.","1081","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paid-family-leave-obama-work"

The Washington Post reported this week that eighty-eight per cent of private-sector managers and financial workers can take paid sick days, compared with only forty per cent of service workers. In November, Massachusetts voters passed a ballot measure that allows workers to earn up to forty hours of guaranteed sick leave a year; they can use it to stay home when a child is sick, or when they themselves are.","1082","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paid-family-leave-obama-work"

"To those who worry that such policies are too costly for small businesses, the government, or maybe even women hoping to advance in their careers, there is some reassuring data. In the years since the F.M.L.A. was passed, California and New Jersey have both instituted six-week, partially paid family leave, funded by employees in the form of a small payroll tax.","1086","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paid-family-leave-obama-work"
"The New Jersey law went into effect in 2009, and three years later the Center for Women and Work at Rutgers conducted a study that showed some remarkably robust and positive results. Women who had taken the leave were far more likely to be working nine to twelve months after the birth of their child than new mothers who had not; they were also thirty-nine per cent less likely to be on public assistance, and fifty-four per cent more likely to have seen an increase in their wages. This finding is important: in some of the European countries that offer very long leaves—of a year or more—women who take advantage of the policies often pay a price in promotions and earning potential. But, based on the evidence here, shorter leaves seem to boost women’s wages.","1087","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paid-family-leave-obama-work"
"Studies also showed that, after the law in California went into effect, in 2004, people there took more and longer leaves. This was especially true for less advantaged women—non-college-educated, unmarried, and non-white mothers, who had previously taken maternity leaves that lasted, on average, only a week. (Among their college-educated, higher-income counterparts, the average was three to five weeks.) For all the attention being paid to the importance of bonding with infants, the fact that bonding isn’t instantaneous receives relatively little notice. A week of maternity leave goes by in a twilit blur; it’s hardly long enough for a new mother to get her physical strength back, let alone figure out the operating instructions for a tiny, dependent new creature. Women who went on paid leave breastfed their babies longer. Meanwhile, most of the businesses surveyed in California reported either positive or no noticeable impact from the family-leave law. Presumably, their employees came back to work happier, healthier, and less distracted.","1088","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paid-family-leave-obama-work"
"The data on the California and New Jersey laws suggests something not altogether expected but very encouraging.

These measures, along with minimum-wage laws, were among the few victories for Democrats in the midterm elections.

North Charleston’s mayor, Keith Summey, announced, “When you’re wrong, you’re wrong” and said that police officers can’t hide a bad decision “behind the shield.” He said that the police force’s “thoughts and prayers are with the family.” North Charleston’s police chief, Eddie Driggers, said he was “sickened.” South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who rose to office as a darling of the Tea Party, said that the shooting was “unacceptable.” Senator Lindsey Graham called the video “horrific.” Senator Tim Scott, an African-American Republican who grew up in North Charleston, called the shooting “senseless” and “avoidable.” The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, known as SLED, immediately took control of the investigation, and the F.B.I. has opened its own investigation, as well.

"It’s crucial to point out that had the bystander not turned on his smartphone camera, that creaky counter-narrative—I thought he was reaching for my weapon—would almost certainly have given Slager a pass. And no doubt, the swiftness of the political and narrative unity in the shooting death of Scott owes much to the lessons of Ferguson. But South Carolina is not Missouri—its racial past, in fact, is more violent, but its attempts to move away from that history, while less known, have been more bold. The state’s history of violence against black men and women is excruciating to know, or to read. If you are unfamiliar, then Google “George Junius Stinney, Jr.,” “Julia and Frazier Baker,” the Hamburg massacre, or the Orangeburg massacre. That is South Carolina at its worst. But there is a streak of fair-mindedness in the state’s history—an ancient ideal that Mark Twain parodied as coming straight out of the chivalric fiction of Sir Walter Scott’s mist-filled novels of courtly knights. While reserved exclusively for whites for most of its history, this tendency appears from time to time and is always surprising, especially to outsiders.","1098","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/walter-scott-shooting-south-carolina"
"All Charlestonians are required to know the story of their Civil War-era representative, James Petigru, the state’s only Unionist, who voted against secession. Charlestonians have made a centuries-long career out of tweaking the rest of the state for its rustic views. Petigru opposed withdrawing from the United States back then because, as it is often quoted, “South Carolina is too small to be a Republic, and too large to be an insane asylum.”","1099","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/walter-scott-shooting-south-carolina"
"But even during the collapse of Reconstruction, when racist Democrats took back control of the state’s government from Republican politicians backed by federal troops, there was a streak of fair play in the reformed Confederate General Wade Hampton, who was elected governor in 1876, and who, in his inaugural speech, said, “It is due, not only to ourselves, but to the colored people of the State, that wise, just, and liberal measures should prevail in our legislation.” (To those writing rebuttal posts right now to argue that this was mere racist palaver, I will note that however rhetorical Hampton’s views were, those earliest attempts at sane post-bellum racial decency in South Carolina were relatively real efforts at moderation, despite the fact they were, absolutely, crushed underfoot by pro-lynching extremists, like “Pitchfork Ben” Tillman, who thought that Hampton was out of his mind.) In the mid-twentieth century, a famous Charleston judge named Julius Waties Waring sought to steer a number of criminal cases toward the ideal of fair play, including a hideous police beating of a black man and later a local desegregation case that would eventually merge with others to become Brown v. Board. A cross was burned in the judge’s yard, and he eventually fled the state.","1100","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/walter-scott-shooting-south-carolina"
"But consider more recent events. Three years before Ferguson, the police chief in the small town of Eutawville killed a black man after an escalating series of events that began with a “broken taillight” infraction. He was indicted on a charge of murder. His trial, in January, 2015, ended in a deadlocked jury, but the prosecutor has promised to push for a retrial. A couple of weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown, in Ferguson, a white state trooper named Sean Groubert stopped a black man named Levar Jones at a gas station in Columbia for a “seatbelt violation.” On camera, Groubert panics and just starts shooting. Groubert was quickly fired and is now facing up to twenty years in prison on felony charges. And, in North Augusta, there is the case of a white public-safety officer named Justin Craven who shot and killed an unarmed black man named Ernest Satterwhite.

But everybody in Latta liked Moore. A lot. So a campaign was quickly mounted, backed by a large-enough coalition of citizens, leading to a special referendum that stripped the mayor of some of his powers so that Moore could be reinstated.

They mark the intentionally unrepaired scars of cannon fire dating to General Sherman’s burning of the city, in 1865. South Carolinians do not forget.

"In the fall of 2013, Mallory Heiney returned from a mission trip to Guinea with a plan to go into health care. She enrolled in classes at a for-profit college called Everest Institute, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, expecting to graduate with a degree that would help her become a nurse. But, after less than a year, she said, her instructors stopped showing up. Corinthian Colleges, the company that owned Everest, had admitted that its finances were in trouble, and that it expected to go out of business; it later said it would shut down several campuses, including the one in Grand Rapids. Heiney graduated but felt she had learned very little. When she tells people where she went, she told me, she gets sympathetic looks. She said, “You go to school so they look at you and think, ‘Wow, this person must be educated’—not so they look at you and think, ‘Oh, this person went to Everest. They must be trash.’ ” Heiney’s student debts include more than ten thousand dollars owed to the federal government and more than ten thousand dollars in private loans; that’s what remains after she repaid some of the interest on her debts while she was in college, in part by selling her own plasma.","February 23, 2015","1107","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/student-debt-revolt-begins"

"On Monday, Heiney and fourteen other people who took out loans to attend Corinthian announced that they are going on a “debt strike,” and will stop repaying their loans. They believe that they have both ethical and legal grounds for what appears to be an unprecedented collective action against the debt charged to students who attended Corinthian schools, and they are also making a broader statement about the trillion dollars of student debt owed throughout the country.","1109","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/student-debt-revolt-begins"
"Corinthian was one of the world’s largest for-profit operators of colleges; at its height, in 2010, more than a hundred thousand students were enrolled in its schools, which operated under the names of Everest, Heald, and WyoTech, throughout the U.S. and part of Canada. These days, the company can hardly be said to exist. Over the past few years, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the attorney general of California, and the attorney general of Massachusetts have brought separate lawsuits accusing the company of all kinds of bad behavior: pressuring students into signing up for huge loans, misleading them about their prospects after graduation, and strong-arming them into beginning to repay their private loans before they had even graduated. Last year, Corinthian stopped filing financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and, earlier this month, the Nasdaq Stock Market sent Corinthian a letter informing its officials—those who remain—that the business would be delisted. All fourteen of Corinthian’s Canada campuses have been shut down. In the U.S., more than fifty campuses have been sold off; a dozen have been closed.","1110","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/student-debt-revolt-begins"
"Corinthian’s downfall has come to be seen as a symbol of the ills of for-profit higher education—the false promises of employment, the mounting student debt, the aggressive collection tactics. But, for Corinthian students and graduates, the company’s failure has had more practical repercussions. Most Corinthian students cover their tuition by taking out federal and private loans. That debt, it turns out, is far more resilient than Corinthian itself. Students and graduates of the company’s schools are, by and large, expected to repay their federal student loans; the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has negotiated for forgiveness of part of the private debt, but not all of it.","1111","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/student-debt-revolt-begins"
"For anyone, student loans are burdensome; a recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that the student-debt problem is so severe that it seems to be reducing the formation of new households (a phrase often used as a euphemism for young people moving out of their parents’ homes) and home ownership. Adding to that, students and graduates of Corinthian-owned colleges are finding that their degrees are all but worthless; when they try to transfer, they discover that other colleges won’t recognize their course credits and, when they try to get work, they learn that employers are not at all impressed by Corinthian coursework.","1112","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/student-debt-revolt-begins"
"In December, a group of Democrats in the Senate, led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, wrote to the Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, calling on the Department of Education to “immediately discharge” the federal loans of at least some students who attended Corinthian. This wasn’t a toothless press stunt. The department, the senators noted, has the power to cancel federal loans for students who attended institutions that violated their rights. In fact, they pointed out, the department’s federal-loan agreements with students go as far as to spell this out, if in fine print: “In some cases, you may assert, as a defense against collection of your loan, that the school did something wrong or failed to do something that it should have done.” Earlier this month, the attorney general of Massachusetts made a request similar to that of the senators.","1113","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/student-debt-revolt-begins"
"A spokeswoman said that the Education Department “shares the commitment” of the senators and the Massachusetts attorney general “to upholding the rights of students who may have been harmed by the actions of institutions that participate in federal student-aid programs.” She said that the department has been in touch with Senator Warren and the attorney general’s staffs and is working on a response. The Education Department doesn’t have jurisdiction over private loans, which amount to far less than federal ones; the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which aims to protect consumers from private-debt troubles, is seeking full relief of the private Corinthian debt, but is meanwhile urging people to continue to pay off the loans.","1114","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/student-debt-revolt-begins"
"The debt strike is at once an unusual and obvious protest strategy in response to the Corinthian debt. The current and former Corinthian students participating in the strike, who call themselves the Corinthian Fifteen (Heiney is among their most outspoken members), are publicly refusing to pay both their federal and private debt. With respect to the federal debt, they plan to file legal documents with the Education Department and with the servicers of their federal loans that assert the little-known right Warren and her colleagues describe in their letter. The strike is the result of an alliance between the students and an offshoot of the Occupy movement known as the Debt Collective. Last year, activists affiliated with the Debt Collective became acquainted with Corinthian students through a campaign to buy and “abolish” large amounts of private student debt—a stunt, which I covered, that was meant to shed light on the magnitude of the student-debt problem. Together, the Debt Collective organizers and some of the students came up with the idea for the current action, drawing on some of the power-in-numbers theories behind the labor movement.","1115","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/student-debt-revolt-begins"
"Debt Collective volunteers—among them, lawyers and people who had dealt with the press—are giving legal, financial, and media support to the strikers, along with training in skills like financial literacy. In addition to committing time and energy, the strikers are assuming the considerable financial and social risks—lower credit scores, embarrassment—of making it publicly known that they don’t intend to repay their loans. (More than a fifth of borrowers of federal student loans go into default, but people who default tend not to announce their status publicly.) Ann Larson, one of the main Debt Collective organizers, talked to hundreds of Corinthian students, many of whom were put off by the potential financial repercussions of striking, not to mention the time commitment and the embarrassment. But she said that she hopes—and expects—that when the first fifteen strikers go public, others who have attended Corinthian campuses will be encouraged to join.","1116","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/student-debt-revolt-begins"
"The stakes are high for the Education Department. Corinthian has said that its students have taken out more than a billion dollars in federal loans annually. Kevin Carey, a fellow at the New America foundation who studies higher education, told me that the Education Department is likely wary of setting a precedent that could inspire students who attended other troubled institutions also to seek loan forgiveness. “Drawing legally and logically defensible lines around this situation will be tricky for them,” he told me. Still, Carey said, “In this particular case, I think there’s a pretty strong argument that they ought to forgive a lot of the debt.”","1117","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/student-debt-revolt-begins"
"Heiney recently began working as a home-health-care nurse—although, she said, “only after a five-hour interview explaining why my school doesn’t reflect my knowledge or patient care.” When I asked why she was willing to make such a public statement about not repaying her debt, she told me that she hopes to influence policy changes that would help future students. “In history, in the civil-rights movement, if everyone was afraid of their own personal repercussions, no progress would ever have been made,” she said.","1118","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/student-debt-revolt-begins"
"If it’s March, it must be test-prep season: next month, New York students in grades three through eight will take the state’s standardized English Language Arts and Mathematics tests: three days of exams devoted to both subjects, lasting for upward of seventy minutes a day. These are often referred to as high-stakes tests because of the impact that the results can have on student promotion, teacher evaluation, and school funding—and the stakes of the tests in New York this year may be pushed higher still. In his State of the State address, delivered at the end of January, Governor Andrew Cuomo pledged to make education reform a centerpiece of his agenda. “Everyone will tell you, nationwide, the key to education reform is a teacher evaluation system,” the governor said. He noted that while only thirty-eight per cent of New York State high-school students are deemed to be “college ready,” according to their scores on standardized tests, 98.7 per cent of teachers in New York’s schools are rated “effective.” “How can that be?” Cuomo asked. “Who are we kidding, my friends? The problem is clear and the solution is clear. We need real, accurate, fair teacher evaluations.”","March 11, 2015","1119","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-a-teachers-job-depends-on-a-childs-test"

"That teachers should be evaluated is an assertion with which no reasonable person involved with education—from a policy-maker to a parent—is likely to disagree. But how teachers might best be evaluated remains a contested science. In New York City, a system that incorporates a range of metrics, called Advance, was adopted in 2013. Students’ results in state tests account for twenty per cent of a teacher’s rating, but the teacher’s curriculum materials are also evaluated, as is his or her classroom practice, which is observed on multiple visits throughout the year by the school principal or another observer.","1121","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-a-teachers-job-depends-on-a-childs-test"
"In his remarks, Cuomo dismissed the methods of evaluation currently in place as “baloney,” and stated his intention to institute a new set of measures. If his proposals are approved along with the rest of the state budget ahead of the annual April 1st deadline, fifty per cent of a teacher’s evaluation will be based on his or her students’ scores on the annual state tests, with the remaining fifty per cent heavily weighted to include the assessment of an outside observer after a one-time visit. The judgment of the school principal will count for just fifteen per cent of a teacher’s effectiveness rating. Any teacher deemed ineffective for two consecutive years may be fired.","1122","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-a-teachers-job-depends-on-a-childs-test"
"Cuomo’s faith in the results of state tests as the best measure of the abilities of both students and teachers is not universally shared. Among those who have dissented is New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio. (Assembly Democrats are also reportedly opposed.) In testimony to a joint legislative budget committee in Albany, de Blasio warned that “excessive reliance on high-stakes testing is troubling. Standardized tests should not be the largest part of a full evaluation of a student or a teacher.” The mayor pointed out that test scores might be tipped downward by only a very small variation in student performance from year to year. With their livelihoods potentially in jeopardy over such minor variation, teachers will be obliged to teach to the test, he said, rather than “teaching for learning.” Teachers themselves are warning that, under such conditions, they will be obliged to narrow their curricula, forgoing collaborative science projects for worksheet drills. Other observers have pointed out that teachers who feel insecure about their ratings may focus on improving the test chances of their most able students at the expense of nurturing the capacities of the least able members of their classroom. Meanwhile, a principal who assigns struggling students to the very best teachers—the teacher those students need the most—risks a drop in the teacher’s scores, which could mean she or he will be lost to the school.","1123","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-a-teachers-job-depends-on-a-childs-test"
"Carmen Fariña, New York City schools chancellor, has repeatedly questioned the usefulness of state-test results in evaluating student, teacher, or school performance. Last fall, Fariña announced that the “letter grade” system of ranking schools which had been introduced in the Bloomberg era—and was based solely on a school’s test-score performance—would be replaced by a different system that would take into account not only test scores but also the observations of outside reviewers and the results of parental-satisfaction surveys, among other measures.","1124","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-a-teachers-job-depends-on-a-childs-test"
"Fariña also wrote a letter to New York City principals last testing season, lamenting stories she’d heard of trips to the Metropolitan Museum or the Bronx Zoo being foregone for the sake of more practice at multiple-choice bubbling. In her letter, Fariña urged principals to resist the temptation to seek better test scores through excessive test prep: “As educators, most of us know that the best preparation for the test is a rich, thoughtful, engaging curriculum that awakens curiosity in students, inspires them to ask questions, helps them explore complex problems, and encourages them to imagine possibilities,” she wrote. Even Arne Duncan, the Secretary of Education, whose department ties school funding to test results, has warned that “too much testing can rob school buildings of joy, and cause unnecessary stress,” noting that testing should only be one measure of progress. “In too many places, testing itself has become a distraction from the work it is meant to support,” Duncan wrote last fall.","1125","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-a-teachers-job-depends-on-a-childs-test"
"That readying students to take the kind of tests the state requires is not the same thing as teaching them—that it can, indeed, be the opposite of real learning, interfering with the fruitful conduct of the classroom and diverting attention and resources away from study—is an irony that is, at this point, fully embedded in the discourse around education. It has also become, increasingly, a motivation for parents, teachers, and principals to take direct action by opting out of state tests altogether. Last year, forty-nine thousand students opted out of the New York State E.L.A. test; sixty-seven thousand opted not to take the math exam. (At the school my son attends, PS 146, in Brooklyn, seventy per cent of students in testing grades opted out.) But 1.1 million students did take the test.","1126","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-a-teachers-job-depends-on-a-childs-test"
"This year, parents and educators are discussing the implications for students, teachers, and institutions should still greater numbers decline to participate in state tests—particularly given Cuomo’s proposals, against which protests and rallies are taking place this week in New York City and in Albany. At a forum at PS 261 in Brooklyn last week, Carol Burris, a high-school principal on Long Island who has spoken and written frequently about testing, noted that student proficiency, as measured by the state E.L.A. tests, was seventy per cent in 2009. By 2013, it had dropped to thirty-one per cent—the shift not caused by a catastrophic decline in the quality of instruction but, rather, owing to the different demands of new tests introduced in 2013, intended to be more in line with the newly adopted Common Core standards. Such a drastic reversal indicates at least as much about the tests—the efficacy of which have been widely challenged—as it does about the abilities of teachers or students. “Because we want to pretend to be objective doesn’t make it so,” Burris said.","1127","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-a-teachers-job-depends-on-a-childs-test"
"In a tacit acknowledgement of the opt-out movement’s momentum, the New York City Department of Education last week updated its parental guidelines concerning state testing in grades three through eight. The guide notes that schools are required to participate in state testing in order to qualify for federal funds, and that there is no official provision for parents to opt out. But, it says, should parents express a desire for their children not to participate in state testing, “the principal should respect the parents’ decision and let them know that the school will work to the best of their ability to provide the child with an alternate educational activity” during testing time.","1128","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-a-teachers-job-depends-on-a-childs-test"
"The Department of Education guide also notes that, because of changes made to the law last spring, New York City public schools may no longer use these state-test scores as the sole, primary, or principal factor in admissions policies, something some competitive middle and high schools had previously done. (There will continue to be a separate specialized high-school admissions test for eight schools; others have been instructed to develop policies for applications from students who do not have seventh-grade state-test scores.) In the light of such widespread skepticism about over-reliance on test results—and such widespread consensus about the detrimental effects engendered by teaching to the test—the governor’s doubling down on state test results to assess teachers’ effectiveness seems a questionable calculation. It looks likely, though, that, should Cuomo’s proposal come into effect, test-prep season will start a lot earlier next year, for everyone.","1129","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-a-teachers-job-depends-on-a-childs-test"

"Since Hugo Chávez took office as President of Venezuela, in 1999, the country’s government has reported no fewer than eighty plots to assassinate the President and overthrow the Chavismo movement, which continues under President Nicolás Maduro. The usual suspects include farmworkers, the paramilitary, terrorists, and former American and Colombian Presidents, in combination with Venezuelan oligarchs and extremist opposition groups. None of these conspiracies have been convincingly proved by the government. This hasn’t stopped officials from using real or imagined intrigues to attack their opponents. Only a month ago, President Maduro ordered the arrest of the opposition leader Antonio Ledezma, accusing Ledezma of participating in a plot to kill him, supposedly developed in Washington, New York, Miami, and Madrid.","March 18, 2015","1168","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-vs-chavismo"
"Last week, President Barack Obama signed an executive order imposing sanctions on seven Venezuelan law-enforcement and military officials, who are all accused of violating protesters’ rights during widespread anti-government demonstrations last year. The move inflamed both the narrative of an imperialist conspiracy against Chavismo and the language of its spokesmen. Maduro’s first response was to ask the National Assembly for special powers that would allow him to address the imperialist threat; the Assembly’s Chavista majority granted his request in less than seventy-two hours. Diosdado Cabello, the President of the National Assembly, who is considered to be the regime’s strongman, went on to call upon the people to defend their homeland, and warned that all those unwilling to do so would be treated as traitors. Over the weekend, the Venezuelan government launched two weeks of military drills, displaying weapons made in Russia and China, and officials gave speeches full of strong patriotic rhetoric to conjure up what they have claimed is the “imminent danger” posed by the U.S.","1169","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-vs-chavismo"
"","1170","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-vs-chavismo"
"Maduro’s regional allies, the members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), also closed ranks around him. Evo Morales, the President of Bolivia, said that the sanctions contained a hidden “threat to invade Venezuela.” In an official announcement, Cuban President Raúl Castro said, “No country has the right to intervene in the internal affairs of a sovereign state or to declare it a threat to its national security without any real justification.” Just last night, the ALBA leaders, including Castro, held an emergency meeting about the sanctions in Caracas, and issued a statement demanding that the U.S. “immediately cease the harassment and aggression against the government and people of Venezuela, as that policy encourages destabilization and the use of violence by a section of the Venezuelan opposition.”","1171","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-vs-chavismo"
"Obama’s order, which froze the American assets and voided the American visas of the seven Venezuelan officials, puts into effect sanctions that were approved by Congress in December. The sanctions target only mid-level officials, indicating that Obama wanted to take a cautious approach to confronting Maduro’s government. The language of the order, however, is extremely aggressive, declaring Venezuela “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States,” in order to meet the official threshold for applying sanctions. Commentators in Venezuela see the sanctions as a reaction to Maduro’s order to reduce the number of officials allowed to work at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas from a hundred to seventeen. Maduro alleges that some of the current employees were “involved in conspiratorial activities to destabilize the country,” and claims to have videos, audio recordings, and testimonies to prove it. For the U.S., the question is whether sanctions will be effective at putting more pressure on Maduro’s government or whether they will backfire and possibly even jeopardize the strategic objective of overcoming more than half a century’s stalemate with Cuba.","1172","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-vs-chavismo"
"At the moment, the sanctions have presented a much-needed opportunity for Maduro, whose popularity is at an all-time low. Around eighty per cent of the population, which is suffering the ravages of a severe economic crisis, believes that he is leading the country in the wrong direction. David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America and moderator of the blog Venezuelan Politics and Human Rights, says that the sanctions are damaging to American interests “for a very simple reason. Maduro’s main strategy has been to portray the very serious problems of governance he is facing as the result of an economic war carried out by the national bourgeoisie, backed by the United States. Declaring Venezuela a national security threat and declaring a state of emergency with reference to it could hardly have fit better into the Maduro government’s conspiracy narrative.”","1173","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-vs-chavismo"
"Maduro’s broad authorization from the National Assembly allows him to protect the sovereignty, security, and integrity of the country from any external or internal threat. Practically speaking, this gives Maduro almost total authority, in areas ranging from economic policy to domestic security. The government response to last year’s protests led to forty-three deaths and hundreds of injuries; more than three thousand protesters and opposition members have been detained, among them several elected officials and one of the most prominent opposition leaders, Leopoldo López. Now the government could easily increase its control over the opposition by imposing even more limitations on civil rights, detaining more of its leaders, or conceivably even by suspending the parliamentary elections due to be held by the end of the year.","1174","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-vs-chavismo"
"The sanctions signal an important change in U.S. policy toward the Chavist government. For the past fifteen years, the U.S. has followed the line proposed by John Maisto, its ambassador to Venezuela from 1997 to 2000, which was to judge Chávez (and, subsequently, Maduro) by what he did rather than what he said. Now, however, with the sanctions, the Obama Administration seems to have taken a new position. Fausto Masó, one of the most respected pundits in Venezuela, said that Obama finally wants to gamble in Venezuela because he knows that Maduro is not Chávez. “Chávez was an electoral champion and a solid leader,” Masó told me. Maduro, by contrast, has become increasingly embattled. “In the short term, Chavismo will use the sanctions as nationalist, anti-imperialist propaganda, but in the long term any confrontation will have a debilitating effect on the Venezuelan government,” potentially isolating the country in the midst of the worst economic crisis in its history. For Masó, the main question is whether Maduro will still allow the parliamentary elections. “Until now, Maduro has said the elections will take place, but he could make an executive order to suspend them,” Masó said. “If he does so, we’ll be entering uncharted waters.”","1175","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-vs-chavismo"
"With the arrest last week of two Brooklyn roommates who were allegedly on their way to Syria to join ISIS, water-cooler conversation around town turned, once again, to the secret lives of youths. “Young people, they don’t have much to lose. They can easily be brainwashed,” Ali Soufan, a former F.B.I. agent who runs the Soufan Group, a security firm that tracks Islamic extremism, said. So what makes them join a jihadist movement? Before their arrest, Akhror Saidakhmetov, nineteen, who worked in electronics kiosks, and Abdurasul Juraboev, twenty-four, who had a job chopping vegetables at the Gyro King on Foster Avenue, resided in Midwood, a diverse neighborhood of Orthodox Jews, Muslims, and immigrants from Poland and South and Central Asia.","1176","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/morning-in-midwood"
"The arrests flew in the face of the local conventional wisdom. At the Gyro King, a Pakistani man in a hoodie and sweatpants said, “The young people here? Mostly they’re staying at home, because their parents don’t let them do stuff. They go to school and home. That’s it.” A man at a visa service on Coney Island Avenue painted a similar picture: “Young people here are good. They don’t go out drinking.”","1177","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/morning-in-midwood"
"A twenty-year-old Jamaican man named Shakwan, who was working the counter at a gym down the block, had a different take. “It’s a boiling pot,” he said. “Is that what they say?” He lives nearby and has friends of every nationality, he said. “Arabs, Pakistanis. For a while, I was the only black kid.” Juraboev is from Uzbekistan and Saidakhmetov is from Kazakhstan.","1178","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/morning-in-midwood"
"Shakwan didn’t know them, but he said that the Gyro King is popular with local kids. “They make cheesesteaks, too. That’s the secret.” (The restaurant’s Yelp reviews confirm Shakwan’s assessment of the food: “When I see people say that there was roaches in the meal that is ridiculous. They are confusing it for a cardamom that looks different but its not a roach very delicious food I recommend it to everyone.”)","1179","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/morning-in-midwood"
"Shakwan questioned the idea that the local teens are all quiet and dutiful. “To be honest with you? They all smoke,” he said, referring to marijuana. “You might think that it doesn’t happen, but, trust me, everybody does it.” Hangout spots include Junior’s Pizza and Fried Chicken, the Kent movie theatre, and local basements, where teen-agers play video games like Call of Duty. Coney Island, where Juraboev was recorded as saying he’d like to plant a car bomb, if instructed by ISIS, is a Friday-night destination. “It’s a landmark. People go there to drink,” Shakwan said.","1180","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/morning-in-midwood"
"With so many different cultures, dating can be complicated. “My mom wants to know where I am all the time,” Shakwan said. “My Pakistani friends, they mess around with any girl—black, white, whatever. But they know they can only bring home Pakistani girls to their parents.” Flirting, he said, happens on Facebook. “Girls love the Internet.”","1181","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/morning-in-midwood"
"Shakwan said that a Pakistani friend had told him about another Pakistani, a nineteen-year-old whose roommate, after a year, admitted that he was a police operative and moved out. “He just got up one day and said, ‘I’m a cop,’ and left.” (Apparently he hadn’t found anything incriminating.)","1182","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/morning-in-midwood"
"Shakwan said he’d seen postings about jihadism on Facebook by people he knew. He’d seen the videos of beheadings. Of the local kids lured into radicalism, he said, “They’ve got to be immature. This is just like regular gangs, but on the Internet.” He’d seen classmates join gangs in high school. “It was always the quiet kid,” he said. “They’re scared, and they want to feel protected,” or they’re looking for friendship. “I call them fake friends.”","1183","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/morning-in-midwood"
"Soufan, the ex-F.B.I. agent, said that impulsivity was a problem. “Young people see videos on YouTube, they see speeches and sermons, they get really emotional,” he said. “They don’t think, Is this a legitimate narrative, a legitimate religion? They don’t think about whether it’s the right thing to do.”","1184","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/morning-in-midwood"
"Shakwan hopes to become a police officer someday, and he admires the agents who made the arrests. “I want to be a cop so bad,” he said. He thought that the saddest thing about Juraboev’s predicament was that, at his job at the Gyro King, he worked in the basement. Shakwan used to work as a valet-parking attendant. “I had to stay in the basement, too, to watch the cars. My phone didn’t get a signal. I was just looking at cars. It gets lonely.” ♦","1185","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/morning-in-midwood"
"Take any road in Italy, look up, and you’ll see a lovely hilltop town: a campanile, a castello, a few newer buildings spilling down the slope, as if expelled for the crime of ugliness. But even amid this bounty there is something exceptional about Matera. It clings to a denuded peak in the extreme south of the country, in the Basilicata region—the instep of Italy’s boot. Travellers are often shocked by the starkness of Matera. It’s a claustrophobic outcropping of cave dwellings carved into limestone, like scrimshaw, with hardly a tree or a blade of grass to be seen. In the afternoon sun, Matera looks like a pile of tarnished gold thrown down by a careless giant. Its severe beauty is as much a tribute to human resilience as to the rugged landscape where it is situated. Most places in Italy encourage you to celebrate the prettiness that wealth bestows: exquisite iron grillwork, festive marble fountains. Matera is more visceral—a monument to endurance and thrift, to hard lives lived without waste.","1186","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Matera may look inhospitable, but people have been settling here for a long time: it is often cited as one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, in a league with Aleppo and Byblos. There is something inherently alluring about this natural fortress, which towers above fertile plains and the Gravina River. A cave near Matera contains the remains of a hundred-and-fifty-thousand-year-old hominid; another has tools and bones from ten thousand years ago, and dozens of Neolithic sites dot the surrounding ridges. Matera was already a significant settlement in the Bronze Age.","1187","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Because of Matera’s narrow confines, rebuilding has been constant, making the city a palimpsest in stone. A dig in 1906, near the Duomo, in the town center, went thirty-five feet below the surface and found Christian coffins and the remains of a Saracen invasion from around 800 A.D. The scientists kept going, and below that they discovered statues, broken columns, and money from the Byzantine occupation, of around 400 A.D. Farther down, they uncovered ancient Greek and Roman coins and, under that layer, bits of ceramics from three thousand years ago. Matera stands at what has long been a crossroads between East and West. As Anne Parmly Toxey points out in her comprehensive 2011 study, “Materan Contradictions,” Greeks, Romans, Longobards, Byzantines, Saracens, Swabians, Angevins, Aragonese, and Bourbons all passed through the town. Man came here and never left—that’s the local boast. Given this history, it is jarring to learn that fifty years ago the government tried to make Matera go extinct.","1188","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"In the middle of the eighteenth century, Giuseppe Antonini, a baron from Salerno, praised Matera for its “highly cultivated” citizens and “its vast and extremely fertile countryside.” The Roman abbot Giovanni Battista Pacichelli, a contemporary of his, was likewise impressed. The town, Pacichelli noted, was divided into three sections, as it is today. The main section, the Civita, contains grand churches and picturesque palazzi; it is flanked on both sides by the Sassi, or the Rocks—steeply graded districts where mostly peasants lived. The pileup of the Sassi disconcerted Pacichelli: the roof of a house, he wrote, could well be the floor of a church, “confusing the places of the living and the dead.” But he, too, admired what was then a thriving ecclesiastical hub. The town was the seat of an archbishop and, at the time of Antonini’s and Pacichelli’s accounts, a regional capital. From Matera, Spanish occupiers oversaw part of the Italian peninsula, eventually giving way to the French.","1189","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Matera’s status began declining in 1806, when Joseph Bonaparte moved the seat of the region’s government to Potenza, sixty miles to the west. Over time, Matera became known as “the capital of peasant civilization.” Rulers came and went, but the locals endured in their cave homes, or grotte. Each morning, they descended long, narrow trails into the valley, and worked in fields that were often miles away. At dusk, they returned to the mountain. Much of the communal life of the town was lived outdoors, in small courtyards called vicinati.","1190","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Materans were tough and self-sufficient. They had their own rituals and songs, their own demons and dialect. Many of their traditions developed as ways of preventing waste. Using shared ovens, they produced a unique horn-shaped bread that was leavened and baked slowly, yielding large pores that helped it stay fresh for a week. Rainwater was captured by a complex network of stone basins and underground ceramic pipes. Resourceful as the Materans were, however, their life style increasingly lagged behind that of the rest of the world. The better-off citizens of Matera began departing for the Piano—a more recently settled, flatter section of the hilltop—and the townspeople who remained in the Sassi were almost exclusively poor. In the caves, plumbing, electricity, and telephones were practically nonexistent. And until the nineteen-thirties you couldn’t take a wagon drawn by a donkey into the Sassi, only a hand-pulled cart.","1191","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Within Italy, Matera came to be seen as just another out-of-the-way town in the impoverished south; among foreigners, it had a reputation as a picturesque troglodytic locale. But, as the world modernized, curiosity gave way to repulsion. It seemed grotesque for people to live in lightless dwellings alongside their animals. In 1853, John Murray’s “Handbook for Travellers in Southern Italy” declared Matera “a dirty city” and noted that “its lower classes are said to be the most uncivilized in the whole province of Basilicata.” Its problems seemed intractable: poor sanitation, brutal work conditions, malaria. Yet the population continued to grow, reaching fifteen thousand by the early twentieth century. Half a dozen family members often crowded into a cave; residents used basins for toilets and burned the waste on the cliffs. Italy was falling behind the other nations of Europe, Basilicata was falling behind Italy, and Matera seemed to be last of all.","1192","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"In 1902, Prime Minister Giuseppe Zanardelli visited the Sassi and reported that it awoke in him “not just amazement but deep pity.” He proposed new railways, which weren’t completed, and land redistribution, which didn’t happen. In 1926, the archeologist and social activist Umberto Zanotti Bianco called Matera “a Dantean horror.”","1193","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"By this time, the Fascists were in power, and Benito Mussolini was determined to bring his humiliated country up to date. Matera was an obvious candidate for modernization. He connected the town to the Apulian aqueduct, providing the Sassi with running water, but the Fascists were stymied by the prospect of overhauling the caves. One solution, they decided, was to depopulate the Sassi and transfer the residents to houses near their fields.","1194","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Mussolini was ousted in 1943, and, paradoxically, it was one of his opponents, the leftist Carlo Levi, who fulfilled the Fascist agenda for Matera. Levi, a doctor and a painter from Turin’s upper class, had been arrested for anti-Fascist activities in 1935 and exiled to Aliano, south of Matera. He spent a year there, amid poverty that he would not have seen otherwise. In his 1945 autobiographical novel, “Christ Stopped at Eboli,” he described the peasants of Italy’s extreme south as living “in a world that rolls on independent of their will, where man is in no way separate from his sun, his beast, his malaria.” During his exile, Levi visited Matera only briefly, but his sister, also a doctor, passed through on her way to see him, and his book incorporated her observations of children “sitting on the doorsteps, in the dirt, while the sun beat down on them, with their eyes half-closed and their eyelids red and swollen” from trachoma. She described boys and girls trailing her down a path, begging for quinine.","1195","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Levi was a gifted polemicist, and his concise retelling of his sister’s experience changed Matera’s destiny. “Christ Stopped at Eboli” was widely translated, and the Sassi became notorious. Italian newspapers started calling Matera a national embarrassment. There were many villages in bad shape across southern Italy, but, as Toxey notes, the “mere idea of a cave, with its subhuman associations, offended the progressive mentality of the designers and leaders of the postwar world.”","1196","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"In 1950, Alcide de Gasperi, the head of the Christian Democrats, visited the Sassi and declared that “this sad remnant of past centuries should disappear.” Two years later, the party passed the first bill for the risanamento, or cleanup, of the Sassi. Materans living in the worst caves would be moved; the more habitable grotte would be renovated.","1197","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"At the time, the United States was funding the rebuilding of Europe through the Marshall Plan. With money flowing in, the Materan risanamento could be done with style. Italian architects were filled with modernist ideas for creating ideal communities. Problems of economic inequality that had never been solved politically might, they believed, be solved aesthetically. Materans would not be forced into generic new apartments; rather, they would be immersed in communities that reproduced the nurturing aspects of Sassi life—the courtyards where people met and gossiped, the communal ovens where they baked their special bread.","1198","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"The Italian planners had in mind the ambitious example of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which had resettled thousands of Appalachian families. An American sociologist, Friedrich Friedmann, led a team of researchers—including a historian, a doctor, a geographer, and a psychologist—who assessed conditions in the Sassi. After architects devised several potential resettlement schemes, Friedmann’s team asked the peasants which design they thought was best. In the new rural development of La Martella, four miles west of the Sassi, the architect Ludovico Quaroni attempted to re-create the open-air vicinati that the Materans had used as their plazas and drawing rooms. Each resettled family was given a house with an adjoining barn for animals; the bedroom windows looked out on the stables, so that residents could keep an eye on the beasts at night, as they had in the Sassi. The first families were moved to La Martella in 1954. The Giornale del Mezzogiorno declared that Materans had travelled “from the darkness of the Sassi to cottages in the green countryside!” Italian newspapers continued to support the cause, and the government began encouraging residents whose caves had originally been thought salvageable to move.","1199","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"The process of moving the peasants, though, did not go as planned. Not enough land was made available for farming. The new vicinati did not feel like the courtyards of Matera—they were not placed at the juncture of several houses, so residents did not naturally spill into them. Ambitions flagged, and builders began putting up ordinary apartment complexes.","1200","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"In 1961, a reporter for La Stampa found the Sassi empty but for a man and his lonely mule, which had been “made melancholy,” its owner speculated, by the disappearance of the people it had known. In the article, the director of local tourism suggested, hopefully, that the Sassi should become a museum. The newspaper later reported that locals wanted to use cement to bury the Sassi—or dynamite to blow up the area. Such radical measures turned out not to be necessary. Long before the caves were empty, the oldest ones began crumbling, and the government began fencing them off. Matera’s ancient settlement appeared to be coming to an end.","1201","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"In fact, the Sassi was about to be re-born. Squatters began occupying some of the caves, and others were used for drugs and prostitution. Then Raffaello De Ruggieri, a lawyer who considered the depopulation campaign a grievous mistake, moved in. “People felt I was crazy to subject my wife to the desolation and emptiness of the Sassi,” he recalls. The De Ruggieris were relieved to discover, however, that they had some friendly neighbors. Local artisans used the caves as workshops for making cucù—ceramic rooster whistles that are a town tradition.","1202","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Other young Italians began seeing the Sassi’s potential, and they became homesteaders. Roofs were buttressed, and modern plumbing was installed. In 1986, the Italian government encouraged the Sassi’s revival by offering subsidies that cut the cost of restoration work in half. Small shops began to appear, and in 1992 La Traccia, a software company, opened. “We came here because everyone else was boycotting it,” Franco Petrella, one of the owners, told an Italian newspaper.","1203","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"For a time, the new Sassi and the old butted heads. When a pioneering restaurant, Il Caffè del Cavaliere, opened, someone set off a small bomb in its entryway. The Corriere della Sera reported that some new residents felt as if they were living in the Wild West, and were thinking of buying guns to fend off “harassment, requests for money, and acts of intimidation.”","1204","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"But order was established, and as the limestone hilltop was restored its rough simplicity found new admirers. In 1993, unesco named the Sassi a World Heritage site, and with that designation “tourism really began,” according to Nicola Rizzi, a retired high-school teacher who was born in the Sassi. Cave dwellings were combined to form restaurants and boutique hotels.","1205","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Materan culture, once thought backward, was now admired for its warmth and its precocious commitment to sustainability. By the turn of the millennium, the Sassi had a popular jazz club, and artisanal winemakers were storing their grapes in the limestone warrens. A candlelit cave set on a hilltop turns out to be an ideal spot for a holistic spa.","1206","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"In February, I flew to Bari, a port city on Italy’s southeastern coast, and drove forty miles, to the hilltop. To enter the Sassi now, you have to park on the edge of sprawling modern Matera, which sits along the western side of the old cave town, and go the final hundred yards on foot. The modern quarter was built on a plain above the cliffs, so you walk down a winding road to reach the Sassi. It was night when I arrived at my bed-and-breakfast, the Casa nei Sassi, which opened a few years ago. Light from street lamps installed in the nineties reflected off the paving stones. Cats prowled alleys that glistened in a light rain. For centuries, the street where I was staying had been an open sewer; the Fascists had paved it over. In the aughts, the strip became crowded with clubs and restaurants. It can get noisy during the summer, but is tranquil in the middle of winter. My room was at the top of a dozen twisting steps, in a converted hayloft, and it overlooked a bar where I sampled Padre Peppe, a Southern Italian liqueur made from green walnuts. From my balcony, I had a view of hundreds of irregular terraces, odd abutments, incidental buttresses, and half-hidden alleys.","1207","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"The next morning, when the sun came up over the plateau that faces Matera to the east, I set out for a walk. You can get anywhere in town by way of the mazelike steps, but I took another road built by the Fascists, Via Madonna delle Virtù, which follows the edge of a thousand-foot cliff. Soon I stood on an outcropping—slabs of stone ending in a low wall. Behind me were the grotte, hunched and worn, one on top of the other. In the oldest part of the city, there are almost no stores, bars, or restaurants. Laundry fluttered from an occasional balcony, but most of the structures were unoccupied. Rows of vacant caves looked like giant skulls, with the empty doorways as eyes. The limestone walls were pockmarked, rain-streaked, and sun-bleached, and they varied in hue, from gray to yellow, as the light moved across them.","1208","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"To see the new Matera emerging from the old, you have to look up the hillside. These residences have the best light and, being closest to the modern city, were the easiest to renovate. They first drew architects and other creative people, then arts professionals and Web designers, and, finally, wealthier types. It’s like a tiny Tribeca. Many of the cave interiors have been playfully reimagined; in some, ceilings have been knocked out, creating three-story aeries.","1209","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"On my walk, I came upon a four-star hotel, Casa di Lucio, which opened in 2001. In the hotel’s windowless dining room, white laminate moderno tables were neatly aligned, and recessed wall lighting emphasized the pebbly nap and the roseate color of the limestone. A deep cistern was on display under glass. The hotel, whose rooms are spread out over several caves, had the one-of-a-kind glamour of the paradors that occupy former monasteries and fortresses in Spain. Nearby, in the basement of the Palazzo Gattini, whose owner was assassinated by brigands in 1860, there is a luxury spa offering hot-stone massages for ninety euros. An old cistern had been turned into a small swimming pool.","1210","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"The new residents of Matera don’t always seem imbued with the communal spirit of the old days: some property owners have fenced off vicinati, making the most public part of the Sassi private. As I went around the Sassi, I was relieved when I came upon a buzzing marketplace where apples filled straw baskets and smoked fish dangled from wooden trestles. An energetic young woman was currying a donkey and chatting with a young man and woman in rough clothes. A dusty wooden cart was leaning against a cobbled wall. But when the carter smiled her teeth were perfect, and the way the cart leaned against the wall was archly jaunty. This hive of activity turned out to be a movie set: a Hollywood crew was filming a new version of “Ben-Hur,” starring Morgan Freeman. Next to a thirteenth-century church, San Pietro Caveoso, a Roman eagle had been placed atop a newly constructed arch—the scaffolding in back gave it away. A crew had installed klieg lights above the ancient buildings. I discovered that “Christ the Lord,” an adaptation of the Anne Rice novel, had been filmed in Matera a few months earlier. When I went into a grotta covered with a bed of straw, I joked to a production assistant, “Is this where Christ was born?”","1211","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"“No,” he answered. “It’s just a typical Roman stable.”","1212","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Matera has played a prominent role in several Biblical films, serving as a stand-in for ancient Jerusalem. Christ has walked the town’s streets at least four times, most famously in Pasolini’s “The Gospel According to St. Matthew,” released in 1964. I became used to men going up and down the stairways in tunics, skullcaps, and neon sneakers.","1213","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Visitors armed with new guidebooks that praise the Sassi’s artisanal traditions sometimes know more about the town’s history than locals whose families were transferred to the modern quarter. I walked by a handsome Renaissance structure with a precipitous view over a low stone wall, and asked a local policeman the building’s name. “Convento di Santa Lucia,” he said, adding that he’d learned it only recently, from Japanese tourists.","1214","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"At the end of my walk, I looked across the valley, past a stream that had carved out the mountain on which the Sassi clustered, toward terraces of olive and fig trees. They were once cultivated, but now grew wild and unpruned. Across the gorge were weathered limestone caves that had sheltered shepherds since Neolithic times. Not so different from the refurbished grotte behind me, they seemed to mock the idea of human progress.","1215","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"And yet Matera has an affable commitment to the young and the new. The town increasingly has the feel of a small Bologna. It has a branch of the University of Basilicata and a classical conservatory, whose students’ music pours out as you walk under its windows. This winter, there was an exhibit on Pasolini. Each September, a women’s-fiction festival takes place. A jazz festival, Gezziamoci, runs nearly the whole year, with performances in and around the Sassi, and a national archeological museum, in a former convent, displays the riches of local digs. You can play mini-golf in an underground cistern, and the new restaurants of Matera produce extraordinarily good food, turning what was once shameful into a source of pride. Matera’s cucina povera contains a lot of chickpeas, fava beans, and crushed peppers. An especially delicious dish is called ciallèdd, which, in Matera, traditionally combines eggs, the springy town bread, and flowers that grow in the nearby Murgia. (Yellow asphodels are considered the sweetest.) Restaurants proudly announce their local sourcing, and waiters are happy to tell you the story of your dish, as if a parcel of Northern California had dropped into Basilicata.","1216","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"This past October, the European Commission* named Matera one of its two capitals of European culture for 2019. (The other is Plovdiv, Bulgaria, a city that also traces its history to the Bronze Age.) Previous cultural capitals have included Istanbul and Marseilles, so the recognition is noteworthy for a small town in a region without an airport. The European Union has offered Matera fifty million euros for investment, and tourism will surely rise further.","1217","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"The organizers of Matera 2019 have designed an official logo, a horn-shaped tube with six extrusions. Depending on which resident you ask, the image is meant to symbolize either the old communal courtyards of the town or its intricate water system. The town’s pride in the coming celebration was evident: as I walked around the Sassi, the symbol showed up with Pynchonian frequency.","1218","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"The unesco designation is seen, in part, as an acknowledgment of Matera’s fraught history. No official apology has ever been given for the forced exodus. Half a century after the depopulation campaign, few cultural historians support the decision. It is now a shameful memory of a more desperate time in Italian history, after the trauma of the Second World War, when the country was intent on erasing its past. The transfer of Materans is seen as one of many patronizing attempts by élites to save indigenous people from themselves.","1219","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"The town’s mayor, Salvatore Adduce, told me that the depopulation of the Sassi was “a laceration.” Despite the best efforts of Italy’s modernists, Materan culture did not flourish outside the caves. Some former Sassi residents abandoned farming and became construction workers, building homes for other émigrés. When that work ran out, they moved north, to work in factories. Many Materans eventually lost their dialect, their customs, their trades, and—most of all—their sense of community. A number of those who stayed behind joined the Italian bureaucracy and contributed to the demise of their town’s way of life. As Toxey, the author of “Materan Contradictions,” has written:","1220","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Locals were excited when Matera was named a capital of European culture—the mayor cried on national TV—but the accolade raised difficult questions. How do you commemorate a disastrous social experiment? What should Matera become? What should the town do with all those empty grotte? And how should Basilicata handle the influx of tourists?","1221","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Materans agreed that they did not want the Sassi to become just another afternoon tourist stop. “We don’t want busloads of barbarians setting up tents,” Mayor Adduce told me. “We want people who, above all, can know what Matera is.”","1222","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"The artistic director of Matera 2019 is Joseph Grima, a former editor of Domus, the European design magazine. Grima’s approach might be called anti-Olympic City: he wants to avoid monumental gestures. The only thing that he plans to add to the Materan landscape is a portable concert hall, by the architect Renzo Piano, that Grima found in a warehouse in Milan several years ago. The structure, made of interlocking curved wooden ribs, can be brought to Matera, used for a year, and then taken down again. It fits with the town’s sustainable aesthetic, and is properly modest. Grima told me that he had thought hard about the unesco award. “It certainly brings wealth, but it has also killed so many cities,” he said, as tourists and destinations catering to them hollow out the real life of a place. He said of Matera that it would be particularly cruel to kill a city that has just come back from the dead.","1223","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Italy is constantly being confronted with challenges from its past: the palazzo too big to heat, the metro dig upended by a Roman ruin. At the same time, Italians like to say “Si fa”—“It works out.” Lately, though, things have not been working out in the Basilicata region. It is one of the poorest regions in Italy, and the unemployment rate is 14.7 per cent. Its manufacturing jobs are being lost at a rapid pace, and between 2008 and 2013 the economy contracted by 13.6 per cent.","1224","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"One of Basilicata’s few bright spots is the Sassi. Not only does it draw tourist dollars; the Italians who now fill the caves are better educated and better paid than the people who left them. They are part of the generation that is succeeding the failed industrial one. Alberto Cottica, a Web entrepreneur who was a consultant to the Matera 2019 committee, told me, “The people who moved in were hipster central.” The Sassi has a lot of digital businesses—broadband is available—and it can seem as if every ounce of Matera’s patrimony were being presented on local Web sites. Last year, part of a prominent ancient building was loaned to a millennial-led organization called unMonastery—a group of self-described “civic hackers” who run a “social clinic” that embeds “skilled individuals within communities that could benefit from their presence.” (The group, now thriving, recently decamped for Athens.) Everything produced by Matera 2019 will be digitally accessible and copyright-free.","1225","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Grima champions Matera’s new digital ethic, and notes proudly that there is no plan to build a conventional new museum or exhibit space. To collect the artistic riches from the region and put them on display in the Sassi would deracinate them, he argues. Instead, curators in Matera will construct an online database that can guide visitors to various local collections. “The region has an extraordinary abundance—much of it in private hands,” Grima said. Matera plans to open a reading room to help visitors appreciate the region’s cultural treasures, but the objects will remain where they are. Matera’s vibrant virtual community, it is hoped, can replace the traditional one that the government destroyed.","1226","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"One day, I took a tour of the Sassi with a man named Vito Festa, who grew up in the district in the nineteen-fifties. He is unusually open about his past: many older Materans still refuse to visit the Sassi or even talk about it. Some of those who built new homes overlooking the caves made sure that there were no windows facing their old dwellings. They found it humiliating to confront the way they had lived before the government rescued them. They had been told they were filthy so many times that they had internalized the sentiment.","1227","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Festa had spent several years in the north of Italy, working as a technician in a chemical lab, but he was not embarrassed about his southern past. Now sixty-seven, he looked like many older Materans, with an orangey skin tone that resulted from spending so much time outdoors when he was young. Marching with him up the hill, I could see that he enjoyed revisiting scenes of his boyhood: the steep path where he had carried water jugs home to his family, the place where he and some friends had accidentally kicked a soccer ball off a cliff. He showed me the outlines of old cisterns and called up the names of farmers who had cultivated the olive and fig trees that now grew wild. Many of his memories were about struggling to get enough to eat: he pointed to a parapet where he had put down bird traps (“I never caught any”), and to the roofs where his family had left almonds to dry. “No one worried about us back then,” he said. “Those were different times.” It had been a community, he remembered, where everyone helped everyone else. As we walked, he bumped into old friends and joked with them in the traditional Materan dialect, which is spoken slowly, with open vowels.","1228","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Festa had a comfortable pension; the Italian system had done right by him in the end. We walked past the Duomo—where he and his ten siblings and half-siblings had been baptized—and past the town’s one outdoor postcard vender, then followed the narrow path to the Sasso Caveoso, the poorest part of the town, where he had grown up. He had no trouble finding his grotta, now abandoned and exposed to the weather. Mold grew on the walls, and some of the stone facing had flaked off. Archeologists had dug into the floor, then covered their holes with straw. He remembered that the cave had two functioning lights, installed by the Fascists. Wires still dangled from the cave roof. His parents and his grandparents slept in the front, and he and his siblings slept in the back. Smiling, he said, “Una pazzia totale!” —what madness! He remembered that he and a brother had walked the family pig every evening before putting it in a stall behind their bed.","1229","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Festa’s family left the Sassi in 1959, when he was eleven, for Spine Bianche, one of the nearby developments built by the modernists. “We were so happy we jumped on the bed!” he recalled. He now owns his own house, in the north of town. As we drove to see it, I got my first good look at modern Matera. Given the economic difficulties of Basilicata, I was surprised by how vital the place seemed. It was a midsized city, with busy trattorias, a via nazionale that backed up at rush hour, and a dog-shit problem. We drove past a ten-foot-high statue of de Gasperi, the man who had emptied out the Sassi; his hand pointed upward, as if in benediction.","1230","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Festa’s house is about two miles from the Sassi, on a street of flat-roofed two-story buildings that seem to pay homage to the old grotte. The interiors, though, could not be more different. Festa proudly went through his garage to unlock the main door. He showed me pear and grapefruit trees that he was cultivating in a tiny enclosed garden in back, the shiny marble floors, and the two kitchens—one in the basement for days when it was too hot to cook near the living room. Everything sparkled. The Sassi caves are celebrated for their lack of right angles; Festa’s home was a series of perfect squares. Nothing had any history to it, except for one red rotary-dial phone, which was meant to be decorative. “I like pretty things,” Festa explained.","1231","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Around every corner in Matera, it seemed, I came across clusters of new residents—the prime engines of revitalization in the Sassi. Many of the men had two-day stubble and wore jackets that kept them warm inside the caves. Bit by bit, these locals were reviving the city, with Web services, excavations, renovations, or small artisanal stores.","1232","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"Some of them were members of Circolo la Scaletta, a volunteer organization co-founded by Raffaello De Ruggieri, the lawyer who helped lead the charge back into the Sassi. During Matera’s dark time, La Scaletta had functioned like the Guardian Angels, watching over the town’s patrimony; its members had saved rare frescoes and uncovered various cavern churches in the Murgia. “We had to choose between being the children of misery or the children of a proud history,” De Ruggieri recalls. “We chose the proud history.” Over time, La Scaletta expanded to include an organization called Fondazione Zètema. One evening, the Zètema group took me to a museum it had just opened, showcasing the work of José Ortega, a Spanish artist who died in 1990 and spent years working in the Sassi. The museum contained several papier-mâché works inspired by local artisans. The house had been beautifully restored, but it felt clammy; to warm up, I opened some wooden doors and went out onto a balcony. Matera is labyrinthine in the manner of Venice: you never know which direction you’re facing. I was stunned to be met by the panoramic expanse of the Murgia, all empty blackness. Standing there felt almost like falling.","1233","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"The members of Zètema suggested that I visit some of the rural cave churches in the area. In Matera, they pointed out, there was a confluence of Eastern and Western Christianity. Some of the town’s Renaissance churches were deliberately built on top of the more Eastern cave churches of an earlier age. In Matera, the new has always covered up the old.","1234","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"I decided to seek out a local “rock church” that is nicknamed the Crypt of Original Sin. It can be visited only by appointment, and is situated just outside Matera, along the Appian Way. Above the church is an enormous railroad bridge that connects to nothing—it was part of a failed attempt to link Matera to the main national railway lines. Approaching the cave in a car, I didn’t see anything special. This was no accident: the monks who lived here, twelve hundred years ago, did not want to be noticed.","1235","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"
"A small group of Italians were also visiting the church, and so we all descended into a low underground chapel. When the group’s guide turned the lights up, we found ourselves in the presence of half a dozen surprising frescoes. They were in the stilted Byzantine style, but they seemed imbued with an extraordinary modern sensibility: the flat figures looked at you with rounded, lively eyes, as if they might say hello to you on the street. The images, which depicted scenes from the Bible, were the least didactic series of church frescoes I’d ever seen. Mary was a warm, brown-eyed mother holding a baby in her arms. St. Peter had a beard and mustache, like a Levantine patriarch. The joy of being alive seemed more potent than worries about the Fall. Eve held out to Adam a wonderfully suggestive fig, instead of the usual apple. In an adjoining fresco, Adam raised his arms toward God as Eve emerged robustly from his rib. God was invisible except for his hand; long and delicate, it was the hand of an artist, not that of the muscular world-maker depicted on Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel ceiling. Amazingly, the rock church had been entirely forgotten during the war and the years of the Sassi’s depopulation. Now, like so much of Matera, it was found. ♦","1236","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/a-cave-with-a-view"

"The basketball locker room in the gymnasium at Princeton has no blackboard, no water fountain, and, in fact, no lockers. Up on the main floor, things go along in the same vein. Collapsible grandstands pull out of the walls and crowd up to the edge of the court. Jolly alumni sometimes wander in just before a game begins, sit down on the players’ bench, and are permitted to stay there. The players themselves are a little slow getting started each year, because if they try to do some practicing on their own during the autumn they find the gymnasium full of graduate students who know their rights and won’t move over. When a fellow does get some action, it can be dangerous. The gym is so poorly designed that a scrimmaging player can be knocked down one of two flights of concrete stairs. It hardly seems possible, but at the moment this scandalous milieu includes William Warren Bradley, who is the best amateur basketball player in the United States and among the best players, amateur or professional, in the history of the sport.","1238","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bill Bradley is what college students nowadays call a superstar, and the thing that distinguishes him from other such paragons is not so much that he has happened into the Ivy League as that he is a superstar at all. For one thing, he has overcome the disadvantage of wealth. A great basketball player, almost by definition, is someone who has grown up in a constricted world, not for lack of vision or ambition but for lack of money; his environment has been limited to home; gym, and playground, and it has forced upon him, as a developing basketball player, the discipline of having nothing else to do. Bradley must surely be the only great basketball player who wintered regularly in Palm Beach until he was thirteen years old. His home is in Crystal City, Missouri, a small town on the Mississippi River about thirty miles south of St. Louis, and at Crystal City High School, despite the handicap of those earlier winters, he became one of the highest-scoring players in the records of secondary-school basketball. More than seventy colleges tried to recruit him, nearly all of them offering him scholarships. Instead, Bradley chose a school that offered him no money at all. Scholarships at Princeton are given only where there is financial need, and more than half of Princeton’s undergraduates have them, but Bradley is ineligible for one, because his father, the president of a bank, is a man of more than comfortable means.","1239","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bradley says that when he was seventeen he came to realize that life was much longer than a few winters of basketball. He is quite serious in his application to the game, but he has wider interests and, particularly, bigger ambitions. He is a history student, interested in politics, and last July he worked for Governor Scranton in Washington. He was once elected president of the Missouri Association of Student Councils, and he is the sort of boy who, given a little more time, would have been in the forefront of undergraduate political life; as it is, he has been a considerable asset to Princeton quite apart from his feats in the gymnasium, through his work for various campus organizations. In a way that athletes in Ivy League colleges sometimes do not, he fits into the university as a whole. Now his Princeton years are coming to an end, and lately he has been under more recruitment pressure—this time, of course, from the National Basketball Association. In September, however, on the eve of his departure for Tokyo, where, as a member of the United States basketball team, he won a gold medal in the Olympic Games, he filed an application with the American Rhodes Scholarship Committee. Just before Christmas, he was elected a Rhodes Scholar. This has absolutely nonplussed the New York Knickerbockers, who for some time had been suffering delusions of invincibility, postdated to the autumn of 1965, when, they assumed, Bradley would join their team. Two years ago, when the Syracuse Nationals wanted to transfer their franchise and become the Philadelphia ’76ers, the Knicks refused to give their approval until they had received a guarantee that they would retain territorial rights to Bradley, whose college is one mile closer to Philadelphia than it is to New York. Bradley says he knows that he will very much miss not being able to play the game at its highest level, but, as things are now, if Bradley plays basketball at all next year, it will be for Oxford.","1240","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"To many Eastern basketball fans, what the Knickerbockers will be missing has not always been as apparent as it is today. Three seasons ago, when Bradley, as a Princeton freshman, broke a free-throw record for the sport of basketball at large, much of the outside world considered it a curious but not necessarily significant achievement. In game after game, he kept sinking foul shots without missing, until at the end of the season he had made fifty-seven straight—one more than the previous all-time high, which had been set by a member of the professional Syracuse Nationals. The following year, as a varsity player, he averaged a little over twenty-seven points per game, and it became clear that he was the best player ever to have been seen in the Ivy League—better than Yale’s Tony Lavelli, who was one of the leading scorers in the United States in 1949, or Dartmouth’s Rudy LaRusso, who is now a professional with the Los Angeles Lakers. But that still wasn’t saying a lot. Basketball players of the highest calibre do not gravitate to the Ivy League, and excellence within its membership has seldom been worth more, nationally, than a polite smile. However, Ivy teams play early-season games outside their league, and at the end of the season the Ivy League champion competes in the tournament of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which brings together the outstanding teams in the country and eventually establishes the national champion. Gradually, during his sophomore and junior years, Bradley’s repeatedly superior performances in these games eradicated all traces of the notion that he was merely a parochial accident and would have been just another player if he had gone to a big basketball school. He has scored as heavily against non-Ivy opponents as he has against Ivy League teams—forty points against Army, thirty-two against Villanova, thirty-three against Davidson, thirty against Wake Forest, thirty-one against Navy, thirty-four against St. Louis, thirty-six against Syracuse, and forty-six in a rout of the University of Texas. Last season, in the Kentucky Invitational Tournament, at the University of Kentucky, Princeton defeated Wisconsin largely because Bradley was busy scoring forty-seven points—a record for the tournament. The size of this feat can be understood if one remembers that Kentucky has won more national championships than any other university and regularly invites the best competition it can find to join in its holiday games.","1241","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"An average of twenty points in basketball is comparable to baseball’s criterion for outstanding pitchers, whose immortality seems to he predicated on their winning twenty games a year. Bradley scored more points last season than any other college basketball player, and his average was 32.3 per game. If Bradley’s shooting this season comes near matching his accomplishment of last year, he will become one of the three highest-scoring players in the history of college basketball. Those who have never seen him are likely to assume that he is seven and a half feet tall—the sort of elaborate weed that once all but choked off the game. With an average like his, it would he fair to imagine him spending his forty minutes of action merely stuffing the ball into the net. But the age of the goon is over. Bradley is six feet five inches tall—the third-tallest player on the Princeton team. He is perfectly coördinated, and he is unbelievably accurate at every kind of shot in the basketball repertory. He does much of his scoring from considerable distances, and when he sends the ball toward the basket, the odds are that it is going in, since he has made more than half the shots he has attempted as a college player. With three, or even four, opponents clawing at him, he will rise in the air, hang still for a moment, and release a high parabola jump shot that almost always seems to drop into the basket with an equal margin to the rim on all sides. Against Harvard last February, his ninth long shot from the floor nicked the rim slightly on its way into the net. The first eight had gone cleanly through the center. He had missed none at all. He missed several as the evening continued, but when his coach finally took him out, he had scored fifty-one points. In a game twenty-four hours earlier, he had begun a thirty-nine point performance by hitting his first four straight. Then he missed a couple. Then he made ten consecutive shots, totally demoralizing Dartmouth.","1242","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bradley is one of the few basketball players who have ever been appreciatively cheered by a disinterested away-from-home crowd while warming up. This curious event occurred last March, just before Princeton eliminated the Virginia Military Institute, the year’s Southern Conference champion, from the N.C.A.A. championships. The game was played in Philadelphia and was the last of a tripleheader. The people there were worn out, because most of them were emotionally committed to either Villanova or Temple—two local teams that had just been involved in enervating battles with Providence and Connecticut, respectively, scrambling for a chance at the rest of the country. A group of Princeton boys shooting basketballs miscellaneously in preparation for still another game hardly promised to be a high point of the evening, but Bradley, whose routine in the warmup time is a gradual crescendo of activity, is more interesting to watch before a game than most players are in play. In Philadelphia that night, what he did was, for him, anything but unusual. As he does before all games, he began by shooting set shots close to the basket, gradually moving back until he was shooting long sets from twenty feet out, and nearly all of them dropped into the net with an almost mechanical rhythm of accuracy. Then he began a series of expandingly difficult jump shots, and one jumper after another went cleanly through the basket with so few exceptions that the crowd began to murmur. Then he started to perform whirling reverse moves before another cadence of almost steadily accurate jump shots, and the murmur increased. Then he began to sweep hook shots into the air. He moved in a semicircle around the court. First with his right hand, then with his left, he tried seven of these long, graceful shots—the most difficult ones in the orthodoxy of basketball—and ambidextrously made them all. The game had not even begun, but the presumably unimpressible Philadelphians were applauding like an audience at an opera.","1243","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bradley has a few unorthodox shots, too. He dislikes flamboyance, and, unlike some of basketball’s greatest stars, has apparently never made a move merely to attract attention. While some players are eccentric in their shooting, his shots, with only occasional exceptions, are straightforward and unexaggerated. Nonetheless, he does make something of a spectacle of himself when he moves in rapidly parallel to the baseline, glides through the air with his back to the basket, looks for a teammate he can pass to, and, finding none, tosses the ball into the basket over one shoulder, like a pinch of salt. Only when the ball is actually dropping through the net does he look around to see what has happened, on the chance that something might have gone wrong, in which case he would have to go for the rebound. That shot has the essential characteristics of a wild accident, which is what many people stubbornly think they have witnessed until they see him do it for the third time in a row. All shots in basketball are supposed to have names—the set, the hook, the lay-up, the jump shot, and so on—and one weekend last July, while Bradley was in Princeton working on his senior thesis and putting in some time in the Princeton gymnasium to keep himself in form for the Olympics, I asked him what he called his over-the-shoulder shot. He said that he had never heard a name for it, but that he had seen Oscar Robertson, of the Cincinnati Royals, and Jerry West, of the Los Angeles Lakers, do it, and had worked it out for himself. He went on to say that it is a much simpler shot than it appears to be, and, to illustrate, he tossed a ball over his shoulder and into the basket while he was talking and looking me in the eye. I retrieved the ball and handed it back to him. “When you have played basketball for a while, you don’t need to look at the basket when you are in close like this,” he said, throwing it over his shoulder again and right through the hoop. “You develop a sense of where you are.”","1244","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bradley is not an innovator. Actually, basketball has had only a few innovators in its history—players like Hank Luisetti, of Stanford, whose introduction in 1936 of the running one-hander did as much to open up the game for scoring as the forward pass did for football; and Joe Fulks, of the old Philadelphia Warriors, whose twisting two-handed heaves, made while he was leaping like a salmon, were the beginnings of the jump shot, which seems to be basketball’s ultimate weapon. Most basketball players appropriate fragments of other players’ styles, and thus develop their own. This is what Bradley has done, but one of the things that set him apart from nearly everyone else is that the process has been conscious rather than osmotic. His jump shot, for example, has had two principal influences. One is Jerry West, who has one of the best jumpers in basketball. At a summer basketball camp in Missouri some years ago, West told Bradley that he always gives an extra hard bounce to the last dribble before a jump shot, since this seems to catapult him to added height. Bradley has been doing that ever since. Terry Dischinger, of the Detroit Pistons, has told Bradley that he always slams his foot to the floor on the last step before a jump shot, because this stops his momentum and thus prevents drift. Drifting while aloft is the mark of a sloppy jump shot. Bradley’s graceful hook shot is a masterpiece of eclecticism. It consists of the high-lifted knee of the Los Angeles Lakers’ Darrall Imhoff, the arms of Bill Russell, of the Boston Celtics, who extends his idle hand far under his shooting arm and thus magically stabilizes the shot, and the general corporeal form of Kentucky’s Cotton Nash, a rookie this year with the Lakers. Bradley carries his analyses of shots further than merely identifying them with pieces of other people. “There arc five parts to the hook shot,” he explains to anyone who asks. As he continues, he picks up a ball and stands about eighteen feet from a basket. “Crouch,” he says, crouching, and goes on to demonstrate the other moves. “Turn your head to look for the basket, step, kick, follow through with your arms.” Once, as he was explaining this to me, the ball curled around the rim and failed to go in.","1245","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"“What happened then?” I asked him.","1246","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"

"His set shot is borrowed from Ed Macauley, who was a St. Louis University All-American in the late forties and was later a star member of the Boston Celtics and the St. Louis Hawks. Macauley runs the basketball camp Bradley first went to when he was fifteen. In describing the set shot, Bradley is probably quoting a Macauley lecture. “Crouch like Groucho Marx,” he says. “Go off your feet a few inches. You shoot with your legs. Your arms merely guide the ball.” Bradley says that he has more confidence in his set shot than in any other. However, he seldom uses it, because he seldom has to. A set shot is a long shot, usually a twenty-footer, and Bradley, with his speed and footwork, can almost always take some other kind of shot, closer to the basket. He will take set shots when they are given to him, though. Two seasons ago, Davidson lost to Princeton, using a compact zone defense that ignored the remoter areas of the court. In one brief sequence, Bradley sent up seven set shots, missing only one. The missed one happened to rebound in Bradley’s direction, and he leaped up, caught it with one hand, and scored. Even his lay-up shot has an ancestral form; he is full of admiration for “the way Cliff Hagan pops up anywhere within six feet of the basket,” and he tries to do the same. Hagan is a former Kentucky star who now plays for the St. Louis Hawks. Because opposing teams always do everything they can to stop Bradley, he gets an unusual number of foul shots. When he was in high school, he used to imitate Bob Pettit, of the St. Louis Hawks, and Bill Sharman of the Boston Celtics, but now his free throw is more or less his own. With his left foot back about eighteen inches—“wherever it feels comfortable,” he says—he shoots with a deep-bending rhythm of knees and arms, one-handed, his left hand acting as a kind of gantry for the ball until the moment of release. What is most interesting, though, is that he concentrates his attention on one of the tiny steel eyelets that are welded under the rim of the basket to hold the net to the hoop—on the center eyelet, of course—before he lets fly. One night, he scored over twenty points on free throws alone; Cornell hacked at him so heavily that he was given twenty-one free throws, and he made all twenty-one, finishing the game with a total of thirty-seven points. When Bradley, working out alone, practices his set shots, hook shots, and jump shots, he moves systematically from one place to another around the basket, his distance from it being appropriate to the shot, and he does not permit himself to move on until he has made at least ten shots out of thirteen from each location. He applies this standard to every kind of shot, with either hand, from any distance. Many basketball players, including reasonably good ones, could spend five years in a gym and not make ten out of thirteen left-handed hook shots, but that is part of Bradley’s daily routine. He talks to himself while he is shooting, usually reminding himself to concentrate but sometimes talking to himself the way every high-school j.v. basketball player has done since the dim twenties—more or less imitating a radio announcer, and saying, as he gathers himself up for a shot, “It’s pandemonium in Dillon Gymnasium. The clock is running out. He’s up with a jumper. Swish!” Last summer, the floor of the Princeton gym was being resurfaced, so Bradley had to put in several practice sessions at the Lawrenceville School. His first afternoon at Lawrenceville, he began by shooting fourteen-foot jump shots from the right side. He got off to a bad start, and he kept missing them. Six in a row hit the back rim of the basket and bounced out. He stopped, looking discomfited, and seemed to be making an adjustment in his mind. Then he went up for another jump shot from the same spot and hit it cleanly. Four more shots went in without a miss, and then he paused and said, “You want to know something? That basket is about an inch and a half low.” Some weeks later, I went back to Lawrenceville with a steel tape, borrowed a stepladder, and measured the height of the basket. It was nine feet ten and seven-eighths inches above the floor, or one and one-eighth inches too low.","1252","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Being a deadly shot with either hand and knowing how to make the moves and fakes that clear away the defense are the primary skills of a basketball player, and any player who can do these things half as well as Bradley can has all the equipment he needs to make a college team. Many high-scoring basketball players, being able to make so obvious and glamorous a contribution to their team in the form of point totals, don’t bother to develop the other skills of the game, and leave subordinate matters like defense and playmaking largely to their teammates. Hence, it is usually quite easy to parse a basketball team. Bringing the ball up the floor are playmaking backcourt men—selfless fellows who can usually dribble so adeptly that they can just about freeze the ball by themselves, and who can also throw passes through the eye of a needle and can always be counted on to feed the ball to a star at the right moment. A star is often a point-hungry gunner, whose first instinct when he gets the ball is to fire away, and whose playing creed might he condensed to “When in doubt, shoot.” Another, with legs like automobile springs, is part of the group because of an unusual ability to shag rebounds. Still another may not be especially brilliant on offense but has defensive equipment that could not be better if he were carrying a trident and a net. The point-hungry gunner aside, Bradley is all these. He is a truly complete basketball player. He can play in any terrain; in the heavy infighting near the basket, he is master of all the gestures of the big men, and toward the edge of play he shows that he has all the fast-moving skills of the little men, too. With remarkable speed for six feet five, he can steal the ball and break into the clear with it on his own; as a dribbler, he can control the ball better with his left hand than most players can with their right; he can go down court in the middle of a fast break and fire passes to left and right, closing in on the basket, the timing of his passes too quick for the spectator’s eye. He plays any position—up front, in the post, in the backcourt. And his playmaking is a basic characteristic of his style. His high-scoring totals are the result of his high percentage of accuracy, not of an impulse to shoot every time he gets the ball. He passes as generously and as deftly as any player m the game. When he is dribbling, he can pass accurately without first catching the ball. He can also manage almost any pass without appearing to cock his arm, or even bring his hand back. He just seems to flick his fingers and the ball is gone. Other Princeton players aren’t always quite expecting Bradley’s passes when they arrive, for Bradley is usually thinking a little bit ahead of everyone else on the floor. W hen he was a freshman, he was forever hitting his teammates on the mouth, the temple, or the back of the head with passes as accurate as they were surprising. His teammates have since sharpened their own faculties, and these accidents seldom happen now. “It’s rewarding to play with him,” one of them says. “If you get open, you’ll get the ball.” And, with all the defenders in between, it sometimes seems as if the ball has passed like a ray through several walls.","1253","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bradley’s play has just one somewhat unsound aspect, and it is the result of his mania for throwing the ball to his teammates. He can’t seem to resist throwing a certain number of passes that are based on nothing but theory and hope; in fact, they are referred to by the Princeton coaching staff as Bradley’s hope passes. They happen, usually, when something has gone just a bit wrong. Bradley is recovering a loose ball, say, with his back turned to the other Princeton players. Before he turned it, he happened to notice a screen, or pick-off, being set by two of his teammates, its purpose being to cause one defensive man to collide with another and thus free an offensive man to receive a pass and score. Computations whir in Bradley’s head. He hasn’t time to look, but the screen, as he saw it developing, seemed to be working, so a Princeton man should now be in the clear, running toward the basket with one arm up. He whips the ball over his shoulder to the spot where the man ought to be. Sometimes a hope pass goes flying into the crowd, but most of the time they hit the receiver right in the hand, and a gasp comes from several thousand people. Bradley is sensitive about such dazzling passes, because they look flashy, and an edge comes into his voice as he defends them. “When I was halfway down the court, I saw a man out of the corner of my eye who had on the same color shirt I did,” he said recently, explaining how he happened to fire a scoring pass while he was falling out of bounds. “A little later, when I threw the pass, I threw it to the spot where that man should have been if he had kept going and done his job. He was there. Two points.”","1254","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Since it appears that by nature Bradley is a passer first and a scorer second, he would probably have scored less at a school where he was surrounded by other outstanding players. When he went to Princeton, many coach’s mourned his loss not just to themselves but to basketball, but as things have worked out, much of his national prominence has been precipitated by his playing for Princeton, where he has had to come through with points in order to keep his team from losing. He starts slowly, as a rule. During much of the game, if he has a clear shot, fourteen feet from the basket, say, and he sees a teammate with an equally clear shot ten feet from the basket, he sends the ball to the teammate. Bradley apparently does not stop to consider that even though the other fellow is closer to the basket he may be far more likely to miss the shot. This habit exasperates his coaches until they clutch their heads in despair. But Bradley is doing what few people ever have done—he is playing basketball according to the foundation pattern of the game. Therefore, the shot goes to the closer man. Nothing on earth can make him change until Princeton starts to lose. Then he will concentrate a little more on the basket.","1255","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Something like this happened in Tokyo last October, when the United States Olympic basketball team came close to being beaten by Yugoslavia. The Yugoslavian team was reasonably good—better than the Soviet team, which lost to the United States in the final—and it heated up during the second half. With two minutes to go, Yugoslavia cut the United States’ lead to two points. Bradley was on the bench at the time, and Henry Iba, the Oklahoma State coach, who was coach of the Olympic team, sent him in. During much of the game, he had been threading passes to others, but at that point, he says, he felt that he had to try to do something about the score. Bang, bang, bang—he hit a running one-hander, a seventeen-foot jumper, and a lay-up on a fast break, and the United States won by eight points.","1256","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Actually, the United States basketball squad encountered no real competition at the Olympics, despite all sorts of rumbling cumulus beforehand to the effect that some of the other teams, notably Russia’s, were made up of men who had been playing together for years and were now possibly good enough to defeat an American Olympic basketball team for the first time. But if the teams that the Americans faced were weaker than advertised, there were nonetheless individual performers of good calibre, and it is a further index to Bradley’s completeness as a basketball player that Henry Iba, a defensive specialist as a coach, regularly assigned him to guard the stars of the other nations. “He didn’t show too much tact at defense when he started, but he’s a coach’s basketball player, and he came along,” Iba said after he had returned to Oklahoma. “And I gave him the toughest man in every game.” Yugoslavia’s best man was a big forward who liked to play in the low post, under the basket. Bradley went into the middle with him, crashing shoulders under the basket, and held him to thirteen points while scoring eighteen himself. Russia’s best man was Yuri Korneyev, whose specialty was driving; that is, he liked to get the ball somewhere out on the edge of the action and start for the basket with it like a fullback, blasting everything out of the way until he got close enough to ram in a point-blank shot. With six feet five inches and two hundred and forty pounds to drive, Korneyev was what Iba called “a real good driver.” Bradley had lost ten pounds because of all the Olympics excitement, and Korneyev outweighed him by forty-five pounds. Korneyev kicked, pushed, shoved, bit, and scratched Bradley. “He was tough to stop,” Bradley says. “After all, he was playing for his life.” Korneyev got eight points.","1257","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bradley was one of three players who had been picked unanimously for the twelve-man Olympic team. He was the youngest member of the squad and the only undergraduate. Since his trip to Tokyo kept him away from Princeton for the first six weeks of the fall term, he had to spend part of his time reading, and the course he worked on most was Russian History 323. Perhaps because of the perspective this gave him, his attitude toward the Russian basketball team was not what he had expected it to be. With the help of three Australian players who spoke Russian, Bradley got to know several members of the Russian team fairly well, and soon he was feeling terribly sorry for them. They had a leaden attitude almost from the beginning. “All we do is play basketball,” one of them told him forlornly. “After we go home, we play in the Soviet championships. Then we play in the Satellite championships. Then we play in the European championships. I would give anything for five days off.” Bradley says that the Russian players also told him they were paid eighty-five dollars a month, plus housing. Given the depressed approach of the Russians, Bradley recalls, it was hard to get excited before the Russian-American final. “It was tough to get chills,” he says. “I had to imagine we were about to play Yale.” The Russians lost, 73-59.","1258","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"When Bradley talks about basketball, he speaks with authority, explaining himself much as a man of fifty might do in discussing a profession or business. When he talks about other things, he shows himself to be a polite, diffident, hopeful, well-brought-up, extremely amiable, and sometimes naïve but generally discerning young man just emerging from adolescence. He was twenty-one last summer, and he seems neither older nor younger than his age. He is painfully aware of his celebrity. The nature of it and the responsibility that it imposes are constantly on his mind. He remembers people’s names, and greets them by name when he sees them again. He seems to want to prove that he finds other people interesting. “The main thing I have to prevent myself from becoming is disillusioned with transitory success,” he said recently. “It’s dangerous. It’s like a heavy rainstorm. It can do damage or it can do good, permitting something to grow.” He claims that the most important thing basketball gives him at Princeton is “a real period of relief from the academic load.” Because he is the sort of student who does all his academic course work, he doesn’t get much sleep; in fact, he has a perilous contempt for sleep, partly because he has been told that professional basketball players get along on almost none of it. He stays up until his work is done, for if he were to retire any earlier he would be betraying the discipline he has placed upon himself. When he has had to, he has set up schedules of study for himself that have kept him reading from 6 A.M. to midnight every day for as long as eight weeks. On his senior thesis, which is due in April (and is about Harry Truman’s senatorial campaign in 1940), he has already completed more research than many students will do altogether. One of his most enviable gifts is his ability to regiment his conscious mind. After a game, for example, most college players, if they try to study, see all the action over again between the lines in their books. Bradley can, and often does, go straight to the library and work for hours, postponing his mental replay as long as he cares to. If he feels that it’s necessary, he will stay up all night before a basketball game; he did that last winter when he was completing a junior paper, and Princeton barely managed to beat a fairly unspectacular Lafayette team, because Bradley seemed almost unable to lift his arms. Princeton was losing until Bradley, finally growing wakeful, scored eight points in the last two minutes. Ivy League basketball teams play on Friday and Saturday nights, in order to avoid travelling during the week, yet on Sunday mornings Bradley gets up and teaches a nine-thirty Sunday-school class at the First Presbyterian Church. During his sophomore and junior years at the university, he met a class of seventh-grade boys every Sunday morning that he was resident in Princeton. If the basketball bus returned to Princeton at 4:30 A.M., as it sometimes did, he would still be at the church by nine-thirty. This year, having missed two months while he was in the Far East, he is working as a spot teacher whenever he is needed. Religion, he feels, is the main source of his strength, and because he realizes that not everybody shares that feeling today, he sometimes refers to “the challenge of being in the minority in the world.” He belongs to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, an organization that was set up eight years ago, by people like Otto Graham, Bob Pettit, Branch Rickey, Bob Feller, Wilma Rudolph, Doak Walker, Rafer Johnson, and Robin Roberts, for the advancement of youth by a mixture of moral and athletic guidance. Bradley has flown all over the United States to speak to F.C.A. groups. One of his topics is a theory of his that conformists and nonconformists both lack moral courage, and another is that “the only way to solve a problem is to go through it rather than around it”—which has struck some listeners as an odd view for a basketball player to have. Nevertheless, Bradley often tells his audiences, “Basketball discipline carries over into your life,” continuing, “You’ve got to face that you’re going to lose. Losses are part of every season, and part of life. The question is, can you adjust? It is important that you don’t get caught up in your own little defeats.” If he seems ministerial, that is because he is. He has a firm sense of what is right, and apparently feels that he has a mission to help others see things as clearly as he does. “I don’t try to be overbearing in what I believe, but, given a chance, I will express my beliefs,” he says. After the Olympics were over, he stayed in the Far East an extra week to make a series of speeches at universities in Taiwan and Hong Kong.","1259","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"As a news story once said of Bradley—quite accurately, it seems—he is everything his parents think he is. He approximates what some undergraduates call a straight arrow—a semi-pejorative term for unfortunates who have no talent for vice. Nevertheless, considerable numbers of Princeton undergraduates have told me that Bradley is easily the most widely admired student on the campus and probably the best liked, and that his skill at basketball is not the only way in which he atones for his moral altitude. He has worked for the Campus Fund Drive, which is a sort of Collegiate Gothic community chest, and for the Orange Key Society, an organization that, among other things, helps freshmen settle down into college life. One effect that Bradley has had on Princeton has been to widen noticeably the undergraduate body’s tolerance for people with high ethical standards. “He is a source of inspiration to anyone who comes in contact with him,” one of his classmates says. “You look at yourself and you decide to do better.”","1260","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bradley has built his life by setting up and going after a series of goals, athletic and academic, which at the moment have culminated in his position on the Olympic basketball team and his Rhodes Scholarship. Of the future beyond Oxford, he says only that he wants to go to law school and later “set a Christian example by implementing my feelings within the structure of the society,” adding, “I value my ultimate goals more than playing basketball.” I have asked all sorts of people who know Bradley, or know about him, what they think he will be doing when he is forty. A really startling number of them, including teachers, coaches, college boys, and even journalists, give the same answer: “He will be the governor of Missouri.” The chief dissent comes from people who look beyond the stepping stone of the Missouri State House and calmly tell you that Bradley is going to be President. Last spring, Leonard Shecter, of the New York Post, began a column by saying, “In twenty-five years or so our presidents are going to have to be better than ever. It’s nice to know that Bill Bradley will be available.” Edward Rapp, Bradley’s high-school principal, once said, “With the help of his friends, Bill could very well be President of the United States. And without the help of his friends he might make it anyway.”","1261","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Some of Bradley’s classmates, who think he is a slave to his ideals, call him The Martyr, though he is more frequently addressed as Brads, Spin, Star, or Horse. He is also called Hayseed, and teased about his Missouri accent. Additional abuse is piled on him by his five roommates, who kid him by saying that his good grades are really undeserved gifts from a hero-worshipping faculty, and who insistently ask him to tell them how many points he scored in various bygone games, implying that he knows exactly but is feigning modesty when he claims he doesn’t. He is a good-looking, dark-haired boy whose habits of dress give him protective coloration on the Princeton campus; like nearly everyone else, he wears khaki trousers and a white shirt. His room is always littered, and he doesn’t seem to care when he runs out of things; he has been known to sleep without sheets for as long as five weeks, stretched out on a bare mattress under a hairy bit of blanket. He drives automobiles wildly. When he wastes time, he wastes it hurriedly rather than at leisure. He dates with modest frequency—girls from Smith, Wellesley, Vassar, Randolph-Macon, Manhattanville. Just before leaving his room to go dress for a basketball game, he invariably turns on his hi-fi and listens to “Climb Every Mountain,” from “The Sound of Music.” He is introspective, and sometimes takes himself very seriously; it is hard, too, for him to let himself go. His reserve with people he doesn’t know well has often caused him to be quite inaccurately described as shy and sombre. He has an ambiguous, bemused manner that makes people wonder on occasion whether he is in earnest or just kidding; they eventually decide, as a rule, that half the time he is just kidding.","1262","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bradley calls practically all men “Mister” whose age exceeds his own by more than a couple of years. This includes any N.B.A. players he happens to meet, Princeton trainers, and Mr. Willem Hendrik van Breda Kolff, his coach. Van Breda Kolff was a Princeton basketball star himself, some twenty years ago, and went on to play for the New York Knickerbockers. Before returning to Princeton in 1962, he coached at Lafayette and Hofstra. His teams at the three colleges have won two hundred and fifty-one games and lost ninety-six. Naturally, it was a virtually unparalleled stroke of good fortune for van Breda Kolff to walk into his current coaching job in the very year that Bradley became eligible to play for the varsity team, but if the coach was lucky to have the player, the player was also lucky to have the coach. Van Breda Kolff, a cheerful and uncomplicated man, has a sportsman’s appreciation of the nuances of the game, and appears to feel that mere winning is far less important than winning with style. He is an Abstract Expressionist of basketball. Other coaches have difficulty scouting his teams, because he does not believe in a set offense. He likes his offense free-form.","1263","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Van Breda Kolff simply tells his boys to spread out and keep the ball moving. “Just go fast, stay out of one another’s way, pass, move, come off guys, look for one-on-ones, two-on-ones, two-on-twos, three-on-threes. That’s about the extent,” he says. That is, in fact, about the substance of basketball, which is almost never played as a five-man game anymore but is, rather, a constant search, conducted semi-independently by five players, for smaller combinations that will produce a score. One-on-one is the basic situation of the game—one man, with the ball, trying to score against one defensive player, who is trying to stop him, with nobody else involved. Van Breda Kolff does not think that Bradley is a great one-on-one player. “A one-on-one player is a hungry player,” he explains. “Bill is not hungry. At least ninety per cent of the time, when he gets the ball, he is looking for a pass.” Van Breda Kolff has often tried to force Bradley into being more of a one-on-one player, through gentle persuasion in practice, through restrained pleas during timeouts, and even through open clamor. During one game last year, when Princeton was losing and Bradley was still flicking passes, van Breda Kolff stood up and shouted, “Will . . . you . . . shoot . . . that . . . ball?” Bradley, obeying at once, drew his man into the vortex of a reverse pivot, and left him standing six feet behind as he made a soft, short jumper from about ten feet out.","1264","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"If Bradley were more interested in his own statistics, he could score sixty or seventy-five points, or maybe even a hundred, in some of his games. But this would merely be personal aggrandizement, done at the expense of the relative balance of his own team and causing unnecessary embarrassment to the opposition, for it would only happen against an opponent that was heavily outmatched anyway. Bradley’s highest point totals are almost always made when the other team is strong and the situation demands his scoring ability. He has, in fact, all the mechanical faculties a great one-on-one player needs. As van Breda Kolff will point out, for example, Bradley has “a great reverse pivot,” and this is an essential characteristic of a one-on-one specialist. A way of getting rid of a defensive man who is playing close, it is a spin of the body, vaguely similar to what a football halfback does when he spins away from a would-be tackler, and almost exactly what a lacrosse player does when he “turns his man.” Say that Bradley is dribbling hard toward the basket and the defensive man is all over him. Bradley turns, in order to put his body between his opponent and the ball; he continues his dribbling but shifts the ball from one hand to the other; if his man is still crowding in on him, he keeps on turning until he has made one full revolution and is once more headed toward the basket. This is a reverse pivot. Bradley can execute one in less than a second. The odds are that when he has completed the spin the defensive player will be behind him, for it is the nature of basketball that the odds favor the man with the ball—if he knows how to play them. Bradley doesn’t need to complete the full revolution every time. If his man steps away from him in anticipation of a reverse pivot, Bradley can stop dead and make a jump shot. If the man stays close to him but not close enough to be turned, Bradley can send up a hook shot. If the man moves over so that he will be directly in Bradley’s path when Bradley comes out of the turn, Bradley can scrap the reverse pivot before he begins it, merely suggesting it with his shoulders and then continuing his original dribble to the basket, making his man look like a pedestrian who has leaped to get out of the way of a speeding car.","1265","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"The metaphor of basketball is to he found in these compounding alternatives. Every time a basketball player takes a step, an entire new geometry of action is created around him. In ten seconds, with or without the ball, a good player may see perhaps a hundred alternatives and, from them, make half a dozen choices as he goes along. A great player will see even more alternatives and will make more choices, and this multiradial way of looking at things can carry over into his life. At least, it carries over into Bradley’s life. The very word “alternatives” bobs in and out of his speech with noticeable frequency. Before his Rhodes Scholarship came along and eased things, he appeared to be worrying about dozens of alternatives for next year. And he still fills his days with alternatives. He apparently always needs to have eight ways to jump, not because he is excessively prudent but because that is what makes the game interesting.","1266","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"The reverse pivot, of course, is just one of numerous one-on-one moves that produce a complexity of possibilities. A rocker step, for example, in which a player puts one foot forward and rocks his shoulders forward and backward, can yield a set shot if the defensive man steps back, a successful drive to the basket if the defensive man comes in too close, a jump shot if he tries to compromise. A simple crossover—shifting a dribble from one hand to the other and changing direction—can force the defensive man to over-commit himself, as anyone knows who has ever watched Oscar Robertson use it to break free and score. Van Breda Kolff says that Bradley is “a great mover,” and points out that the basis of all these maneuvers is footwork. Bradley has spent hundreds of hours merely rehearsing the choreography of the game—shifting his feet in the same patterns again and again, until they have worn into his motor subconscious. “The average basketball player only likes to play basketball,” van Breda Kolff says. “When he’s left to himself, all he wants to do is get a two-on-two or a three-on-three going. Bradley practices techniques, making himself learn and improve instead of merely having fun.”","1267","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Because of Bradley’s super-serious approach to basketball, his relationship to van Breda Kolff is in some respects a reversal of the usual relationship between a player and a coach. Writing to van Breda Kolff from Tokyo in his capacity as captain-elect, Bradley advised his coach that they should prepare themselves for “the stern challenge ahead.” Van Breda Kolff doesn’t vibrate to that sort of tune. “Basketball is a game, he says. “It is not an ordeal. I think Bradley’s happiest whenever he can deny himself pleasure.” Van Breda Kolff’s handling of Bradley has been, in a way, a remarkable feat of coaching. One man cannot beat five men—at least not consistently—and Princeton loses basketball games. Until this season, moreover, the other material that van Breda Kolff has had at his disposal has been for the most part below even the usual Princeton standard, so the fact that his teams have won two consecutive championships is about as much to his credit as to his star’s. Van Breda Kolff says, “I try to play it just as if he were a normal player. I don’t want to overlook him, but I don’t want to over-look for him, either, if you see what I’m trying to say.” Bradley’s teammates sometimes depend on him too much, the coach explains, or, in a kind of psychological upheaval, get self-conscious about being on the court with a superstar and, perhaps to prove their independence, bring the ball up the court five or six times without passing it to him. When this happens, van Breda Kolff calls time out. “Hey, boys,” he says. “What have we got an All-American for?” He refers to Bradley’s stardom only when he has to, however. In the main, he takes Bradley with a calculated grain of salt. He is interested in Bradley’s relative weaknesses rather than in his storied feats, and has helped him gain poise on the court, learn patience, improve his rebounding, and be more aggressive. He refuses on principle to say that Bradley is the best basketball player he has ever coached, and he is also careful not to echo the general feeling that Bradley is the most exemplary youth since Lochinvar, but he will go out of his way to tell about the reaction of referees to Bradley. “The refs watch Bradley like a hawk, but, because he never complains, they feel terrible if they make an error against him,” he says. “They just love him because he is such a gentleman. They get upset if they call a bad one on him.” I asked van Breda Kolff what he thought Bradley would be doing when he was forty. “I don’t know,” he said “I guess he’ll be the governor of Missouri.”","1268","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Many coaches, on the reasonable supposition that Bradley cannot beat their teams alone, concentrate on choking off the four other Princeton players, but Bradley is good enough to rise to such occasions, as he did when he scored forty-six against Texas, making every known shot, including an eighteen-foot running hook. Some coaches, trying a standard method of restricting a star, set up four of their players in either a box-shaped or a diamond-shaped zone defensive formation and put their fifth player on Bradley, man-to-man. Wherever Bradley goes under these circumstances, he has at least two men guarding him, the man-to-man player and the fellow whose zone he happens to be passing through. This is a dangerous defense, however, because it concedes an imbalance of forces, and also because Bradley is so experienced at being guarded by two men at once that he can generally fake them both out with a single move; also, such over-guarding often provides Bradley with enough free throws to give his team the margin of victory. Most coaches have played Princeton straight, assigning their best defensive man to Bradley and letting it go at that. This is what St. Joseph’s College did in the opening round of the N. C.A.A. Tournament in 1963. St. Joseph’s had a strong, well-balanced team, which had lost only four games of a twenty-five-game schedule and was heavily favored to rout Princeton. The St. Joseph’s player who was to guard Bradley promised his teammates that he would hold Bradley below twenty points. Bradley made twenty points in the first half. He made another twenty points in the first sixteen minutes of the second half. In the group battles for rebounds, he won time after time. He made nearly sixty per cent of his shots, and he made sixteen out of sixteen from the foul line. The experienced St. Joseph’s man could not handle him, and the whole team began to go after him in frenzied clusters. He would dribble through them, disappearing in the ruck and emerging a moment later, still dribbling, to float up toward the basket and score. If St. Joseph’s forced him over toward the sideline, he would crouch, turn his head to look for the distant basket, step, kick his leg, and follow through with his arms, sending a long, high hook shot—all five parts intact—into the net. When he went up for a jump shot, St. Joseph’s players would knock him off balance, but he would make the shot anyway, crash to the floor, get up, and sink the dividend foul shot, scoring three points instead of two on the play. On defense, he guarded St. Joseph’s highest-scoring player, Torn Wynne, and held him to nine points. The defense was expensive, though. An aggressive defensive player has to take the risk of committing five personal fouls, after which a player is obliged by the rules to leave the game. With just under four minutes to go, and Princeton comfortably ahead by five points, Bradley committed his fifth foul and left the court. For several minutes, the game was interrupted as the crowd stood and applauded him; the game was being played in Philadelphia, where hostility toward Princeton is ordinarily great but where the people know a folk hero when they see one. After the cheering ended, the blood drained slowly out of Princeton, whose other players could not hold the lead. Princeton lost by one point. Dr. Jack Ramsey, the St. Joseph’s coach, says that Bradley’s effort that night was the best game of basketball he has ever seen a college boy play.","1269","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Some people, hearing all the stories of Bradley’s great moments, go to see him play and are disappointed when he does not do something memorable at least once a minute. Actually, basketball is a hunting game. It lasts for forty minutes, and there are ten men on the court, so the likelihood is that any one player, even a superstar, will actually have the ball in his hands for only four of those minutes, or perhaps a little more. The rest of the time, a player on offense either is standing around recovering his breath or is on the move, foxlike, looking for openings, sizing up chances, attempting to screen off a defensive man—by “coming off guys,” as van Breda Kolff puts it—and thus upset the balance of power. The depth of Bradley’s game is most discernible when he doesn’t have the ball. He goes in and swims around in the vicinity of the basket, back and forth, moving for motion’s sake, making plans and abandoning them, and always watching the distant movement of the ball out of the corner of his eye. He stops and studies his man, who is full of alertness, because of the sudden break in the rhythm. The man is trying to watch both Bradley and the ball. Bradley watches the man’s head. If it turns too much to the right, he moves quickly to the left. If it turns too much to the left, he goes to the right. If, ignoring the ball, the man focusses his full attention on Bradley, Bradley stands still and looks at the floor. A high-lobbed pass floats in, and just before it arrives Bradley jumps high, takes the ball, turns, and scores. If Princeton has an out-of-bounds play under the basket, Bradley takes a position just inside the baseline, almost touching the teammate who is going to throw the ball into play. The defensive man crowds in to try to stop whatever Bradley is planning. Bradley whirls around the defensive man, blocking him out with one leg, and takes a bounce pass and lays up the score. This works only against naïve opposition, but when it does work it is a marvel to watch. To receive a pass from a backcourt man, Bradley moves away from the basket and toward one side of the court. He gets the ball, gives it up, goes into the center, and hovers there awhile. Nothing happens. He goes back to the corner. He starts toward the backcourt again to receive a pass like the first one. His man, who is eager and has been through this before, moves out toward the backcourt a step ahead of Bradley. This is a defensive error. Bradley isn’t going that way; he was only faking. He heads straight for the basket, takes a bounce pass, and scores. This maneuver is known in basketball as going back door. Bradley is able to go back door successfully and often, because of his practiced footwork. Many players, once their man has made himself vulnerable, rely on surprise alone to complete a back-door play, and that isn’t always enough. Bradley’s fake looks for all the world like the beginning of a trip to the outside; then, when he goes for the basket, he has all the freedom he needs. When he gets the ball after breaking free, other defensive players naturally leave their own men and try to stop him. In these three-on-two or two-on-one situations, the obvious move is to pass to a teammate who has moved into a position to score. Sometimes, however, no teammate has moved and Bradley sees neither a pass nor a shot, so he veers around and goes back and picks up his own man. “I take him on into the corner for a one-on-one,” he says, imagining what he might do. “I move toward the free-throw line on a dribble. If the man is overplaying me to my right, I reverse pivot and go in for a left-handed lay-up. If the man is playing even with me, but off me a few feet, I take a jump shot. If the man is playing me good defense—honest—and he’s on me tight, I keep going. I give him a head-and-shoulder fake, keep going all the time, and drive to the basket, or I give him a head-and- shoulder fake and take a jump shot. Those are all the things you need—the fundamentals.”","1270","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bradley develops a relationship with his man that is something like the relationship between a yoyoist and his yoyo. “I’m on the side of the floor,” he postulates, “and I want to play with my man a little bit, always knowing where the ball is but not immediately concerned with getting it. Basketball is a game of two or three men, and you have to know how to stay out of a play and not clutter it up. I cut to the baseline. My man will follow me. I’ll cut up to the high-post position. He’ll follow me. I’ll cut to the low-post position. He’ll follow me. I’ll go back out to my side position. He’ll follow. I’ll fake to the center of the floor and go hard to the baseline, running my man into a pick set at the low-post position. I’m not running him into a pick in order to get free for a shot—I’m doing it simply to irritate him. I come up on the other side of the basket, looking to see if a teammate feels that I’m open. They can’t get the ball to me at that instant. Now my man is back with me. I go out to the side. I set a screen for the guard. He sees the situation. He comes toward me. He dribbles hard past me, running his man into my back. I feel the contact. My man switches off me, leaving the pass lane open for a split second. I go hard to the basket and take a bounce pass for a shot. Two points.”","1271","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Because Bradley’s inclination to analyze every gesture in basketball is fairly uncommon, other players look at him as if they think him a little odd when he seeks them out after a game and asks them to show him what they did in making a move that he particularly admired. They tell him that they’re not sure what he is talking about, and that even if they could remember, they couldn’t possibly explain, so the best offer they can make is to go back to the court, try to set up the situation again, and see what it was that provoked his appreciation. Bradley told me about this almost apologetically, explaining that he had no choice but to be analytical in order to be in the game at all. “I don’t have that much natural ability,” he said, and went on to tell a doleful tale about how his legs lacked spring, how he was judged among the worst of the Olympic candidates in ability to get high off the floor, and so on, until he had nearly convinced me that he was a motor moron. In actuality, Bradley does have certain natural advantages. He has been six feet five since he was fifteen years old, so he had most of his high-school years in which to develop his coördination, and it is now exceptional for a tall man. His hand span, measuring only nine and a half inches, does not give him the wraparound control that basketball players like to have, but, despite relatively unimpressive shoulders and biceps, he is unusually strong, and he can successfully mix with almost anyone in the Greco-Roman battles under the backboards. His most remarkable natural gift, however, is his vision. During a game, Bradley’s eyes are always a glaze of panoptic attention, for a basketball player needs to look at everything, focussing on nothing, until the last moment of commitment. Beyond this, it is obviously helpful to a basketball player to be able to see a little more than the next man, and the remark is frequently made about basketball superstars that they have unusual peripheral vision. People used to say that Bob Cousy, the immortal back-court man of the Boston Celtics, could look due east and enjoy a sunset. Ed Macauley once took a long auto trip with Cousy when they were teammates, and in the course of it Cousy happened to go to sleep sitting up. Macauley swears that Cousy’s eyelids, lowered as far as they would go, failed to cover his coleopteran eyes. Bradley’s eyes close normally enough, but his astounding passes to teammates have given him, too, a reputation for being able to see out of the back of his head. To discover whether there was anything to all the claims for basketball players’ peripheral vision, I asked Bradley to go with me to the office of Dr. Henry Abrams, a Princeton ophthalmologist, who had agreed to measure Bradley’s total field. Bradley rested his chin in the middle of a device called a perimeter, and Dr. Abrams began asking when he could see a small white dot as it was slowly brought around from behind him, from above, from below, and from either side. To make sure that Bradley wasn’t, in effect, throwing hope passes, Dr. Abrams checked each point three times before plotting it on a chart. There was a chart for each eye, and both charts had irregular circles printed on them, representing the field of vision that a typical perfect eye could be expected to have. Dr. Abrams explained as he worked that these printed circles were logical rather than experimentally established extremes, and that in his experience the circles he had plotted to represent the actual vision fields of his patients had without exception fallen inside the circles printed on the charts. When he finished plotting Bradley’s circles, the one for each eye was larger than the printed model and, in fact, ran completely outside it. With both eyes open and looking straight ahead, Bradley sees a hundred and ninety-five degrees on the horizontal and about seventy degrees straight down, or about fifteen and five degrees more, respectively, than what is officially considered perfection. Most surprising, however, is what he can see above him. Focussed horizontally, the typical perfect eye, according to the chart, can see about forty-seven degrees upward. Bradley can see seventy degrees upward. This no doubt explains why he can stare at the floor while he is waiting for lobbed passes to arrive from above. Dr. Abrams said that he doubted whether a person who tried to expand his peripheral vision through exercises could succeed, but he was fascinated to learn that when Bradley was a young boy he tried to do just that. As he walked down the main street of Crystal City, for example, he would keep his eyes focussed straight ahead and try to identify objects in the windows of stores he was passing. For all this, however, Bradley cannot see behind himself. Much of the court and, thus, a good deal of the action are often invisible to a basketball player, so he needs more than good eyesight. He needs to know how to function in the manner of a blind man as well. When, say, four players are massed in the middle of things behind Bradley, and it is inconvenient for him to look around, his hands reach back and his fingers move rapidly from shirt to shirt or hip to hip. He can read the defense as if he were reading Braille.","1272","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bradley’s optical endowments notwithstanding, Coach van Breda Kolff agrees with him that he is “not a great physical player,” and goes on to say, “Others can run faster and jump higher. The difference between Bill and other basketball players is self-discipline.” The two words that Bradley repeats most often when he talks about basketball are “discipline” and “concentration,” and through the exercise of both he has made himself an infectious example to younger players. “Concentrate!” he keeps shouting to himself when he is practicing on his own. His capacity for self-discipline is so large that it is almost funny. For example, he was a bit shocked when the Olympic basketball staff advised the Olympic basketball players to put in one hour of practice a day during the summer, because he was already putting in two hours a day—often in ninety- five-degree temperatures, with his feet squishing in sneakers that had become so wet that he sometimes skidded and crashed to the floor. His creed, which he picked up from Ed Macauley, is “When you are not practicing, remember, someone somewhere is practicing, and when you meet him he will win.” He also believes that the conquest of pain is essential to any seriously sustained athletic endeavor. In 1963, he dressed for a game against Harvard although he had a painful foot injury. Then, during the pre-game warmup, it bothered him so much that he decided to give up, and he started for the bench. He changed his mind on the way, recalling that a doctor had told him that his foot, hurt the night before at Dartmouth, was badly bruised but was not in danger of further damage. If he had sat down, he says, he would have lowered his standards, for he believes that “there has never been a great athlete who did not know what pain is.” So he played the game. His heavily taped foot went numb during the first ten minutes, but his other faculties seemed to sharpen in response to the handicap. His faking quickened to make up for his reduced speed, and he scored thirty-two points, missing only five shots during the entire evening.","1273","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"How Bradley acquired these criteria and became a superstar is not what interests people in basketball. If they think about it at all, they wonder why he did it. “Where did this kid get his dedication?” Macauley asks. “Why did he decide to make the sacrifices?” The pattern of his life seems to provide an answer to the question, beginning with the fact that he used the sport as a way to get to know other boys, for he was an only child.","1274","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Crystal City, which was once an active river port, now has a population of about four thousand, with a preponderance of Italians, Greeks, French, and Slavs, and a considerable proportion of Negroes. Its principal street, Mississippi Avenue, is paved with red brick and overhung with the limbs of oak and tulip trees. Although the town is fully incorporated, its people see it as a collection of unofficial subdivisions, various neighborhoods being known as Crystal Valley, Crystal Terrace, Crystal Heights, Old Town, Downtown, Crystal Village, and North Crystal. A stranger arriving at night and hearing talk of all these areas might well believe he was in a sprawling megalopolis. In reality, the town has a three-man police force; it has one factory, an enormous one that makes plate glass and that indirectly gave the town its name; and it has one bank president, and one bank president’s son.","1275","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"The Bradleys live on Taylor Avenue, behind picture windows that look out on the Grace Presbyterian Church, across the street, whose ample churchyard forms a kind of town common. Elsewhere in Crystal City, weeds sometimes grow at forty-five-degree angles out of the clefts where the streets meet the curbstones, and property owners tend to resign themselves to having brown lawns in summer, but in and around the churchyard everything is trim, immaculate, and green. When Warren Bradley, Bill’s father, goes to work in the morning, he walks halfway around the churchyard to the Crystal City State Bank, where, according to his wife, he “started out as a penny shiner” in 1921. His father had died in 1910, when he was nine, and he had been able to complete only one year at Crystal City High School before going to work, first as a ticket-seller for the Missouri & Illinois Railroad and later as a yard clerk for the Frisco Line. “The feel of money seemed to appeal to me,” he says in explaining his switchover to banking. Sixteen years after joining the bank, he became its president. In the meantime, he compensated for his abbreviated education by reading on his own, and although his son is a Rhodes Scholar, he is still the most incisive and articulate member of the family. He cares about politics with a studious passion and, ignoring the possible effect of his beliefs on his business, is a contentious Republican in a town full of Democrats. He is ordinarily a reserved man, and he has a soft voice, but when something worth reacting to comes along, he reacts, and often bluntly. Four years ago, when his son was under very heavy recruitment pressure from college coaches, Mr. Bradley was disturbed by all the attention his family was getting, because he didn’t think that basketball was that important. One day, a man walked into the Crystal City State Bank without an appointment and asked Mr. Bradley’s secretary to say that Adolph Rupp had come to call. Rupp, known throughout basketball as The Baron, has for thirty-five years been the coach at the University of Kentucky. He works more meticulously and expensively than any other coach, having movies taken at every practice, which he studies each morning as if he were John Huston going over the daily rushes. He once drove Artur Rubinstein out of his gym because the pianist, preparing for a concert, disturbed the concentration of the Kentucky Wildcats. He has won more than seven hundred games while losing only a hundred and forty-five, and he once won three national championships in four years. Rupp still gets indignant when he remembers that Mr. Bradley was too busy to see him immediately. Rupp had to wait an hour and a half.","1276","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Thanks to a noteworthy stamina of spirit, Mr. Bradley has overcome the inconveniences of having calcified arthritis of the lower spine, which has made him unable to bend over for nearly twenty-five years. He uses long wooden tweezers to pick up objects from the floor. He was almost forty when he married Susan Crowe, who was a graduate of Central College, in Fayette, Missouri, and was then teaching in a junior high school in St. Louis. She grew up near Herculaneum, a town a few miles up the river from Crystal City, and she played interscholastic basketball for Herculaneum High School—a bit of family history that amuses her son. She is five feet seven, and her husband is six feet one and a half. What Bill Bradley calls the luck of being the son of these parents arises from the marked differences in their personalities. If Mr. Bradley is a contemplative man with “an enlightened disinterest,” in his son’s words, in regard to athletic pinnacles, Mrs. Bradley is an outgoing and amiably competitive woman of immense dynamism. Her father, a coffee salesman, was a big, rough man who could bend spikes in his hands, could do six things at once, liked to tell jokes all night, and was proud of a mark on his forehead where a stallion had once bit him. Mrs. Bradley, who is full of high spirits herself, spends her life doing things for other people, except when she’s on the links at the Joachim Country Club. She says that she couldn’t care less who wins and who loses at any game, but she usually wins, and she has been club champion. Edward Rapp, the principal of the Crystal City High School, grew up with Mrs. Bradley and watched with interest as she raised her son. “Susie knew what kind of a son she wanted, and by dint of determination she has him,” Rapp says. She herself says, “I wanted a Christian upright citizen, and I thought the best way to begin was by promoting things that would interest a little boy.” She always had a busy program planned for him, full of golf lessons, swimming lessons, piano lessons, French lessons, trumpet lessons, dancing lessons, and tennis lessons.","1277","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"When Bradley went out on his own, he sometimes encountered attitudes that disconcerted him. The churchyard was a favorite site with boys in the town for pickup games of tackle football. Crossing the street with the idea of joining in, he would sometimes hear the other boys say something like “Oh, here comes the banker’s son,” in a tone that made it clear enough that they did not want him. “This was something that hurt me in a very personal way,” he says. “They would not judge me for what I was.” In one form or another, the stigma of being the banker’s son remained with him for some years, and it made him feel that he had more of a need to prove himself than others did. He gradually became tolerated in the churchyard football games, whereupon he displayed another peculiarity, which no one really minded. All little boys playing tackle do so with the understanding that they are not really themselves but small and temporary incarnations of the greatest playing stars. The other boys in the churchyard would announce their names one by one, all of them claiming to be stalwarts of the University of Missouri or some other Midwestern school. Bradley, for his part, always told them that he was Dick Kazmaier, of Princeton, who in the early fifties won the Heisman Trophy as the outstanding college football player in the United States. Today, Bradley wears on his basketball uniform at Princeton the number 42, which is the number that Kazmaier used in football.","1278","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bradley first played basketball, in the Crystal City Y.M.C.A., when he was nine years old. “It was just for something to do,” he recalls. When his mother saw that he was interested in the game, she put a basket on the side of the garage so that he could play with his fellow Cub Scouts, to whom she was den mother. Each year, however, the seasonal fever for basketball had just begun to rise when it was time to go to Palm Beach. This was a recurrent frustration, for at the Palm Beach Private School, which he attended, soccer, fencing, and boxing were the major sports. When the school day ended at two, Bradley would hurry out past the limousines that were picking up his classmates, run back to the hotel where his parents stayed, go to his room, and reach under his bed for his basketball—an odd item to take along on a trip to Florida. With a series of tympanic thumps, he would dribble out of the room, across the lobby and the street, and along the sidewalks, under the columnar palms. There was a public schoolyard several blocks away with a basket in it, and he played there every day. Now and then, a few tatterdemalions from West Palm Beach came to the playground, and he befriended them eagerly. “Basketball was a way to get to know guys,” he says. But usually he was alone. This, as much as any place, was where the fundamental narcotic of basketball entered his system. He can remember quite vividly how he felt about the game and about himself as he played it, and once, when I asked him about it, he closed his eyes and said, “What attracted me was the sound of the swish, the sound of the dribble, the feel of going up in the air. You don’t need eight others, like in baseball. You don’t need any brothers or sisters. Just you. I wonder what the guys are doing back home. I’d like to be there, but it’s as much fun here, because I’m playing. It’s getting dark. I have to go back for dinner. I’ll shoot a couple more. Feels good. A couple more.”","1279","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Toward the end of seventh grade, Bill told his father he wanted to stay in Crystal City in future winters, and his father consented. The Bradley house then became the community center, for Bill had things that the other boys didn’t have—television in his bedroom, for example, and a pinball machine in the basement. On the inside of his bedroom door he had a basketball net, and when the weather was bad outdoors he would get down on his knees—he was six feet three when he was in the eighth grade—and play against boys his own age, two at a time. Conditions outside had to be pretty unsavory before that happened, though; he and his friends played around the outdoor basket in gloves, if necessary, and at night, under flood-lights. Gradually, Bradley’s back yard evolved into a basketball court nearly as good as Princeton’s. “Our yard wasn’t for the purpose of raising grass,” his father recalls. “There was no grass in it at all.” This was because they had a macadam surface put over it, flat and smooth, around the steel pole supporting a fan-shaped backboard, whose hoop was exactly ten feet above the ground. There must be at least five million back-yard baskets in the United States, yet it is possible to search through a whole community without finding more than half a dozen at the regulation height.","1280","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bradley’s high-school basketball coach, Arvel Popp (pronounced “Pope”), says that he began cultivating Bradley when the boy was still in grade school. What Popp was mainly cultivating, however, was a football player, because at that time, at least, he was a football coach first and a basketball coach second. Before Bradley reached high-school age, Popp told him, “I’m going to make you into the finest end who ever played for the University of Missouri.” Bradley therefore incurred double jeopardy when, entering high school, he showed no interest in football. He had to do what he could to dispel gossip that he was chicken, and he had to prove himself as a basketball player to Coach Popp, for Popp was not interested in having boys on his basketball team who didn’t play football.","1281","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"If basketball was going to enable Bradley to make friends, to prove that a banker’s son is as good as the next fellow, to prove that he could do without being the greatest-end-ever at Missouri, to prove that he was not chicken, and to live up to his mother’s championship standards, and if he was going to have some moments left over to savor his delight in the game, he obviously needed considerable practice, so he borrowed keys to the gym and set a schedule for himself that he adhered to for four full years—in the school year, three and a half hours every day after school, nine to five on Saturday, one-thirty to five on Sunday, and, in the summer, about three hours a day. He put ten pounds of lead slivers in his sneakers, set up chairs as opponents and dribbled in slalom fashion around them, and wore eyeglass frames that had a piece of cardboard taped to them so that he could not see the floor, for a good dribbler never looks at the ball. Aboard the Queen Elizabeth on a trip to Europe one summer, he found that the two longitudinal corridors on C Deck, Tourist Class, were each about four hundred and fifty feet long, making nine hundred feet in all, or ten times the length of a basketball floor. This submarine palaestra became the world’s finest training area in two respects. It was not only the longest gym on earth, it was also the narrowest, measuring forty-eight inches across. The width was ideal for the practice of dribbling, since it tended to bunch the opposition, or fellow-passengers, who got used to hearing the approaching thump-thump of the basketball, and to seeing what appeared to be a six-foot-five-inch lunatic come bearing down upon them with a device on his face that cut off much of his vision.","1282","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Coach Popp, as it turned out, was less inflexible than his reputation suggested. After his varsity basketball team lost its first four games, he decided to put a freshman—Bradley—in his lineup, for the second time ever, and after that the Crystal City Hornets won sixteen out of twenty-one. The older boys on the team resented Bradley’s presence a little, and were also suspicious of him, because he would sometimes use the waiting time in the locker room before a game to bring out a textbook and study. They passed to him fairly infrequently in that first year, but, largely as a result of vacuuming rebounds, he averaged twenty points a game. The resentment arose from the natural tendency of high-school boys to give a great deal of importance to seniority, and by his third year it was gone. Once an anomaly, he was now a model. One of his teammates of those years, Sam La Presta, has recalled, “Bill did what he did by hard work. Everyone looked up to him. He was sort of inspirational. Basketball was one-millionth of what he had to offer.”","1283","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"At Princeton, Bradley has become such an excellent basketball player that it is necessary to look beyond college basketball to find a standard that will put him in perspective. The standard’s name is Oscar Robertson, of the Cincinnati Royals, who is the finest basketball player yet developed. He is five years older than Bradley, and now that Bradley is leaving basketball, the question of who would ultimately have been the better player will not be answered. Robertson, who is known in basketball as The O, stands out among all professionals for the same reason that Bradley stands out among all amateurs. Other players have certain individual skills that are sharper, but Bradley and Robertson are brilliant in every aspect of the game. To make a detailed comparison between Bradley and Robertson as they are now, Robertson is a better rebounder and a better defensive player, notwithstanding the defensive performance that Bradley gave in an exhibition game last fall between the Olympic team and the Royals, when he held Robertson to eleven points. Bradley is as good a passer as Robertson, and they are about even in dribbling, too. Going hard for the basket, Robertson is a better driver “When I watch Robertson,” Bradley says, “I just stand with my mouth wide open. There are so many things he does that I could never do in a hundred years. I could never feel confident, the way he can, that I could shoot jump shots against anybody at all. He’s the best basketball player alive.” Bradley adds that one of the big differences between his abilities and Robertson’s is that The O has better body control and is more deceptive when he moves. Bradley, for his part, has a greater variety of shots than Robertson, and is, in general, a more accurate shooter. As Bradley notes, however, he doesn’t have the same jump shot. Bradley is merely outstanding with his jumper. But no one has a jump shot like Robertson’s—frozen in the air, with his back arched and his hands behind his head, where the ball is totally protected until he sends it into the basket. Bradley’s jump shot is released, more conventionally, from just above his head. The O’s jump shot is literally “unstoppable” —the most intoxicating adjective in basketball. If Bradley does enough shooting this year, he may become the second-highest scorer in the records of college basketball, but he will still be nearly five hundred points under the final count that Robertson left behind him at the University of Cincinnati. Robertson and his Royals teammate Jerry Lucas, who played for Ohio State, are the only two basketball players who have been included on the Sporting News All-American team, which is picked by the professional scouts, in all three of their college basketball seasons. This year, barring the unforeseen, Bradley will become the third. Among Bradley’s Olympic teammates was U.C.L.A.’s Walt Hazzard, now a Los Angeles Laker, who, like Robertson, is a Negro, and he passed along to Bradley a compliment of unforgettable magnitude. “Where I come from,” Hazzard told Bradley, “you are known as The White O.”","1284","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"With all his analyses of its mechanics, Bradley may have broken his game down into its components, but he has reassembled it so seamlessly that all the parts, and also his thousands of hours of practice, are concealed. He is as fluidly graceful as any basketball player I have ever seen. Quite apart from the excitement produced by the scoreboard, a spectator cannot help feeling a considerable elation as he watches Bradley accomplish his fakes and moves and shots. He does it all with a floating economy of motion and a beguiling offhandedness that appeal to the imagination. Many basketball players, outstanding ones included, have a tendency to be rather tastelessly rococo in their style, and Bradley stands out in contrast to them because he adorns nothing that he does. When a game is won beyond doubt, and Bradley leaves the court with three or four minutes to go, the coach of the opposing team has sometimes halted play to walk down to the Princeton bench and shake his hand. The coach doesn’t do this just because Bradley has scored thirty-five or forty points but because he has done it so uncompromisingly well.","1285","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"This season, in the course of a tournament held during the week after Christmas, Bradley took part in a game that followed extraordinarily the pattern of his game against St. Joseph’s. Because the stakes were higher, it was a sort of St. Joseph’s game to the third power. Whereas St. Joseph’s had been the best team in the East, Princeton’s opponent this time was Michigan, the team that the Associated Press and the United Press International had rated as the best college team of all. The chance to face Michigan represented to Bradley the supreme test of his capability as a basketball player. As he saw it, any outstanding player naturally hopes to be a member of the country’s No. 1 team, but if that never happens, the next-best thing is to be tested against the No. 1 team. And the Michigan situation seemed even more important to him because, tending as he sometimes does to question his own worth, he was uncomfortably conscious that a committee had picked him for the Olympic team, various committees had awarded him his status as an All-American, and, for that matter, committees had elected him a Rhodes Scholar. Michigan, he felt, would provide an exact measurement of him as an athlete. The height of the Michigan players averages six feet five, and nearly everyone of them weighs over two hundred pounds. Smoothly experienced, both as individuals and as a coördinated group, they have the appearance, the manner, and the assurance of a professional team. One of them, moreover, is Cazzle Russell, who, like Bradley, was a consensus All-American last year. For a couple of days before the game, the sports pages of the New York newspapers were crammed with headlines, articles, and even cartoons comparing Bradley and Russell, asking which was the better player, and looking toward what one paper called the most momentous individual confrontation in ten years of basketball. One additional factor—something that meant relatively little to Bradley—was that the game was to be played in Madison Square Garden. Bradley had never played in the Garden, but, because he mistrusts metropolitan standards, he refused to concede that the mere location of the coming test meant anything at all. When a reporter asked him how he felt about appearing there, he replied, “It’s just like any other place. The baskets are ten feet high.”","1286","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Bradley now says that he prepared for the Michigan game as he had prepared for no other. He slept for twelve hours, getting up at noon. Then, deliberately, he read the New York newspapers and absorbed the excited prose which might have been announcing a prizefight : FESTIVAL DUEL: BILL BRADLEY VS. CAZZIE RUSSELL . . . CAZZIE—BRADLEY: KEY TEST . . . BRADLEY OR CAZZIE? SHOWDOWN AT HAND . . . BILL BRADLEY OF PRINCETON MEETS CaZZIE RUSSELL OF MICHIGAN TONIGHT AT THE GARDEN! ! This exposure to the newspapers had the effect he wanted; he developed chills, signifying a growing stimulation within him. During most of the afternoon, when any other player in his situation would probably have been watching television, shooting pool, or playing ping-pong or poker—anything to divert the mind—Bradley sat alone and concentrated on the coming game, on the components of his own play, and on the importance to him and his team of what would occur. As much as anything, he wanted to prove that an Ivy League team could be as good as any other team. Although no newspaper gave Princeton even the slightest chance of winning, Bradley did not just hope to do well himself—he intended that Princeton should win.","1287","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"Just before he went onto the court, Bradley scrubbed his hands with soap and water, as he always does before a game, to remove any accumulated skin oil and thus increase the friction between his fingers and the ball. When the game was forty-two seconds old, he hit a jump shot and instantly decided, with a rush of complete assurance of a kind that sometimes comes over an athlete in action, that a victory was not only possible but probable. Michigan played him straight, and he played Michigan into the floor. The performance he delivered had all the depth and variation of theoretical basketball, each move being perfectly executed against able opposition. He stole the ball, he went back door, he threw unbelievable passes. He reversed away from the best defenders in the Big Ten. He held his own man to one point. He played in the backcourt, in the post, and in the corners. He made long set shots, and hit jump shots from points so far behind the basket that he had to start them from arm’s length in order to clear the backboard. He tried a hook shot on the dead run and hit that, too. Once, he found himself in a corner of the court with two Michigan players, both taller than he, pressing in on him shoulder to shoulder. He parted them with two rapid fakes—a move of the ball and a move of his head—and leaped up between them to sink a twenty-two-foot jumper. The same two players soon cornered him again. The fakes were different the second time, but the result was the same. He took a long stride between them and went up into the air, drifting forward, as they collided behind him, and he hit a clean shot despite the drift. Bradley, playing at the top of his game, drew his teammates up to the best performances they could give, too, and the Princeton team as a whole outplayed Michigan. The game, as it had developed, wasn’t going to be just a close and miraculous Princeton victory, it was going to be a rout. But, with Princeton twelve points ahead, Bradley, in the exuberance of sensing victory, made the mistake of playing close defense when he did not need to, and when he was too tired to do it well. He committed his fifth personal foul with four minutes and thirty-seven seconds to go, and had to watch the end of the game from the bench. As he sat down, the twenty thousand spectators stood up and applauded him for some three minutes. It was, as the sportswriters and the Garden management subsequently agreed, the most clamorous ovation ever given a basketball player, amateur or professional, in Madison Square Garden. Bradley’s duel with Russell had long since become incidental. Russell scored twenty-seven points and showed his All-American calibre, but during the long applause the announcer on the Garden loudspeakers impulsively turned up the volume and said, “Bill Bradley, one of the greatest players ever to play in Madison Square Garden, scored forty-one points.” Bradley had ratified his reputation—not through his point total nearly so much as through his total play. After he left the court—joining two of his teammates who had also fouled out—Michigan overran Princeton, and won the game by one basket. Bradley ultimately was given the trophy awarded to the most valuable player in the tournament, but his individual recognition meant next to nothing to him at the time, because of Princeton’s defeat. It had become fully apparent, however, that Bradley would be remembered as one of basketball’s preëminent stars And like Hank Luisetti, of Stanford, who never played professional basketball, he will have the almost unique distinction of taking only the name of his college with him into the chronicles of the sport. ♦","1288","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1965/01/23/a-sense-of-where-you-are"
"The debate in the economics community over the Trans-Pacific Partnership continues. In Monday’s Washington Post, Lawrence Summers, who promoted a series of free-trade agreements during the nineteen-nineties, when he worked in senior posts at the Treasury Department, said, “The repudiation of the T.P.P. would neuter the U.S. presidency for the next 19 months.” Summers also provided a series of reasons to be skeptical of the treaty, however, writing, “A reflexive presumption in favor of free trade should not be used to justify further agreements. Concerns that trade agreements may be a means to circumvent traditional procedures for taking up issues ranging from immigration to financial regulation must be taken seriously.” He later concluded, “Our challenge now is less to increase globalization than to make the globalization we have work for our citizens.”","June 16, 2015","1289","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"

This is the same Krugman who supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, and who spent some of the nineteen-nineties dismissing the promoters of so-called “managed trade” policies—like Lester Thurow, Laura D’Andrea Tyson, and Robert Kuttner—as “pop internationalists” who didn’t understand how things really worked.","1290","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"What explains this intellectual evolution? Summers and Krugman would say that there is no inconsistency between the positions they took on free trade in the past and what they are saying now. Recently, both of them have argued that the T.P.P. isn’t primarily a trade agreement at all, in the traditional sense of deals that aim to eliminate tariffs, cut prices for consumers, and allocate productive resources according to the law of comparative advantage, which David Ricardo promulgated in the early nineteenth century. Rather, the T.P.P. is largely a business-driven effort to extend more international protection to the investments, patents, and copyrights of major U.S. corporations.","1291","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"“Why do some parties want this deal so much?” Krugman asked on his Times blog, in March. “Because as with many ‘trade’ deals in recent years, the intellectual property aspects are more important than the trade aspects.” In his article on Monday Summers wrote, “The world’s remaining tariff and quota barriers are small and, where present, less reflections of the triumph of protectionist interests and more a result of deep cultural values such as the Japanese attachment to rice farming. What we call trade agreements are in fact agreements on the protection of investments and the achievement of regulatory harmonization and establishment of standards in areas such as intellectual property.”","1292","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"There is a good deal of truth in this argument. Last year, when parts of a draft T.P.P. treaty appeared on WikiLeaks, one of things we learned was that the U.S. negotiators were resisting efforts by other countries to get cheap access to life-saving drugs developed in the United States, and were pushing for the treaty to enforce drug patents that lasted twelve years. It’s no secret that lobbyists for industries such as pharmaceuticals, entertainment, and software have been pressing successive administrations to take a tough line on intellectual-property issues.

"But I.P. protection isn’t the entire story. Michael Froman, the U.S. Trade Representative, offered Politico’s Michael Grunwald some statistics meant to show that the T.P.P. would also tackle old-fashioned protectionism. Vietnam, which would be part of the new free-trade area, currently ”slaps tariffs of 70 percent on U.S. cars and machinery, 35 percent on U.S. chemicals, 30 percent on U.S. biscuits and baked goods, and 25 percent on U.S. recording equipment,” Grunwald writes. “Cars made in America face a 30 percent tariff in Malaysia”—another potential member of the T.P.P.—“which might not seem stiff compared to 50 percent on motorcycles or 35 percent on plywood, except that cars made in Japan and other Asian nations don’t face any tariff in Malaysia.” Froman didn’t say precisely how these tariffs would be treated in the final agreement. However, Grunwald reported that “he hinted that just about all of them will be cut or eliminated.” And that, presumably, would help U.S. manufacturers, just as a reduction on tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports would help U.S. farmers.","1294","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"There are still some (indeed, many) economists who are willing to make the argument that the T.P.P. would benefit Americans on the whole. The Peterson Institute for International Economics, in Washington, has published a series of studies detailing the purported benefits of the T.P.P. And the White House Council of Economic Advisers is still on board, of course. Recently, it published a letter in support of granting the President trade-promotion authority, signed by fourteen economists who have headed the council during the past forty years—going back to Alan Greenspan, who served in the Ford Administration. “International trade is fundamentally good for the U.S. economy, beneficial to American families over time, and consonant with our domestic priorities,” the letter began.","1295","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"The letter’s signatories included three economists who have served in the Obama Administration: Christina Romer, Austan Goolsbee, and Alan Krueger. Summers, who headed the National Economic Council during Obama’s first term, didn’t sign it, despite the White House’s insistence that the T.P.P. would boost labor rights and environmental protection—causes Summers singled out in his op-ed. Another conspicuous absentee was Columbia’s Joseph Stiglitz, who served in the Clinton Administration, and who has emerged as a prominent critic of the T.P.P. Evidently, Summers, Stiglitz, and Krugman—perhaps the three most famous economists in the country—all agree with Hillary Clinton, who said over the weekend that President Obama should listen to the Congressional Democrats, particularly Nancy Pelosi, who voted against him last week.","1296","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"In short, the Democratic Party’s intellectual consensus on free trade has been shattered, and it’s pretty clear why. The fact that, as Summers noted, tariffs have already come down is part of the story. Another factor is the general hostility toward the pharmaceutical industry and other corporate rent collectors, and toward the secrecy that pervades trade negotiations. But the bigger story is that, so far, free trade and globalization have failed to deliver the material benefits to ordinary Americans, and particularly to American workers, that were advertised. Over time, Democratic politicians and economists have been forced to acknowledge this fact.","1297","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"Inside the economics profession, the revisionism arguably began in 1997, with the publication of Dani Rodrik’s book “Has Globalization Gone Too Far?” and continued with Stiglitz’s “Globalization and Its Discontents,” from 2003. For a long time, many trade economists had continued to insist that rising imports from developing countries hadn’t played much of a role in the decline of manufacturing employment. But as another five million manufacturing jobs were lost in the years after 2000, and imports from China soared, this position became increasingly difficult to maintain. A 2013 study by David H. Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon H. Hanson found that rising Chinese imports accounted for about a quarter of the decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs between 1990 and 2007. A 2014 study by the same three authors and two others, Daron Acemoglu and Brendan Price, estimated that between 1999 and 2011, competition from China had caused the loss of 2.4 million jobs—a figure the study said “likely understates the full consequences of the China shock on US employment.”","1298","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"Amid a U.S. economy that includes more than a hundred and forty million jobs, 2.4 million is perhaps not a huge number. But there is also an emerging consensus that globalization and free trade have contributed to the problems of wage declines and income stagnation, which afflict tens of millions of Americans. In 2012, a long survey article in the Journal of Economic Perspectives concluded: “Our analysis sheds new light on the sobering fact of pervasive real-income declines for the large majority of Americans in the past decade. These real-income declines may be part of the same globalization and innovation forces shaping returns to superstars and to capital.”","1299","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"

"On the evening of August 6th, when the news broke that Senator Charles Schumer would vote against the Iran accord, the Democratic Senate leader, Harry Reid, was as stunned as the rest of his caucus. The two men are close friends. When Reid became the leader, in 2005, Schumer was a backbencher, who mused about running for governor of New York. Reid took an interest in him, came to rely on both his fund-raising prowess with Wall Street and his counsel on a range of matters, and always advised his ambitious protégé, “Be patient, be patient.” Last March, when Reid announced that he would retire at the end of 2016, he endorsed Schumer to succeed him and announced that another contender, Richard Durbin, the Democratic whip (and Schumer’s former roommate), would stand down. For those progressives who questioned whether Schumer should be leader, Reid said that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders would keep the caucus honest. Now, because of Schumer’s position as presumptive leader, Reid felt that Schumer should have informed him of his decision on the Iran deal, given its importance, according to a Senate aide. Still, when a White House official called Reid that night to ask if he would announce his support of the deal to counter Schumer’s opposition, Reid refused, saying he wasn’t ready, a close associate said. (A spokesman for Senator Reid later issued a statement denying that Reid was surprised by Schumer’s announcement. “Their relationship is as close as ever.

And it was his timing, perhaps even more than the substance of his decision, that has upset his pro-deal colleagues and, most unmistakably, the White House. Josh Earnest, the President’s press secretary, said he wouldn’t be surprised if some members of the Senate Democratic caucus “consider the voting record of those who say they would like to lead the caucus,” and he went on to liken Schumer’s decision to oppose the Iran deal to his support for the Iraq War, in 2003. It always seemed implausible that Schumer—an AIPAC stalwart who boasted that he is Benjamin Netanyahu’s best friend on Capitol Hill—would oppose AIPAC and Netanyahu on a deal they both claim is an existential threat to Israel. (I have written about AIPAC’s influence on politicians for the magazine.) “Chuck was always among the least likely Democrats to support the deal,” a longtime close friend of Schumer’s told me.

"But the White House and some of Schumer’s Democratic colleagues strongly urged him not to announce his opposition until late August or early September. Republican leaders have set a vote in mid-September on a resolution to disapprove of the deal. Should that resolution pass, Obama has vowed to veto it. In a move that also surprised his colleagues, Schumer said that he would vote to override Obama’s veto as well. As another Senate staff member told me, “It is protocol, if you’re a member of the leadership who is going to oppose your President on a major issue like this, that you not do so in a way that is going to undercut the President and give the President’s opponents fodder to use against him.” Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, responded in an e-mail, “Senator Schumer was pressed both on the right and the left on the timing of his decision, but said from the very beginning that after careful deliberation, when he made up his mind, he would announce his decision publicly and explain the reasoning. He finished deliberating on that Wednesday afternoon, wrote his statement that evening, and published it soon after.”","1303","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"
"In the days before Schumer’s announcement, momentum for the accord’s approval appeared to be building in the Senate. On Tuesday, August 4th, Barbara Boxer, Tim Kaine, and Bill Nelson announced their support. Two days later, Jeanne Shaheen and Kirsten Gillibrand came out in favor. Opposition to the deal is especially strong in New York and Florida, which have large numbers of Jewish voters, many of them conservative or right-wing on matters related to the Middle East, so Nelson, from Florida, and Gillibrand, from New York, were two senators whom AIPAC and other anti-deal forces were hoping to win. But two days before Gillibrand announced her decision, she attended a meeting with senior diplomats of America’s P5+1 negotiating partners on the deal: China, Russia, France, Britain, and Germany. The meeting, organized by Durbin, who is whipping his colleagues to vote for the deal, was attended by about thirty Democratic senators; Schumer skipped it. “Gillibrand asked each ambassador, If we reject this, what would your government do, in terms of going back for a better deal?” someone at the meeting recalled. “And they each said their government was not interested in any further negotiation with Iran on this subject. That’s the reality. Nonetheless, the basic line that’s been taken by AIPAC is, Go back for a better deal.” That has now become Schumer’s position as well. Gillibrand later said that the meeting helped convince her to support the deal.","1304","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"
"After Gillibrand’s announcement, pro-deal forces were ebullient. The tide was strong. Some enjoyed imagining a panic at AIPAC. According to several Senate aides, they believed they were close to having enough votes to block Republicans on the resolution of disapproval itself, so that it would never reach the President and he wouldn’t have to exercise his veto. But hours later Schumer posted his decision online, in the form of a sixteen-hundred-word essay. “What Schumer has done now, unfortunately, is that he has made what was within realistic reach super-difficult,” the first Senate aide said. “By coming out so early, before recess, it’s been really detrimental to the cause of the President and other Senate Democrats who want to be in favor of this deal, because now he’s given a lot of time for senators on the fence to be hit with political attacks like, ‘Why aren’t you where Schumer is? He’s leading; why are you so weak?’ ” The aide continued, “If he wanted to be helpful, as future leader of the caucus, he could have waited. He personally would have had to withstand pressure back home, in exchange for helping out his colleagues. Instead, he said, I’m going to take the pressure off myself and put the pressure on my colleagues.”","1305","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"
"On Saturday, that dynamic played out in a full-page ad in the Times—the first, but surely not the last. Featuring side-by-side images of Schumer and Senator Cory Booker, the ad demanded, “Senator Cory Booker: Will you join Senator Schumer and reject the catastrophic Iran deal?” It implored Booker to do so “before Iranian nukes kill millions of Americans.” Among those who funded the ad was the World Values Network, whose executive director, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, is a longtime close friend of Booker but, evidently, not loath to exert intense public pressure. Booker is viewed as undecided.","1306","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"
"As of today, twenty Democratic senators have come out in favor of the deal; a total of thirty-four are needed to sustain the President’s veto. “It’s still very much an open question whether we can sustain a veto,” a third Senate aide said. “It will depend on how hard the deal is whipped against within the caucus.” Schumer, by nature an aggressive whip, known for his “full Chuck Schumer” style, is working against Durbin, who chose not to try to contest Reid’s endorsement of Schumer for leader. Schumer’s statements on the subject of his whipping, or not, have been ambiguous. A relentless phone canvasser, he has acknowledged he is making calls to members. “I will certainly share my view and try to persuade them that the vote to disapprove is the right one,” he said, in what might constitute a definition of whipping, but he added that, in the Senate, members make up their own minds—“especially in matters of conscience and great consequence, like this.”","1307","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"
"Schumer is a strong tactician. Before making his decision to oppose the accord at the time he did, he almost certainly calculated how it would affect his prospects in the leadership election, in 2016. He must also have given thought to the long-term ramifications of this vote, and how it will affect the fortunes of the Party he plans to lead. At this point, what no one but Schumer (and perhaps AIPAC) seems to know is whether he wants to do all he can, albeit quietly, to kill the deal. If he does, will he try to persuade Harry Reid to join him in opposing it? And what effect might that have on senators, perhaps up for reëlection, facing threats, who are wavering?","1308","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"

"Emphasis mine, but Sanders’s, too. The day after his “Meet the Press” appearance, he upped the idea from offhand suggestion to formal proposal. In a letter to Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, he observed that “having debates between Democratic and Republican candidates during the primary process” would “engage large numbers of voters who typically do not pay attention to the process until much later, when the general election begins to come into focus.” This, he said, would “get people to participate at higher levels.”","1312","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"

The Republican clown car is still full, but it has become obvious which of its occupants are remotely imaginable nominees and which are not. Put the five top plausible Republicans—Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, for sure, Scott Walker, maybe, plus two or three from the Paul/Kasich/Cruz/Perry/etc. grab bag—on one side of a New Hampshire stage.

"A typical debate among, say, five Republicans or five Democrats is a five-sided free-for-all, and the game is zero-sum. A debate with five Republicans and five Democrats would have ten players, each with his or her own individual interest, but, in important ways, each player would be on a side—a team, if you like. This might encourage a certain discipline. The members of each side would be reminded that what distinguishes them from one another is less important than what distinguishes them from the members of the other side. Nobody would want to be the one whose jab at a teammate provides an opportunity for real-time gloating by the other side. (“I have to agree with Mr. Chafee about Secretary Clinton’s scandalous speech fees.” “Senator Rubio said it better than I could about Jeb Bush’s mediocre record in Florida.”) Everyone on the stage would have to be conscious of an electorate beyond his or her own party’s base. All would have to demonstrate an ability to handle challenges from those who differ from them in ways that go beyond the details of their own party’s ideological orthodoxy.

"Of course, no one can really predict what would happen, which would be part of the fun. But the television audience would be huge—a lot bigger, I suspect, than for any of the Republican-only or Democrat-only debates. The sheer novelty would be a magnet for eyeballs. Anyway, when the Yankees play the Red Sox, it’s a lot more riveting than watching one or the other take batting practice.

The vote may come as soon as Friday. The House Republican leaders tell their dubious members that they are supporting Obama only in order to “constrain” him. Meanwhile, Obama is lobbying members of the Black Congressional Caucus, whose support he can normally count on, tirelessly and, for the most part, fruitlessly. “The president’s done everything except let me fly Air Force One,” Representative Cedric Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana, told the Christian Science Monitor this week.

"The long, bad aftertaste of NAFTA—the North American Free Trade Agreement, enacted in 1994—explains much of the Democratic opposition to the T.P.P. Ronald Reagan originally proposed NAFTA, but Bill Clinton championed it, got it through Congress mainly on Republican votes, and signed it. In many Democratic districts, NAFTA is still widely blamed for the loss of hundreds of thousands of American manufacturing jobs, and for long-term downward pressure on wages. When President Obama argues that the T.P.P. is not NAFTA, he is correct. It convenes Pacific Rim nations and economies of many stripes, from wealthy, democratic Japan to authoritarian, impoverished Vietnam, and it includes six countries with which the United States already has free-trade agreements. If enacted, it will encompass forty per cent of global economic activity. It is less a traditional trade deal than a comprehensive economic treaty and, at least for the United States, a strategic hedge against the vast and growing weight of Chinese regional influence. What exactly the T.P.P. will do, however, is difficult to know, because its terms are being negotiated in secret. Only “cleared advisors,” most of them representing various private industries, are permitted to work on the text. Leaked drafts of chapters have occasionally surfaced—enough to alarm, among others, environmentalists, labor groups, and advocates for affordable medicine.","1323","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-does-obama-want-the-trans-pacific-partnership-so-badly"
"Some of the fear and loathing inspired by the T.P.P. is hard to take seriously. Conservative opponents of immigration reform, for instance, have descried in the T.P.P. a Trojan horse, inside which, they fear, the dreaded immigration reform will be smuggled into law. (Paul Ryan has tried to debunk this notion, calling it an “urban legend.”) There are House Republicans who seemingly refuse to support any measure that Obama wants, simply because he wants it. Last week, contemplating the approaching fast-track vote, Representative Ryan Zinke, of Montana, said, “We are talking about giving Barack Obama—a President who negotiates with rogue nations like Iran and Cuba—exorbitant authority to do what he thinks is best.” Zinke, a former Navy SEAL commander, went on, “I don’t have faith that President Obama will negotiate in the best interest of Montana or America.”","1324","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-does-obama-want-the-trans-pacific-partnership-so-badly"
"More substantive objections to the T.P.P. have emerged from senators and representatives, who are now allowed, under strictly controlled conditions—in a guarded basement room under the Capitol, with no note-taking—to read drafts of the eight-hundred-page agreement. Senator Elizabeth Warren has criticized its provisions for “investor-state dispute settlement.” I.S.D.S. allows corporations to sue governments over laws that may adversely affect “expected future profits.” Environmental regulations, public-health measures, and even minimum-wage laws can be challenged under I.S.D.S., which is already a feature of many trade agreements. A Swedish power company is currently suing Germany, seeking $4.6 billion in damages, because of steps Germany is taking to phase out nuclear power, and Philip Morris is suing to prevent Uruguay and Australia from implementing policies to reduce smoking. Under the T.P.P., the international tribunals that would hear such cases would not, according to Warren, be staffed by judges but by a rotating cast of corporate lawyers. Challenges to American laws should at least be lodged, she argues, in American courts.","1325","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-does-obama-want-the-trans-pacific-partnership-so-badly"
"WikiLeaks has published T.P.P. draft chapters on investment, the environment, and two versions, from 2013 and 2014, of the intellectual-property-rights chapter. The environment chapter was a major disappointment to activists who had been led to believe that it would contain real enforcement mechanisms. In the Sierra Club’s analysis, the T.P.P. will generate a rapid increase in exports of American liquefied natural gas, which will in turn lead to more fracking, more methane emissions, a shift of the domestic energy market from gas toward coal, and the exacerbation of climate change. The proposed intellectual-property agreements appear to have been dictated by the entertainment, tech, and pharmaceutical industries. Doctors Without Borders declared that, if the drug-patent provisions do not change in the final draft, the T.P.P. is on track to become “the most harmful trade pact ever for access to medicines” in developing countries. With each glimpse of the draft chapters, the coalition opposing the agreement grows. Even a “sweetener” in the form of assistance for workers who lose their jobs because of trade agreements turns out to be partly financed by a seven-hundred-million-dollar raid on Medicare. Now Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder, is trying to raise a hundred thousand dollars through crowdsourcing, planning to offer the money as a reward to anyone who leaks the entire T.P.P. text—twenty-nine chapters’ worth.","1326","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-does-obama-want-the-trans-pacific-partnership-so-badly"
"With the fast-track authority that President Obama seeks, he would be able to negotiate trade agreements and present them to Congress for an up-or-down vote, with no amendments or filibusters permitted. Such agreements would then require only fifty-one votes, not sixty, to pass. Paul Ryan recently said, on CNN, that “every President since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had” some form of fast-track authority. That is not quite right—Richard Nixon never got it, although he initiated the modern version of it. Still, not having it plainly galls Obama. And his only realistic hope of enacting the T.P.P. now turns on getting fast-track authority from the House.","1327","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-does-obama-want-the-trans-pacific-partnership-so-badly"

That’s how strange the legislative politics of the T.P.P. have become. Nearly every constituency in the Democratic Party opposes it; and the more they learn about it, the more they oppose it. And yet their leader, Obama, wants it badly.","1328","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-does-obama-want-the-trans-pacific-partnership-so-badly"
"But why? Maybe it’s a better agreement—better for the American middle class, for American workers—than it seems in the leaked drafts, where it appears bent to the will of multinational corporations. John Kerry, the Secretary of State, and Ashton Carter, the Secretary of Defense, co-authored a column on Monday in USA Today arguing, in evangelical tones, that the T.P.P. will usher in a glorious new era of American-led prosperity, a “global race to the top” for all parties. Meanwhile, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. sees only a race to the bottom. Organized labor, by all accounts, plans to punish any elected Democrat who supports the T.P.P., or even supports fast-track for Obama, in the next campaign. It’s difficult, again, to evaluate the agreement when we can’t see it. And it will be difficult for Congress to do its job if its members can’t study each part of the many-tentacled T.P.P. on its merits, but must simply vote yes or no on the whole shebang. What’s the rush? Is it simply Obama’s wish to make his mark on history and to complete his pivot toward Asia before his time is up? Politicians are often accused of supporting pro-corporate policies to please wealthy backers, looking toward the next campaign.

"And, of course, Sanders’s contribution can’t be measured solely in polling numbers. In lambasting tax-dodging corporate élites and highlighting the corrosive effect that money is having on U.S. politics, he is telling truths that need to be told and giving voice to the feelings of many Americans, particularly young Americans, who feel alienated by the current system.

"Sanders, however, insists that he’s not running merely to cheer up progressive activists or to be a thorn in the side of the Clinton political machine. He insists he’s in it to win, which means he needs to move beyond his base of white, college-educated liberals and start picking up votes from other elements of the party coalition, such as non-whites, women, and Southern Democrats, all of whom still slant heavily toward Clinton.","1337","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"

She recalls it as the “ten-year war.” Between 1995 and 2005, Warren, a professor who had established herself as one of the country’s foremost experts on bankruptcy law, managed to turn an arcane issue of financial regulation into a major political issue.","1346","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In the late nineteen-nineties, Congress was trying to pass a bankruptcy bill that Warren felt was written, essentially, by the credit-card industry. For several years, through a growing network of allies in Washington, she helped liberals in Congress fight the bill, but at the end of the Clinton Administration the bill seemed on the verge of passage. Clinton’s economic team was divided, much as Democrats today are split over economic policy. His progressive aides opposed the bill; aides who were more sympathetic to the financial industry supported it. Warren targeted the one person in the White House who she believed could stop the legislation: the First Lady. They met alone for half an hour, and, according to Warren, Hillary stood up and declared, “Well, I’m convinced. It is our job to stop that awful bill. You help me and I’ll help you.” In the Administration’s closing weeks, Hillary persuaded Bill Clinton not to sign the legislation, effectively vetoing it.","1347","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"But just a few months later, in 2001, Hillary was a senator from New York, the home of the financial industry, and she voted in favor of a version of the same bill. It passed, and George W. Bush signed it into law, ending Warren’s ten-year war with a crushing defeat. “There were a lot of people who voted for that bill who thought that there was going to be no political price to pay,” Warren told me.","1348","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren is not running for President. But she is mounting a campaign to insure that Clinton and other prominent Democrats adhere to her agenda of reversing income inequality and beating back the influence of corporate power in politics. These are issues that Warren has pursued for three decades, as an academic, a policy adviser to Democrats, an Obama Administration regulator, and, since 2012, a U.S. senator and the anchor of a progressive wing of the Democratic Party.","1349","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Clinton has taken notice. Last December, she invited Warren to a private meeting at her Washington home, near Embassy Row, to hear Warren’s advice on issues such as income inequality. In recent months, members of Clinton’s policy team have consulted with Dan Geldon, one of Warren’s closest advisers, about economic policy. And a few days after Clinton’s official announcement, on April 12th, that she is running for President, she wrote a paean to Warren in Time, saying that Warren “never hesitates to hold powerful people’s feet to the fire: bankers, lobbyists, senior government officials and, yes, even presidential aspirants.”","1350","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Clinton even sounds like Warren these days, evidently hoping to fend off charges that she is a captive of Wall Street money and influence. In the video in which Clinton announced her candidacy, she says, “The deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top.” Two days later, during a stop in Iowa, she noted, “Hedge-fund managers pay lower taxes than nurses or the truckers I saw on I-80, when I was driving here over the last two days.” And in a fund-raising e-mail she wrote, “The average CEO makes 300 times what the average worker makes.”","1351","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Clinton’s people insist that any similarity to Warren is coincidental. “Hillary was talking about rising inequality and how the deck was stacked against people in 2007 and 2008,” Neera Tanden, the head of the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank, and a policy adviser to Hillary Clinton, said. “I see a lot of overlap. I do not see a causal link from one person to the other.” The Warren camp seems to have a different view. Last week, Warren’s advisers privately circulated a picture showing the two women sitting beside each other, a quote bubble emanating from Clinton: “What she said.” When I asked Warren last week if she believed that Clinton was co-opting her message, she hesitated and replied, “Eh.” She added, “She’s laying out her vision for the country and she deserves an opportunity to do that.” Warren may have decided not to run because she felt she couldn’t win. But Clinton’s populist turn signals another possibility: Warren feels that she can accomplish more from the sidelines.","1352","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“I think she’s doing exactly the right thing,” Barney Frank, the former congressman from Massachusetts, told me recently, referring to Warren. “Right now, she’s as powerful a spokesperson on public policy as you could be in the minority.” Frank worked closely with Warren in the House on financial-reform legislation to curb the power of banks. “She has an absolute veto over certain public-policy issues, because Democrats are not going to cross her. And if she were to even hint at being a candidate that would be over.” He added, “Democrats are afraid of Elizabeth Warren. No Democrat wants Elizabeth Warren being critical of him.”","1353","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren believes that, when it comes to economic policy, there is a Wall Street view and a Main Street view, and Democrats must choose sides. Her critics argue that this is simplistic and naïve, but she has buoyed many on the left who are critical of President Obama’s economic policies and advisers for being excessively influenced by Wall Street. Warren was especially unimpressed by the President’s first Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, who was appointed at the start of the financial crisis. “I was shocked that he picked the person who had just done the bailouts through the New York Fed,” she said. “I assumed that the President would want to carve a different path, and want to separate himself from the Republican-led bailout.” She added, “Tim Geithner came from the New York Fed, which, effectively, works for Wall Street.” (Geithner declined to respond on the record to Warren’s criticism of him.)","1354","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In the final year and a half of the Obama Administration, Warren will continue to take on the President over issues such as international trade and his choices for Treasury Department positions, but she will be focussing more intently on influencing Clinton. In the past two weeks, in the wake of Warren’s forceful opposition, Clinton has backed away from a major trade agreement with Asian countries that, as Secretary of State, she had helped to negotiate. But, as Warren knows, Clinton can be an inconsistent ally. Her challenge over the next year and a half is to make sure that Hillary Clinton’s embrace of Warrenism is a lasting one.","1355","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"On a shelf in her Boston office, Warren keeps a glass bowl of large rocks, a gift from her advisers during the 2012 Senate campaign, when she would often say to them, “I want to throw rocks.” When I visited her in Washington in late February, though, she was in a theatrical mood, reprising a scene from the early nineteen-seventies, when she was struggling to balance the strains of new motherhood, a failing marriage, and law school. Splayed out on a chair, she demonstrated how she drove her Volkswagen Beetle with one hand, reaching with the other into the back seat to keep the baby awake.","1356","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“No, no, no!” she yelled. “Wake up, baby, wake up, wake up! Just a little bit longer! Just a little bit longer! Do we remember the sunshine song?” She began to sing “You Are My Sunshine.” At the time, Warren said, she couldn’t get her homework finished unless her daughter napped at home; that meant keeping the baby awake on the drive back from the babysitter after class. “I learned to shift through the steering wheel, so as not to let go of that baby,” Warren said. Once, she crashed the car. “I rolled right into someone while doing that. Caved in the whole front end of that VW Beetle.”","1357","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren’s attempts at drama can feel forced. In her memoir, she frequently recalls times when she was “stunned” or “furious,” or when she “clenched” her teeth at the “vile” actions of the big banks. Her more compelling moments, captured on video, feature her passionately defending the role of government or pummelling committee witnesses—government regulators or bankers who have made the mistake of arguing a point with Warren, a former high-school debate champion. She has cultivated a public image as a fierce and uncompromising fighter, although her critics in business and politics sometimes use other words.","1358","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“I think that she would do better if she were less angry and demonized less,” Warren Buffett, the C.E.O. and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, recently complained on CNBC. Several commentators denounced Buffett, an ardent supporter of Hillary Clinton, as sexist, but one of Warren’s close advisers told me that her aides acknowledge the criticism. “I would modify her vitriol, because I think it gratuitously creates enemies,” the adviser said. “There is a grain of truth in what Buffett said.”","1359","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren is driven in part by an awareness of the obstacles that she had to overcome to achieve professional success. She grew up in Oklahoma City in the nineteen-fifties, the youngest of four and the only girl. “All I ever wanted to do was be a teacher,” she said. “It must have been miserable to be one of my dolls, because I used to line them up and teach school.” In her 2014 memoir, “A Fighting Chance,” she describes herself in high school as “tall,” “self-conscious,” and cursed with crooked teeth. Her mother told her to get married early, but she secretly sent away for college applications and, on the strength of her debate-team skills, won a full scholarship to George Washington University, in D.C. After two years, she dropped out of college and, at nineteen, married Jim Warren, whom she had dated in high school.","1360","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren soon realized that she had made a terrible mistake. “It was all over at that point, statistically,” she said. “You get married at nineteen and drop out of college, that’s pretty much it for most girls, especially back in the late sixties.” Still, she finished college and went to law school, at Rutgers, but her husband wanted her to stay home, while she insisted on going to work as a lawyer. “I tried,” she told me. “I tried so hard.” The couple, who had two children, divorced in 1980. (Jim Warren died in 2003, of lung cancer.)","1361","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In 1983, after finishing law school, and teaching law at the University of Houston, she took a position at the University of Texas Law School, in Austin, where she offered to lecture on bankruptcy law. She knew little about the subject, apart from her experiences of financial insecurity growing up. By the time Warren was born, the family’s finances were deteriorating. Her father, who served as a flight instructor in the Second World War, had sought a job flying but was passed over because of his age. He had lost all his money starting a car dealership, and then he was injured in a car crash.","1362","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“It was a life lived just at the edge of economic survival,” Warren said. “When I got sick, my mother would lean down, put her hand against my forehead, and then step back and do the calculation: how sick I seemed to be versus how big was the outstanding bill with Dr. Buffington.”","1363","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Eventually, her father found a job selling carpeting, and the family bought a station wagon and moved to a bigger house in Oklahoma City. Then her father suffered a heart attack. “It all just came undone in the blink of an eye,” Warren said. Her mother took a minimum-wage job at Sears to support the family.","1364","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"At the University of Texas, Warren joined with two other professors to study what kind of people declare bankruptcy. At the time, the common view of most legal scholars and many politicians was that the bankruptcy laws were being abused by people cheating the system. Warren initially thought the same. “I’d gone into this research to prove that those people who filed for bankruptcy were different from us,” she said. “We’d had hard times, but we’d never filed for bankruptcy.” Jay Westbrook, one of Warren’s collaborators, who still teaches at the University of Texas Law School, told me, “We had a picture in our mind of sort of shiftless people who weren’t very careful with their money.”","1365","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren and her colleagues travelled to courthouses around the country and gathered data on hundreds of bankruptcy cases. There were no electronic records, so they flew from city to city with a portable Xerox machine that they called R2-D2. In academic legal circles, theoretical work was a surer path to a tenured position than empirical field research, but Warren and her colleagues stayed with it for almost a decade. One of the first cases she reviewed involved a middle-class couple who committed suicide before they could appear at their court hearing. “I looked at that and I thought, Yeah, I know people who would make that choice,” she said.","1366","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The data revealed that, by the early nineteen-eighties, a growing number of middle-class Americans were resorting to bankruptcy, and that most debtors were homeowners. “I will never forget the day that we did that data run,” Westbrook said. “We couldn’t believe it. We checked the computer three times.” Debtors were not irresponsible slackers but families hit with the sudden loss of a job, a divorce, or a bad car accident, which depleted their savings and pushed them into financial ruin. Bankruptcies were going up because of mounting economic stress on the middle class.","1367","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In 1987, Warren moved on to a job at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, teaching contract law and bankruptcy; in 1995, she went to Harvard. “She broke the news about what the actual practices and effects of the bankruptcy law were,” Martha Minow, the dean of Harvard Law School, told me. “That put her on the map and made a lot of people interested.”","1368","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren said that her early research has informed everything she’s studied since. She noted that by 1975 productivity and median wages, which until then had risen together, had started to decouple: the former continued to rise while the latter remained flat. Meanwhile, bankruptcy filings soared, regardless of how the economy was doing. “A problem that looks real but small and at the margins in the nineteen-eighties has moved to the center by the nineties,” Warren said, “and by the two-thousands it’s starting to hollow out America’s middle class.”","1369","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren tells her life story as a series of confrontations. Early on, she fought to escape her bad marriage and pursue a professional career; later, she fought against an élitist legal academy that looked down on her credentials and her research interests. In the late eightes and early nineties, at the University of Pennsylvania, she mostly avoided the debates over faculty diversity that were then seizing the campus. She was a registered Republican, and “was not viewed as a champion of women or minorities,” the Boston Globe noted, in 2012. “Silent on the race and gender wars that divided campuses in the nineteen-eighties and nineteen-nineties, she was never a liberal crusader.” Warren told me that she was immersed in her scholarship and wary of political fights outside her areas of expertise.","1370","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In 1994, Congress created a commission to make policy recommendations on how to reform the bankruptcy laws. Mike Synar, Bill Clinton’s first appointee to run the commission, recruited Warren to serve as the top policy adviser. Conservative and pro-lender members of the panel argued that the laws were too easy on debtors and encouraged reckless behavior, a position shared by the banks. The pro-consumer side, arguing for more lenient terms for Americans who go broke, often had a one-vote majority on the panel. Many of the big issues were decided by a vote of five to four. “This was the first time that I’m aware of that Elizabeth was exposed to and part of the crucible of politics,” a member of the panel said. By the end of her work on the commission, in 1997, Warren was a Democrat.","1371","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Congress mostly ignored the group’s work and adopted the industry-friendly bill, which many Democratic legislators, along with some of Bill Clinton’s senior advisers, favored. Warren went to see Gene Sperling, Clinton’s top economic aide in the White House, who opposed the legislation. She showed him a stream of hard data and offered talking points about how the legislation would hurt families in economic distress, but the situation looked hopeless. By 1999, while Clinton was recovering from the Lewinsky scandal of his second term, the bill had gained support in a Republican Congress. In addition, the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, was from South Dakota, the heart of the credit-card industry, and he strongly supported the bill.","1372","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“It was tough to know what to do, as we were facing veto-proof majorities in both Houses,” Sperling told me. “Warren really did have an impact. She had amassed data to show that a lot of the rise in bankruptcies was due not to deadbeats but to medical debt and women hurt by divorce. Her facts helped buck up both Clintons to keep fighting for a better bill and gave those of us in the trenches good ammo and amendment strategies.” The White House slowed the legislation’s progress through Congress, and when it finally did pass, in 2000, Clinton, in one of his last acts as President, refused to sign it, effectively vetoing it. A White House aide later told Warren that, two days after her meeting with the First Lady, the White House economic team flipped its position “so fast that you could see skid marks in the hallways of the White House.”","1373","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The following year, Bill Clinton was replaced by George W. Bush. A new version of the bill was introduced. In Warren’s 2003 book, “The Two-Income Trap,” she describes what happened next:","1374","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In 2005, a decade after Warren began her crusade against the bill, the legislation was signed into law by Bush. “We held them off for ten years, and that’s about thirteen or fourteen million families that made it through the system,” Warren told me. The delay, she added, proved that Wall Street was not as powerful in Washington as it had imagined. “The big banks thought they’d just roll in and pick up a few percentage points’ increase in their bottom line, because they could squeeze families a little harder when they were right on the edge and they could get just a few more dollars. They thought they had it made.”","1375","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren’s book became a surprise hit among Democratic policymakers. During the 2004 Democratic Presidential primaries, John Edwards called Warren to discuss it, and John Kerry mentioned it in a speech, declaring it “one of the best books that actually describes the transformation that has taken place in America.” It also earned the admiration of Dr. Phil, the TV psychologist, who invited Warren to appear on his show to talk about how families could remain financially stable in a world of predatory lending. Warren offered some unremarkable advice about the dangers of taking out a second mortgage to pay off other debts, but it altered the course of her career. The show had reached six million viewers, and she later wrote, “I might have done more good than in an entire year as a professor.”","1376","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"When I called Dr. Phil, whose full name is Phillip McGraw, he said that he and Warren have remained friends over the years. “I was really intrigued by that book,” he said. “But I didn’t think it was particularly written for the general populace.” He told me that after the show he said to Warren that her book was “too technically intense and it’s not reader-friendly.” He encouraged her to write and speak to a much larger audience.","1377","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"One of Warren’s lesser-known skills is an ability to build unlikely alliances. For years, she has worked closely with Camden Fine, the head of the Independent Community Bankers of America, who is considered by some to be one of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington. In the financial world, community bankers see themselves as representatives of Main Street America, and they are often at odds with the financial behemoths on Wall Street. On a recent Friday, Fine, who is from Jefferson City, Missouri, greeted me in his office, on L Street, wearing pleated khakis and a striped button-down shirt. He radiates the image of the kind of small-town bank president who might have given your grandfather a loan on little more than a handshake. The walls and shelves of his office are filled with St. Louis Cardinals paraphernalia and Civil War artifacts, next to thank-you notes from Barney Frank and other politicians.","1378","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine represents some sixty-five hundred small banks across the country. Frank told me, “It’s the smaller businesses that have natural grassroots networks: Realtors, mortgage brokers, auto dealers, community banks. They’re in everybody’s district and they tend to have a very extroverted corporate culture: ‘Hi, how are ya, can I sell ya a car?’ Extremely good on TV.”","1379","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Community banks, which typically are local and often have less than a billion dollars in assets, are good at getting what they want out of Congress, but they are also considered more consumer-friendly than large financial conglomerates, such as Citigroup or Bank of America. In June of 2009, Elizabeth Warren went to visit Fine. For the four years since losing the bankruptcy fight, she had continued to teach and write at Harvard, but she remained politically active. In the months before the 2007-08 financial crisis, she became increasingly vocal about Wall Street’s mortgage-lending practices and wrote an article in a new policy journal, Democracy, that warned of the dangers of subprime-mortgage lending. The title of the article, “Unsafe at Any Rate,” echoed Ralph Nader’s 1965 book, “Unsafe at Any Speed,” about the dangers of the unregulated automobile industry. Warren called for the creation of a new government agency that would do for financial products what the Consumer Product Safety Commission, created in 1972 by Richard Nixon, had done for toys, appliances, and other items.","1380","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house,” she wrote. “But it is possible to refinance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same one-in-five chance of putting the family out on the street.”","1381","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren did not predict the subsequent financial meltdown in all its particulars, but her warning about the dangers of unregulated lending was prescient. “It was like watching a train wreck and standing on the side,” she told me. “You were screaming at people to stop doing this: ‘Wait, slow down, there’s gonna be a crash here.’ But nobody could make their voice heard on this.” She places much of the blame on the Federal Reserve, which had the regulatory tools to address the housing bubble: “Alan Greenspan”—the former Federal Reserve chairman—“inflated the bubble, and he did it either knowingly or with reckless abandon.”","1382","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In late 2008, after the crash, Harry Reid, the Democratic leader of the Senate, called Warren in Cambridge and asked her to serve on a new Congressional Oversight Panel, which was charged with monitoring how the federal government was spending the seven hundred billion dollars that was being used to bail out the financial sector. Jim Manley, Reid’s spokesman at the time, said, “Reid had heard her speak, and like everyone else was impressed by her ability to break complex issues down into sound bites that people can understand.” Reid told me, “She’d done a lot of writing on poor people. Nobody knew who she was, but she was great. Everybody liked her.” Warren temporarily gave up her teaching duties and moved to Washington.","1383","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Reid’s decision was not greeted warmly by the new Obama Administration. Treasury Secretary Geithner resented Warren’s use of the panel to question his policies in the middle of the crisis, and Warren complained that he denied many of her requests for information. “There was this feeling that Elizabeth Warren was pretty sophisticated,” a former Obama official said. “And when we’re getting hit everywhere she should be a little more sympathetic. She was somebody who was supposed to be on your side, and she carried more weight against you because she was a Democrat and was well regarded on these issues.”","1384","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren told me, “We were there to do oversight, and it made no difference to me whether there was a Democrat or a Republican in the White House. Our only consideration should be the American people, not whose feelings in government might get hurt or whose political careers might be advanced.” Warren said her work on the panel studying Treasury’s practices taught her that Obama’s economic advisers were even more beholden to the banks than she had understood. “The Treasury Department believed in saving those at the top, and didn’t worry much about the rest of America,” she said.","1385","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren was well known in liberal policy circles, but Geithner had never heard of her until she became his overseer and summoned him to testify. He felt that she was much better at complaining about what she was against than at articulating what she was for. In his recent memoir, “Stress Test,” Geithner calls Warren “one of our most ardent and eloquent liberal critics” but chastises her for not offering him more specific policy suggestions during the financial crisis.","1386","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren quickly realized that, although she could hold hearings and write reports, her panel had no more authority than her old blue-ribbon bankruptcy commission. Those writing the new rules for financial regulation had the real power. Warren thought she had a chance to get a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau into the emerging law, so she stopped excoriating Geithner, and met with Fine, the bank lobbyist. She knew that public opposition to the protection bureau on his part could kill it.","1387","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“The Wall Street crowd constantly tries to use my members almost like human shields to try to get their stuff through, because they know that Congress likes smaller banks,” Fine told me. Warren took the same approach. She doubted that she could persuade Fine to support the agency, but, if the community banks simply remained neutral, that would be a victory. “We had not totally developed our position yet,” Fine said. “But we were very, very skeptical and were making noise that we were going to oppose the creation of that agency.”","1388","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine viewed Warren as a left-wing activist, hostile to the interests of his member banks, most of which were run by Republicans. “In the financial industry, Professor Warren was regarded as a little loopy, way out there on the fringe, and was not taken all that seriously,” he said. “So I told my assistant, I’ll spend thirty minutes with this loopy woman and then come get me and just make an excuse that I’ve got a call or something.”","1389","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Instead, Fine and Warren spoke for two hours. Warren played on Fine’s fears of the Wall Street banks, explaining that under current law small community banks were subject to more intense regulatory scrutiny than the large financial institutions. She argued that even if Fine and his members hated the idea of any additional regulation, at least her agency would make the mega-banks face the same kinds of review. “You need to give this agency a chance,” Warren told him.","1390","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine got up from the table where we were sitting and retrieved a document from his desk drawer. “I debated about showing this to a reporter, but it’s historic,” he told me. It was an e-mail he’d sent to the members of his executive committee the day after his meeting with Warren. At the top of the memo, in bold caps, it said:","1391","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The e-mail recapped Fine’s meeting with Warren and laid out his group’s political strategy for the coming fight over Dodd-Frank, the bill that was to overhaul regulation of the financial industry. Warren “bluntly told us that she was meeting with I. C. B. A. instead of A. B. A.”—the American Bankers Association, which is dominated by the large Wall Street firms—“because she feels strongly that our understanding and support of her recommendation to create the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency is vital to its success,” Fine wrote. “She said that she wants community banks to get behind it. Her argument is that the big banks can afford to absorb continued and increasing regulatory burden, but that smaller banks cannot; and that if we don’t do something about the burden the big banks will crush us.”","1392","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine argued that Warren’s vision for the agency would not be so bad for community banks, but he did worry that her approach was too theoretical. “Dr. Warren is an academic, and thinks like an academic,” he wrote. “She has taught contract law,” and she “has never been out of academia. While I found her arguments compelling, they were terribly naïve. That said, if we are clever, I believe we can work with her and perhaps shape an agency that has little impact on community banks but a huge impact on the unregulated part of the financial-services industry.”","1393","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"He said that, even if his group decided to publicly oppose the agency, it needed to work with Warren to shape the legislation. “Over all, it was a very good and enlightening meeting,” he concluded. “We might be able to turn lemons into lemonade yet.” Fine persuaded his trade group to remain neutral about Warren’s agency.","1394","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren effectively co-opted Fine and his members as allies against Wall Street. As the Dodd-Frank bill made its way through Congress, in 2010, Fine’s willingness to tolerate it was crucial. With Warren’s blessing, Barney Frank, who sponsored the bill in the House, negotiated a deal with Fine that allowed community banks to be examined by their current regulators rather than by Warren’s new agency. “They were the ones with the clout, and that’s why I had to make a deal with Cam,” Frank told me. Warren signed off on it. “She was willing to do what she had to do as long as it didn’t give away substance,” Frank said. “Every time we came to one of those things where, to save the great bulk of the bill, we had to make some kind of concession, she understood it and was very helpful in selling it.”","1395","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Geithner, long pilloried as doing the bidding of bankers, couldn’t resist pointing out the irony of Warren and Frank’s accommodation with Fine. “The smaller community banks, with members in every congressional district, got themselves largely carved out of the new consumer agency’s direct supervision, despite our resistance,” he wrote in his memoir. But, in exchange for the concession, Fine promised Frank that he wouldn’t oppose the agency, a position that Frank told me secured the support of many wavering centrist Democrats and helped insure the bill’s passage.","1396","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"On July 21, 2010, Obama signed the new law in a ceremony in Washington. Valerie Jarrett, his longtime adviser, oversaw the seating chart for the event, and she instructed her staff to place Warren in the front row, between former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and the chairman, Ben Bernanke. Warren had accomplished something extraordinarily rare for an academic: she had turned a policy-journal idea for a new government agency into the real thing. Now she wanted to run it.","1397","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Many liberals were pressing Obama to nominate Warren to head the new agency, and fifty-seven representatives and eleven senators sent him a letter endorsing the idea. The White House did not appreciate the pressure. “I was pushing hard for her, and Obama got annoyed with me,” Frank said.","1398","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Soon after the bill signing, Warren and Jarrett met in Jarrett’s office, in the West Wing. At the meeting, Jarrett asked Warren, “Can you be confirmed?”","1399","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren had cultivated Jarrett as an ally, much as she had Camden Fine. The two women met soon after Warren first arrived in Washington, in early 2009, and they regularly dined together and talked about policy. In the early days, the Obama Administration was dominated by male economic advisers whom many critics on the left considered too sympathetic to the large banks. Warren helped Jarrett serve as a counterweight to Larry Summers, who was Obama’s top economic adviser and a White House rival for turf and power in the first two years of Obama’s Presidency. A former White House official said, “With the economic team, Valerie found it necessary to carry other voices into the White House herself. An added factor was that Elizabeth Warren is a strong woman and she and Valerie saw each other as kindred spirits.”","1400","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Jarrett helped persuade Obama to champion Warren’s new agency, but she was skeptical about Warren’s political usefulness. Warren suggested a compromise: let her spend the next year setting up the new agency, and then the President could decide whether he wanted to nominate her as its first official director. Jarrett agreed. Geithner opposed the idea, but Jarrett’s opinion prevailed with Obama, and Warren officially went to work under Geithner at Treasury to establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Geithner writes that he was in favor of having Warren set up the agency, but Warren insisted to me that he opposed her. “It was a big struggle to get me in there to set it up,” she said.","1401","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The Administration’s enthusiasm for Warren continued to diminish. The Democrats lost the House to the Republicans in the 2010 midterms, and the Administration was looking for areas of compromise, not confrontation. Warren “has an oversized personality and at Treasury she ruffled a few feathers when she came on board,” a former senior White House official said.","1402","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The former White House official said, “I think in Valerie’s mind it wasn’t about Elizabeth Warren. It was about the President—where he wanted to go and what he wanted to get done. She respects people who are on the team, and that’s part of being on the team: you respect the President’s choice and you don’t try to jam him into making a decision. The Warren-for-C.F.P.B. boomlet began to look a lot more like it was about Warren than about President Obama and the goals of the Administration. And once that happens you lose Valerie.”","1403","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine, who saw the drama unfold, said of Warren and Jarrett, “She and Valerie had a love-hate relationship. In Valerie Jarrett’s mind, she is and always will be the queen bee. And she doesn’t want anybody else to become another force within the Administration.” Warren was diplomatic. “Valerie was enormously helpful when we were trying to get the consumer agency passed into law,” she told me. “Valerie is a friend.” When I asked if the relationship soured, she said, “I don’t think so. Valerie’s always been supportive.” In June, 2011, Obama asked Warren to come to the White House, and he informed her that she wasn’t getting the job. Fine blamed Geithner and pressure from Wall Street for the Administration’s decision. “Geithner despised her, and he’s the one who torpedoed her nomination,” Fine said. “He knew that she was a thorn in the side of his buddies up on Wall Street.” That probably overstates Geithner’s opposition. His legislative aides, who were in charge of Treasury’s relations with Congress, told him that the Senate Democratic leadership believed that Warren couldn’t win a confirmation fight, but Geithner left the decision up to Obama.","1404","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“Of course I was disappointed,” Warren told me. “I loved that work and I loved that agency.” The Warren adviser said that Warren was devastated after the meeting with Obama. “She wanted that job. She begged for it. She told the President, she told Valerie, she told them fifty times over. It was her baby. It was like taking away her child. It’s a very powerful agency, and it was her dream.”","1405","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The former senior White House official, who was involved in the decision, defended it on political grounds. “If she could have been confirmed, the President would have gone forward,” he said. “It became apparent that there was just no way the Republicans were going to do this.” He added, “She didn’t totally agree with that. She wanted to make this a fight.” In July of 2013, the Senate approved Richard Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general and state treasurer, as the new bureau’s director.","1406","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Shortly before Warren left Washington and moved back to Massachusetts, she met again with the President. “You are the very best we have,” Obama told her. “I only wish I spoke as well as you.” On her last day at the agency, the Warren adviser said, “she walked out quietly, in tears, and that was it.”","1407","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In late March, Warren stood before a crowd of small-business owners and government bureaucrats in the ballroom of the Sheraton Hotel in the Boston suburb of Framingham. She was hosting the annual “matchmaker” meeting of a program that she created to help Massachusetts businesses win more government contracts. A few days earlier, in an editorial, the Boston Globe wrote, “Democrats would be making a big mistake if they let Hillary Clinton coast to the Presidential nomination without real opposition, and, as a national leader, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren can make sure that doesn’t happen.” But few people encountering Warren for the first time at that event would have left the room taken with the idea that she was a natural candidate for President. Warren told the crowd that, when she spent her year in Washington building the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, she was frustrated that the same big companies got all the contracts. “This is all about business matchmaking,” she declared, pumping her arm. “Get out there and make some matches!”","1408","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Five minutes later, she stepped off the stage and hurried to a waiting car in front of the hotel. A few Boston reporters, eager for a comment from her about the Globe editorial, chased her out the door. Warren, who is well known in Washington for dodging the press when convenient—“She’s been known to pull out the old cell phone and pretend to be talking,” Jim Manley, Harry Reid’s former spokesman, said—sped off as reporters shouted at her. One shook her head and sighed, “I can’t believe this woman. She never answers a single question.”","1409","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren learned to be a highly disciplined politician during her 2012 Senate campaign. When Obama refused to nominate her to head the new consumer agency, his longtime adviser Pete Rouse told her that she should run for the Senate. Harry Reid also encouraged her. “Republicans were afraid of her,” he told me. “So what did they do? They said they would block her nomination. And thank goodness they did. Because after that I worked with Elizabeth and others to see if she would run against Scott Brown, who I thought was one of the worst senators in the history of my being around here. I mean, what a phony. In 2011, we worked hard to get her to run.”","1410","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren was skeptical. She wasn’t from Massachusetts and had never run for office; in January of 2010, Brown had become a hero on the right when, in a surprise victory, he was elected to finish the term of Ted Kennedy, who died in 2009. But Rouse argued that in a Presidential election year Warren would benefit from a surge of pro-Obama Democrats who hadn’t voted in the 2010 special election. More important, her reputation as the liberal conscience of the Obama Administration had created a national fund-raising network for her. She raised forty-two million dollars, becoming one of the best-funded Senate candidates in history. More than half of the money came through her Web site and more than seventy per cent from outside Massachusetts.","1411","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"But for much of the campaign Warren was down in the polls, struggling to defend previous claims of Cherokee ancestry, and she was forced to run a TV spot about the controversy. “As a kid, I never asked my mom for documentation when she talked about our Native American heritage,” she said in the ad. “What kid would? But I knew my father’s family didn’t like that she was part Cherokee and part Delaware, so my parents had to elope.” Brown suggested that she had used the claim as an affirmative-action tool to advance through the academic ranks at Penn and Harvard. Conservatives spoke of “Fauxcahontas.”","1412","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The affirmative-action claim turned out to be meritless. “It never came up here in the appointments process,” Minow, the Harvard Law School dean, told me. “I was on the faculty when she was hired. They had no idea. Nobody did. It was a nonissue. Somebody checked a box at some point to report to the federal government or whatever. But it’s nothing that the faculty ever discussed—ever.”","1413","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren spoke at the Democratic Convention that September, before Bill Clinton, who delivered a memorable defense of Obama’s record. Although Warren’s address will not go down in the pantheon of great Convention speeches, she broke through in the polls soon afterward—aided by some debate performances against Brown—and she won by almost eight points. Throughout her campaign, she said that she wouldn’t go to Washington to be a polite senator who got along with her colleagues but accomplished nothing.","1414","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In the Senate, Warren has struggled to live up to the promises of her campaign. It’s not entirely her fault. The Senate was designed to foster long careers, and she is one of a hundred members in a body that operates under arcane rules and is hobbled by a super-majority requirement. In 2013 and 2014, she was a member of the majority, which gave her more leverage, but now—as one of the least senior members of the minority party—she has limited power and influence. I asked her how she can make a difference when she serves in a branch of government that has come to be defined by the fact that it does so little.","1415","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“Let me describe it differently,” she said. “I’m actually quite optimistic. There are a lot of tools in the toolbox.” She added that there is plenty of existing law governing how big financial institutions deal with America’s families but that government agencies don’t often use it. “One of the things that I work on as a senator is how to get the agencies to do that. And, if we can, the aircraft carrier moves one degree. Maybe two. But add that up over time, and pretty soon we’ll hit fifteen degrees.”","1416","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"She had just learned that the Department of Education would not renew a debt-collection contract for Navient, a student-loan company that she has frequently criticized. The company was alleged to have violated federal rules in the way it collected payments from young people. It often failed to disclose payment plans that were available to debtors, a practice that led to higher profits for Navient. “The world just shifted one degree,” Warren said. “It will affect, over time, millions of people if there’s better debt collection. That is, more people who can get into the right repayment program, who can continue to repay, more people who will get the debt forgiveness that’s available to them as a matter of law. This isn’t charity. This is what the law says.” She added, “The playing field just got one degree more level. And that is good.”","1417","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Sometimes Warren is compared to super-partisans like Ted Cruz, one of the most outspoken and conservative Republicans in the Senate. Her aides and some Democratic senators object to the analogy, seeing Cruz and his colleagues as undisciplined conservative activists who insert themselves into every public fight. “He’s a pain in the ass to his own Republicans,” Reid said. “She’s not.” Warren sees herself as more selective in her battles, which can be an asset. “The people who are the most effective senators are the people who, if I said their names, you could tell me two or three things they really care about,” former Senator Christopher Dodd said. I recently watched Warren speak at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Iran sanctions. During most hearing appearances, she launches into a soliloquy or berates a witness. She holds typed notes and can be seen nervously lip-synching as she prepares for her moment on camera.","1418","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"But at the sanctions hearings Warren made a short opening statement saying she believed that negotiations with Iran are the best option to prevent war, then explained that she wanted to hear the witnesses to understand if any new sanctions would help or hurt that process. (She later voted against the sanctions plan, which was being led by hawkish Republicans.)","1419","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren’s two biggest confrontations have been over Obama nominees whom she saw as too oriented toward Wall Street. While she was setting up the new consumer agency, Warren learned how the decision-making process works for high-profile nominees, and she knew from her own experience that, if Congress creates enough of a problem for a nominee, Obama will abandon him or her. Warren’s advisers believe that Obama has a low tolerance for political pain. Critics accuse Warren of grandstanding, but her aides insist that she is simply trying to influence decision-making.","1420","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The first Obama nominee she helped scuttle was Larry Summers, whom Obama considered nominating as Fed chairman. She collaborated with her old friend Camden Fine. “She and I worked pretty closely together to torpedo Larry Summers,” Fine said, recalling a secret campaign they undertook. In the spring of 2013, Fine told the Administration that his organization was going to publicly oppose Summers as chairman. It would have been the first time in the group’s nearly hundred-year history that it took a position on a Fed chairman. Fine couldn’t believe that Obama was going to pass up the opportunity to nominate Janet Yellen, who would be the first female chair of the Fed. He e-mailed Warren with the question “Really?” Warren e-mailed back and said she felt the same way. “She was also communicating with the White House and telling them that she wasn’t happy,” he said.","1421","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"

"Fine worked on moderate and conservative Senate Democrats, such as Jon Tester, of Montana, while Warren lobbied liberals. When enough of the senators came out publicly against Summers, Obama gave up. “Warren got a couple of the progressive senators to oppose Summers,” Fine said, “and then I got a couple of the conservative Democratic senators, including Tester, to come out.” Senator Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, who led the effort in support of Yellen, told me, “Senator Tester’s public statement seemed to be the straw that broke the camel’s back.”","1424","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"

(In 2005, Lazard moved its headquarters to Bermuda.) Although the Administration has publicly opposed inversions, Obama picked Weiss to be Under-Secretary for Domestic Finance, a top position at Treasury. Warren orchestrated a campaign against him. Outside liberal groups that had championed her during her Senate race started a petition against Weiss, while she used outlets like the Huffington Post to criticize him. Inside the Senate, she quietly lobbied the liberals again, and one by one they started to come out against him.","1425","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The former senior White House official said that he was “disappointed and surprised” by the opposition, because Warren began her public campaign just weeks after Democrats lost the Senate to the Republicans in the midterm elections. “The President had just gotten killed in the election, and this is one of his first appointments,” he said. “I don’t object to her opposing Antonio Weiss, but I would have liked to see her at least wait a little bit, give the President a little bit of space, maybe meet with the guy before she came out and attacked him and said he’s unqualified because he worked on Wall Street. But that’s consistent with her brand, and it worked for her.”","1426","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"

They sold mortgages that were like grenades with the pins pulled out, and then they packaged up those risks and sold them to pension plans and municipal governments, groups that did not intend to buy high-risk financial products.

It has been more than ten years since Barack Obama stood up at the 2004 Democratic Convention, in Boston, and said, “We have more work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that’s moving to Mexico, and now they’re having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour.”","May 14, 2015","1438","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"The impact of trade and trade deals on American workers remains a huge issue, even as President Obama seeks to persuade skeptical Democrats on Capitol Hill to give him the power to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership (T.P.P.), a new agreement with eleven other Pacific Rim countries, including Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Australia, and Peru. Earlier this week, the President suffered an embarrassing setback in the Senate, where forty-five Democrats voted to prevent a debate on so-called trade promotion authority for the deal. The White House and its allies are hoping to get things back on track by offering dissident Democrats a series of votes on different aspects of the T.P.P. If this plan works, it would allow Democrats to register their concerns on such issues as alleged currency manipulation by America’s trading partners, but would leave in place the essential elements of the proposed agreement. (On Thursday, the Senate voted, sixty-five to thirty-three, to move ahead and consider giving Obama trade promotion authority, which would enable him to negotiate a trade deal in its entirety and present it to Congress for a single yes-or-no vote.)","1439","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"About the only surprising thing in the Democratic rebellion is that it appears to have taken the White House by surprise. Anybody who was following the issue knew that the T.P.P. was becoming increasingly unpopular in Democratic circles. It wasn’t just labor unions and progressive crusaders, such as senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who were questioning whether it was a good idea to give the President the power he wanted.","1440","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"Many moderate Democratic senators have been put off by the secrecy surrounding the putative agreement, which has been in negotiations since 2010 and whose provisional text is classified, and they are also concerned that it would exert more pressure on the jobs and wages of American workers. On top of this, several prominent Democratic-leaning economists who supported previous trade deals, such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman, have expressed concerns about this one, noting that some of the biggest beneficiaries would likely be big multinational companies with large intellectual-property holdings, such as pharmaceutical corporations and Hollywood film studios. (The T.P.P. would strengthen protections for trademarks, copyrights, and patents.)","1441","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"In responding to this opposition, Obama took on Senator Warren and other critics last month, telling MSNBC, “I would not be doing this trade deal if I did not think it was good for the middle class. And when you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is, when you dig into the facts, they are wrong.”","1442","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"On one of the specific issues Warren raised, about whether the trade deal could be used to undermine the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, Obama might be right, although we’ll have to take it on trust; the text of the provisional agreement is classified. (When Senator Barbara Boxer went to inspect it in a secure room at the Capitol, a guard told her she couldn’t take notes.) A number of legal experts, however, including Yale’s Judith Resnik and Harvard’s Laurence Tribe, have raised similar concerns to the ones Warren expressed, warning that the T.P.P. could allow corporations and investors to challenge the laws and policies of member countries, including the United States, outside the scope of their existing legal system. In a recent letter to congressional leaders, the experts referred to a known provision of the T.P.P., which would see disputes resolved not by the courts but by a new conflict-resolution panel, the prospective makeup of which is far from clear. This panel “risks undermining democratic norms because laws and regulations enacted by democratically elected officials are put at risk in a process insulated from democratic input,” they warned.","1443","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"President Obama hasn’t addressed all of these concerns, and he has also failed to provide much backing for his assertion that the T.P.P. would be beneficial to the middle class. The most widely quoted study of the deal’s likely effect, which was carried out by three economists associated with the pro-free-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics, found that its impact would be modest. By 2025, the study said, the deal would boost over-all U.S. income by about 0.4 per cent of G.D.P. If this is accurate, the new trade deal won’t have much effect either way on American incomes.","1444","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"But that isn’t the full story. In an important recent paper, Josh Bivens, of the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute, pointed out that estimates like the one produced by the Peterson Institute don’t take into account the distributional aspects of trade agreements. The traditional argument for free trade is that it reallocates resources, workers included, to their most productive uses, and that this causes over-all income and output to rise. But this churning process doesn’t only create winners, such as consumers who can buy lower-cost imported goods. It also creates losers, such as the Maytag-plant workers in Illinois and many others who make things that poorer countries can produce more cheaply because they have lower wages.","1445","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"To be sure, some Americans might see their wages rise if the T.P.P. is signed, especially if they find jobs in U.S. export industries that retain a competitive advantage, like airline manufacturing and film production. (A recent report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers stresses this point.) But since businesses that are vulnerable to cheap foreign competition, such as textile factories and customer call centers, tend to be more labor intensive than export industries, the over-all impact will be negative. Or, as Bivens, puts it, “If expanded trade does lead to a reshuffling of domestic production from importables to exportables, then it will increase inequality and drag on wages for a large majority of American workers.”","1446","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"There is a strong counter to this depressing scenario, but it’s a long-term one, and making it would involve acknowledging the sacrifices that American workers are being asked to make, not pretending they don’t exist. Over time—decades, rather than the next few years—the integration into the world economy of countries like Vietnam and Malaysia should generate higher rates of growth and prosperity for everybody, American workers included. As the global market gets bigger and global trade continues to expand, living standards will gradually rise in developing countries, and the sons and daughters of today’s sweatshop workers will become big consumers of American-made and American-designed products. Indeed, we can already see this happening. China is now the biggest auto market in the world, and General Motors sells as many vehicles there as it does in the United States. Apple sells more iPhones in China than it sells in the United States.","1447","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"Guaranteeing American firms access to fast-growing Asian markets makes sense, but nobody should pretend that it is cost-free. As long as wages in developing countries remain a fraction of U.S. wages, multinational companies will have a significant incentive to incorporate workers from these nations into their global supply chains and, where necessary, to substitute them for American workers. Even where firms don’t end up shuttering their U.S. plants and offices, the threat of offshoring and outsourcing will continue to exert downward pressure on the wages of many American workers.","1448","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"That is the reality of the world we live in. When President Obama says we can’t close our eyes to it, or turn our backs on it, he is correct. But his arguments would be more persuasive if he did what he did in 2004, and also spoke about the downsides of free trade and globalization.","1449","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"

"A remarkable thing almost happened to the two-party system in the summer of ’44: Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic President, about to be nominated for a fourth term, began a political flirtation with Wendell Willkie, the businessman Republican he’d defeated four years earlier, with the idea of forming a joint venture. No matter that, in 1940, Willkie had criticized the slowness of the economic recovery and, as Hitler’s Germany overran Europe, what he saw as American unreadiness. The two candidates had mostly agreed on big questions—above all, on sending military aid to Great Britain. Willkie’s sharpest criticism of F.D.R. focussed on his quest for a third term, a break with a two-term tradition that dated back to George Washington. “The doctrine of one man’s indispensability is a new doctrine for this country,” the Times editorial page noted, not approvingly, when the newspaper endorsed Willkie.","July 28, 2015","1451","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"As is still true today, party labels did not always mean what they seemed to mean. Willkie, a former Democrat, was never completely trusted by his party, though he had more in common with his 1944 primary competitors—Thomas E. Dewey, the New York governor; Harold Stassen, the former “boy governor” of Minnesota; even General Douglas MacArthur, the Pacific commander, whose vanity overcame his soldierly responsibilities—than many Republicans in this year’s free-for-all have with each other. Willkie quit the race in April, after Dewey won the Wisconsin primary, and Roosevelt was soon informed that Willkie was unhappy about being beaten by conservatives. More than that, F.D.R. told his special counsel, Samuel I. Rosenman, Willkie had been mulling “the possibility of a new setup in American politics.” Roosevelt, as Rosenman wrote in a memoir of his years at the White House, added that some Democrats “are out for my scalp, too”—referring to anti-New Deal sentiment in Texas and the South. “I think the time has come for the Democratic Party to get rid of its reactionary elements. … and to attract the liberals in the Republican Party. Willkie is the leader of those liberals.” It would have to be a long-term project, the President continued, “But we can do it in 1948, and we can start building it up right after the election this fall.” Roosevelt said that “Willkie and I together” could form this new party.","1452","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"Roosevelt dispatched Rosenman to New York, where, secret-agent-style, he visited Willkie’s hotel suite and told him that Roosevelt “wants to team up with you.” Willkie was receptive and, on July 13th, even as F.D.R. was getting ready to ask Senator Harry Truman to be his running mate, he dictated a letter to Willkie saying, “I want to talk to you about the future, even the somewhat distant future, and in regard to the foreign relations problems of the immediate future.” This was a hard-to-keep secret. A headline reading “Willkie Asked by Roosevelt to Meet with Him” appeared in the August 11th edition of the New York Herald Tribune, followed by more stories, all suggesting that one topic would be the direction of the postwar world. Willkie’s initial reaction was “No comment,” while Roosevelt was at his most evasive, at first denying that the letter existed—which prompted an August 21st apology to Willkie—and then admitting that it was genuine. Willkie wrote, but never mailed, a letter to F.D.R. saying, “If it is agreeable with you, I would prefer postponement of any such talk until after the November election.” (Willkie was feeling pressure to support Dewey, his party’s nominee.)","1453","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"But this political serial ended abruptly when Willkie, on October 8th, died of a strep infection that spread to his heart. He was fifty-two. Six months later, Roosevelt, too, was dead, and so was his hybrid-party plot.","1454","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"It’s hard, though, to resist the thought that a new political force—a fusion party—might have been born that summer, that a Roosevelt-Willkie alliance, drawing on the moderate impulses of the major parties, might have planted roots and become a counterweight to an era like the present, when men and women professing all sorts of highly personal beliefs keep leaping into the Presidential race. Forget Donald Trump; just consider the “mainstream” Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, who announced his candidacy by saying, “We defunded Planned Parenthood and enacted pro-life legislation. We passed castle doctrine and concealed carry.” That sounded like a man running as a divider, not a uniter.","1455","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"A fusion party would accentuate coöperation, an urge present in 2004, when the Democrat John Kerry apparently asked the Republican John McCain to be his running mate. McCain said no, but the race would have been enthralling. President Eisenhower, in private, sometimes sounded off about breaking away from his party, and, when he contemplated dropping Richard Nixon from the ticket, in 1956, he considered asking the Ohio governor, Frank Lausche, a Catholic Democrat, to take his place. (Under very different circumstances, Abraham Lincoln, in 1864, took the border-state Democrat Andrew Johnson as a running mate.) Some possible alliances have gone unrealized—or unrecognized—because of party labels. On foreign policy, for instance, Hillary Clinton has often had more in common with the Republican Senator Lindsey Graham than with the Democrats Bernie Sanders or Jim Webb or, for that matter, Barack Obama.","1456","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"And, if it would have been too much to hope that, after the 2012 election, President Obama and a restless Mitt Romney could have discussed a centrist coalition, odd pairings can still happen. Obama and the Koch brothers, David and Charles, have managed to break through party barriers and ideology in the cause of criminal-justice reform.","1457","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"Certainly, if Willkie and Roosevelt had lived and followed through, their venture might have seemed far-fetched. But a short-lived alliance might have demonstrated that in a divided nation—even one with sixteen Republican Presidential contenders running wild—there might be a path to that calmer center, where, polls suggest, most people still want to live.","1458","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"Politics can be unfair. Consider Joe Biden. Being Vice-President is a thankless job— “not worth a bucket of warm piss,” in Vice-President John Nance Garner’s famous words.

"All of the Democratic Vice-Presidents that Biden grew up watching eventually became Democratic nominees for President: Lyndon Johnson, Hubert Humphrey, Walter Mondale, and Al Gore. If Biden decides to forego a run for the Oval Office, he will be the first Democratic Vice-President unable to secure his party’s nomination in sixty-three years. (In 1952, the seventy-four-year-old Alben Barkley, Harry Truman’s veep, was pushed out of contention by party leaders who considered him too old. Biden is seventy-two.)","1460","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"Biden is reported to be currently considering a run against Hillary Clinton. And yet, while history seems to be in his favor, for Biden to enter the race would be a monumental mistake.","1461","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"Previous Vice-Presidents joined nominating contests with the widespread support of the Democratic Party’s establishment. But this year, the Party’s fundraising networks, interest groups, and elected officials are backing Hillary Clinton. In fact, her support is unprecedented in the modern era. The single best predictor of who will win a party’s nomination is support from other elected officials. Clinton has more endorsements from governors and members of the House and Senate than any previous nominee at this stage of the process. Joe Biden has garnered endorsements from two elected officials, both of them from his home state of Delaware. If there is even a single elected official outside of Delaware pining for a Biden candidacy, he or she is being very quiet.","1462","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"Elite party support is enormously important for a sitting Vice-President because there are many disadvantages to running while serving. The Vice-Presidential entourage is large and cumbersome, not suited to the kind of retail politics that the spoiled voters of Iowa and New Hampshire demand. While Clinton is free to stray from Obama’s policies, the Vice-President’s every utterance would be judged against Obama’s official pronouncements. Each time there was a difference of opinion, commentators would wonder why he couldn’t convince the President of his ideas.","1463","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"Even if Biden had a greater share of party support, a campaign against Clinton would be challenging. Running as an insurgent, he would quickly run into the same demographic wall that has haunted the campaigns of previous Democrats who took on party front-runners. Candidates like Gary Hart, in 1984, Bill Bradley, in 2000, and Howard Dean, in 2004, found that they could gain an edge by engineering a spirited campaign as an outsider from the left—just as Bernie Sanders is doing now. These candidates often did well with white progressives, but they could never expand their appeal to other Democratic base groups. Only Barack Obama was able to succeed by winning African-American voters away from Hillary Clinton, who was the establishment front-runner in 2008. But Biden, who is white and male and older than Clinton, offers no obvious advantage when it comes to winning over Democratic voting groups like women, minorities, labor, and younger voters.","1464","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"Even if Biden had a lead over Clinton with particular groups, it would be unusually difficult for him to campaign to her left. He has recently courted Senator Elizabeth Warren, but many Warren fans have moved into the Sanders camp. More awkwardly, as a senator from Delaware, which is home to the credit-card industry, Biden was the leading champion of the bankruptcy legislation that Warren spent a decade fighting against in the late nineteen-nineties and early two thousands. Biden’s record on criminal-justice reform is similarly out of step with the current Democratic Party: he was the author of the 1994 crime bill, from which many experts trace the record level of mass incarceration for nonviolent crimes, especially in minority communities.","1465","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"On foreign policy, Clinton and Biden were often on different sides of important debates within the Obama Administration, with Biden more often taking the non-interventionist course and Clinton being more comfortable with the use of force. But on the great foreign-policy issue of modern times—the Iraq war—Biden, like Clinton, voted in favor of it while in the Senate.","1466","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"But isn’t Hillary Clinton’s campaign losing air? Isn’t she hobbled by scandal and suffering from dire approval ratings? Not really. Her approval rating with the overall electorate is fifty per cent unfavorable, forty-two per cent favorable. That’s not great, to be sure, but it is far better than most of the top Republican candidates for President. Biden’s numbers are only marginally better than hers: forty-two per cent unfavorable, forty-five per cent favorable. If he stepped into the race, and inevitably became the target of regular political attacks, his numbers would likely start to sink, just as hers have.","1467","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"But at this stage, favorability ratings that include all voters are much less important than polls that only include Democrats. And Clinton remains dominant with that group. An aggregation of recent polls shows her with forty-nine per cent of the vote, to Biden’s thirteen per cent.","1468","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"It must be maddening for Biden, who has served Obama for six and a half years with loyalty to find himself so utterly frozen out of his party’s race for the nomination. It must sting to know that by sitting out this race he will go down in history as the only Democratic Vice-President in modern times who couldn’t win his party’s nomination. Yet it would be far more humiliating if he jumped into the race and was soundly defeated.","1469","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"Biden surely knows all of this. It’s much more likely that the Vice-President is not actually preparing a campaign against Clinton, but rather readying himself as a replacement if something wildly unexpected destroys her candidacy. In that sense, Biden is being shrewd. He can’t beat Clinton, but he can set himself up as the Party’s insurance policy in case of her collapse.","1470","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"

"For months, well before the start of the six-week campaign, we had been assured that May 7th would result in a hung parliament—that is to say, where the Labour Party and the Conservatives would gather a roughly equal number of votes, and where neither would be able to command a working majority in the House of Commons. “Well Hung,” the Sun declared on its front page. There were six hundred and fifty seats up for grabs, and an outright majority would therefore be three hundred and twenty six: a fantasy figure, allegedly, far beyond the grasp of any single bloc. The expectation was that, in the days or even weeks to come, each party would then have to find an envelope, a pencil, and a pocket calculator, armed with which it could then try to shape a coalition—clubbing together with other, smaller parties to attain the magic number.","1472","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/david-cameron-carries-on"
"Somewhere, deep in the intestines of the British political imagination, coalitions cause the public to squirm. They are thought to be a little funny and foreign, like horse meat, bidets, or driving on the right-hand side of the road. There is no logic behind this prejudice (coalitions have long been a tolerated part of life in many stable countries, not least Germany), but that, of course, is precisely what makes it a prejudice. Britain has itself been run by a coalition, between the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, for the past five years, in an arrangement that—again, contrary to all soothsaying—has endured, but anyone quietly hoping that it might continue in that vein had no way of indicating such a wish on the ballot paper. By definition, a coalition is something that is patched together after an election, rather than something you can vote for on the day.","1473","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/david-cameron-carries-on"
"The prospective coalition that had, until today, tickled the passions of psephologists everywhere was a binding together of the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party, or S.N.P. Might it not be that Ed Miliband, the leader of the former, and Nicola Sturgeon, the new and redoubtable chief of the latter, could jump into bed together, forge a lusty, anti-Conservative majority, and rule as one—the John and Yoko of the parliamentary chamber? Imagine.","1474","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/david-cameron-carries-on"
"Last year, the S.N.P. lost, none too narrowly, the referendum on Scottish independence. That, almost everyone assumed, was that. The Highland fling was over. But no. It was no fling but a first flexing of muscle, the Party’s sweetest trick being to leave Britons south of the border with the impression that they need not trouble themselves with the Scottish question for another generation. That was certainly the hope, and the pledge, of David Cameron, the Prime Minister of what he took to be a freshly united kingdom. Instead, a spirit of national self-possession not only hung around in Scotland, unbowed, but grew in fervor and fed directly into the general-election campaign. The S.N.P., until recently a minor force in the land, far behind Labour, began to nourish two unprecedented desires: first, wherever possible, to sneak seats from Labour candidates and, second, if that theft proved successful, to become the kingmaker of the next Great Britain. It became the solemn wish of every voter, from Skye to Dumfries, to have a selfie taken with Nicola Sturgeon, and she did her indefatigable best to make that dream come true.","1475","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/david-cameron-carries-on"
"So, who would it be? Would Sturgeon and Miliband seize power, at the dawning of May 8th? Would Cameron be out of a job? Or would he, perhaps, seek to nail together a creaking coalition of his own—either with the Liberal Democrats, once more, or with the United Kingdom Independence Party? (UKIP, another new player on the scene, has tempted both Tory and Labour voters with its distaste for uncontrolled immigration and its vague, if stout-hearted, belief that there must be an older, easier Britain tucked away in the corners of modern life, awaiting rediscovery. The UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, seemed most at home in a pub, and that alone endeared him to a very specific, not to say thirsty, sector of the population.) The one thing, every pundit and pollster agreed, that could not and would not occur was a clear Conservative majority. Only a madman would dare to think of such a thing.","1476","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/david-cameron-carries-on"
"And that, needless to say, is what has come to pass. Madness is truth. Last night, as Big Ben struck ten, the BBC announced its exit polls, suggesting that the Conservatives would win as many as three hundred and sixteen seats—ten short of an absolute majority, but enough to work with, and almost enough to rule with. Labour politicians and activists were glassy with disbelief, as were those of other persuasions. One Liberal Democrat grandee, Lord Ashdown, declared at around ten past ten that, if the exit polls were correct, he would eat his hat live on national TV. In a touching demonstration of just how much the future political shape of the U.K. means to the electorate, the hat was soon trending on Twitter. Before long, it was notching up more followers than many Liberal Democrat M.P.s could muster votes. Lord Ashdown’s party was almost wiped out. As breakfast loomed, it had a grand total of eight seats in the House of Commons.","1477","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/david-cameron-carries-on"
"That, it turned out, was the people’s way of saying thank you to the Lib Dems, as they are known, for having served in the coalition. There was a school of thought that, simply by entering into government at a difficult time, rather than sitting back and relishing the luxury—and the untested ideals—of perpetual opposition, the Lib Dems had shown an unwonted strain of courage. If so, they were punished for such presumptuous behavior, and sent back to the wilderness from which they had come. Their leader, Nick Clegg, delivered what was, by any reckoning, a more reflective and keenly felt speech than he or any other leader had made in the course of the campaign, lamenting the “dark hour” that has befallen liberalism—just when its virtues are, in his view, most urgently required, both in Britain and beyond.","1478","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/david-cameron-carries-on"
"As for Labour, all is lost. It polled two hundred and thirty-two seats, far below its most abject fears. It has been left for dead in Scotland by the S.N.P.; there has been no love lost between those two parties, and there will be no marriage of convenience. That is a matter less of political sentiment than of math. Even if you combined the S.N.P.’s fifty-six seats (a startling figure) with Labour’s paltry total, you would not have nearly enough to overtake the Tories. Various Labour stalwarts were deposed, much to the delight of their foes. Douglas Alexander, who masterminded the election campaign, had his mastery removed by the voters, which is always a painful sensation. More spectacular still was the fall of Ed Balls, who had hoped and aimed to be the new Chancellor of the Exchequer this morning, charged with the lofty task of guiding the nation’s finances. Instead, he is left with nothing—no public purse to control, and no parliamentary seat.","1479","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/david-cameron-carries-on"
"Balls took his defeat with sorrowful courtesy and good grace, which became him well; unlike, for instance, Lord Kinnock, formerly a Labour leader, who himself lost a general election, in 1992, that he had been expected to win. Asked about last night, he said that people had meant to vote sensibly, for Labour, but, once in the privacy of the voting booth, had changed their minds and voted for their own prosperity. Selfish varmints! The implication appeared to be that the fearful id of the Tories had, yet again, broken through the more civilized superego of socialist instinct, or, at any rate, that the British had had the nerve to act on behalf of their own families’ well-being. There is much to ponder in these words of the noble lord, but, as a rule, it is never a good idea, after you have lost a political contest, to blame the voters.","1480","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/david-cameron-carries-on"
"And so, as the day proceeds, we have two clear winners. One is David Cameron, whose party has won three hundred and thirty-one seats—no coalition required. He has seen the Queen, as custom dictates, and requested permission to form a new government. If she asked him politely, over coffee, how he viewed the large, unwieldy mass of Scottish nationalists that will shortly be arriving in the House of Commons, in no mood for niceties, he presumably gulped, smiled weakly, and reached for another royal cupcake. Still, it was his night, and, should he pause a moment to oversee the ritual smashing of crystal balls, as the nation’s polling experts bemoan the futility of their calling, one can hardly blame him. His claim throughout has been that the austere policies of the coalition were driven by necessity, as a means to erode and eventually erase the great cliff-face of British debt, whereas Miliband argued that austerity was an ideological choice, entirely typical of Conservative meanness and spite. Economists will continue to thrash out the issue; meanwhile, the public, as is its privilege, chose whom to believe. And the other winner? The gentleman, anonymous and nattily dressed, who is said to have walked into a betting shop during the final days of the campaign, produced wads of crisp fifty-pound notes, and staked thirty thousand pounds (forty-six thousand dollars) on an outright Conservative majority.

Where Ed’s failure lay, exactly, is a conundrum that historians will not hesitate to kick around. His decency, and his faith in the cause, were never in doubt. In retrospect, however, might he rue the day when he agreed to a monolith, inscribed with his signature and carved with eight inspiring, if wholly nebulous, Labour pledges, which he promised to erect in the garden of No. 10 Downing Street, in the event of his victory?

Commanders-in-Chief started gracing the stands in 1917, when Woodrow Wilson witnessed the Democrats pull out a 22-21 squeaker.

Some familiar names had some notable moments during this period: Michigan congressman Gerald Ford slugged the first known grand slam in the game’s history; former Yale baseball captain George H. W. Bush played four years at first base for the G.O.P. and hit a home run of his own. But no sitting Presidents returned to the much-diminished game. After the Senators left D.C., in 1971, the tradition downsized to a new home in suburban Virginia: an austere field with only a cage behind home plate, a chain-link fence in the outfield, and a set of bleachers along the third-base line. There the game stayed for decades, drawing only a few hundred fans a year and raising just a handful for charity.","1487","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat"
"In the nineties, due to a wave of expansion and whispers of relocation, Major League Baseball took notice of the congressional contest. The game moved to the home of the minor-league Bowie Baysox, in Maryland, and started receiving logistical and philanthropic support from M.L.B. Attendance and revenue spiked. When M.L.B. returned to the capital city, in 2005, so did the Congressional Baseball Game. Last year’s game drew eighty-five hundred fans to Nationals Park, and the event raised almost four hundred thousand dollars for charity.","1488","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat"

Her co-worker Katelyn Phillips quipped, “Eric Cantor’s pollster is predicting a G.O.P. win.” On the other side of the stadium, “Rand Slam” and “Take Me Out to the Paul Game” banners were raised by a crowd of at least twenty Rand Paul staffers.","1489","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat"

Two of Paul’s potential 2016 rivals, Rick Santorum and Ohio governor John Kasich, are also Congressional Baseball alumni. Paul made his run for President official on April 7th, seemingly endangering his games-played streak. But, a few weeks later, he announced that he would play in the Congressional Baseball Game after all, becoming the first active Presidential candidate ever to do so. “I need something to keep me sane,” Paul explained, as the press mobbed the G.O.P. dugout to speak to him on game day.","1491","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat"

A “liberty Republican” in the mold of his father, Paul has built his reputation on slashing government involvement in all aspects of life, from Wall Street to guns to health care. (The one regulation he supports, he jokes, is a rule that forbids Democratic ace Cedric Richmond, the representative from Louisiana with an eighty-mile-per-hour fastball, from pitching more than two innings per game.) On national security, these positions put him at odds with the more hawkish members of his own party. His recent crusade against the N.S.A.’s surveillance program was a hit with his libertarian base, but it alienated him within the Republican caucus. Asked if his contrarian ways have ever created friction with his teammates, Paul shrugged it off. “Everybody razzes each other; you just have to not take yourself too seriously.” (Fans joined in the razzing too: another Swalwell staffer’s sign read, “Rand Paul Can’t Delay This Game for 10 Hours.”)","1493","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat"

Barack Obama, often maligned for his distaste for congressional schmoozing, had become the first President in decades to attend one of the top schmoozing events on the congressional calendar.

Four more years!” On the right side, Republican partisans reminded the players of the political calculation behind the President’s visit: “Tee-Pee-Ay! Tee-Pee-Ay!,” or Trade Promotion Authority. The next day, the House of Representatives was to hold a hotly contested vote to approve T.P.A. (better known as “fast track” negotiating authority), the rare Obama Administration priority supported by more congressional Republicans than Democrats.

The concept is as distant as a time when there really were party bosses, people like Thomas Pendergast, whose machine ran Kansas City when Harry Truman was a senator (bosses often came with “machines”), or Chicago bosses like Edward Kelly, in the Roosevelt era, or Richard J. Daley, in the Eisenhower-Kennedy-Johnson-Nixon era. But, despite O’Malley’s complaint, it is hard to make a case that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman who heads the Democratic National Committee, is a boss or controls a machine, even if the debate schedule—four “authorized” debates before the Iowa caucuses, on February 1st, and just six in all—does skew suspiciously toward the already widely known Hillary Clinton.

Priebus aside, the Republican Party may nonetheless have acquired a new sort of boss, or perhaps anti-boss—Fox News Channel’s Megyn Kelly, who is politically alert, unflinching, and, to judge from the evidence of recent years, attuned to reality. That’s what so annoyed the onetime “mastermind” Karl Rove when, on the night of the 2012 election, he refused to accept the arithmetic of the decisive Ohio vote. Kelly tried to help him with the math, and their curious dialogue continued two days later, when Rove insisted several times that Obama’s victory wasn’t all that impressive and Kelly said, “You keep saying that, but he won, Karl, he won … and that’s what the Republicans care about, what the Democrats care about.”","1500","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-the-g-o-p-need-a-new-machine"

Rather, the beginning of the slow-motion end for Trump, if indeed it is the end, won’t have come from a private conversation among city bosses or a shove from Reince Priebus—or from the other Republican candidates, who are either ineffectual or have shied away.

"However, what is good for the Party over all is not necessarily good for individual candidates.

"While there was widespread condemnation of Trump’s comments from Democrats and many media commentators, Trump’s Republican rivals remained largely silent. (Senator Lindsey Graham was a notable exception.) The obvious reason behind this silence is that many voters in the G.O.P. primaries are sympathetic to Trump on the issue of immigration. Yes, the typical Republican candidate might think that the G.O.P., in general, needs to condemn anti-immigrant bigots. But there’s no benefit for any one candidate to speak up. A look at the polls supports this cynical analysis: much of Trump’s rise, which has been fuelled by his immigration tirades, has come at the expense of his most conservative rivals, who all see their opening in the race to the right of Jeb Bush, the candidate of the Republican establishment.","1510","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"

With the exception of Ted Cruz, who seems to be setting himself up as the Trump voter’s second choice, every Republican Presidential candidate rushed to social media to pillory Trump. That, however, may be too little and too late. If the Party’s long-term existential crisis, especially at the Presidential level, is with Latinos, then it not only missed an opportunity to stand with a population being crassly caricatured by a demagogue, it also signalled that attacking immigrants is O.K., while attacking veterans is out of bounds.

President Obama has shown so little of that kind of passion that his self-control has long been seen as a liability. In his performance at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner last month, Obama made light of that fact; he introduced “Luther,” the Presidential “anger translator,” who gave voice to Obama’s inner churn.

"This, it appears, was not a joke. Obama’s running argument with congressional Democrats over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pending trade accord, has flared up dramatically over recent days—eliciting, from the President, not indignation so much as raw irritation of a surprisingly personal nature. His potshots at Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has spoken out against the T.P.P., have been played and replayed by the White House press corps—and it would be churlish to deny them this pleasure; Obama gave good copy. He accused his sometime friend Warren of cynicism: “The truth of the matter,” he told the reporter Matt Bai last Friday, “is that Elizabeth is, you know, a politician like anybody else.” (This is the unkindest cut: when politicians call politicians “politicians.”) “And you know, she’s got a voice that she wants to get out there.” Warren’s arguments, the President added, are “hypothetical, speculative,” and unable to “stand the test of fact and scrutiny.”","1521","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/when-presidents-attack"
"The Presidential peeve was on further display in a speech that day in Oregon. Obama characterized his critics as panicked protectionists who want to “pull up the drawbridge and build a moat around ourselves,” and who are “making stuff up” in an attempt to obstruct the T.P.P. On Tuesday, Senate Democrats blocked the “fast-track” authority that the White House had sought for the trade pact, which would have given it the ability to speed its passage by keeping it free of amendments. It’s unlikely that the President’s huff cost him the vote, but it’s unlikely that it helped him, either. Representative Louise Slaughter, of New York, called his criticism of congressional Democrats “completely inaccurate”; Senator Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, complained that Obama “made this more personal than he needed to,” and wondered why Obama had referred to Warren by her first name, “when he might not have done that for a male senator, perhaps?” (Politico reported that the President has, on at least one occasion, referred to Brown publicly as “Sherrod.” The White House press secretary predicted on Wednesday that Brown will “find a way to apologize” to Obama for the allegation.)","1522","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/when-presidents-attack"

In a speech in Glynco, Georgia, in May of 2007, Bush charged that conservative critics didn’t “want to do what’s right for America” and were “trying to frighten our fellow citizens” by using words like “amnesty.” In response, a Heritage Foundation analyst used words like “yelling” and “screaming” to describe what Bush was doing.

That November, Clinton attacked “labor forces” for applying “real roughshod, muscle-bound tactics” on undecided Democrats, “telling these members in private they’ll never give them any money again, they’ll get them opponents in the primary.” This had its intended effect: it infuriated a key Democratic constituency. (It also necessitated a Presidential apology to Lane Kirkland, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.)

F.D.R.’s “purge” was a disaster: not only did he fail to dislodge even a single senator who had opposed him on the Court plan, but he pried wider the divisions that existed in the party.","1525","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/when-presidents-attack"

Petulance is rarely rewarded. Displays of pique are displays of weakness. In Obama’s case, they signal a slide in political standing and a slackening of personal discipline, neither of which will serve him well during his remaining time in office. Trade, after all, is not the only issue that puts him at odds with Democrats on Capitol Hill—tax reform and energy exploration are others—and Obama needs Congress at this point more than Congress needs him. He should, at the very least, contain his obvious contempt for those who see things differently than he does.

In her 2014 memoir, “Hard Choices,” Clinton changed tack, fessing up and saying that she had relied heavily on prewar intelligence about Saddam’s programs to build weapons of mass destruction. “I should have stated my regret sooner and in the plainest, most direct language possible,” she wrote. She went on, “I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn’t alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.”","1532","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"That language was commendably clear. It means that Clinton and Bush are now agreed upon the proposition that, knowing what we know now, invading Iraq was an error. The two of them also agree that, once Saddam had been overthrown, the U.S.-led occupation bungled things by not providing adequate security inside Iraq. In her book, Clinton wrote that the United States “went to war in Iraq with only half a strategy.” In his interview with Kelly, Bush said, “Once we invaded and took out Saddam Hussein, we didn’t focus on security first, and the Iraqis in this incredibly insecure environment turned on the United States military because there was no security for themselves and their families. By the way, guess who thinks that those mistakes took place as well? George W. Bush.”","1533","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"It was pretty rich of Jeb to cite his brother’s post-White House ruminations in an effort to exculpate the tragic errors of the Bush Administration. Nonetheless, Jeb’s statements to Kelly, in which he also included a direct reference to Clinton’s 2002 vote, highlighted the dilemma facing the Democratic front-runner. If she tries to use the Iraq issue against the Republicans, by, for example, warning that a G.O.P. President could end up blundering into another war, she will open herself to criticisms, counterattacks, and endless rehashings of her 2002 vote.","1534","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Is there a way around this problem? I think that perhaps there is. Rather than apologizing and complaining about faulty intelligence, Clinton could say that we all make mistakes, but the key thing is what we learn from them. In the case of the Republicans in general, and Jeb Bush in particular, she could argue convincingly that the learning process has hardly begun.","1535","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Despite Bush’s claim, during the big foreign-policy speech that he delivered in Chicago in February, that “I’m my own man,” it has been widely reported that he’s been consulting with some of his brother’s former advisers, including Paul Wolfowitz, who famously said that the Iraqis would “welcome us as liberators.” The speech itself relied on standard G.O.P. boilerplate—“Weakness invites war. Strength encourages peace”—and was devoid of novel ideas. Setting aside Rand Paul, who has virtually no chance of winning the nomination, there is precious little evidence of new thinking elsewhere in the Republican field, either. Indeed, Marco Rubio’s speech last week at the Council on Foreign Relations suggests that the candidates are trying to outdo each other in bellicosity.","1536","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Clinton, for her part, still has work to do to explain what she learned from the Iraq disaster. Clearly, it didn’t turn her against the concept of overseas military intervention. In 2011, as Secretary of State, she helped orchestrate air attacks on Libya that aided in bringing down Muammar Qaddafi, unleashing a civil war that is still raging. In 2013, after she left office, she supported U.S. military action against the Syrian regime, a course that President Obama eventually backed away from. In “Hard Choices,” however, she struck a cautious note. “As much as I have wanted to, I could never change my vote on Iraq,” she wrote. “But I could try to help us learn the right lessons from that war … I was determined to do exactly that when facing future hard choices, with more experience, wisdom, skepticism, and humility.”","1537","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"As the 2016 campaign unfolds, Clinton might want to say more about how her views have changed, and how, as President, she would reconcile her urge to exercise American power—both to protect U.S. interests and to do some good in the world—with the harsh realities of experience. Such a discussion would help shift attention away from her 2002 vote and allow her to draw a contrast with the Republicans’ empty rhetoric. More importantly, it would focus the campaign debate on the question that, ever since March, 2003, has been hovering over practically everything: Whither America after Iraq?","1538","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"In his measured responses to international crises and his occasional flip-flops, President Obama has provided one answer, which harkens back to the cautious realism of the former national-security advisers Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft. Would Clinton stick to Obama’s “Don’t do stupid stuff” philosophy? Based on her history, some analysts suspect that she remains, at heart, a neo-liberal interventionist, à la Tony Blair, or even, perhaps, an old-school Democratic hawk from the Scoop Jackson school. Understandably enough, given the controversy that followed critical remarks that she made last summer about the U.S.’s cautious policy in Syria, Clinton hasn’t said much during the past nine months that would help voters place her on the foreign-policy spectrum. Now that she’s officially a candidate for President, it’s time she helped them out a little.","1539","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"

"As the British Prime Minister David Cameron puts together his new government, the opposition Labour Party’s inquest into last Thursday’s election result is getting going. Following the resignation of its leader, Ed Miliband, there is already a concerted effort to drag the Party back to the political center. Speaking over the weekend, Lord Mandelson, one of the architects of Tony Blair’s centrist “New Labour” project, back in the nineteen-nineties, said of the election, “The reason we lost it, and lost it so badly, was because, in 2010, we discarded New Labour rather than revitalizing it and reënergizing it and making it relevant for new times that we faced.” On Monday, David Miliband, the former Labour foreign secretary who lost the 2010 leadership election to his brother, weighed in from New York, where he now heads the International Rescue Committee, saying, “I think that the voters have delivered a very clear verdict. And unless Labour is able to embrace a politics of aspiration and inclusion, a politics that defies some of the traditional labels that have dogged politics for so long, then it’s not going to win.”","May 12, 2015","1541","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"

"This debate is sure to intensify in Britain as Labour chooses a new leader. But what are the lessons of the election for the upcoming Presidential contest in this country? Historically, British and American politics have often moved roughly in sync—one thinks of the Reagan-Thatcher years—and even today there are strong links between the major parties on both sides of the Atlantic. During the election campaign, David Axelrod, President Obama’s longtime strategist, worked for Labour, and Jim Messina, Obama’s campaign manager in 2012, worked for the Conservatives. (Yes, many Democratic eyebrows were raised at Messina’s decision to cross the aisle.) In addition, some of the internal party dynamics that drive the major British parties have counterparts here. In the Democratic Party, as in the Labour Party, liberal-leaning progressives are perennially seeking to shift the Party to the left, and running up against opposition from centrists. Meanwhile, the Republicans, like the Conservatives, are struggling to come to terms with the issue of immigration.","1543","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"Inside Hillary Clinton’s campaign, there will doubtless be people echoing the Blairites’ argument that Labour’s heavy defeat demonstrates the dangers of straying too far to the left. And to some extent, at least, these people have a point. The Labour platform, which included a vow to raise the top income-tax rate and introduce a new property tax on multimillion-dollar homes, went over well in some areas, particularly the big cities, which are home to lots of liberal, college-educated residents, as well as many immigrants. In Greater London, for example, Labour increased its number of seats from thirty-eight to forty-five. But, in the suburbs and small-town England, the party’s progressive message fell flat, allowing the Conservatives to win an over-all majority in the House of Commons.","1544","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"Despite this failure, it would be a misleading oversimplification to say that Labour lost because the voters rejected its redistributive tax plans, which actually polled well individually, as did many of its other progressive proposals, including raising the minimum wage, reducing college fees, and guaranteeing twenty-five hours of free day care each week to families with young children. Miliband got his biggest bump in the polls after he promised to close a tax loophole that allowed some rich British residents to pay no tax on their overseas earnings. And his claim that the Tories weren’t adequately funding the National Health Service prompted the Conservatives to come up with extra money for the socialized system.","1545","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"It would also be an error to interpret the election result as an unqualified endorsement of the Conservatives’ austerity policies, which largely defined their first term of office under Cameron. Although the Tories slightly increased their share of the vote compared to the 2010 election—from 36.1 per cent to 36.9 per cent—the Liberal Democrats, whose participation in a coalition government had enabled the Conservatives to carry out their economic plan, suffered an unprecedented drubbing: their vote share fell from 23.1 per cent, in 2010, to just 7.9 per cent. As Matthew Yglesias pointed out in a post at Vox, the “total vote count of the austerity coalition … collapsed.”","1546","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"Labour’s problem was that, while it managed to increase its vote share slightly compared to 2010—from 28.9 per cent to 30.4 per cent—it didn’t pick up enough of the non-Tory vote. In Scotland, it was decimated by the Scottish National Party; in England, it lost a significant number of votes to the anti-immigrant U.K. Independence Party. Among those defeated was Douglas Alexander, Labour’s chief foreign-affairs spokesman, who lost his seat in Paisley and Renfrewshire South, near Glasgow, to a twenty-year-old college student representing the S.N.P., and Ed Balls, Labour’s chief economic spokesman, who lost his seat in Morley & Outwood, a suburb of my home town of Leeds, to the Conservatives largely because a UKIP candidate took about an eighth of the vote.","1547","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"The fate of Alexander and Balls, two experienced and moderate Labour politicians, demonstrates why it is dangerous, from an American perspective, to read too much into what happened to Labour. The Democrats have their challenges, to be sure. But getting squeezed simultaneously by a left-wing nationalist party and a right-wing nationalist party isn’t a danger that Hillary Clinton, or whoever else emerges as the Democratic candidate, will face. Indeed, because of the rapidly growing Hispanic vote in many areas, the issue of immigration, which was central to UKIP’s appeal, represents a big danger to the G.O.P. If the Republican candidate can’t find a way to neutralize this potential problem, he or she may well struggle to win key states like Colorado, Florida, and Nevada.","1548","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"And that’s not the only difference between the United States and Britain. Another huge one is that the Democrats are the incumbent party, which means that they, like the Conservatives in Britain, stand to benefit from the recent improvement in the economy. As I’ve pointed out numerous times before, the performance of the British economy has been disappointing. Compared to previous recoveries, G.D.P. growth has been weak, and the average person’s living standard is still below the level it reached in 2008. During the past couple of years, however, things have improved somewhat: the U.K.’s G.D.P. has grown faster than that of any other economy in Europe, and employment growth has been strong. This upturn allowed the Conservatives to argue that things were getting better, and that, after all the sacrifices the country had made, it wasn’t worth taking a risk on Labour—a party many voters, rightly or wrongly, associated with overspending and large budget deficits. Focus groups and opinion polls confirm that the Tory message about the economy got through.","1549","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"The U.S. economy, like its British counterpart, has enjoyed a modest recovery in terms of G.D.P., with strong job growth. Many Americans still tell pollsters they don’t see much sign of the rebound in their own lives, but this was also true in Britain: the lack of a “feel-good factor” was one of the reasons that many commentators thought Labour stood a good chance of winning. In the end, though, the voters rewarded the Conservative Party for its stewardship of the economy. If the U.S. economic recovery continues into next year, which most economists expect to happen, the Democrats should reap at least some electoral reward.","1550","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"None of this means that Labour didn’t make any mistakes, or that the Democrats can’t learn from some of them. Ed Miliband’s struggles since he defeated his brother, in 2010, demonstrate the importance of picking a credible leader who has a track record and is an effective communicator. Miliband, despite a better-than-expected performance during the campaign, never really met these standards. Practically everything he said about rising inequality, stagnant living standards, and Tory attacks on the needy and jobless was accurate. So were his arguments that the tax system has been skewed in favor of the wealthy ever since Mrs. Thatcher abolished residential property taxes, or, rather, replaced them with a poll tax (hence Labour’s proposal for a “mansion tax”), and that Britain needs to invest in education and infrastructure to build a high-skill, high-wage economy. But, although Miliband and his colleagues had the right diagnosis, they couldn’t persuade the British public that they had the right policies to tackle them. Labour’s proposals were individually popular. However, many voters apparently believed the Tories’ claims that Labour would spend irresponsibly and bankrupt the country.","1551","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"Here again, though, the situation facing the Democrats is very different, and incumbency is an advantage. Whatever economic platform Hillary Clinton cobbles together (and here I am assuming she gets the nomination), she will be able to point to a track record of growth and responsible fiscal management. Since 2010, the U.S. budget deficit has fallen from almost ten per cent of G.D.P. to less than three per cent. Despite Republican claims that Obama’s spendthrift policies were leading the country to rack and ruin, this prediction clearly hasn’t come true, and public opinion is starting to reflect that fact. As recently as 2012, according to Gallup, more than sixty per cent of Americans identified the economy as the most important problem facing the country. By April of this year, this figure had fallen to thirty-four per cent. And the number of people identifying the budget deficit or federal debt as the biggest problem was just five per cent.","1552","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"It could even be argued that Labour’s defeat should be more disturbing to Republicans than to Democrats. It is the G.O.P., after all, that is seeking to unseat an incumbent. It is the G.O.P. that is the more ideologically driven party. And it is the G.O.P. that has a record of squandering budget surpluses on its pet projects, such as tax cuts and military adventures. Miliband, despite his best efforts, couldn’t persuade voters that Labour wouldn’t go back to what many of them perceived (largely unfairly, as it happens) to be its old, bad ways. Come next year, Jeb Bush, or whoever wins the Republican primary, will face a similar challenge.","1553","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"

"But before you think of moving to Canada for a year and a half, or tuning out and reading Tolstoy and Dickens, take a peek at a new analysis of the American political firmament by Sean Trende and David Byler, of the Web site Real Clear Politics. It’s a data-driven article that examines what’s happening not only in Washington but in legislatures and statehouses around the country, which also have a significant impact on people’s lives. Trende and Byler conclude that the Republican Party is already stronger than it has been for many decades. With a good result in 2016, including a takeover of the White House, it could virtually sweep the board. Indeed, Trende and Byler say, the Republicans could end up in their strongest position since 1920, the year women got the vote.","1555","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-2016-is-so-very-important"
"If the spectre of today’s Republican Party monopolizing most of the levers of power at the federal, congressional, and state levels isn’t enough to get people exercised about 2016, I don’t know what is. From tax and spending policy to health insurance, foreign policy, and social issues like gun control and gay marriage, the country would be subjected to a concerted effort to roll back time. While the Senate filibuster and the courts might exercise some restraint on the G.O.P. victors, many members of the Party would be determined to use their position of dominance to set the country on a regressive, rightward path.","1556","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-2016-is-so-very-important"
"Is this too alarmist? One can quibble with the power index that Trende and Byler constructed to gauge the political influence of each party, which consists of five equally weighted parts: Presidential performance, House of Representatives performance, U.S. Senate performance, gubernatorial performance, and state legislative performance. (“Performance” refers to measures of electoral performance, rather than of governance.) Perhaps the Presidency should be assigned more importance than the national and local legislatures. Another pertinent criticism is that the two analysts don’t weight state governorships by population, which means, for example, that the victory of a Republican governor in Arkansas counts for as much as that of a Democratic governor in California.","1557","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-2016-is-so-very-important"
"Still, the Trende and Byler power index has the merit of being straightforward, and it enables the analysis to be taken all the way back to the Civil War. In 1866, Lincoln’s G.O.P. scored a hundred and eight, a number it has never again attained. The Republicans’ worst ever score was recorded after the Roosevelt landslide of 1936: minus a hundred and nineteen. (A negative score for one party implies a positive score for the other.)","1558","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-2016-is-so-very-important"
"For much of the postwar period, the Democrats held a narrow lead over the Republicans on the power index, but this changed after the 2014 midterms, when the G.O.P. score jumped up to 33.8. The fifty-four seats the Republicans won in the Senate was their second-best result since 1928, and the two hundred and forty-seven seats they hold in the House is the highest since after the 1928 election, when Herbert Hoover trounced Al Smith. At the local level, the G.O.P. now has thirty-one governors, and it controls sixty-eight of ninety-eight partisan state legislatures, its best showing since 1920.","1559","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-2016-is-so-very-important"
"Trende and Byler concede that their portrait of Republican dominance “is at odds with the prevailing theme of a Republican Party with serious demographic problems,” which “make it difficult for the GOP to win the presidency.” But they also point out that “those same shifts have strengthened it in the states, which is where most lawmaking takes place.” (In an earlier article, Byler pointed out how partisan redistricting has also helped Republicans at the local level.) The two analysts conclude: “None of this is to say that Republicans are building a permanent majority of any sort. It is simply to say that when one takes account of the full political picture, the Republican Party is stronger than it has been in most of our readers’ lifetimes. This is important, and more analysis should take account of this fact.”","1560","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-2016-is-so-very-important"
"It should—and indignant voters should pay attention, too. At this stage, Democratic control of the White House is about the only thing holding the Republicans back, but they are far from invulnerable. Thanks to the big gains they made in the midterms of 2010 and 2014, they will be defending a lot of seats at the national and state level that are potentially up for grabs. Indeed, Trende and Byler note that, “a bad Republican year could place the party ‘in the red,’ with its share of the presidential vote, Senate, House and state legislatures falling precipitously.” In short, the 2016 election could bring a quick end to Republican gains, or it could assign the G.O.P. a position of dominance.

"Sometime next month, the Supreme Court will decide King v. Burwell, and the conventional wisdom about the stakes in the case appears to have shifted. The case represents a challenge to the core of the Affordable Care Act. The plaintiffs charge that, based on a strict reading of single sentence (actually, four words), federal health-insurance subsidies should be available only in the sixteen states (and the District of Columbia) that set up their own health exchanges, or marketplaces. This means, they argue, that there should be no subsidies for people who now buy insurance on the federal exchange in the other thirty-four states. At the moment, about thirteen million people receive those subsidies.","May 21, 2015","1562","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"
"The people with the most riding on the outcome, of course, are those thirteen million. Without subsidies, it’s likely that most of them will no longer be able to afford their insurance. Until recently, the perception has also been that the Democrats had the largest political stake in the case. After all, the A.C.A. is the signature achievement of the Democratic President. Suddenly, though, and paradoxically, it has come to seem that Obamacare’s Republican opponents are most at risk if the decision goes their way. They have the most to lose by winning. As Jonathan Chait wrote recently, “The chaos their lawsuit would unleash might blow back in a way few Republicans had considered until recently, and now, on the eve of a possible triumph, they find themselves scrambling to contain the damage.” In this view, the peril is especially great for Republicans, because, as Jonathan Cohn recently pointed out, the G.O.P. has failed to propose any kind of plan to address the loss of insurance for so many millions of people.","1563","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"

To the vast mass of Americans who follow politics casually or not at all, Obamacare and the American system of health care have become virtually synonymous. This may not be exactly right or fair, but it’s a reasonable perception on the part of most people. The scope of the Affordable Care Act is so vast, and its effects so pervasive, that there is scarcely a corner of health care, especially with regard to insurance, that is unaffected by it. So if millions lose insurance, they will hold it against Obamacare, and against Obama. Blaming the President in these circumstances may be unfair, but it’s the way American politics works.","1565","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"
"Republicans, of course, will encourage this sentiment. The precise legal claim in King v. Burwell is an esoteric one. It is not based on a claim that Obamacare is unconstitutional. (The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law three years ago.) Rather, the central assertion by the plaintiffs is that the Obama Administration violated the law itself. In any event, the subtlety of the issue at the heart of the case will surely be lost in its aftermath. The headlines will read, correctly, “Court rules against Obamacare,” and this will be all that matters. The Republicans will argue that the Supreme Court showed that the law was flawed from the start, that the Obama Administration is lawless, that a full repeal of the law is the only appropriate response to the Court’s decision—and that the millions who lose their subsides should blame the sponsor of the law. Watch for references to a “failed Presidency.” There’ll be plenty of them.","1566","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"

Better than anyone, Administration officials know the scale of the problems that would be created by a loss in the Supreme Court. Advertising this possibility makes sense as a litigation strategy; Obama officials don’t want to make it easy for the Supreme Court to rule against them. In testimony before Congress and elsewhere, Sylvia Burwell, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (and the defendant in the case), said that the Administration has no contingency plan for an adverse ruling in the Supreme Court. But playing chicken with the Justices only works if it works. If the Supreme Court strikes down the subsidies, the Administration will also have to answer for why it didn’t prepare for this possibility.","1567","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"

"Democrats and Republicans disagree on a lot, but leaders of both parties are as keen now as they were decades ago to embrace manufacturing jobs. G.O.P. Presidential candidates, including Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, have spoken of a “renaissance” in American manufacturing; Rubio, for his part, told a Los Angeles audience in April that taxes and regulations need to be relaxed to create more factory jobs. Meanwhile, a group of Democratic senators have joined forces with labor unions and some big businesses to support an ongoing campaign, backed by legislation, called Manufacturing Jobs for America (M.J.A.). “America’s manufacturing sector has enormous potential to create new jobs and accelerate our economic recovery,” the campaign declares.","August 6, 2015","1569","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has increased modestly the past few years, but when parties offering different economic visions rush to take credit for a renaissance, it suggests that some kind of larger deception is at work. To many Americans who’ve worked in factories, including me, the hype feels misplaced and anachronistic. What few politicians will tell you is that most factory jobs are decidedly unpleasant. Having any job usually beats unemployment, of course, and today’s factory workers are far better off than those who toiled in the nineteenth century’s dark Satanic mills, but their jobs often epitomize what Karl Marx identified as the alienation of the laborer from his or her labor. They lead the human employee to be treated, in the enduring phrase of Marx and Friedrich Engels, as “an appendage of the machine.”","1570","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"It says something about the nature of the work that so many manufacturing tasks have proven to be replaceable by automation. Machines are better equipped to handle numbing repetition, and are immune to the unsafe and unhealthy conditions of much industrial work. Despite the advent of modern workplace-safety regulations, factories remain likely, for example, to damage employees’ lungs and hearing. (In the screw-machine factory where I worked in college, there was an earplug dispenser on a wall, but anyone who wore plugs was considered a wuss.) Furthermore, workers in low-autonomy, repetitive manufacturing jobs display disproportionately high rates of alcoholism, drug abuse, and depression.","1571","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 17.2 million manufacturing jobs in the United States twenty years ago; today the figure is 12.3 million. Yet America’s gross domestic product during that period rose from about ten trillion dollars to more than sixteen trillion, adjusted for inflation.","1572","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"Why, then, is America so in love with manufacturing jobs? Historically, manufacturing played a unique and vital role in economic development. Some economists, particularly those influenced by Nicholas Kaldor, who taught at Cambridge and developed a set of “laws” about economic development, emphasize that there is a strong correlation between the health of a country’s manufacturing sector and the pace of its economic growth. And common sense tells us that few countries have joined the world’s élite solely by farming or extracting natural resources. Manufacturing is also vital during wartime, when it’s important for a country to have access to its own supply of tanks, bombers, and materiel. In addition, producing physical objects holds a nostalgic, psychological attraction.","1573","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"None of this, however, has much to do with why today’s politicians tout manufacturing. Its main attraction for them, and for workers, lies in its perceived economic benefits. “Workers in manufacturing jobs earn 24 percent more in annual pay and benefits than the average worker in other industries,” the M.J.A. campaign claims, citing figures from the National Association of Manufacturers. Many basic factory jobs also require little skill, training, or language ability, which means that most adults can perform them. Because unskilled workers still make up a significant portion of the American workforce, manufacturing is for millions of people the best economic choice available.","1574","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"There’s nothing intrinsic to assembling widgets that guarantees higher wages, though. On the contrary: one of the main reasons that the U.S. has lost so many manufacturing jobs in recent decades is that the same work can be done elsewhere for a fraction of the cost. Manufacturing pays better than many low-skilled jobs in large part because it was for a long time a highly unionized sector, and workers were able to lock in higher wages over years of collectively bargained contracts. Yet even that advantage is not what it once was. A manufacturing employee today is far less likely than a government employee to be represented by a labor union. (You probably won’t hear a lot of political rhetoric, even from Democrats, about how we need more well-paying government jobs, however).","1575","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"Indeed, some of the jobs created in the recent manufacturing “renaissance” are distinguished by their low pay. When Los Angeles passed a law this year that will raise the minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour by 2020, some local apparel manufacturers grumbled that they would move their operations outside the city limits to avoid paying more than the state’s minimum wage, which will rise next year to ten dollars an hour. If these businesses make good on their threat, Los Angeles could end up as a city in which fast-food workers are better paid than manufacturing workers not far from its borders.","1576","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"As anomalous as that situation may appear, it might help us rethink some outdated notions of work and value. If our society’s goal is good wages and benefits, there’s not much point in fretting about whether the jobs our globalized economy creates are in the manufacturing sector. The deeper challenge is to find ways to insure that the jobs created by the American economy pay well and promote social goals such as health, the environment, and worker satisfaction, regardless of sector. The resistance to higher wages among some of Los Angeles’s producers suggests that this won’t be easy in manufacturing. To the extent that a lack of skills in all areas holds back American workers from higher wages, it could take generations for the workforce to develop those skills. Still, the problem of low and stagnant wages won’t disappear or get any easier by continuing to pretend that manufacturing ought to be our only, or even our highest, priority.","1577","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"Hillary Clinton’s big speech about the economy on Monday generated a wide range of reactions from the punditocracy. The Times’s David Brooks thought it was politically clever: “She’s cleared the first political hurdle of the campaign,” he wrote. Vox’s Matthew Yglesias said that Clinton’s policy agenda amounted to a rebuke of neoliberalism and indicated a “paleoliberal revival.” Politico’s Ben White reckoned that the speech was a non-event. “The snap reaction among Wall Street investors, economists and ardent financial reformers who thrill to the soak-the-rich rhetoric of Bernie Sanders was a collective: ‘Meh. What’s next?’ ” he reported.","July 14, 2015","1578","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"My reaction was that the speech suggested serious intentions to tackle the problem of wage stagnation and to boost middle-class incomes (“That will be my mission from the first day I’m President to the last,” Clinton said), while still seeking to hold the center ground of today’s Democratic Party, which has shifted to the left since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, in 2008, and the later rise of Occupy Wall Street. Compared to the starry-eyed supply-side revivalism of Jeb Bush and the relentless labor-bashing of Scott Walker, though, her speech was on a different plane completely.","1579","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"In terms of policy details, it was pretty much as expected. Many of the proposals that Clinton outlined were part of a lengthy report on “inclusive prosperity” that was published, earlier this year, by the Center for American Progress, which was founded by John Podesta, her campaign manager. The C.A.P.’s panel of experts, led by Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, and Ed Balls, the Labour Party’s top spokesman on economic issues, proposed boosting the minimum wage, investing in child care and education, setting up an infrastructure bank, changing the tax code to eliminate loopholes enjoyed by the rich, expanding tax breaks for profit-sharing and employee share ownership, and strengthening collective bargaining.","1580","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"Clinton proposed all of these things. She also embraced President Obama’s recent move to expand overtime pay, called for more paid sick days and family leave, and promised to prosecute individuals and firms on Wall Street. (On my Twitter stream, that last pledge sparked some skepticism. One person sent me a link to an OpenSecrets.org page showing that three of Clinton’s top four campaign donors, in the course of her career, are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase.)","1581","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"One thing Clinton didn’t do was utter the “R-word”—redistribution—which would surely be a central element of any serious revival of old-fashioned American liberalism. Instead, she talked about encouraging “fair growth,” which is another term for inclusive prosperity. Speaking on this theme, she said, for example, “We have to get serious about supporting workers,” and, referring to the need for tax reform, “Those at the top have to pay their fair share.”","1582","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"Clinton didn’t spell out how she’d revive labor unions, which now represent less than seven per cent of workers in the private sector. The only specific tax changes she proposed that would affect the very rich were eliminating the carried-interest deduction enjoyed by hedge-fund managers and private-equity managers, and enacting the “Buffett rule,” which would apply a minimum federal tax rate of thirty per cent to people earning more than a million dollars a year. These are two eminently worthwhile proposals, ones that President Obama has also endorsed. By themselves, however, they wouldn’t do very much to address the remarkable concentration of income and wealth at the very top of the income distribution.","1583","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"To be fair to Clinton, nobody is quite sure how to tackle that problem. At the very least, it would require a three-pronged approach: far-reaching changes to the tax code aimed at taxing wealth and restoring the progressivity that was part of the code until Ronald Reagan came to power; reining in the financial sector, which is responsible for much of the rise in inequality over the past thirty years; and challenging the social norms and corporate-governance structures that facilitate the outlandish pay packages received by senior corporate executives.","1584","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"Clearly, Clinton isn’t willing to go that far, although she did say that she’d get back to us with some proposals to encourage long-term investing over short-term trading. “The speech revealed a woman who does not have her heart in class conflict,” Brooks rightly noted. Like many centrist Democrats, she prefers to talk about expanding opportunity while proposing individual measures with a redistributive aspect, such as providing child care for working mothers and expanding financial aid for students from modest backgrounds. Over the past twenty-five years, this pragmatic approach has produced some major advances for Americans of modest means, such as the repeated expansion of earned-income-tax credits and the Affordable Care Act.","1585","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"It is an eminently defensible philosophy, and Brooks may also be right when he argues that it’s more politically palatable to the American public at large than the fire-and-brimstone stuff that Clinton’s competitor Bernie Sanders is offering up. You have to wonder, though. Over the holiday weekend, I ran into a retired businessman who used to own a firm that employed more than a hundred people. I’ve never been an extremist of any sort, he said, but I’ve come to the conclusion that America, at this stage, would benefit from a modest dose of socialism.","1586","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"

"Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic senator from California, is making a late career of not quite pleasing anyone. After five decades in politics, Feinstein, at eighty-one, is the oldest sitting member of the Senate, where a late term is often less a valedictory than a chance for activism: think of Edward Kennedy or Mitch McConnell. With its elaborate rankings and deferential codes, the Senate rewards longevity; senior members have better committee seats, more loyal patrons, first choice of desk space in the chamber. As they near retirement age—whatever that means, in an institution where nearly a quarter of the members are over seventy—senators can hope to change a thing or two.","1588","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"When Barack Obama took office, on January 20, 2009, the Democrats held the Senate, and Feinstein had just become chairman of the powerful Intelligence Committee. At Obama’s inaugural ceremony, she delivered the welcoming remarks, standing before an eager crowd and declaring, “Future generations will mark this morning as the turning point for real and necessary change in our nation.” Skeptics on the National Mall might have noted that this was not a novel sentiment in such speeches, but for Feinstein it was an earnest indicator of political engagement. As the Bush Administration came to an end, the country was reconsidering the decisions of the previous eight years, particularly the ethics of the War on Terror.","1589","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein is sometimes described as a centrist, but it is because her views are varied, not because they are mild; she thinks of herself, more accurately, as a pragmatist. Especially in recent years, on issues she cares deeply about, she will take positions that other senators do not. Feinstein has pursued a deal to prevent Iran from building nuclear arms more intently than any of her colleagues. In March, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress, in the hope of averting a possible deal, Feinstein appeared on “Meet the Press” and said, “What Prime Minister Netanyahu did here was something no ally of the United States would have done.” When I saw her the next day, she told me, “For Netanyahu to come here with a clear view of preventing an agreement was really inappropriate. Particularly because this President’s Administration has provided more than twenty-five billion dollars to Israel, far more than to any other country.”","1590","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Although Feinstein mostly votes with the Democrats, she is less predictable than many of her colleagues. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, she voted to confirm several of President George W. Bush’s nominees. In 2007, she endorsed Michael Mukasey for attorney general—even as he dodged the question of whether waterboarding is torture, saying only, “If it amounts to torture, then it is not constitutional.” A Democrat from hyper-liberal San Francisco, she has persistently defended government surveillance programs and targeted killings by drones, and she has been one of the C.I.A.’s most faithful supporters. Last year, after President Obama called to move authority for drone strikes from the C.I.A. to the Defense Department, Feinstein placed a classified amendment in a spending bill that helped keep the program where it was. When the activist Edward Snowden revealed that the N.S.A. had amassed the phone records of vast numbers of American citizens, he was hailed on the left as a whistle-blower. Feinstein said, “I don’t look at this as being a whistle-blower. I think it’s an act of treason.” Advocates for human rights and civil liberties responded with angry editorials. The journalist Glenn Greenwald has said that her “disgusting rhetoric recalls the worst of Dick Cheney.”","1591","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The former Secretary of State George Shultz, who has raised money for Feinstein’s campaigns from Republican friends in California, told me, “Dianne is not really bipartisan so much as nonpartisan.” Slightly formal in style, she adheres faithfully to procedure and protocol; she believes in settling disputes privately, and by argument rather than by force. Even in less than momentous situations, she is a dogged negotiator. William Luers, a former ambassador and the head of the Iran Project, recalled, “I don’t think anyone has a meeting with her where she says, ‘I’m with you all the way.’ Rather, she says, ‘I’m with you, but you have to understand under what terms.’ ”","1592","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In her office recently, she described how she broke with the C.I.A. over the detention and interrogation program that began in the days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. From the first time Feinstein was briefed about the program, she opposed it. On September 6, 2006, Michael Hayden, the C.I.A. director, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee and described a network of “black sites”: secret facilities where C.I.A. interrogators subjected detainees to “enhanced interrogation techniques,” seeking information about possible terrorist attacks. Hayden, self-assured and pugnacious, insisted that the interrogations were carefully run and unassailably effective. Afterward, Feinstein wrote to him that his testimony was “extraordinarily problematic,” and that she was “unable to understand why the C.I.A. needs to maintain this program.” In November, when Hayden appeared before the committee again, Feinstein peppered him with questions. She wanted to know how the agency guarded against abuse, whether detainees were stripped of their clothes, whether they were fed during periods of sleep deprivation. Although she and several colleagues raised objections, Hayden, not long afterward, told a meeting of foreign diplomats, “This is not C.I.A.’s program. This is not the President’s program. This is America’s program.”","1593","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In December, 2007, the Times revealed that C.I.A. officers had secretly destroyed videotapes of interrogations, against the advice of White House officials. A few days later, Hayden, insisting to the Intelligence Committee that there had been no “destruction of evidence,” turned over cables related to those taped interrogations. For months, two committee staff members reviewed the cables, which described the interrogations of Abu Zubaydah, whom the C.I.A. suspected was a high-ranking Al Qaeda member, and of a detainee named Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.","1594","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In February, 2009, the staff members appeared before the committee and described what they had found. Nearly twenty-four hours a day for twenty days, Abu Zubaydah was stripped naked and subjected to multiple “enhanced” techniques: slammed into a wall, slapped, deprived of sleep, confined in a coffin-size box, forced into painful postures. He was also waterboarded at least eighty-three times. Two psychologists, contracted by the C.I.A. to develop and run the interrogation program, reported that Abu Zubaydah was “ready to talk” during the first exposure, but “we chose to expose him over and over until we had a high degree of confidence he wouldn’t hold back.” After the first waterboarding sessions, a C.I.A. official wrote, “Several on the team profoundly affected . . . some to the point of tears.” By the seventh day, the C.I.A. team had informed headquarters that it was unlikely Abu Zubaydah had the threat information the agency was seeking, but the team was instructed to continue. During one waterboarding session, investigators found later, Abu Zubaydah “became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.”","1595","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Nashiri was subjected to similar measures. Investigators determined that he was put in a “standing stress position,” with “his hands affixed over his head,” for at least two days. It was implied that his mother would be brought before him and sexually abused. He was waterboarded. After each session, his interrogators reported that he was coöperative, but officials told them to persist, because he had not provided information on imminent attacks. When the interrogators objected, they were replaced.","1596","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein described the interrogations as “ugly, visceral.” As the new chairman of the committee, she had the authority to try to effect change. “You set the table, so to speak,” she said recently. “You make the determinations, what will come up, what the committee will do.” She called for a full investigation of the C.I.A. program, and the committee voted in favor of it, 14–1. That was the genesis of what became known as the torture report, a sixty-seven-hundred-page tome, laden with footnotes. When the report was completed, in December, 2012, it included an appendix devoted to Hayden, detailing more than thirty misstatements in one session of his testimony. (Hayden argues that the Democrats misinterpreted the intent of his testimony, saying, “I described the norms—how things were supposed to work—and they found the exceptions.”)","1597","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Michael Schiffer, who was a member of Feinstein’s staff for a decade, told me that Feinstein retains a stubborn, perhaps naïve faith that the system is run by people who are trying to do the right thing for the country. “When that faith is shaken, she is really determined to do something about it,” he said. “It was that faith that caused her to be so enraged about torture.” A former intelligence officer, who knew Feinstein from her years on the Intelligence Committee, saw her determination a little differently: “The worst thing, from Dianne Feinstein’s perspective, is trying to keep her from doing her job of oversight. And if you lie to her that’s bad.”","1598","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"When Obama took office, Feinstein assumed that he would be a strong ally. During the campaign, he had excoriated the Bush Administration for the C.I.A.’s interrogation program, forthrightly calling the interrogation tactics “torture.” On his second day in the White House, he issued an executive order that banned C.I.A. detention and effectively prohibited the use of waterboarding and other coercive techniques. In the end, though, what Feinstein’s group released was not the full report but a five-hundred-page executive summary, with a fraction of the meticulous, excruciating details. The summary’s release, last December, came after an eleven-month battle, in which Feinstein and several other Democrats on the committee fought strenuously against the C.I.A.—and, unexpectedly, the Obama White House.","1599","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"While many of those who had condemned Feinstein for her position on the N.S.A. praised her work on the report, the intelligence community, led by her former allies at the C.I.A., vilified her. Jeff Duncan, a Republican congressman from South Carolina, said that she was “as much a traitor to this country at this point” as Snowden was. Feinstein told me in her office that the torture report was the most important work of her career. But the process of getting it released, with all of the attendant conflict and compromise, was surely not the decisive victory she hoped for. Amy Zegart, an intelligence scholar at Stanford, said, “I can’t think of anyone else who’s been beaten up by so many different factions, over so many different issues, in such a short period of time.”","1600","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein began negotiating the terms of the committee’s investigation in the spring of 2009, during an unusual period of openness. The C.I.A. had a new director, Leon Panetta, a former congressman, whom Obama had instructed to improve the agency’s relationship with the legislature. (Panetta told a colleague that the directive was to “make love to Congress.”) Panetta agreed to give the committee access to millions of pages of documents: unredacted operational cables, e-mails, memos.","1601","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"But many members of the C.I.A. distrusted the inquiry from the beginning. “Feinstein’s report started as an attempt to get to the bottom of whether these ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ were valuable,” the former intelligence officer told me. “For many at the agency, just asking the question is unpatriotic.” The agency arranged for the Senate staff to work on the report not in the committee’s secure space, in the Hart Senate Office Building, but in a secret C.I.A. facility in northern Virginia, using a computer system that the C.I.A. provided.","1602","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Six Republicans on the committee voted in favor of the investigation, but by the fall of 2009 they had recused themselves. Democratic staff members worked alone at the C.I.A. site for three and a half years. In December, 2012, the committee approved the final report (eight Democrats and one Republican voted yes) and sent it to President Obama. The report concluded that the enhanced techniques were far more brutal than the agency had disclosed, and were an ineffective means of obtaining accurate information. The C.I.A. had justified them by enumerating terrorist plots that had been “thwarted.” The report examined twenty of these examples and found them “wrong in fundamental respects.”","1603","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein asked the White House to gather comments from the executive branch and respond by mid-February. Instead, the response arrived in June, sent by the C.I.A. By then, the agency had a new, less congenial director: John Brennan, a C.I.A. veteran who had served as Obama’s counterterrorism adviser. Brennan was upset about the inquiry at the start, according to a former White House official: “Feinstein had gotten Panetta to give up code names, references to other countries, spycraft stuff. Brennan was very concerned about people’s lives.” The response, which Brennan delivered personally to Feinstein and to the committee’s Republican vice-chairman, Saxby Chambliss, acknowledged that there had been “lapses,” and that some employees were not held accountable. But it strongly disputed the report’s major findings. For several months, the Senate staff members met with their C.I.A. counterparts to review the complaints. Relations grew only more poisonous.","1604","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On January 15th, Brennan summoned Feinstein and Chambliss to Room 217, a secure office in the Capitol, for an urgent meeting. Chambliss, a conservative from Moultrie, Georgia, recalled that the meeting began cordially but that Brennan soon began to display “an edge.” He told the two senators that, for several days, C.I.A. officials had been searching hard drives in a computer system that the committee’s staff members maintained at the C.I.A. site in Virginia. They had found copies of sensitive documents—which, he charged, the staff had acquired by hacking into the agency’s computer system. The atmosphere grew tense. “John was very forthright in his opinion that the staff had gone into C.I.A. computers,” Chambliss said. “John didn’t handle that right.”","1605","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The files that Brennan was concerned with were known in the agency as the Panetta review. As the C.I.A. turned over records to the committee, Panetta had ordered a team of his own to vet them, in an attempt to predict the committee’s findings. It was, in effect, the agency’s best effort to critique itself as unsparingly as the Senate staff would, and, according to people who have read it, it largely accorded with the congressional report. (The C.I.A. has countered that the Panetta team examined only about half the documents that were given to the committee, and that the review was an unapproved draft.) Senator Mark Udall, one of the Democrats on the Intelligence Committee, later said that the Panetta review—like the Senate report—found that, in an effort to justify torture, the C.I.A. repeatedly provided inaccurate information to Congress and the President about the efficacy of the enhanced techniques.","1606","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"A week before Feinstein and Chambliss met with Brennan, a C.I.A. official had told him that the Senate investigators might have obtained the Panetta review. Brennan ordered an investigation, and the next day an agency official reported that five Senate investigators had accessed the documents “thousands of times.” According to a memo from that official, included in a report by the C.I.A. inspector general, Brennan told him to “pursue all available options to determine how the documents came to be on the [Senate] side of the system.” That Saturday, the official recalled, Brennan called him at home, to urge him to find answers by “whatever means necessary.” (Brennan later told the inspector general that he “would never use those words.”)","1607","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"As Brennan recounted the charges to Feinstein and Chambliss, he grew more agitated. Senator Jay Rockefeller, Feinstein’s predecessor as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said, “Brennan has such an explosive temper. His face turns really red. Dianne seems to bring that out in him—because she’s so West Coast, calm, cool, stately.” Brennan said that the Senate staffers had printed out copies of the documents, and demanded that Feinstein return every one to the C.I.A.","1608","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein, recalling the meeting, said, “That was terrible! It was something I never expected to see in my government.” Senator Martin Heinrich, another Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, described her as alarmed, but also galvanized: “I think she knew, after that meeting, that it was going to be a real battle to bring the report out.” It was all the more extraordinary, he continued, because “I can honestly say I don’t know a bigger booster of the C.I.A. than Senator Feinstein.”","1609","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"During the long process of producing the report, Feinstein had immersed herself in memos and drafts. “You remember that movie ‘The Constant Gardener’?” Rockefeller said. “Dianne is the constant student.” Throughout, she remained a staunch supporter of the C.I.A., stressing that a relatively small number of employees were involved in the interrogation program. Obama had ended the program in January, 2009; she was merely trying to make sure that it was never repeated. Even Chambliss—who cast the sole vote against assembling the torture report, arguing that it was time to move forward—emphasized that he and Feinstein have otherwise been united in support of the intelligence community. After he became vice-chairman of the committee, in 2010, he said, “Dianne and I shared the common interest of making sure we did everything we could to give tools to our intelligence community to be able to protect Americans.” He added, “She might not agree with me. But she was not automatically going to be on the Democratic side of whatever the issue was.” Indeed, several of Feinstein’s Democratic colleagues on the committee—Martin Heinrich, Ron Wyden, and Mark Udall—opposed her on surveillance, and had pushed her to get the entire torture report declassified. Feinstein, concerned that the information in the full report would be too inflammatory, decided that the executive summary sufficed for the time being.","1610","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Two days after the meeting with Brennan, Feinstein wrote to him, urging him to stop investigating her staff, and noting that the C.I.A.’s search could well have violated constitutional principles of separation of powers. She and Chambliss wrote several more letters, asking who had authorized the searches, under what legal authority, and who had carried them out. For weeks, Brennan did not respond.","1611","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein spoke with officials at the White House and at the Department of Justice, and with the Senate legal counsel. In late January, the C.I.A. inspector general, David Buckley, learned about the search, and told Brennan that he was going to investigate the C.I.A.’s actions. According to three Senate aides, Brennan immediately told Buckley that he wanted him to conduct the investigation. “Publicly, Brennan appeared to be grabbing the situation by the horns, but he was actually pushed into it,” one aide said. (The agency maintains that Brennan requested the inquiry unprompted.)","1612","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Heinrich, Wyden, and Udall wanted to confront Brennan publicly, but Feinstein refused. Then, on January 29th, they had an opportunity: the Senate Intelligence Committee held its annual hearing on threat assessments, and Brennan was one of the witnesses. Heinrich told Brennan that the agency’s recent actions were “meant to intimidate, deflect, and thwart legitimate oversight.” When he asked about the Panetta review, Brennan deflected the question, saying that he would address the matter with the committee “at the appropriate time, and not at a threat-assessment hearing.”","1613","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"

"Udall asked Brennan if he was aware of the Panetta review when he provided the C.I.A.’s response to the committee, and Brennan said, “I had not gone through it.” Udall, noting that the answer “strikes me as a bit improbable,” pressed forward. “Are you saying that the C.I.A. officers who were asked to produce this internal review got it wrong, just like you said the committee got it wrong? We had sixty-three hundred pages, six million documents, thirty-five thousand five hundred footnotes.” Brennan again said that he would respond “at the appropriate time.”","1615","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"

"At the hearing, Brennan was imperturbable. When Wyden, Feinstein’s strongest adversary on privacy issues, asked whether the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act applies to the C.I.A., Brennan said, “I would have to look into what that act actually calls for and its applicability to C.I.A.’s authorities. And I’ll be happy to get back to you, Senator, on that.”","1619","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The torture issue has dogged Brennan. Obama, at the beginning of his first term, had wanted to make him director of the C.I.A., but backed away after human-rights advocates pointed out that Brennan had been the agency’s deputy executive director from 2001 to 2003, when many of the worst abuses occurred. (Brennan has said that he had “some visibility into some of the activities” of the detention program but that he was “not in the chain of command.”) Instead, Obama brought Brennan into the White House, as his counterterrorism adviser. Brennan told Charlie Rose recently that in those early days Obama “did not have a good deal of experience” with intelligence-related subjects, but that in the intervening years he had “gone to school and understands the complexities.” Brennan met with Obama frequently, helping to orchestrate a vast expansion of the targeted-killing program, and shaping the various “kill lists.” In the White House, he was described by other officials as Obama’s “father confessor,” who allowed the President comfort as his decisions took the lives of thousands of suspected militants, along with an unknown number of civilians.","1620","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"“John had a Jesuit education, he is a practicing Catholic, and I’ve heard him in meetings at the agency, talking about the theories of just war,” a former C.I.A. officer who has known Brennan for many years said. “He weighs things carefully.” The former intelligence officer said that Brennan was “a Dudley-Do-Right character, a guy who is convinced he is wearing the white hat. He has always wanted to be close to power—because, I think, he is convinced he can do good by being there.”","1621","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Robert Grenier, the former director of the C.I.A. Counterterrorism Center, has been friendly with Brennan since they were junior officers, and he has described Brennan as “highly ambitious and a talented bureaucratic infighter.” He told me that the agency’s leaders had such confidence in Brennan that, in 1996, they promoted him from an analyst to Riyadh station chief. The political skills that made him a good choice for that position were evident in his White House job, Grenier continued. “I’ve never seen anyone from that perch exert the kind of influence and even, to a certain extent, direct control,” he said, citing the targeted-killing program. “Unlike most of his predecessors, he actually understands the whole system from the inside. So he was in a position, with the weight of the President behind him, to really push himself into the middle of the process, and to control it.”","1622","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"When Obama nominated Brennan as C.I.A. director, in January, 2013, Brennan made his way dexterously through the confirmation process. During a hearing before the Intelligence Committee, Chambliss mentioned a private conversation in which Brennan had disparaged the committee’s report as “a prosecutor’s brief, written with an eye toward finding problems.” Rockefeller recounted a quite different conversation. “You told me that you were shocked at some of what you read,” he told Brennan. “I would hope . . . that you will make parts of this . . . required reading for your senior personnel so they can go through the same experience you went through. Are you willing to do that?”","1623","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"“Yes, Senator,” Brennan replied. “I am looking forward to taking advantage of whatever lessons come out of this chapter in our history and this committee’s report.”","1624","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"At Langley, Brennan’s performance caused consternation. “Career people back at the C.I.A., watching this, were dismayed,” John Rizzo, the agency’s former acting general counsel, recalled. “He seemed overly in agreement with the Democrats, and he made preliminary comments about what he’d seen in the report—said it was shocking.” At the hearing, Brennan earnestly promised to be forthcoming with the committee, and to “speak truth about power.” Early in his testimony, he acknowledged that there was a “trust deficit” between the committee and the C.I.A. “If I am confirmed,” he said, “I would make it my goal on day one of my tenure and every day thereafter to strengthen the trust between us.”","1625","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"At the close of the hearing, Feinstein told Brennan, “I’ve sat through a number of these hearings; I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone more forthright or more honest or more direct.”","1626","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In late January, 2014, as the fight over the C.I.A.’s search of the Senate computers continued, Brennan presented a security briefing to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a strong supporter of the torture report, and Reid offered some unsolicited advice. “He told Brennan, ‘You’re wrong here,’ ” a senior Senate staffer recalled. “ ‘There is no justification for breaking into the staff computers. Just say you did it. Say you’re sorry. John, it’s Dianne Feinstein. You are questioning her credibility, and she is an unimpeachable person.’ But Brennan said no. He was defiant.”","1627","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Instead, Brennan intensified his attack. On February 7th, the C.I.A.’s acting general counsel, Robert Eatinger, filed a crimes report with the Department of Justice. He stated that information made available to him suggested that a Senate staff member had exploited a security vulnerability “to access, copy, and bring across the firewall C.I.A. documents to which he or she did not have authorized access,” and that at least four other staff members had “accessed and printed these C.I.A. documents on multiple occasions.”","1628","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"According to Feinstein, the staff had identified the Panetta documents sometime in 2010 by using a search tool that the C.I.A. had provided. She told me that her staff members were unnerved by the C.I.A.’s attempt to instigate criminal charges. Still, she resisted going public. “Feinstein worked every internal lever she possibly could,” the Senate aide said. “It was frustrating to some of us, because we thought the only way you could have accountability over the C.I.A. was to start informing the public.”","1629","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein’s staff wrote a speech about the C.I.A.-Senate fight for her to deliver on the Senate floor, but for several weeks she resisted. In early March, articles about the conflict appeared in the press, including two in which unnamed sources suggested that the committee staffers had “hacked” into the C.I.A. network to obtain the Panetta review and that the C.I.A. had spied on the Senate staff’s computers. Brennan said, “I am deeply dismayed that some members of the Senate have decided to make spurious allegations about C.I.A. actions that are wholly unsupported by the facts.” On the weekend of March 8th, Reid called Feinstein several times. “She was saying, ‘I want to be fair, I want to be in the middle—I’m chairman,’ ” the senior Senate staffer recalled. “And Senator Reid was saying, ‘Look, you can’t stand by anymore! The C.I.A. is leaking stuff. They’re making your staff out to be the bad guys!’ ”","1630","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein reserved time on the Senate floor for Tuesday, March 11th, but even that morning her staff was not certain that she would give the speech. Ultimately, she told me, in her efforts to reach a private resolution with Brennan, “there comes a point where the stonewalling is such that you have to break through.” At about 9 a.m., Feinstein, dressed in a purple suit, walked to the lectern. “Let me say up front that I come to the Senate floor reluctantly,” she began. As her anger gradually built, the room was still. She summarily rejected the notion that her staff had hacked into C.I.A. computers; the documents had appeared on the Senate side of the network, and her staff members had printed them out. In 2013, Feinstein said, when the C.I.A. delivered its response to the report, the staff members noted major disparities with the Panetta review. The terms that she had originally negotiated with Panetta suggested that the C.I.A. had to approve any documents that left the facility in Virginia. But the staff members, who knew that the agency had rescinded hundreds of files from the computer system, including the Panetta review, were afraid that it would confiscate the printouts. They redacted the names of non-supervisory C.I.A. personnel, along with information that might help locate detention sites, and then hauled the documents to the secure committee space in the Hart Building. Inside an inner office, they locked the documents in a safe.","1631","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein said that the C.I.A.’s search of the staff’s computers might well have violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers, as well as the Fourth Amendment, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and an executive order that prohibits the C.I.A. from conducting domestic searches or surveillance. The crimes report that the C.I.A. had filed with the Department of Justice, she said, was an effort “to intimidate this staff.” She noted that it had been filed by the C.I.A.’s acting general counsel, who had been a lawyer in the agency’s Counterterrorism Center, and was mentioned by name more than sixteen hundred times in the report. “How this is resolved,” she concluded, “will show . . . whether our work can be thwarted by those we oversee.”","1632","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"After Feinstein spoke, she went to the Senate Democratic Caucus weekly lunch. As she entered the room, her colleagues gave her a standing ovation. The Senate aide said, “I think it made her feel like, O.K., I’ve done the right thing. But then, within forty-eight or seventy-two hours, she was hearing from Chambliss and other Republican members of the committee: ‘Why did you have to go out there and do that? It was so partisan of you!’ And she started to feel, again, like, Maybe I shouldn’t have done that.”","1633","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Brennan, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations later that morning, said, “As far as the allegations of C.I.A. hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth. I mean, we wouldn’t do that. I mean, that’s—that’s just beyond the—you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do.” Although he stammered slightly, he spoke with his customary conviction, seeming disturbed only by the temerity of the accusation. Several weeks later, on Fox News, the former C.I.A. director Michael Hayden dismissed Feinstein as “emotional.”","1634","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On the morning of November 27, 1978, Dianne Feinstein, then forty-five years old, told reporters in the San Francisco City Hall press room that she was thinking about getting out of politics. She had been elected to the board of supervisors in 1969, and had become its first woman president. But she failed in a bid to become mayor in 1971 and again in 1975; the second time, she did not make the runoff. She had entered that race as the front-runner, so “it was a big shock to the town, and to her,” Jerry Roberts, who covered Feinstein’s career for the San Francisco Chronicle, said. “She really got squeezed between the left and the right.” Her opponents were George Moscone, a progressive aligned with the labor movement, and John Barbagelata, whom Roberts described as “sort of a Tea Party precursor.” The fight was strenuous. “In the middle was Dianne, basically a technocrat, saying, ‘Let’s have civility.’ ” Feinstein told me she concluded that she was not electable.","1635","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"An hour after the press conference, Feinstein, in her small office on the second floor of City Hall, saw her fellow-supervisor Dan White run past. White, a former police officer, had resigned from the board three weeks earlier, but he wanted his job back. She called out to him, but he ignored her. Minutes later, she heard gunshots and smelled cordite. She went to her door and saw White race out of the building. In an office down the hall, she found Supervisor Harvey Milk, the city’s first openly gay elected official, face down on the floor, surrounded by blood; she reached for his neck, hoping to find a pulse, and her finger went through a bullet hole. She soon learned what had happened: after Moscone refused to give White his job back, White had shot him and then gone on to Milk’s office.","1636","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein grew up in San Francisco, and her private life captured something of the city’s combination of propriety and license. Her father, a professor of medicine, was Jewish; her mother, a volatile, emotionally unstable woman from St. Petersburg, was Russian Orthodox. When Feinstein was entering ninth grade, her mother enrolled her in the exclusive Convent of the Sacred Heart, reasoning that she would benefit from exposure to the social élite. At the convent, situated in a mansion in the Pacific Heights neighborhood, the pupils wore white gloves and curtsied to their instructors. The nuns emphasized to the students that their purpose was to make a difference, and that they should not be limited by their gender. Although Feinstein was never a committed feminist, she resisted restrictions in her professional life. At Stanford, she was the vice-president of her class—the highest office a woman could hold. After graduating, in 1956, she eloped with a prosecutor named Jack Berman, and had a daughter, Katherine; when they divorced, three years later, Feinstein carried on for a time as a single mother. Then, in 1962, she married Bertram Feinstein, a neurosurgeon twenty years her senior.","1637","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Soon after finding Milk’s body, Feinstein appeared near the doors of City Hall, where a large crowd had gathered. “It is my duty to make this announcement,” she said. “Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed.” People shouted in horror, and Feinstein struggled to keep her composure. Her lips moved silently, and then she said, “The suspect is Supervisor Dan White.”","1638","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein, as president of the board of supervisors, became mayor, and served out Moscone’s term, presiding over a city that was torn apart—as she later said, “some of it sorrow, some of it hate.” Just days before the murders, nine hundred followers of the minister Jim Jones, many of them from San Francisco, had committed suicide at Jonestown, in Guyana. In the previous few years, a terrorist group called the New World Liberation Front had carried out scores of bombings, some of which targeted Feinstein and other supervisors. “The lesson Dianne took from this craziness was that she had been right—that all this polarization and bitterness that was extant in the town had now led to these murders,” Roberts said. “That’s when she started talking about how the center is so important.”","1639","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"While Feinstein was the acting mayor, Milk’s killer was convicted of manslaughter, rather than murder, and the city erupted in a riot. “Twelve squad cars were blown up, the stores were looted, and the gay community just went nuts,” Feinstein recalled. “The hatred was so big, we really had to bring the bricks of the city together again, and it was difficult.” She was elected mayor in 1979 and again in 1983. When the AIDS crisis began, she said, “I had to close down the bathhouses. You learn how to do the tough stuff and bring people together at the same time.” She worked closely with the city’s downtown business establishment and with law enforcement; having served on a citywide crime commission, she describes herself as “very police-oriented, and very public-safety-oriented.” Jerry Roberts recalled, “We used to say, Dianne’s never met a uniform she didn’t like. She carried a fire-department turnout coat in the trunk of her car, so if there was a fire she heard about on her scanner she could get out and take a look.”","1640","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In 1990, Feinstein ran for governor of California. Nine tumultuous years as mayor had honed her instinct for the political center. At the state Democratic Party convention, packed with activists from the left, Feinstein stated that she unequivocally supported the death penalty. The crowd booed her—to the delight of her political consultants. That mass denunciation became a thirty-second TV spot, designed to reach the majority of California voters, who agreed with her.","1641","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In the weeks before the primary, Feinstein was far behind, but she was able to make a concerted push. Her second husband had died in 1978, and two years later she married Richard Blum, a wealthy investor. Now she and Blum loaned her campaign three million dollars, some of which paid for statewide television ads showing a clip of Feinstein announcing that Moscone and Milk had been assassinated. Feinstein won the primary, then narrowly lost to the Republican candidate, Pete Wilson.","1642","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Despite her loss, Feinstein was now sure that she was electable—perhaps, even, to the highest office. In 1992, she ran for the Senate against an incumbent Republican, John Seymour. In their biggest debate, her political consultant Bill Carrick recalled, Seymour charged that Feinstein, a strong advocate of gun control, had owned a handgun. “Dianne explained that at one point the New World Liberation Front had planted a bomb in a flower box outside her daughter Katherine’s bedroom window,” Carrick said. “And, yes, she had gotten a gun. But, she said, after a while she realized it would do no good. She launched a citywide campaign, urging San Franciscans to turn in their guns. And she concluded, ‘The Pope was coming to town. So we melted down all these guns we’d collected and gave them to him, in the form of a cross.’ ” Feinstein won easily.","1643","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"As a mayor, Feinstein had relished executive decision-making, but in the Senate she had to generate support among ninety-nine colleagues. Shortly after arriving, she secured a seat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and told its chairman, Senator Joe Biden, that she wanted to sponsor legislation to ban assault weapons. Michael Schiffer, her former staff member, told me, “The leadership basically said, If you want to do this, terrific—you’re on your own. She went out, senator to senator, buttonholed people, found out what was necessary to cobble together enough votes.” She sent a draft of her legislation to the N.R.A. for suggestions; instead, it fought tenaciously against the bill. “I was amazed to see the degree to which the National Rifle Association controls this body,” Feinstein said at the time, betraying her inexperience. The legislation passed, in what was both a surprising achievement and a lesson in compromise. The law stopped the manufacture, sale, and transfer of assault weapons. But it did not remove existing weapons from the streets, and it exempted six hundred and fifty kinds of firearms, including high-powered rifles and shotguns.","1644","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein’s greatest political vulnerability has come from her home life. In December, 1978, the United States and the People’s Republic of China announced the start of diplomatic relations, and Feinstein, who had just become mayor, decided to try to establish a sister-city relationship with Shanghai, China’s leading port and industrial center. Six months later, she led a mayoral delegation to China. Blum, who had been fascinated with Asia since visiting Nepal, in 1968, accompanied her. Feinstein recalled that, after spending time in Shanghai, “we went to Beijing, and we were on the Wall, walking along, and I ran into Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles. I said, ‘Tom, what are you doing here?’ And he said, ‘We’re going to Shanghai,’ to get a sister-city relationship. I said, ‘Been there, done that!’ ”","1645","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein became friends with Shanghai’s mayor, Jiang Zemin, and the two visited each other regularly; Jiang once spent Thanksgiving in San Francisco with Feinstein and Blum. In 1986, Feinstein and Jiang agreed to foster trade and business through corporate partnerships. Soon afterward, Shanghai Pacific Partners, in which Blum was an investor, signed a deal with a state-owned investment entity to create a seventeen-million-dollar apartment-and-retail complex, Golden Bridge Mansion, in a Shanghai suburb. As Feinstein told me, “In my day, China made friends first, and then they did business with their friends.”","1646","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In 1993, Jiang became the President of China. Feinstein served as an intermediary for him with the White House, and argued in Congress that Beijing should be granted permanent most-favored-nation trading status. Meanwhile, Blum and a partner raised more than a hundred million dollars to invest, primarily in China. For years, Feinstein was dogged by news stories about the apparent conflict of interest. In 1997, Blum pledged to donate to charity all profits he made from his China investments and, two years later, said that he had ended his personal investments there; however, he continued to manage a partnership that invested in China.","1647","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Finally, in 2000, he declared that he would not invest in China or Hong Kong, and that any money he received from managing others’ investments there would also go to charity. But the issue persisted, because his holdings and managed funds were so sprawling and complex that they fell outside the scope of mandatory disclosure forms. In Feinstein’s 2000 race, her Republican challenger, a congressman named Tom Campbell, charged that Blum continued to maintain an interest in at least one company doing business in China. Feinstein dismissed the allegation. She also insisted that there was a “firewall” between her and Blum, and that she made every effort to consult with the Senate Ethics Committee on possible conflicts of interest. “I don’t know what more I can do,” she said. “I mean, get divorced and live in sin, I suppose.”","1648","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"It was a flippant response, which ignored the obvious: Blum should have resisted the money. But Feinstein was not accustomed to having her integrity called into question. For the most part, her constituents didn’t seem to care. In 1994, Feinstein—tough on gun control, illegal immigration, and crime—was voted California’s most popular politician, and she has held on to that ranking; in 2012, she set a record for the greatest number of popular votes in any Senate election in history.","1649","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"For months after the torture report was sent to Obama, in December, 2012, the White House issued no clear statement supporting its release. The following April, at the Sedona Forum, in Arizona, Senator John McCain was seated onstage with Vice-President Biden. McCain, a vocal opponent of torture, spoke about how important it was for the report to come out. Biden agreed, but said that there was “an internal debate” in the White House: “Do we go back and do we expose it? Do we lay out who was responsible?” The issue, he said, was “not resolved yet.”","1650","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"By early 2014, it had become clear that the White House was reluctant to take sides against the C.I.A. According to the official’s memo included in the inspector general’s report, Brennan had notified Denis McDonough, Obama’s chief of staff, while his agents were searching the Senate computers; he also informed the White House counsel before the crimes report was filed with the Department of Justice. Obama halted neither action. “I was astonished that the White House let it go that far,” a former White House official told me. “It was such a loss of control.”","1651","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"After Feinstein’s floor speech in mid-March, 2014, the Intelligence Committee voted to send the report’s executive summary to the White House for a declassification review, anticipating public release. The White House instead said that the C.I.A. would take the lead in redacting information. Feinstein argued that the agency had a conflict of interest—redacting the charges of its own violations—and she appealed to Obama to reconsider. She got no response.","1652","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In the six million documents that the C.I.A. had turned over, undercover agents were referred to by their official aliases, and the agency suggested pseudonyms for them that Senate staffers could use. In drafting the report, the staffers used several hundred of those pseudonyms, along with the real names of publicly identified senior C.I.A. officials. Their goal was to create a narrative in which major characters appeared repeatedly, many in various contexts, lending coherence to a complex chain of events and revealing the multifaceted roles that some individuals played. This was not without precedent: previous reports of intelligence failures, including the Church committee report, in 1975, had used pseudonyms for central characters.","1653","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"But on August 1st, when the C.I.A. delivered the redacted report—a few days before its expected release—Feinstein saw that the agency had redacted all the pseudonyms, arguing that readers might be able to combine them with other details and identify the agency personnel. The report, shot through with black lines, resembled a play where the pivotal actors were unrecognizable from scene to scene, making the action almost impossible to follow. The C.I.A. made one concession. The report had used the real names of the two contract psychologists—already identified in the press—who were paid eighty million dollars to develop the interrogation program. The C.I.A. said that the psychologists could be identified by pseudonyms that the agency had provided.","1654","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein rejected the redacted version, and began negotiating, mainly with Denis McDonough. Since the issue of pseudonyms was the most difficult one, they agreed to leave it for last, and discussed other redactions through the fall. Over Columbus Day weekend, McDonough flew to San Francisco to meet with Feinstein. “This has been a very difficult process,” Feinstein told me, not long afterward. She said that she and McDonough had “settled a lot of problems,” but that some remained, and she was determined not to have the report “decimated.”","1655","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein offered to reduce the number of pseudonyms from several hundred to forty or fifty, but McDonough refused. By mid-November, she was fighting for just fourteen. Many of these people had played major roles in the program and currently occupy high-level positions at the C.I.A. One was Alfreda Bikowsky, an agent who had been named in journalistic accounts as early as 2011. As deputy chief of the unit dedicated to finding Osama bin Laden, Bikowsky had participated in brutal interrogations. She was convinced of the program’s virtues. Its strength, she once wrote, was that potential terrorists expected nothing worse than a “show trial” in America. They “never counted on being detained by us outside the U.S., and being subjected to methods they never dreamed of.”","1656","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The former intelligence officer told me, “There was this group of four or five women, at the core of hunting Al Qaeda.” Bikowsky was at the center of it. “They all had this burden of guilt, that they were there and didn’t stop 9/11. They saw their jobs as making America safer—and were willing to go to great lengths.” In statements to the committee in 2006, Porter Goss, the C.I.A. director who preceded Michael Hayden, described the interrogations as “not a brutality. It’s more of an art or a science.” The key, he said, was “knowing what makes someone tick.” He added, “Just the simplest thing will work, a family photograph or something.” In fact, as the report describes, C.I.A. officers threatened at least three detainees with harm to their family members. Other techniques included menacing a subject with a pistol and a cordless drill, and employing “rectal hydration,” which the chief of interrogations later characterized as a marker of “total control over a detainee.” Before one session with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the lead planner of the 9/11 attacks, who was subjected to waterboarding a hundred and eighty-three times, Bikowsky sent an e-mail that referred to him by a nickname: “Mukie is gonna be hatin’ life on this one.”","1657","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"According to the report, Bikowsky was the chief architect of the C.I.A.’s effort to justify its use of enhanced techniques. In February, 2007, she accompanied Hayden to testify before the Intelligence Committee. The former intelligence officer said that Bikowsky had come because “Hayden was new and didn’t know all the details. She had all the facts stuffed into her head. Unless you knew what questions to ask, she’d run circles around you.” Citing information that she said was obtained from the interrogation program, Bikowsky testified, “There’s no question, in my mind, that having that detainee information has saved hundreds, conservatively speaking, of American lives.” The report lists four major claims she made in the hearing, and provides evidence that all are inaccurate. It also asserts that Bikowsky misled the C.I.A. inspector general and other senior officials about the efficacy of the enhanced techniques. (The C.I.A. stands by all but one of Bikowsky’s claims, and says that her assertions about the techniques reflected a widespread understanding. A spokesman said, “The representations as to the value of the information derived from detainees subject to E.I.T.s”—enhanced interrogation techniques—“were representations made by the agency, not one individual. Suggestions to the contrary only serve to distort the record.”)","1658","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The argument over how Bikowsky should be identified in the report was particularly freighted. The main character in the movie “Zero Dark Thirty” was based partly on her, and she was the subject of a Wikipedia page. Still, the C.I.A. and the White House refused to allow a pseudonym for her. She has been promoted to a senior position in the global-jihad unit. “The C.I.A. does not hold people accountable the way I think it should,” Feinstein told me. “You want to support them if the wrong thing happens.” But, she added, that is different from supporting them “for doing wrong.”","1659","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On November 20th, McDonough went to a Senate Democratic Caucus meeting, in the Mansfield Room of the Capitol. He was there to brief senators on the President’s immigration policy, but he knew that Feinstein and her colleagues on the Intelligence Committee would want to discuss the torture report. Feinstein delivered a prepared speech, about ten minutes long. “She flat-out called out the White House and the C.I.A.,” the senior Senate staffer recalled. “Then Rockefeller, Wyden, Heinrich, and Udall spoke, and they really went after McDonough.” McDonough, according to the staffer, argued that the report would risk lives, pointing out that, while he had Secret Service protection, C.I.A. families did not. The Senate aide recalled that McDonough defended his impartiality. “He said, ‘Every time I go over to the C.I.A., they tell me I’m doing the Senate’s bidding, and I come over here and you guys tell me I’m doing the C.I.A.’s bidding,’ and neither is true. I’m trying to be an arbitrator.” For many, his protest rang hollow. “Denis and Brennan are very tight, and Denis thinks very highly of Brennan,” someone who knows McDonough well said. “I think whatever Brennan told him, Denis had reason, based on the personal relationship, to trust.” At the close of the meeting, McDonough made it clear that the White House would not allow the remaining, contested pseudonyms to be used, and, if the committee did not agree, the report would not come out.","1660","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The pseudonyms for the fourteen key people were deleted. Although Bikowsky was referred to in some places as the “deputy chief of Alec station,” in dozens of other spots any title for her was redacted. Robert Eatinger, the acting general counsel Feinstein mentioned in her floor speech, had all sixteen hundred mentions of his name redacted. It was a bitter defeat, but Feinstein feared that if the report was not released before the Republicans took control of the Senate, in January, 2015, it never would be. Some of her colleagues believed that the White House was deliberately running out the clock. “Obama participated in the slowdown process, and that’s a hard thing to forgive,” Rockefeller said.","1661","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On Friday, December 5th, Feinstein had the report sent to the printer, to be released after the weekend. Later that day, she got a call from Secretary of State John Kerry, a good friend. “He talked about the dangers this would cause around the world, which I saw as right out of the White House playbook—or the C.I.A. playbook,” Rockefeller said. Feinstein had heard this argument from McDonough and Brennan many times. But, Rockefeller said, “when it came from Kerry it had a more human sense to it. It got to her.” Rockefeller talked with her over the weekend. “The Kerry call actually turned out to be good, because it made her take her deepest values and square them one against the other—and she came out with the right answer. On Monday, she walked into her office and said, ‘I want the report out.’ ”","1662","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"During the weekend, the National Counterterrorism Center and other intelligence agencies issued a threat assessment, predicting that the report would inspire violence throughout the world and cause significant damage to U.S. relationships. But when the report was issued nothing happened. I asked Feinstein whether she found the threat assessment suspect at the time. “Well, what I thought was that it was a little bit of intimidation.” She paused. “Not a little bit. I thought it was just intimidation.”","1663","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On Tuesday, December 9, 2014, the day the report was released, the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security issued an unusual joint warning. That evening, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Feinstein, “Was it worth it to release this report today if, in fact, American lives, whether diplomats, military personnel, civilians, are going to be in danger?” Feinstein responded that there is “no perfect time to release this report,” and added, “I think you’ve done a good job, certainly, of hyping the warnings.” But Blitzer persevered, wondering if she would feel guilty if Americans were killed. “I couldn’t believe that,” Feinstein told me. “He asked me three times!”","1664","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Newspaper stories picked out startling details from the report, and the Times editorial board called for the prosecution of the “torturers and their bosses,” starting with former Vice-President Dick Cheney. But on the Sunday-morning television shows the C.I.A.’s defenders outnumbered its critics. “Several of us made a concerted decision that, if and when this came out, we weren’t going to take it,” John Rizzo, the agency’s former general counsel, who is named many times in the report, said. Planning for the counter-offensive had begun in the spring of 2014. McDonough insisted that former C.I.A. officials be allowed to read the report; Feinstein acquiesced. Thus, they had time to prepare their rebuttal and create a Web site, C.I.A. Saved Lives, before the release of the report. When Hayden read the report, he was furious about how he had been treated. Feinstein also singled him out in a floor speech the day the report was released, saying, of his initial briefing, in September, 2006, “He referred specifically to a ‘tummy slap,’ among other techniques, and presented the entire set of techniques as minimally harmful and applied in a highly clinical and professional manner. They were not.” Hayden and Rizzo became the point men on TV.","1665","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The former C.I.A. officials attacked the report as partisan. Feinstein had repeatedly tried to persuade the Republicans on the committee to rejoin the investigation, but they refused, and wrote a response to the report that was strikingly similar to the C.I.A.’s. (They also attacked the Senate staff for having taken the Panetta documents from the C.I.A. facility.) The former officials disputed the report’s evidence that the enhanced techniques had been ineffective. And they denounced the committee for conducting no interviews, relying instead on contemporaneous C.I.A. e-mails, documents, and internal interviews and investigations. The Justice Department had started an investigation of the detention program in August, 2009, and Panetta said that he would therefore not require C.I.A. personnel to speak to the committee. But Rizzo, who retired in 2009, said now that he would have been happy to talk. “I pounded that drum about the interviews every chance I got,” he told me.","1666","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The day after the report was released, McCain spoke at a Human Rights First dinner that honored him and Feinstein. “It’s been a tough day for Dianne—they rolled out the big guns,” he said. “I’m proud of her resilience.” General David Petraeus, the C.I.A. director who resigned in 2012, after an F.B.I. investigation discovered he was having an extramarital affair with his biographer, said in a video presentation that when he was military commander, in both Iraq and Afghanistan, “my view was that, if you want to get information from a detainee, the best way to do it is become his or her best friend.” He went on to say that Feinstein’s “leadership on this issue has been very important. She has of course spearheaded the entire effort to go back and look at what the practices were, to get these out into the open, to insure that we have learned everything that we can.”","1667","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Brennan responded to the report in a press conference at C.I.A. headquarters, in Langley—the first such conference to be televised live. Like Hayden and Rizzo, he criticized the report as “partisan” and “flawed.” He denied that the C.I.A. had misled the White House and Congress, arguing that detainees subjected to the enhanced techniques had provided valuable information, and that it was “unknowable” whether they would have done so under other circumstances. Most important, he refused to characterize the procedures as torture, or to say that they should not be used again. “I defer to the policymakers in future times,” he said. President Obama gave no speech of his own about the report, letting Brennan speak for the Administration.","1668","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On July 31st, the C.I.A. inspector general, David Buckley, released a summary of findings in the internal investigation he had started in January. He concluded that agency employees had acted improperly in accessing the computers and the e-mail of the committee staff, and that the crimes report that the C.I.A. had filed with the Justice Department was based on erroneous information.","1669","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Brennan, four months after his firm denials at the Council on Foreign Relations, apologized to Feinstein and Chambliss. He also said that he was appointing an accountability board, headed by the retired Democratic senator Evan Bayh, to review the situation. Feinstein pointed out that the report “confirmed what I said on the Senate floor in March,” but she also spoke of “positive first steps.”","1670","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Some of her colleagues weren’t ready to abandon the fight. Senator Carl Levin demanded that Brennan explain his earlier denial, and Udall and Heinrich called for his resignation. Even Chambliss found the situation “very, very serious.” During a White House news conference the next day, Obama made his most forthright acknowledgment yet of the substance of the report: “When we engaged in some of these enhanced interrogation techniques, techniques that I believe and I think any fair-minded person would believe were torture, we crossed a line.” But he emphasized his “full confidence” in Brennan: “Keep in mind—John Brennan called for that I.G. report.”","1671","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"When Obama came into office, he wanted to heal the breach between Congress and the C.I.A. that had developed during the Bush Administration. Yet the agency’s relationship with Congress had grown only more fraught. Senator Harry Reid had stopped taking his intelligence briefings from Brennan. As Majority Leader, Reid regularly got calls from the White House asking him to assume onerous legislative tasks; now he made a preëmptive move. “He called Denis McDonough and said, ‘I told Brennan back in January what he should do!’ ” the senior Senate staffer recalled. “ ‘Don’t call me on this—I’m not defending him. I’m not going to undermine Dianne Feinstein. You have done nothing but obstruct this report.’ ” When Reid had a similar conversation with the President, the staffer said, “the President tried to justify what the C.I.A. had done, saying the staff had gotten the Panetta review, and the C.I.A. had no choice.”","1672","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Brennan’s predicament was resolved six months later. In mid-January, 2015, the accountability board dismissed Buckley’s conclusion that the officers who searched the Senate computers had acted improperly. On the contrary, the board said, there was no “common understanding” between the committee and the agency about access to the Senate staff’s computers—only an “informal” one. And the board concluded that concerns about the Panetta review justified the search. It confirmed that Brennan had conveyed “explicit instructions” on three occasions to find out whether Senate staff members had accessed the Panetta review. But, it continued, “a misunderstanding between the D/CIA and [redacted] arose because the former did not appreciate what forensic techniques were necessary to answer his questions and the latter did not understand the D/CIA’s expectations that no intrusive methods be employed.”","1673","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"John Rizzo told me that this accountability board was different from any he had seen during three decades at the agency. Boards were often formed to follow up on an inspector general’s report and recommend disciplinary action for those who had acted improperly. Here the board discredited the inspector general. “I was surprised they came out as hard as they did on Buckley,” Rizzo said. (In January, Buckley left the agency.) “It was a surprise to me, too, that they didn’t mete out discipline. I thought it was a given, especially considering that Brennan went and apologized to Feinstein.” Why did he think no one was disciplined? Rizzo laughed. “From reading the board’s report, it appears that John Brennan himself was the one. He said, basically, pull out all the stops. So how do you hold subordinates liable for something like that?”","1674","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On the day the board issued its findings, shortly after the Republicans took control of the Senate, the new chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Richard Burr, wrote to Obama, asking that all copies of the complete torture report that Feinstein had sent to the White House and other parts of the executive branch, including the Departments of State, Justice, and Defense, be returned. (Burr was apparently concerned that the report would become publicly available under the Freedom of Information Act.) Feinstein, now the vice-chair, wrote to Obama, strongly opposing the request. Several weeks later, the Administration pledged that it would not destroy or return copies without permission from the courts. Regarding Burr’s letter, the former C.I.A. officer said, “That is thinking like the agency does! If there is a report that was mistaken or flawed, you pull it out from the computers completely.” Burr said that he also intended to give the Panetta-review documents, still in the committee safe, back to the C.I.A. When I asked Feinstein about Burr’s attempt to claw back the report, she said, “I was surprised, and somewhat suspicious about who put him up to it.”","1675","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Brennan had prevailed, in a way that had seemed highly unlikely six months earlier. “John was able to wend his way through a minefield,” his old friend Grenier said. Brennan’s relations with Democrats on the Intelligence Committee remain hostile. In May, Wyden, Heinrich, and Senator Mazie Hirono sent Brennan a letter, demanding he acknowledge that the computer search was improper and affirm that it would not happen again. His statements after the report’s release continue to resonate. “It surprised me that he wouldn’t use the word ‘torture,’ ” the former intelligence officer said. “I know he needs to defend the agency to have credibility there—but he has exceeded that.” In the years since 9/11, the former officer continued, “the C.I.A. has done remarkable things and reprehensible things. I think the way the agency went on the offensive after 9/11 surprised Al Qaeda, and ninety per cent of what it did was right on track. But what was done with those two psychologists and the interrogations—the agency lost its sense of where the edge was, and went over it. The report really is important. In the future, if the C.I.A. faces a situation where it comes to the edge, hopefully it will know to go back—and understand that it cannot do anything.”","1676","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"As for Feinstein, the officer continued, “She was a serious overseer, knowledgeable, interested in the work. She was really hard-nosed on targeted killings—and someone who was a quasi liberal from California. She was such an important asset, for the C.I.A.” Listening to Feinstein’s speech last March, he said, “I thought, for the agency to lose that is horrifying.”","1677","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"One day in early March, I met with Feinstein and several staff members in her office in the Hart Building. A large, vividly detailed painting of landscapes in Nepal, which she and Blum had visited on one of their early trips, hung behind her desk. When I told Feinstein what the former intelligence officer had said about her, she smiled and said, “That’s nice to know. See, you don’t hear this. That’s for sure.” She continued, “It’s a lonely place. And it’s a lonely place for my staff, because they get beaten up.” It appears that Burr and other Republicans may still try to punish the staff for taking the Panetta documents back to the Hart Building, even as Feinstein has said that removing the documents was justified by the committee’s oversight responsibility. Alissa Starzak, who worked on the report before leaving the committee, in 2011, was nominated last July to be general counsel of the U.S. Army. Her confirmation was slowed by Republicans angry about her role in the report; Burr has said that he is striving to keep her from getting confirmed. Feinstein and Chambliss, who has retired, worked well together. No one would say that about Feinstein and Burr. “Some people around here look at oversight as being the best buddy, and always supporting them, no matter what,” Feinstein said. “That isn’t oversight. Oversight can’t just be going to a hearing and listening to what somebody says, when you don’t know whether they’re telling you the truth or not.” After all, she noted, “part of the C.I.A. tradecraft is deception.”","1678","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"It was almost a year since Feinstein had given her speech on the Senate floor. I asked why Brennan chose the course he did. “It’s the protection of the brotherhood, at the C.I.A.—you protect me and I protect you,” Feinstein said. “And Brennan wanted to destroy the report. In my view, the beauty and the strength of this country—what makes it so different—is that we admit our mistakes and we go on. And it’s tough.”","1679","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Some have hoped that Feinstein’s experience with the torture report might lead her to view intelligence agencies more skeptically. There is little sign of that. In a recent speech, she reflected on her tenure as chairman of the Intelligence Committee and said that she would change only one thing: “I would hold more open hearings.” She is as confident as ever about the ethics of the targeted-killings program. “This is good oversight,” she told me. “The staff team has made fifty-nine visits to see the real-time operations of the Predator, the intelligence, the training. We stay on top of it. And the collateral damage—it’s classified, believe it or not, but the numbers are very good.” (After the recent announcement that two hostages were killed in a drone strike in Pakistan, Feinstein renewed her call for a public annual report on the number of combatant and civilian deaths from these strikes.) And she remains a champion of the N.S.A. and its call-records program, still objecting even to the term “surveillance.” Two independent panels concluded that the program has never been crucial in any terrorism-related investigation. But Feinstein continues to justify it, referring to the case of Najibullah Zazi, who pleaded guilty to plotting suicide-bombing attacks in the New York City subways in 2009. “What is that worth, saving subway cars stuffed to the gunwales with people?” she demanded.","1680","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"With the torture report, Feinstein abandoned her long-standing allies in the intelligence community. She defended her work by emphasizing its thoroughness; she has noted, with pride, that the Senate historian told her it was the longest report a committee had ever produced. When she was attacked, she said, repeatedly, “Read the report!” That was her hashtag as she took to Twitter to fact-check Brennan, during his televised press conference. Now she told me, “We sent out this big report to those departments that should care. But I am disappointed, because I suspect that not very many people have looked at it.” The public seemed uninterested, too. A poll conducted by the Washington Post and ABC News after the report’s release found that fifty-nine per cent of Americans supported the C.I.A.’s use of the coercive methods—slightly more than before. Elisa Massimino, the chief executive of Human Rights First, faulted the President for the fact: “Obama hasn’t provided the leadership we would expect from somebody who set this out as a priority issue. I think his job is to lead the country to a stronger consensus that we don’t want to do this again, and he failed at that.”","1681","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"After the report was released, Feinstein sent Obama a letter with her recommendations. Probably the most important was passing legislation to close the loopholes that had made torture possible, and to build on the executive order that Obama issued in January, 2009. (Without legislation, another President could reverse that order.) In this year’s State of the Union address, Obama said, “There’s one last pillar of our leadership, and that’s the example of our values. As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we’re threatened, which is why I have prohibited torture.” But the President has given no sign that he has any interest in Feinstein’s recommendations, even as she and McCain recently introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would permanently ban the enhanced techniques. I asked her whether she was disappointed in Obama’s lack of support for the torture report. She paused, and replied, “Well, let me say that there are people who don’t want to look at the whole truth. And I don’t know whether the President read our report or not. I certainly haven’t heard from him since.” ♦","1682","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On Thursday, some of Hillary Clinton’s top campaign officials held a briefing for about three dozen members of the 2016 hack pack. Their message was a positive one. “The view inside the campaign is that voters are concerned about kitchen-table issues Clinton wants to talk about, rather than media reports and Republican attacks on the [Clinton] foundation, the officials said,” Vox’s Jonathan Allen reported. “There’s no conflict between her promise to represent ‘everyday Americans’ and the access big donors have had to Clinton and her husband over the years, they said, arguing that voters will trust her to represent them in the White House.”","May 29, 2015","1683","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"

"The entry into the Democratic contest by Bernie Sanders was welcome from a Clintonite perspective, because it filled a potentially dangerous vacuum. With his long record of service to progressive causes, Sanders is popular enough to garner a decent-sized following among liberal Democrats, but he’s almost certainly too far to the left to represent a serious threat to Hillary. So far, at least, his presence has been more of a problem for Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who is set to officially announce his candidacy on Saturday. As I noted back in March, O’Malley is a serious figure who demands some respect. As governor, he eliminated the death penalty, legalized gay marriage, and championed various good-government initiatives. But with Sanders already out there on the stump, O’Malley has struggled to gain traction.","1685","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"A new poll of likely Democratic voters conducted by Quinnipiac University illustrates the scale of the task that is facing Clinton’s challengers. The survey, which was carried out from May 19th to May 26th, showed her getting fifty-seven per cent of the vote. Sanders was in second place, with fifteen per cent. O’Malley got just one per cent, and so did two other possible candidates, Jim Webb, a former U.S. senator from Virginia, and Lincoln Chafee, a former governor and U.S. senator from Rhode Island. Of course, it is early in the process, and anything could happen between now and the end of the primaries. At this stage, though, Clinton is sitting pretty.","1686","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"Something similar, if somewhat less definitive, could be said of her position vis-à-vis her potential Republican opponents. Opinion polls positing head-to-head matchups with likely G.O.P. candidates have consistently shown Clinton winning, and the Quinnipiac survey was no exception. It showed her with double-digit leads over Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, two of the Republican front-runners. Interestingly, the closest hypothetical contests were with Rand Paul, the libertarian senator from Kentucky, and Florida senator Marco Rubio, whom some in the Clinton camp have reportedly identified as her biggest potential threat. Clinton’s leads over both Paul and Rubio were four points.","1687","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"The Quinnipiac poll also contained some valuable clues as to how Clinton has been able, so far, to navigate all of the negative media coverage she has received while sustaining relatively little damage to her overall polling numbers. In terms of the level of personal trust that voters have in Clinton, the drip-drip-drip of stories does seem to be having an effect. Fifty-three per cent of respondents to the Quinnipiac survey said that they do not consider her to be “honest and trustworthy,” while only thirty-nine per cent said that they did. Among self-identified Independents, the numbers were even more lopsided: sixty-one per cent to thirty-one per cent.","1688","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"The number of people who question Clinton’s trustworthiness must be of concern to her team, and it’s a figure that Republican ad-makers and opposition-research shops will be seeking to increase. But this issue needs to be weighed against the fact that Presidential elections are about leadership—and most Americans think of Clinton as an experienced and strong leader. One of the survey questions asked, “Would you say that Hillary Clinton has strong leadership qualities or not?” Sixty per cent of respondents said yes, and thirty-seven per cent said no. Among Independents, fifty-eight per cent answered yes, and thirty-eight per cent said no.","1689","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"These findings suggest that voters are more sophisticated than they are sometimes given credit for. Rather than looking at politicians in black-and-white terms, they are able to size up candidates’ strengths and weaknesses, and to reach an over-all view based on what they are looking for in a leader. At a time when the world seems like an increasingly dangerous place and a majority of Americans believe that the country is on the wrong track, perceived strength and decisiveness may well count for a great deal. “Can you get low marks on honesty and still be a strong leader?” said Tim Malloy, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll, in a news release. “Sure you can.

If an agreement eventually emerges, both parties will have to sell it to constituencies that remain skeptical because of the even more tortured history between the two countries—spanning six decades and including a coup, terrorist attacks, assassinations, the shooting down of a passenger aircraft, covert operations, nuclear sabotage, and hostage dramas. Privately, the American and Iranian delegations have mused, more than once, over which government was taking the bigger risk, or was going to pay a bigger price, for the nuclear diplomacy.","1693","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-nuclear-deals-adversaries-back-home"
"In recent weeks, Washington has echoed with appeals to President Obama—by both Republicans and Democrats—to abandon diplomacy. “Walking away from a bad deal at this point would take courage, but it would be the best thing for the United States, the region, and the world,” the Tennessee Republican Bob Corker, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Obama, on June 15th. “No one trusts Iran,” he said on “Face the Nation,” on Sunday. “The type of agreement that has been reached certainly is one that is more to their benefit than it is the rest of the world.” Other Republicans have warned of diplomatic desperation and capitulation.

The recently extended deadline—to July 7th—was timed to the new law. If the deal, a lengthy document with many annexes, were submitted by July 9th, Congress would have only thirty days for review. If submitted afterward, Congress will get sixty days—doubling the time for opponents to lobby against it.","1697","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-nuclear-deals-adversaries-back-home"
"The broader concern in Washington has been that the deal would do too little and give up too much. A bipartisan group organized by the Washington Institute, a pro-Israeli think tank, warned, in a public statement, that the deal would not completely dismantle Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.

"Judging from the plethora of theories purporting to explain the utterly unanticipated victory of David Cameron’s Tories in the British general election, the result was wildly overdetermined. There’s the Shy Tory Theory: people don’t want to admit to inquiring strangers, such as pollsters, that they’re voting Conservative because they’re afraid of being thought of as selfish bastards who hate taxes more than they love their fellow man. There’s the Wallace Theory: the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, looked too much like Gromit’s human housemate and struck people as somehow odd or weird. Relatedly, there’s the Wrong Miliband Theory: Labour should have gone with Ed’s smoother, less Gromit-like older brother David, who had been Gordon Brown’s foreign minister and is now self-exiled to New York as president of the International Rescue Committee. There’s the Fundamentals Theory: the British economy has been doing a bit better lately, and good economic news always benefits incumbents. There’s the Keynes Theory, a.k.a. the Cassidy Corollary: the Labour Party accepted the premises of austerity and totally failed to educate the public in the well-established truth that budget deficits are a positive in times of high unemployment, falling demand, and low interest rates, thereby allowing itself to be portrayed as the party of un-paid-for government handouts and fiscal irresponsibility. (Barack Obama was guilty of the same failure in 2009, thereby helping to precipitate the Republican sweep of the 2010 midterms.) There’s the Clashing Nationalisms Theory: alarmed at the rise of the Scottish National Party and the prospect of a Labour-S.N.P. coalition that might accelerate the breakup of the United Kingdom, English voters stampeded rightward.

"The fondest dream of the Liberal Democrats has long been to bring European-style electoral reform to the parliament of the United Kingdom. For this perpetual third party, proportional representation was the Holy Grail that would win them a share of seats consonant with their popular support. By the turn of the twenty-first century they had reason to be hopeful. All of the new British legislative institutions created in recent decades—the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh National Assembly, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the U.K. delegation to the European Parliament—are elected by one or another variant of P.R. Westminster was the last British holdout of “First Past the Post,” the ancient single-member-district, plurality-winner-take-all system still used mainly in certain former British colonies, such as Canada, India, and the United States.","1712","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/misrule-britannia-the-u-k-s-screwed-up-election"
"The 2010 election finally produced the rare phenomenon the Liberal Democrats spent decades praying for: a “hung Parliament.” Since neither the Conservatives nor Labour had captured a majority of seats, the Lib Dems held the balance of power. Their center-center-left orientation notwithstanding, they decided to ally with the Tories, entering Her Majesty’s Government for the first time since 1922. The fresh-faced young leaders of the new coalition, the Tories’ David Cameron and the Lib Dems’ Nick Clegg, became prime minister and deputy prime minister respectively. They announced their partnership—their bromance!—in a joyful press conference in the garden of 10 Downing Street.","1713","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/misrule-britannia-the-u-k-s-screwed-up-election"
"The Lib Dems had a number of reasons for their decision, but the biggest was that the Tories agreed to hold a referendum on replacing “First Past the Post” with what Brits call the “Alternative Vote.” Under A.V., the voter numbers the candidates in order of preference. If no candidate gets an outright majority of first choices, then second choices—and, if necessary, third and fourth choices—are counted until somebody goes over fifty per cent plus one. (As it happens, this is how some of the groovier American cities, such as San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, and Minneapolis, elect their mayors. It’s also how the Academy picks the Oscar for Best Picture. The stateside name for it is instant-runoff or ranked-choice voting.)","1714","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/misrule-britannia-the-u-k-s-screwed-up-election"
"If you’re a P.R. fan, A.V. isn’t ideal. It’s still a one-winner-take-all system. It doesn’t allocate seats proportionately, so there’s no guarantee that a party that is the first choice of, say, one-fourth of the national electorate will end up with anything close to one-fourth of the national legislature.

"Still, A.V. has some formidable advantages compared to F.P.T.P. It allows you to vote for the party or candidate you genuinely prefer without penalizing the one you’d settle for (the dreaded Nader Effect). It discourages scorched-earth negative campaigning, because candidates want your second preference if they can’t get your first. It broadens “the conversation.” It confers greater democratic legitimacy, because the ultimate winner is at least acceptable to a majority.

Since you, dear reader, are the kind of person who stuck with me this deep into this wonky post, it’s a cinch you’re also the kind of person who would have voted Yes. Among the Yes supporters were the editorialists of the Guardian, the Independent, the Financial Times, and the Daily Mirror. Yes had all the best celebrities: Billy Bragg, Helena Bonham Carter, John Cleese, Steve Coogan, Colin Firth, Stephen Fry, Eddie Izzard, Joanna Lumley, Vivienne Westwood … plus a whole slew of Anglican bishops and other worthies.

"Everything, apparently. The Conservatives had been clear from the beginning that their official position would be No, but they had encouraged the Lib Dems to delude themselves that their opposition would be pro forma. Instead, even though a few prominent Tories urged a Yes, the entire Conservative infrastructure mobilized for No. The right-wing press—the Daily Express, the Telegraph, and Murdoch’s Sun and Times went all out. Labour was officially neutral, and, although Ed Miliband and many other Labour politicians plumped for Yes, the majority of Labour members of Parliament ended up in the No camp. They were joined by masses of Labour voters, who wanted to punish the Lib Dems in general for making Cameron prime minister and Clegg in particular for going along with sharp rises in university tuition fees. Old-school lefties hated the prospect that Labour candidates might have to depend for their election on the second preferences of Lib Dem voters, even if that would produce more Labour MPs. Better, in their view, to have a “pure” Labour government once in a blue moon than a necessarily more moderate Labour-Lib Dem alliance on a much more frequent basis.","1718","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/misrule-britannia-the-u-k-s-screwed-up-election"
"The referendum lost and lost big. The margin was two to one against A.V.—a ghastly humiliation for the Lib Dems, making them objects of near-universal contempt. At that point, they were trapped in a vortex of doom. Their plummeting popularity made it impossible for them to withdraw from the coalition and force a snap election. For the next four years, they were slowly smothered by the Tory embrace.

On social issues, especially marriage equality, their clout sufficed to allow the government to compile a sterling record. Their reward on May 7th was utter devastation. They lost all but eight of their fifty-six members of the House of Commons. Seats-wise, they aren’t even the U.K.’s third party any more. They’re tied for fourth with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, Ian Paisley’s old right-wing redoubt.","1720","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/misrule-britannia-the-u-k-s-screwed-up-election"
"The Lib Dem collapse, set in motion by the defeat of A.V., is a synecdoche. It is part of a larger story: the frequent inability of single-seat, plurality-winner-take-all electoral arrangements to insure acceptably democratic, acceptably representative outcomes, especially in a non-two-party environment. Among other flaws, it hugely rewards smaller parties if they’re narrowly regional and mercilessly punishes them if they’re broadly national.","1721","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/misrule-britannia-the-u-k-s-screwed-up-election"
"The only bright spot in all this is that electoral reform, which had been pronounced dead after the failure of the A.V. referendum, is suddenly showing signs of life again. The unrepresentative nature of F.P.T.P. has never been more glaringly obvious. The Tories won an outright parliamentary majority with just 36.9 per cent of the popular vote, up a few tenths of a percentage point from 2010. This is identical with Alf Landon’s showing in the 1936 U.S. Presidential election and worse than George McGovern’s in 1972. The Democratic Unionists got their eight seats with fewer than two hundred thousand votes; it took the Lib Dems thirteen times that many to eke out their eight. The new kid on the right-wing block, the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), which actually beat the Lib Dems in the popular vote, snagged just one seat. That’s a voter-to-seat ratio of 3,881,129 to one. The Labour Party’s ratio was 40,277 to one; the Tories’, 34,244 to one; the S.N.P.’s, 25,972 to one.

"Six days after formally entering the 2016 Presidential race, Senator Bernie Sanders is having some time of it. After attracting overflow crowds at a number of stops in Iowa late last week, Sanders moved on to Minnesota on Sunday, where he appeared at the Minneapolis American Indian Center and declared, “Our country belongs to all of our people and not just a handful of billionaires.” According to a report in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, about three thousand people turned out. A local television station estimated the number of attendees at four thousand.","June 1, 2015","1725","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"Whatever the exact number was, the seventy-three-year-old from Vermont appears to be attracting bigger crowds than any other candidate, Democrat or Republican. With one recent national survey finding that fifteen per cent of likely Democratic voters support him, and a new Des Moines Register poll showing him picking up sixteen per cent of the Democratic vote in Iowa, the media is starting to accord him some serious attention. The Times, having initially failed to report Sanders’s formal announcement of his candidacy in its print edition, ran a front-page story on Friday about his appeal to senior citizens, and another piece over the weekend about the enthusiastic reception he was receiving in Iowa. Before speaking in Minneapolis on Sunday, Sanders appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” where he highlighted the “grotesque level of income and wealth inequality” in the U.S. and said, “I think we need a political revolution in this country.”","1726","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"To be sure, not all of the Sanders coverage has been helpful to his campaign. Last week, Mother Jones, as an accompaniment to an interesting piece about his early years in left-wing politics, reprinted an article he wrote in 1972 for an alternative newspaper called the Vermont Freeman, the subject of which was male and female power relations, and sexual fantasies. One line in particular got quite a bit of media attention, including an explainer by NPR’s Danielle Kurtzleben. “A woman enjoys intercourse with her man—as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously,” Sanders wrote. On “Meet the Press,” the host, Chuck Todd, asked the senator about the piece. Sanders described it as fiction, adding, “It was dealing with gender stereotypes, why some men like to oppress women, why other women like to be submissive. You know, something like ‘Fifty Shades of Grey.’ Very poorly written, forty-three years ago.”","1727","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"While it is embarrassing to Sanders, the flap about his literary effort, which he wrote while trying to get by as a carpenter and freelance journalist, seems unlikely to have much lasting effect on his campaign. That’s partly because Sanders’s run for the White House isn’t based on his personal character, or even his record as a mayor, congressman, and U.S. senator. Sanders is running for a cause—a resurgent progressivism that was conceived during decades of wage stagnation and rising inequality, born during the great financial crisis of 2008, and announced on the political stage by the street protests of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the widespread public support they engendered.","1728","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"Of course, many candidates claim that their campaigns aren’t about them but about something larger. But when Sanders uses this line, which he does all the time, he is merely stating a fact. Before he entered the 2016 race, the new progressivism was a cause in search of a candidate. After Senator Elizabeth Warren refused to step up and run, Sanders seized his chance, and he is now getting his reward. In a contest dominated by a consummate insider with strong ties to the moneyed élite, many disaffected Democrats are embracing him as an underdog and an outsider. During a general election, almost all of Sanders’s supporters would vote for Clinton over Jeb Bush or any other Republican, but, right now, his presence in the primary gives them the opportunity to raise a rumpus, and to try to pull the party in a liberal direction.","1729","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"As the campaign progresses, it will be fascinating to see how far this effort succeeds. Already, Clinton has shifted her stance on immigration reform and the criminal-justice system.

"Although each of these policy proposals is important in its own right, neither would cost the Democratic Party’s donor class any money. The political test for Clinton will come in the area of economic policy, where Sanders has put out a comprehensive and, by American standards, quite radical manifesto. It includes reforming the tax code to make the rich pay more, raising the federal minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour, reforming trade policies, breaking up the big banks, and turning Medicare into a public health-care system for Americans of all ages.","1731","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"When Sanders unveiled this plan last December, I pointed out that it isn’t all at variance with the policies of the Clinton-Obama wing of the party. Virtually all Democrats support raising the minimum wage and eliminating some of the tax breaks for the rich, for instance. In these areas, and others, Clinton should be able to find common ground with progressives. But the question remains: In positioning herself as a battler for the middle class, how far to the left will she go?","1732","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"We may get some clues on June 13th, when she speaks at Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park, on Roosevelt Island. In a note to reporters on Monday, a campaign official said that Clinton would “lay out her view of the challenges facing this country and her vision and ideas for moving the country forward.” As I wrote on Friday, Clinton has made a strong start in the opinion polls, with her approval ratings largely withstanding the barrage of stories about deleted e-mails and the finances of the Clinton Foundation. But with Sanders and Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, now officially in the race, the dynamics are changing. Although neither of Clinton’s challengers is known as a political cutthroat, both will look to knock holes in Clinton’s record, and to draw contrasts with their own policy positions.","1733","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"

"If you’re following the 2016 Presidential campaign closely (and, at this early stage, I’m not suggesting that’s necessary), you’ll find an interesting subplot. While much of the media is focussing on the rise of Donald Trump and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders, the two pre-race favorites, Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, are continuing to focus on each other. At the start of this week, the Clinton campaign put out a video highlighting what it said were Bush’s “extreme ideas about immigration” and claiming that he was following Trump’s lead. On Thursday, the Bush campaign released a video highlighting Clinton’s e-mail travails and promoting Bush’s upcoming e-book, ”Reply All,” which will contain some of the e-mail exchanges he had when he was the governor of Florida.","August 27, 2015","1735","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"It’s pretty clear what’s going on here. The seasoned operatives running both campaigns are operating on the assumption that, six or seven months from now, Jeb and Hillary will both be on their way to securing the nominations of their respective parties, after which they will face each other in a general election. The Trump tornado will have blown itself out. Sanders will have maxed out his support among progressive Democrats. Order will have been restored, and it will be Bush versus Clinton, after all.","1736","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"On the Democratic side, arguably, this strategy of playing a long game makes sense. Clinton, despite recent slippages—notably in New Hampshire, where two successive surveys have shown Sanders ahead of her—retains a big lead in the national polls. For example, a Quinnipiac University survey of likely Democratic voters released on Thursday showed Clinton at forty-five per cent and Sanders at twenty-two per cent.","1737","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"As my colleague Ryan Lizza pointed out in a post arguing that Vice-President Joe Biden can’t win the nomination, Clinton also has the support of a majority of elected Democrats, which, in the past, has been a good predictor of success. I’m a bit less convinced than Ryan that a Biden campaign would be a no-hoper. In the Quinnipiac poll, he came in third, at eighteen per cent—not bad for someone who isn’t even a candidate yet. But there is no doubt that, right now, Clinton is the strong favorite. Most British bookmakers, where people wager real money on these things, have the odds of her getting the nomination at one to three or one to four. This implies that bettors put the probability that Clinton will prevail at seventy-five or eighty per cent.","1738","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Bush’s campaign, on the other hand, appears to be in free fall. His poll numbers are tanking, his message is blurred, his verbal stumbles are multiplying, and his money men are reportedly getting nervous. In the betting market, he remains the favorite to get the G.O.P. nomination, but at some of the sites his odds have slipped to seven to four, which implies that the probability of his winning is about a third. Rather than worrying about Clinton, Bush and his strategists desperately need to find a way for him to counter his Republican rivals—not just Trump, whose whirlwind campaign would be difficult for any regular politician to deal with, but Marco Rubio, John Kasich, and Carly Fiorina, any of whom could conceivably end up supplanting him as the moderate conservative candidate. (I use “moderate” in a relative sense. All of the G.O.P. candidates, Bush included, are solidly on the right.)","1739","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Until Memorial Day, when Trump wasn’t yet in the race, Bush was polling in the mid-teens—enough to keep him in or close to the lead. The new Quinnipiac poll has him at seven per cent, sharing third place with Rubio and Cruz. That’s just one survey, of course, but the Real Clear Politics poll average also shows him dropping into single figures, at 9.8 per cent. And it’s not just the national polls that are bringing bad tidings. In Iowa, Bush is tied, with Rubio, for sixth place—yes, sixth—behind Trump, Ben Carson, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, and Fiorina. In New Hampshire, he is in third place: Kasich, who is making a big effort there, has moved ahead of him (with both of them well behind Trump). In South Carolina, too, Bush is in third place, behind Trump and Carson. Based on these numbers, it appears that he could fail to win any of the first three primaries, leaving him acutely vulnerable going into the Nevada caucus and Super Tuesday.","1740","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Of course, these numbers will change over the next few months. But they are unlikely to move in Bush’s favor unless he hones his message and stops tripping over himself. What does he stand for? Going into the campaign, it seemed pretty straightforward: competence, conservative economics, and a shift toward the center on immigration and other social issues. But in none of these areas has he really delivered. His verbal clangers have made him look like a gentleman amateur, rather than a seasoned politician capable of taking down a Clinton or a Biden. Beyond some sunny rhetoric about boosting the G.D.P. growth rate to four per cent a year, his economic plan remains largely undefined.","1741","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Perhaps most alarming of all, Bush seems unsure whether he truly represents a break with the xenophobic, homophobic, modernity-loathing wing of the Republican Party. He has allowed Kasich, in particular, to position himself as a plausible, electable alternative. (One telling example: while Bush is running away from the Common Core education standards, which he previously backed, and which many conservative Republican activists hate, Kasich is still supporting them.)","1742","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Meanwhile, the gaffes keep coming. Every week, it seems, Bush or a member of his staff has to try to walk back one of his public comments. Most recently, he suggested, after using the term “anchor babies,” that he was referring not to children born in the United States to Hispanic parents but to those born to Asian parents. That hop from the frying pan into the fire allowed Trump, of all people, to accuse him of being offensive. And it’s not merely that Bush appears to have inherited the family weakness for malapropisms. He seems incapable of saying anything snappy or memorable. With Trump regularly tearing him to shreds in interviews and on Twitter, the best he can manage in response are statements like “Mr. Trump doesn’t have a proven conservative record.”","1743","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"As long as Trump’s campaign seemed likely to fade quickly, staying above the fray was a defensible strategy. It jibed with the old edict “Never wrestle with a pig. You get dirty and, besides, the pig likes it.” But things have moved on, and it’s clear that Trump isn’t going away anytime soon. Moreover, Trump is a typical bully, and so, as long as he senses weakness on Bush’s part, he will continue to torment him with comments like “Jeb Bush is a low-energy person,” or, as he put it in Alabama last weekend, “a very, very low-energy person.”","1744","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Surely, it is time for Bush to strike back—not merely to defend himself but to speak on behalf of his party, which, as George Will warned on Wednesday, in the Washington Post, sees its chances of winning the White House retreat with “every sulfurous belch from the molten interior of the volcanic Trump phenomenon.”","1745","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"But wait, you may ask, hasn’t Bush already tried that? He has. On Monday, he went to Texas to denounce Trump’s heartless and impractical immigration plan. We saw how well that went; it was the site of his attempted clarification about “anchor babies.” The next morning, Judy Chu, the California representative who heads the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said that Bush’s comments demonstrated that he was “not fit for the Presidency.”","1746","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Days before Donald Trump helped draw twenty-four million viewers to Fox for the first Republican Presidential primary debate, Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, took to YouTube for a new-media gambit. Broadcasting from a drab Washington, D.C., apartment, the Brooklyn-bred Democratic candidate delivered a fifteen-minute speech, which was screened for a hundred thousand fans at gatherings around the country. Among the venues registered on the Sanders Web site: “a GMO-free restaurant in the same parking lot as Sapphires Strip Club” (Las Vegas, Nevada), “My Home in the Woods” (Burton, Ohio), and the “Schatsky Family Household” (New York, New York).","1747","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/enter-sandman"

Those assembled in the living room “to channel our support for Bernie into concrete actions,” per Schatsky’s invite, did not include his parents, the relational psychologist Susan Bodnar and the research strategist David Schatsky. “Ronen just kind of told us he was doing this,” his mother had said earlier, over the phone. The apartment, according to an article called “Teach Your Parents Well,” in Dwell, had been eco-fitted at the behest of Ronen and his sister, when they were eight and five. “I just said they should do a sustainable apartment, and they hired an architect,” said Ronen, who will attend the University of Chicago, after a gap year spent farming in Europe and hiking the Appalachian Trail.","1748","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/enter-sandman"

Something that fits very snug, but you know it’s going to stretch over the years and get comfortable and lived-in.

"On Thursday, while the political world was focussed on the Supreme Court’s Obamacare ruling, two polls came out showing Bernie Sanders making up ground on Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire and Iowa. In a survey carried out by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center for CNN and the Manchester-based WMUR TV, Clinton was leading Sanders by just eight percentage points: forty-three per cent to thirty-five per cent. Meanwhile, a poll carried out in Iowa for Bloomberg found that Sanders now has the support of about a quarter of likely Democratic voters, by far his strongest showing yet in the state that will be the first to vote in the Democratic primary. “It’s tremendous progress that he is making with voters in the first two states,” Tad Devine, Sanders’s chief political strategist, told Bloomberg’s John McCormick. “It’s something we felt on the ground.”","June 26, 2015","1758","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"At this stage, it’s necessary to issue a few qualifiers.","1759","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"First, it’s not July 4th yet, and there are still seven months until the 2016 primaries begin. At this early stage, opinion polls bounce around quite a bit, and no single survey should be accorded very much weight. Second, Clinton is trouncing Sanders in the national polls. Third, even in the early primary states she still has a big advantage. In Iowa, Sanders has yet to come within twenty-five points of her in any poll, and in New Hampshire a separate Bloomberg survey found that she retains a much bigger lead than the CNN/WMUR survey suggested: twenty-six points. “Clinton remains enormously well-known and well-liked in New Hampshire, a state she won before,” Doug Usher, of Purple Strategies, the research firm that carried out Bloomberg’s New Hampshire poll, said. “She benefits from a gender gap in a primary that will be disproportionately female, and even Sanders’s voters admit Clinton is likely the nominee.”","1760","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"So there’s no need for panic in the Clinton camp, which has adopted the public position that it expected a competitive primary all along. But for Sanders, and for Democrats who would like an alternative to Clinton, the signs are encouraging. The seventy-three-year-old Vermont senator is clearly enjoying himself, hurtling around the country, drawing large crowds, and promoting his progressive agenda. In the past few days, for instance, he has welcomed Pope Francis’s encyclical on climate change, criticized Congress for granting President Obama fast-track authority to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and reiterated his call to expand Medicare into a national health-care system for everyone.","1761","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"As Sanders promised when he started out, he isn’t criticizing Clinton directly. But he is seeking to draw a contrast between his clear positions on such issues as trade with his opponent’s nuanced statements. And he’s insisting he’s in it to win. Speaking to David Corn, of Mother Jones, Devine explained that Sanders’s strategy is based on raising enough money—forty or fifty million dollars—to advertise in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, and he claimed that, thanks to lots of small donations, this strategy is working so far. “I don’t know if we can outright beat her in Iowa and New Hampshire,” Devine said, “but we have a real shot at it in both places.”","1762","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"That may be stretching things. Still, if Sanders keeps gaining, he will certainly have the capacity to disrupt some of the Clinton campaign’s carefully laid plans. Should they go after Bernie? Should they ignore him? Something in the middle? Up until now, the Clintonites have been running a professional and highly scripted operation that has achieved most of its initial goals, but that sometimes resembles painting by numbers. Clinton has the money, the infrastructure, and the support from other prominent Democrats that Sanders lacks, but the Vermont senator has advantages, too: enthusiasm at the grassroots, the flexibility that comes with being a one-man band, and the ability to position himself as a scrappy underdog and outsider.","1763","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"“You can make the case that a certain amount of Bernie Sanders’s support is a protest vote, but there’s more to it than that,” J. Ann Selzer, the president of Selzer & Co, which carried out Bloomberg’s poll in Iowa, said. “People like him. They like what he stands for. They like showing up at his events and hearing him say things they believe in.” In short, Sanders is running a classic insurgency campaign. And as many establishment candidates have discovered in the past, running against such an opponent can be an uncomfortable experience.","1764","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"This will be the first and the last time Donald Trump is described as a model of restraint, but let it be said: at his Presidential announcement speech, in New York last Tuesday, Trump managed to stand in front of a microphone for more than forty minutes, his mouth moving for the duration, without taking a single jab at Hillary Clinton. In this way he distinguished himself from the rest of the Republican field. The day before, in Miami, Jeb Bush swiped at Clinton—twice by name and a few more times by obvious implication—in his own announcement speech. Last month, launching his campaign, Marco Rubio posited himself as a perfect contrast to Clinton, warning that “a leader from yesterday began a campaign for President by promising to take us back to yesterday. Yesterday is over.” (So is Trump’s restraint: within hours of his speech, he flew to Des Moines and accused Clinton of “playing the woman card really big. I watched her the other day, and all she would talk about was ‘Women! Women! I’m a woman!’ ”)","June 22, 2015","1765","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"
"Even if Clinton weren’t the only viable Democrat in the race, she would hold a special place in the Republican line of fire. Hillary is hated by the right in a way that Martin O’Malley can only dream of being hated. This is true across the conservative spectrum. While some candidates (Rand Paul) are trying to lock in the libertarian vote, and others (Bush, Rubio) are wooing the reform-minded, all are playing to the anti-Clinton caucus (none more insistently than Carly Fiorina, the former C.E.O. of H.P., whose belligerence toward Clinton is approaching self-parody). Now, with Clinton officially running and the Republican field nearly complete, the scattershot censure of the past few months has begun to coalesce into several reasonably distinct lines of attack.

The “brick phone,” in fact, is a favorite reference of Rubio, who is forty-four, and who has said that the Clintons arrived in Washington back when people were lugging those two-pounders around. Never mind that Motorola’s DynaTAC 8000X is a relic of the Reagan era, not of the nineteen-nineties (the age of the clamshell). The implication is that Clinton herself is a relic, and that age determines outlook.","1768","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"

"Savor the irony, if you’re into that sort of thing, that it was Mitt Romney who appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” last week and urged voters to “look at how much money [Hillary Clinton has] been making.” Romney questioned how Clinton can “sell a populist message when she makes in one hour a multiple of what the average American will make in a year.” Those would be the same Americans who, Romney claimed in 2012, “believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.” Though Romney is not running for President this time, he is lending a hand by stoking resentment against his own class. Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chairman, has also found his inner egalitarian, telling a gathering of conservatives in February that “if there’s not a private luxury jet and a quarter-million-dollar speaking fee waiting for her, you can forget” seeing Hillary Clinton in public. Among the candidates, Rick Santorum attacks Clinton as a tool of “corporate interests,” and Jeb Bush—the chairman and manager of at least three offshore private equity funds—paints her as one of the “pampered élites.”","1770","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"

"Critics have labelled Clinton a radical since at least 1980, when her refusal to change her last name to her husband’s became an issue in his losing campaign for reëlection as the governor of Arkansas. Her stewardship of the failed health-care plan during the Clinton Administration associated her with “big government,” though she has done little in the past twenty years to reinforce that impression. No matter. If the Democrats ran a blue dog for President—not a centrist “blue dog” Democrat but an actual, barking blue dog—Republicans would call it a “liberal,” as Fiorina, Bush, and others are calling Clinton now. To Fiorina, Clinton’s announcement speech was a “long litany of left-wing causes”; Walker saw it as confirmation that “her views are out of touch with mainstream America.” Bush has been more precise. In April, he e-mailed supporters about a speech that Clinton gave on the rights of women and girls. “Hillary Clinton,” Bush wrote, “said that people’s deep-seated religious beliefs need to be changed in order to advance her own personal political agenda. Wow.” She didn’t say that, but Bush—to ingratiate himself with the religious right, which distrusts him—repeated the charge last Monday. The Republican electorate is being primed to expect the annihilation of individual freedom under a Hillary Clinton Administration. (Obama, it appears, hasn’t finished the job.)

"For all the froth over the Benghazi attack—which made it an article of faith on the right that Clinton, as the Secretary of State, created what Rubio calls “global chaos”—there has been little talk of foreign policy on the campaign trail. Fiorina has been goading Clinton to “name an accomplishment” from her time at the State Department, while Fiorina’s rivals see a highlight reel of destruction. Ted Cruz has been rumbling about the “Obama-Clinton” axis for months now. Bush charges that a “phone-it-in foreign policy” is “leaving a legacy of crises uncontained, violence unopposed, enemies unnamed, friends undefended, and alliances unravelling.” (If that sounds like the rap on his brother’s Administration, Jeb is leaving the ironies unacknowledged.) None of the Republican candidates have particularly robust foreign-policy credentials, so, absent an international crisis of the first order, this will remain a secondary issue for now.","1774","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"

"“I think people wonder,” Romney said on “Morning Joe,” “can they really trust Hillary Clinton?” Not if the G.O.P. can help it. And, in truth, Clinton has not helped herself on this score. Her use of a personal e-mail account to conduct State Department business and the Clinton Foundation’s acceptance of donations from foreign governments have stoked the engines of indignation on the right. Fiorina told a group of party activists that Clinton “tweets about women’s rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights.” To Cruz, Clinton “embodies the corruption of Washington,” which is putting it mildly compared to Rand Paul, who charges both Clintons, flatly, with thinking that “they are above the law.”","1776","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"

Last Wednesday, Quinnipiac reported a “continuing slide” in the percentage of swing-state voters who view Clinton as honest and trustworthy. In Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, the trust deficit is eight to fourteen points. It is unclear whether the Republican candidates can claim credit for this, or whether news coverage is what has driven Clinton’s numbers down. Certainly, the press corps has pursued the e-mail story and dug into the Clinton Foundation’s finances without any need of encouragement from the G.O.P.","1777","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"
"There is danger for Clinton in the trust gap, if it opens wider. When a candidate isn’t trusted to say what she means or do what she says, then it ceases to matter, really, what proposals she offers on renewable energy. But “trust,” as measured by polling firms, is an abstraction. The question that will decide the election is not “Do you trust this nominee?” but “Do you trust this nominee more than you trust the other nominee to make progress on the issues that matter to you?” On that question, Clinton should like her odds. While Bush, in the Quinnipiac poll, beats Clinton by four points on who’s more “honest and trustworthy,” Clinton tops him by fourteen points on “who understands the problems of people like you.” Bush isn’t alone in this deficiency. The whole Republican field is proudly, doggedly committed to a set of economic policies that reinforce the party’s identification with the already prosperous, and that has lost the popular vote in five out of the past six Presidential elections.","1778","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"

"Beyond the headline figures, which saw the Conservatives achieve an over-all majority in the House of Commons, three big stories came out of the election. The first, and least consequential, was the embarrassment suffered by the opinion pollsters (and the pundits, myself included, who had relied on the figures, which suggested that the election would be very close indeed). The second story, much more significant, was that the British public, or, I should say, the English public, endorsed the controversial (and, in my view, mistaken) austerity policies that the Conservative-Liberal Democratic coalition has pursued since 2010. Finally, and this may be most important outcome of the election, the political landslide in Scotland raised anew the question of how long the United Kingdom will survive in its current form.","1781","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/after-a-tory-and-s-n-p-triumph-what-now-for-the-united-kingdom"

"Let’s start with the pollsters’ Waterloo. In terms of seats in the House of Commons, the discrepancy between the actual result and the final pollsters’ projections, many of which showed the Conservative and Labour Parties gaining roughly equal representation, was huge. At least four explanations are possible for why pollsters got it so wrong: their samples were biased; there was a herding problem, in which some of them massaged their figures to match the perceived view that the race was tight; there was a (very) late swing to the Conservatives that they failed to pick up; or many of their respondents were telling fibs.","1783","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/after-a-tory-and-s-n-p-triumph-what-now-for-the-united-kingdom"
"It’s too early to say which is the best explanation, but the last one is the most intriguing. For all its electoral success, the Conservative Party is still widely viewed as the “nasty party.” When questioned by pollsters, some people who intend to support the Party may not want to be publicly associated with it, so they say that they are undecided or that they intend to vote for another party. They are “shy Tories,” and they have been spotted before. In the elections of 1987 and 1992, when Margaret Thatcher and John Major, respectively, were in office, incumbent Conservative governments did better than many of the polls had predicted.","1784","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/after-a-tory-and-s-n-p-triumph-what-now-for-the-united-kingdom"
"The “austerity triumphs” story is an important one, but it shouldn’t be oversold. With slightly more than one in three voters choosing the Conservatives, there wasn’t an overwhelming majority backing their experiment in pre-Keynesian economics. Moreover, the Liberal Democrats, who were complicit in George Osborne’s cuts to government programs, got smashed at the ballot box. And one of the reasons that the S.N.P. did so well in Scotland was that it pledged to fight for the abandonment of austerity policies, not merely to try to tone them down a bit, which was the Labour Party’s stance.","1785","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/after-a-tory-and-s-n-p-triumph-what-now-for-the-united-kingdom"
"That said, the Conservatives scored a big victory, and their clear lead over Labour on the issue of economic competence was surely one of the deciding factors, especially in England. On the BBC last night, Neil Kinnock, a former Labour leader who suffered two crushing defeats at the hands of the Tories, in 1987 and 1992, pointed out that many Britons vote for the party they believe can deliver “economic security,” and that the Conservatives and their Fleet Street allies are masters at whipping up economic fears. The record of the last Labour government, which was in office when the financial crisis of 2008 plunged the economy into recession, plagued Miliband and Ed Balls, Labour’s economics spokesman. So did virulent attacks from the Conservative media, and the difficulty of explaining Keynesian economics to non-economists. The Conservatives’ message was simple: things are finally getting better; don’t let Labour wreck them. And that message ultimately worked.","1786","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/after-a-tory-and-s-n-p-triumph-what-now-for-the-united-kingdom"
"But economics wasn’t the whole story. Perhaps even more important was the fact that the anti-immigrant United Kingdom Independence Party took a lot of Labour votes. I spoke with a Labour veteran a few weeks ago, and he told me that the rise of UKIP was what worried him most. While the media was focussed on the threat UKIP represented to the Conservatives, Labour canvassers, especially those operating in the Midlands and the North of England, were reporting that a considerable number of the Party’s white working-class supporters were leaning toward Farage and his fellow rabble-rousers. Those reports turned out to be true, and it explains why in some marginal seats that Labour had been targeting, such as Nuneaton and Warwickshire North, there was actually a net swing from Labour to the Conservatives. Although UKIP ended up with just one seat, prompting Farage’s resignation, the Party won thirteen per cent of the over-all vote—by far the best performance by an English nationalist party in a general election.","1787","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/after-a-tory-and-s-n-p-triumph-what-now-for-the-united-kingdom"
"Then there is the leadership factor. In Britain, perhaps even more so than in the United States, people vote for the individual rather than the party. The forty-five-year-old Miliband, despite exceeding expectations with an error-free election campaign, never grabbed the British public’s imagination the way Tony Blair did in the nineteen-nineties. It can be debated to what extent Miliband’s decision to appeal primarily to Labour’s core voters rather than reaching out to the center, as Blair did, hindered the Party’s chances. In any case, the result was so bad for Labour that he had no choice but to resign, which he did with dignity, saying, “We have come back before and this party will come back again.”","1788","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/after-a-tory-and-s-n-p-triumph-what-now-for-the-united-kingdom"
"Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, said something similar, but his humiliation was even greater. After a nationwide rout of Lib-Dem candidates, the Party’s presence in the House of Commons was reduced from fifty-five seats to seven. Across the country, former Liberal Democratic voters repudiated Clegg’s decision, in 2010, to go into a coalition with the Conservatives. In his resignation speech, Clegg refused to admit his error, saying, “I believe the history books will judge our party kindly for the service we sought to provide to the nation at a time of great economic difficulty.” Of course, that depends on who writes them.","1789","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/after-a-tory-and-s-n-p-triumph-what-now-for-the-united-kingdom"

On the basis of the opinion polls, practically everybody believed that the separatist S.N.P. would make big gains, but it exceeded all expectations, including those of its leader, Nicola Sturgeon. When an exit poll suggested that the S.N.P., which previously had just six seats at Westminster, could end up with fifty-nine, Sturgeon tweeted, “I’d treat the exit poll with HUGE caution. I’m hoping for a good night but I think 58 seats is unlikely!” In fact, the S.N.P. won fifty-six out of fifty-nine seats.","1790","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/after-a-tory-and-s-n-p-triumph-what-now-for-the-united-kingdom"

Labour lost Kirkcaldy, the seat that had been held by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and was considered one of its safest. Even more astonishing, the Labour Party failed to win a single seat in Glasgow, which for many decades was one of its bastions.","1791","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/after-a-tory-and-s-n-p-triumph-what-now-for-the-united-kingdom"

For a democratic union of two countries to survive, it needs majority support in both countries. At the moment, this condition is still being met by Scotland and England, but only just. If the dynamic that produced the S.N.P.’s triumph continues, it points toward the eventual breakup of the union or, at the least, a federalization of the United Kingdom.","1796","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/after-a-tory-and-s-n-p-triumph-what-now-for-the-united-kingdom"
"On the night of October 11, 2012, Barack Obama loped across the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base, looking as if he were trying hard not to grin. It was a change of mood; eight days earlier, he had done poorly in his first Presidential debate with Mitt Romney, and the feeling in his campaign was gloomy. But, that evening, Vice-President Joe Biden had had his first debate with Paul Ryan, during which he called out the Romney campaign on its “malarkey.” Some commentators thought that he had looked foolish—he’d laughed a lot, and when Biden laughs, he throws back his head. (Mark Salter, the Republican operative, called the Obama-Biden debate combination “sleepy cop/crystal-meth cop.”) But even many of the critics thought that he’d won. He had reminded a lot of people of why they wanted a Democrat in the White House, particularly on questions like income inequality. One of those people seems to have been Obama himself. He’d watched the debate on Air Force One and, though there wasn’t a plan for him to speak to reporters, he swung over to where they were standing.","June 12, 2015","1797","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"

So I’m very proud of him.”","1798","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"

That was the case when what was scoffed at as yet another instance of Bidenic indiscipline—getting ahead of his boss by saying that he was “absolutely comfortable” with full legal recognition of same-sex marriage—led Obama, too, to say what he actually believed, and arrive at a place where he felt proud to be.","1799","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"The idea that a person could make those around him better came up again this past weekend, when Obama delivered the eulogy for Biden’s son, Beau, who had died of brain cancer, at the age of forty-six. The Vice-President, by all accounts, was hit hard by his son’s death. In 1973, he had taken his Senate oath next to the hospital bed where Beau lay, at age three, after surviving the car crash that had killed Biden’s wife and daughter. He was also the son who had served in the reserves in Iraq, been elected as the attorney general of Delaware, and one day, perhaps, could go even further in politics than his father had. “He even looked and sounded like Joe, although I think Joe would be first to acknowledge that Beau was an upgrade—Joe 2.0,” Obama said. He added, “That’s who Beau was. Someone who cared. Someone who charmed you, and disarmed you, and put you at ease. When he’d have to attend a fancy fund-raiser with people who took themselves way too seriously, he’d walk over to you and whisper something wildly inappropriate in your ear.” (Joe Biden, for his part, has been known to whisper wildly inappropriate things, but when he was, for example, caught on an open mic telling Obama that the passage of the Affordable Care Act was “a big fucking deal,” he was reminding Obama that he should take something seriously.) At the funeral, Obama said that he loved Biden. The two have a weekly lunch; the most recent one was on Wednesday, Biden’s first day back at work since Beau’s death.","1800","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"

Decide.’ ’’ Biden is seventy-two. Hillary Clinton is sixty-seven. More tellingly, Biden added, “I watched my father. I made a mistake in encouraging him to retire.

(Bill Clinton recently said that he would consider giving up paid speeches—after Hillary wins.) Joe Biden is not a very wealthy man. By one estimate, his net worth is between thirty-nine thousand and eight hundred thousand dollars; by another, with his mortgage figured in, it is a negative number. (Biden: “But I got a great pension and I got a good salary!”) Which way does that cut, for each of them? Perhaps it makes a Biden campaign less feasible, in that he has less flexibility; it might also make it more desirable, depending on one’s definition of independence.","1803","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"Last week, Hillary Clinton almost lost to Bernie Sanders in a Wisconsin straw poll (the tally was forty-nine per cent to forty-one), but Sanders, who can reasonably be called a socialist, is not likely to be the one who makes clear what her real general-election vulnerabilities are, or how to overcome them. Biden would. He may have no chance of winning. But he is a more plausible candidate than anyone Clinton is facing now, and perhaps the best answer to the fear that, as the Republicans fight it out among themselves, she will drift through until the convention, with a stray glance at Martin O’Malley, and enter the general election unprepared for the fight. Obama was right about Biden’s debate with Ryan: rewatching it is a good reminder of his ability to speak plainly and in detail about Democratic economic policies—something that involves more than just throwing out lines about level playing fields. (Republicans have been doing that, too.) Maybe Hillary Clinton, in a speech she’s scheduled to give on Saturday, will find a way to make those themes work for her. She hasn’t yet.","1804","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"And, although she served four years as Secretary of State, Biden has a deeper background in foreign policy, with years as a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a skepticism about things like troop deployments that might appeal to noninterventionists—who can be found across the spectrum. His 2006 proposal for Iraq—reshaping the country into a loose three-part federation—also much derided, does not, in light of recent events, look all that bad. (As it is, a sectarian Shiite-dominated central government unwilling to give a voice or commit resources to Sunni and Kurdish regions has contributed to the rise of ISIS.)","1805","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"But how, might one ask, could Biden win in a general election when Obama, his boss, is so unpopular? That question points to what may be one of the most interesting results of having Biden in the race. Hillary Clinton would have to decide where she really stands on the Obama Presidency, in all its aspects, and say what she thinks about it. (He was her boss, too.) Her advisers have made it clear that she’s counting on the Obama coalition; how tied are their votes to the Obama legacy? Clinton needs a response that doesn’t just involve hinting that everything would have been better if she’d been elected in 2008. She tried out some jabs at Obama, in an interview with the Atlantic last August, in which, quoting one of his mantras, she said, “Great nations need organizing principles, and ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle,” and called his choices on Syria a “failure.” Her spokesman said afterward that she hadn’t meant to criticize the President, and looked forward “to hugging it out.” The message there, whatever it was, got muddled. Biden’s presence might clarify it, and present some interesting choices to Democratic primary voters—and to Obama, who might not endorse anyone before the nomination, but could give a few hints of his preference along the way.","1806","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"

He’s been mulling such a move for at least a couple of years. “It’s as likely I run as I don’t run,” Biden said on the talk show “The View” in February, 2014. In an interview with Politico’s Glenn Thrush that month, he laid out the sort of campaign he could conduct, focussing on rising inequality and the wage squeeze. “It’s either going to be me or someone else who is going to make this argument in the Democratic Party.” As I wrote at the time, “He’s still full of energy, he’s served President Obama loyally, he loves the game, and he thinks—pundits and pollsters be damned—that this might be the moment for an old-school, shit-kicking, hand-grasping, mouth-running, stick-up-for-the-working-stiff pol like himself.”","August 3, 2015","1808","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"

That was premature. In January of this year, he told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos that he still hadn’t made up his mind, noting, “There’s plenty of time.” Now, however, the clock is ticking. In recent weeks, as Amy Chozick, of the Times, reported on Saturday, some of Biden’s aides have been meeting with potential donors and campaign staffers who have not yet committed to Clinton. The report said that confidants of Biden expect him to make a final decision one way or the other by early September.","1809","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Two things appear to have prompted Biden to get serious. The first was the death, in May, of his forty-six-year-old son Beau, who had urged his father to take a third and final tilt at the Presidency. (Biden’s previous campaigns were in 1988 and 2008.) The other factor was the growing perception among political professionals that Clinton could be vulnerable in a general election, which is partly based on polling data showing that many voters distrust her. “The No. 1 thing voters want is a candidate who is honest and trustworthy, and the veep is leading in those polls,” William Pierce, the executive director of the Draft Biden 2016 super PAC, told Chozick.","1810","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"The poll that Pierce was referring to was carried out by Quinnipiac University and released late last week. It found that just thirty-seven per cent of likely voters find Clinton “honest and trustworthy,” and that fifty-seven per cent don’t. For Biden, the figures were reversed. Fifty-eight per cent of the respondents said that they found him honest and trustworthy; thirty-four per cent said they didn’t. The Vice-President also led the former Secretary of State on the issue of empathy. Asked whether he “cares about the needs and problems of people like you or not,” fifty-seven per cent said yes, and thirty-five per cent said no. When the pollsters asked the same question about Clinton, forty-five per cent of people said yes, and fifty-two per cent said no.","1811","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"This was just one poll, and its results didn’t all come out in Biden’s favor. Fifty-eight per cent of respondents said that Clinton had “strong leadership qualities,” compared to fifty-two per cent for Biden. Still, the survey found that in head-to-head contests with the Republican candidates, Biden did at least as well as Clinton. In a matchup with Jeb Bush, Clinton trailed by one percentage point, and Biden led by one point; in a matchup with Donald Trump, they both led by twelve percentage points.","1812","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"If these figures are taken at face value, they suggest that Biden could be a viable candidate in the general election. But in order to get there, he would have to overcome Clinton’s enormous lead in money, organization, and electoral support. The Clinton campaign has already raised well over fifty million dollars, and it is aiming to raise a hundred million by the end of the year. (That doesn’t count all the money that will be raised by super PACs and other organizations allied with Hillary.) Clinton already has big political operations in the early voting states. And, according to the Huffington Post’s poll average, she is leading Bernie Sanders by 56.9 per cent to 18.9 per cent among likely Democratic voters.","1813","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Although he’s not currently a candidate, Biden is in third place, with twelve per cent of the vote. If he were to enter the race, that figure would almost certainly rise, at least for a while. But he would still be a long-shot candidate. Positioning himself to the left of Clinton, he would be competing with Bernie Sanders for the votes of progressive Democrats, some of whom wouldn’t welcome his late entry. He would also need to pick up support from moderates who have doubts about the Clintons.","1814","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"At seventy-two, Biden potentially faces an age issue. (Clinton is five years his junior; Sanders is a year older.) A bigger challenge, however, might be demonstrating that he has what it takes to be President. Despite his long history as a senator and Vice-President, many members of the political and media establishment have long seen him as lacking the necessary gravitas and depth for the highest office. Doubts about Biden’s seriousness date back to his 1988 Presidential bid, which was derailed by allegations that he had exaggerated his college record and plagiarized part of a speech.","1815","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Nineteen eighty-eight is a long time ago, and Biden has achieved a lot since then, including serving as Vice-President for the past six and a half years. An eminently decent and likable man, he has never had the stench of corruption that attaches itself to many people who stay in Washington for a long time. About the worst that you hear said about him is that he is a blowhard who occasionally blurts out embarrassing things.","1816","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"In an era of scripted politicians and carefully orchestrated campaigns, some Democrats may see Biden’s spontaneity as a plus. And the issues of the moment play to his strengths. As long ago as 1988, he was talking about increasing social mobility, defending the middle class, and challenging the notion that you can’t buck the market. “For too long in this society, we have celebrated unrestrained individualism over common community,” he said in his first announcement speech. “For too long as a nation, we have been lulled by the anthem of self-interest. . . . We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference.”","1817","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Back then, Biden was a youngish Roman Catholic pol on the up, and, doubtless, the echoes of John F. Kennedy in his speech were deliberate. Today, he is older and more grizzled (as are many of the rest of us). Taking on the Clintons and the Republicans is a task that would give anyone pause, let alone a seventy-two-year-old who has just lost his son. Even after the latest round of speculation, it is perfectly possible, indeed likely, that he will stay out of the race. But if he decides to give it a go, he might surprise a few people.","1818","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Early this year, Matteo Renzi invited Angela Merkel to Florence for a tête-à-tête at the Romanesque guild-priory known since the Renaissance as the Palazzo Vecchio and now its city hall. Renzi comes from Florence and, like most Florentines, he is devoted to the city, which in his case elected him mayor in 2009, when he was thirty-four, and nurtured the native Machiavellian wiles that five years later brought him to Rome, at thirty-nine, as the youngest Prime Minister since Italy became Italy, in 1861. In Rome, the art of politics could be described as nets and tridents. Not Renzi’s style. In Florence, where the Renaissance charm of the city and the Renaissance stealth of its population still hold sway, Renzi is a master of both, so it isn’t surprising that late last year, when Merkel confessed that she’d visited Florence only once, he asked her to come again, this time as his guest. The papers called the invitation the Prime Minister’s charm offensive. Renzi, who had hoped for Merkel’s blessing on his requests to the European Commission for the time and financial flexibility to rescue the beleaguered economy he inherited, put it this way: “Dostoyevsky wrote that beauty will save the world. Let’s see if it can save Europe, too.” (Not precisely. It was part of an insolent question posed to the eponymous hero of “The Idiot.”)","1819","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi and Merkel are the European Union’s odd couple. Like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia, they get along. They enjoy each other’s company, and, if their unlikely friendship includes a large measure of amusement and incredulity, they are well matched when it comes to the steel behind the strategic courtesies that each deploys. Merkel, unflappable and seemingly untouchable after ten years as Chancellor of the Continent’s biggest economic power, is Europe’s reigning austerity hawk, and pretty much calls the shots in Brussels. Renzi, who at the time of his invitation was entering his eleventh month in office, was still known abroad mainly for his youth, for the jeans and sneakers he wears to meetings, and for the barbed tweets with which he documents his uphill battle to solve Italy’s social woes and persistent fiscal crises. He had produced an ambitious package of reforms, and kept the budget deficit at a safe, if hovering, three per cent of the country’s G.D.P. (Any E.U. member with a higher deficit risks sanctions from Brussels.) Now he needed to finance the kind of infrastructural, technological, and economic innovations that would create new jobs and generate enough investment and enthusiasm to put Italy, the third-largest economy in the euro zone, back into what he calls the “European conversation.” By January, he was well on the way to success: Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, had announced a plan to release some three hundred billion euros to the zone’s qualifying states for what was prudently called investment with scrutiny; and Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (and the former governor of the Bank of Italy), had signed off on another plan, designed to kick-start recovery for those states, with a stimulus package of a trillion euros. Merkel, with a seemly, balanced budget, was resigned, but she did not approve.","1820","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi, with his press secretary and diplomatic adviser in tow, pulled up at the gate of a military terminal on the edge of Ciampino, Rome’s city airport, to fly to Florence. He was running a couple of hours late, and when I joined him on the small government plane idling on the runway he was still dressed in his work uniform of jeans and a rumpled white shirt, open at the neck. We talked through the flight, or, rather, Renzi talked. He was excited about Merkel’s visit, and kept interrupting himself to come back to it. He has what could be called a peripatetic mind and, like any good performer, he uses it to keep you on the edge of your seat, not asking inconvenient questions, and also, perhaps, to impress himself when he’s about to confront an obstacle in his path. The obstacle that night was Merkel, and the goal, he told me, was “changing the narrative of Europe through art.” Renzi tries out aphorisms the way other men do ties. The last time we had talked, it was “changing the story of Europe through art.”","1821","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi was still practicing—“The future of Europe is not tomorrow, it is today!”—as the plane began its descent into Florence’s airport. He looked at his watch, jumped up, and disappeared into the pilot’s bathroom to change into a suit and comb his hair. We got to the Palazzo Vecchio just in time for him to race up four hundred and sixteen ceremonial steps, check out the crowd of notabile waiting inside, and race back down to collect the Chancellor when she stepped, smiling, out of a modest consular car, dressed in black trousers and, under a plain black coat, a pretty, off-the-rack yellow jacket—as if to suggest that hers was the beauty of fiscal thrift.","1822","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Merkel seemed pleased, if somewhat bemused, by the red-carpet and costumed-honor-guard welcome she received. Renzi escorted her up to the palazzo and introduced her to the assembled locals, and, after a decent Instagram interval, they vanished into a private room for their conversation on the subject of saving Europe. An hour later, they emerged and were joined by a small group of advisers, representing his and her side of the spending divide—after which their talk morphed into a Tuscan feast, served at a table set in solitary splendor in the middle of a vast and otherwise empty hall. At ten, everyone walked next door, to the Uffizi, for an after-hours tour. Renzi, as proud as a new father, expounded on the beauty of Botticelli’s “The Birth of Venus.” Merkel stole back into the gallery alone, minutes later, and headed for the early Leonardo “Annunciation.” The evening ended at eleven, with Merkel leaving for her hotel and Renzi and a few friends disappearing down a small street for an espresso at his favorite Florence hangout. He had officiated at the owner’s wedding, to her barista, back in the days when he would bike to city hall and people greeted him on the street with a “Ciao, sindaco! ”","1823","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"The next morning, there was a press conference in the Michelangelo gallery of the Academy of Florence, and the beauty on offer was “David,” slingshot at hand—fourteen ravishing feet of marble ready to take on Goliath. Merkel congratulated Renzi on his promise to “turbo-charge” his reforms. She joked that he brought her “progress reports” whenever they met, and said she had “no doubt that what Matteo proposes will be implemented”—all the while reminding him that, from Germany’s point of view, it was up to entrepreneurs, not states, to promote jobs. Renzi, for his part, said that while he and the Chancellor “may not always have the same opinions” on the virtue of frugality over growth, “the symbols of compromise are important”—by which he meant that Germany risked isolating itself in Europe by its unbending fiscal rigor. In the end, it was a draw and a gracious goodbye. It has to be said that Merkel flew home to Berlin looking uncommonly reassured that Italy wasn’t Greece.","1824","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Italians who admire Matteo Renzi call him “our best hope.” More skeptical Italians say, “Well, maybe our only hope.” The Western press hedges its bets with “brash” but “confident.” And his enemies use the term il rottamatore, the demolition man. Renzi agrees with his enemies. “I’m the scrapper,” he told me. “I’m cleaning up the swamp.” He meant the waste, the deadly bureaucracy, the notoriously padded ranks of Italy’s public administration, the unemployment now at forty per cent among the country’s youth, the outrageously slow pace of the justice system, the culture of cronyism, political perks and payoffs, tax evasion, casual everyday criminality, and open cheating—not to mention the various mafias, from the Cosa Nostra to the Camorra and the ’Ndrangheta, that still hold much of the economy of the South (and not a little of the North) in thrall. “We love Italy, I think you love Italy, everybody loves Italy,” Renzi had told the Council on Foreign Relations one morning last September, during a trip to New York for the opening of the United Nations session. “This is the risk for my country.” The risk has been that, for Italians, loving Italy is a way of saying, We’re used to the swamp we have, we know our way around in it—why bet on a future that might be worse?","1825","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"“They love their past, their present, but they need a vision and an explanation of their future—in the possibility of a future,” Renzi told me that night, flopping onto a couch in the living room of his hotel suite. It was nearly ten hours since I’d heard him speak at the C.F.R., and he was exhausted from a day of interviews and speeches but waiting up for a call from the French President. “The mentality of Italy has to change, because reforms aren’t possible without everybody’s participation. We’re a young team—we want to invest in the new generation—but we’re not simply a young team. Youth is the man of whatever age who risks believing in the possibility of change.”","1826","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi had moved into the Palazzo Chigi, the Prime Minister’s official residence, with a to-do list. “A reform a month,” he promised. He was going to radically change the labor market in Italy, with a Jobs Act that would offer financial protection for new, young workers while, at the same time, giving employers the right (a first for Italy) to lay off any workers in cases of economic pressure, with no obligation to rehire them; reduce the maddening ineptness of public administration; reform the justice system to shorten the process for civil cases; remake a parliament swollen to more than a thousand extravagantly paid members; generate foreign investment, then running at half the E.U. average; confront corruption with “values”; rewrite the election laws to produce a majority-rules system; and, of course, wrest “the story of Europe” from Angela Merkel. In January last year, a month before he became Prime Minister—with the hard-core labor wing of his center-left Democratic Party already stonewalling but with much of Italy distracted by his infectious litany of transformation—he struck a deal with Silvio Berlusconi that would help get his reforms passed.","1827","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Berlusconi was Italy’s Prime Minister three times in the seventeen years between 1994 and 2011. He spent nine of those years in office—thanks in large part to Forza Italia, the party he founded, and funded with his own money, in order to protect a financial empire that had made him Italy’s richest man. (His fortune now stands at $7.6 billion.) As Prime Minister, he was also its most legally unaccountable man. He was not solely responsible for the “swamp,” but given that, in office, he controlled ninety per cent of the country’s media—his own private media monopoly, Mediaset, and RAI, the state radio and television networks—he could celebrate his insouciant immunity and, more to the point, make it glamorous and entertaining. That running joke came to a halt in 2011, when Italy’s sovereign debt rose to $2.6 trillion and Berlusconi, losing a vote of confidence in parliament, had to resign from office. Two years later, after dozens of criminal investigations, he was banned from politics when a tax-fraud case, dating from the year of his resignation, became the first of his lower-court convictions to be whisked through the appeals process, and upheld, before the statute of limitations could kick in. (Given the state of Italy’s justice system, two years counted as overnight.)","1828","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"When Renzi took over the government, Berlusconi was about to start serving a suspended sentence that obliged him to devote four hours a week to community service, tending Alzheimer’s patients at a nursing home near Milan. Many of his parliamentary deputies had defected by then and formed their own party, the New Center Right—they vote in a coalition with Renzi’s party now, and one of them, Angelino Alfano, is his interior minister. But the rest of Forza Italia remained a considerable presence in both houses of parliament, ready to do Berlusconi’s bidding.","1829","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi’s deal with Berlusconi was negotiated at Democratic Party headquarters, on the Largo del Nazareno, with a Democratic deputy named Lorenzo Guerini representing Renzi and Gianni Letta, Berlusconi’s longtime éminence grise, representing the other side. It quickly became known as the Nazarene Pact, and though it was never published or even, presumably, written down, no one denied what was in it. Berlusconi pledged Forza Italia’s support for two of Renzi’s key reforms. One involved transforming the country’s chaotic version of a proportional electoral process into what Roberto d’Alimonte, a well-regarded political scientist who had helped draft the reform for Renzi, called a simple “majority-assuring system”: the party whose list of candidates won at least forty per cent of the vote would get fifty-four per cent of the seats in parliament, and could form a government of its own; if no party won forty per cent, the two lists with the most votes would compete in a runoff, and the winner would get the government. Renzi put it this way when we last talked: “In Germany, Angela Merkel was forced to have a grand-coalition government. I joke with Angela that, with my electoral law, she could be Chancellor free and clear.”","1830","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"The second reform involved amending Italy’s postwar constitution, a document desperately, if understandably, democratic in its intended checks and balances. No new law could be enacted unless or until both the Camera (the chamber of deputies) and the Senate agreed to the same document, with exactly the same wording—one reason that Italy has been left endlessly recycling old Prime Ministers through a series of unstable new alliances. (Renzi’s is the sixty-third government in sixty-nine years.) Renzi’s idea was to abolish the Senate in its present role, transforming it, greatly reduced in size, into an assembly in some ways similar to the German Bundesrat. It would deal mainly with regional affairs, play no part in the creation (or the collapse) of the country’s governments, and leave the important national legislation in the Camera’s hands.","1831","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"In return, Berlusconi expected a say in the selection of the country’s next President. The Italian Presidency is a largely ceremonial post, but in times of crisis the President has critically important powers. He (there has never been a she) has the right to dissolve parliament and call for immediate elections or, alternately, to appoint a new Prime Minister to form a government and serve until the current five-year election cycle ends—which, in fact, is how Renzi got the job. The President also has the right to grant pardons and commute sentences, which in Berlusconi’s case would possibly lift his ban, at least until the next conviction. (This spring, Berlusconi went on trial again, in Naples, charged with bribery.) Given that in January of 2014 the President, Giorgio Napolitano, was eighty-eight and longing to retire, and that Berlusconi, a surgically youthful seventy-seven, was longing for a comeback, Renzi got his pact.","1832","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"In one sense, the pact could be seen as an American-style crossing of the aisle, but it amounted to revolution in a country where ideology had long taken precedence over accommodation. Renzi faced the inevitable backlash from the left of his party with a shrug and a few choice words, knowing, perhaps, that in the matter of craftiness he was miles ahead of the man whom no politician in Italy had ever managed to outfox before. (“Whom should I have talked to? Dudù?” he demanded. Dudù is a miniature poodle owned by Berlusconi’s girlfriend.)","1833","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"While the left cried betrayal and Berlusconi cheerfully waited for absolution, Renzi quietly pushed the Presidential candidacy of a Constitutional Court justice named Sergio Mattarella, who, at seventy-four, had spent his life battling Italy’s criminal classes and their political allies, Berlusconi among them. (Mattarella’s older brother, a reform governor of Sicily, was gunned down by the Sicilian Mob in 1980, at the age of forty-five.) When it was all over, the Democrats’ recalcitrant leftists fell in line behind Mattarella, and then it was Berlusconi who cried betrayal. Mattarella became President in January this year. The Nazarene Pact is a thing of the past, but so, it appears, is Berlusconi.","1834","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi isn’t much of a reader. It’s unlikely that he keeps “The Prince” on his night table, but somewhere along the way to the Chigi Palace he learned one lesson from the wiliest Florentine of them all: a leader takes no prisoners where his ambition to rule wisely is at stake. There is no doubt that Renzi wants to save Italy from itself, or that he considers himself the only person who can do that. At home, he goes on the attack. “Plots, secrets, fake scoops, bollocks, and backward thinking: it takes just one night of watching television to understand Italy’s talk-show crisis” was one of his tweets at the end of January. A month later, he announced a plan to transform the compromised state media networks into an independent public corporation chartered on the order of the BBC. He reserves his homilies for inspirational speeches and the foreign press.","1835","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"“I come from two experiences,” he told me one afternoon in Rome. One involved the four years he spent refereeing amateur soccer games, in Florence as a young man, and having to think on his feet and “to decide in seconds: this is the foul, this is the red card.” The other involved his fifteen years as a Boy Scout, developing a passion for public service—“for the res publica” is how he put it. You would have to add Catholicism to that short, formative list. In Italy, the Boy Scouts are not just tents and trails. They are under the aegis of the Church.","1836","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi was born into a devout Catholic family. His father, Tiziano, is a Florence businessman who for years was a Christian Democratic assemblyman, and Matteo himself is a churchgoing Catholic, married to a like-minded schoolteacher and former Girl Scout whose brother is a priest. Roberto Cociancich, a Milan lawyer and Democratic Party senator, met Renzi when he signed up for a Boy Scout leadership-training camp that Cociancich was running in Tuscany. “Matteo was twenty then,” he told me. “There were forty people training in the camp, but after a couple of days I knew that this young man was somebody special. He was brilliant, capable—so capable that I asked him to join my training team. In the Scouts, we put a lot of emphasis on becoming good citizens. Our mission is to produce leaders, and we see the political life as an instrument for this. So I urged him to consider that life. In 2013, he called me and said, ‘Twenty years ago, you told me to choose a political life. Now it’s your turn’—so I ran for the Senate, and here I am.”","1837","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi likes to quote his mother—an obligatory male ritual in Italy. He says that she used to tell him stories about Robert Kennedy “fighting for justice in the sixties, in America,” and that she always ended those stories with the words “Matteo, fight!” His communal spirit as a young leader seems to have done little to dampen that imperative. His easy camaraderie notwithstanding, he grew up with an appetite for the fray and a mean competitive streak. At nineteen, he was a contestant on Italy’s version of “Wheel of Fortune.” He was a little chubby then, and his getup was provincial (brown suit, big wide-knotted tie), but he won three weeks in a row before being beaten, and took home some thirty thousand euros in prize money. At twenty-seven, he left the small party where he had been provincial secretary to become the local leader of the Daisy, a center-left coalition that in 2007 merged into the fractious ranks of the newly created Democratic Party. At twenty-nine, he was elected president of Florence’s provincial council. Five years later, he decided to run for mayor. When he won the Democrats’ nomination and then the election, he softened the blow to a friend named Dario Nardella, who had apparently hoped to be mayor himself, by appointing him as his deputy mayor and obvious successor. “Matteo is committed and tough, but it’s to lead, not to control,” Cociancich said. Actually, it’s both.","1838","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi was the third Prime Minister appointed by Giorgio Napolitano in the years since Berlusconi left office, in 2011. The others were “technocrats,” a euphemism for “experts in another life.” The well-known economist and former European Commissioner Mario Monti was brought in first, to tackle the mounting debt crisis that Berlusconi had failed to manage. Two years later, Monti made the mistake of running in the national elections—with no political base beyond Civic Choice, the small party he had patched together to support him—and was trounced. Enrico Letta came next. He lasted ten months before Napolitano replaced him. Letta was directing a think tank when we first met, in 2007. Eight years later, he described his months at the Chigi to me this way: “I wasn’t a ‘communicator.’ I didn’t run an administration of a hundred-and-forty-character bites.” Renzi’s public assault on Letta began with a condescending tweet: “Stay calm! Nobody wants your job.” The message was clear. The next day, Letta drove to the Quirinale to offer his resignation to Napolitano. By evening, Renzi was Prime Minister.","1839","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi’s plan then was to move to general elections quickly. He wanted fresh and appealing faces in his cabinet, to signal the end of those old pols, laundered and recycled through most of the governments that preceded his. Predictably, he opted for youth and women—the obvious appealing things. (Renzi told me that the average age of his cabinet was forty-seven; eight of the sixteen ministers he appointed were women.) It worked. A few months later, riding the wave of Renzi’s popularity, the Democratic Party won forty-one per cent of the vote in Italy’s European parliamentary election. It was a spectacular victory for Renzi—better than any Italian party had done in any election since 1946, and certainly enough of a mandate to free him from the risks of calling general elections at home. He bought the time to negotiate his reforms.","1840","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"“Renzi is a pure politician, one of the toughest I’ve seen in years,” Franco Bernabe, the chairman of the Italian financial-advisory boutique FB Group and a former head of ENI, the state energy company, and Telecom Italia, told me. “He picks up very quickly on the essence of power. He’s not very deep intellectually, but he has a fantastic ability to take up and absorb good ideas. He had only local experience when he came to Rome, but he already had a European agenda, he understood completely the problems of Italy, and he could get that message across. Monti had failed spectacularly at that, and Letta even worse. I, of course, welcomed a man with the right vision and understanding, and if he didn’t listen to every old pol, so what? He was anxious to get rid of that older generation. They would happily have got rid of him.”","1841","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"In Florence, Renzi had been immensely popular as mayor. He halved the size of an overstuffed city council, installed free Wi-Fi centers across the town, and increased the budget for social services and preschools. He found patrons for art projects and exhibits like “Sculpture in the Age of Donatello,” which spent this spring at the Museum of Biblical Art, in New York. He also closed Florence’s Renaissance city center to traffic. The tour buses disappeared. It was a change that tapped into the pride that Florentines take in their history. It also meant that the center could be reclaimed, or at least shared, by the natives. (Renzi, who revered Steve Jobs, told me that Jobs liked to compare the two great Renaissances: Florence and Apple.)","1842","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"But what really made Renzi’s national reputation were the Leopolda, annual public conclaves that he inaugurated a year after his election, on the advice of his deputy mayor for culture, in a converted nineteenth-century railway station of the same name. The Leopolda were all-day happenings on the order of a political human be-in. Thousands of people came to talk and listen. The only rule was that everyone had to say whatever he or she wanted to say in five minutes or less.","1843","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Edoardo Nesi, a Tuscan writer and filmmaker who has been a deputy in the Camera for the past two and a half years, got to know Renzi in Florence, after Renzi talked about his book “Story of My People” at the first Leopolda. The book was a memoir, about the small family fabric factory that Nesi ran briefly and had to sell when competition from China began forcing Tuscany’s old fabric-makers out of business; it got a lot of attention in Italy because of its evocation of people fighting for dying local traditions in a global world. Nesi called Renzi to thank him. “Matteo said, ‘Come to the next Leopolda and talk,’ ” Nesi told me. “So I did. Four or five thousand people were there that day, listening and talking, and the idea of something like that, something political, starting from the people—it confirmed my feeling that Matteo was necessary for Italy. It was his idea that Italy had to change, that Italy had been living for years concentrating on its past without connecting to its future, that Italy was in decadence.” I asked Nesi why he’d run for parliament, and he said, “I had this feeling that Italy was up for grabs, this feeling of urgency and fear, so I thought it was good to give a little of my time to public service—and also because this moment, in Italy, this is fantastic material for a writer!”","1844","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"It’s been said that Renzi’s “Rome” is the elevator between his office on the first floor of the Palazzo Chigi and his official apartment on the third. His wife, Agnese Landini, remains in Florence, where their three children go to public school, and where Landini teaches Latin and Italian in a classical public high school. Most weekends, Renzi flies home to see them. They are rarely together at the Chigi. On the few occasions when the family spends a weekend in Rome, Renzi joins them at a seventeenth-century villa in a tranquil, outlying Roman park which for years has served as one of the Prime Minister’s official retreats.","1845","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"“It’s fifty minutes on the plane, and I’m home,” Renzi told me, talking about his commute to Florence. “And that way I avoid the risks in bringing my family here. In Florence, they can continue a traditional life. A year ago, I didn’t have secret service. I used my bike. I talked quietly to citizens on the street. Now that’s over for me, but I want that same freedom for them. This job is an incredible responsibility. But this chair I’m sitting in—it isn’t the center of my life, but at this moment I work for my country. I’m focussed on changing my country. I feel the emotion of innovation, of the lab.” A minute later, he was recommending his “innovation video”—highlights from a whirlwind trip he’d made to Silicon Valley in the fall—which in turn reminded him that “Pope Francis decided to speak to the European Parliament on November 23rd, during my presidency of Europe.” (The presidency of the Council of the European Union is a rotating six-month post; Italy gets another turn in fourteen years.) Renzi counts that speech as an endorsement—a reform Pope and a reform Prime Minister in synch in their excoriations of church and state. He is an ardent Francis fan. He said that after the Pope warned Catholics that their “moral responsibility” did not include breeding “like rabbits,” the first thing he did was to call a prolifically procreating friend and tell him, “You can stop now!”","1846","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Lucia Annunziata, who covered national politics for Corriere della Sera and, in 2012, became the editor of the new Huffington Post Italia, says that Renzi’s stories are a constructed life, a way to enforce his image as a gentle knight on a noble crusade, with none of the vices that Italians have come to expect in their politicians. In fact, he has very few. He isn’t a womanizer. He isn’t corrupt, or even, by all reports, interested in money. One of his first appointments was Raffaele Cantone, a Naples magistrate who had heroically pursued the Camorra for twenty years. Renzi created an anti-corruption authority for Cantone—three hundred men and women working together from Rome to dismantle a system so criminally interconnected that Cantone described their job to me as “an unending process.” Renzi gave Cantone carte blanche and his office an independent charter. “I am not a friend,” Cantone, who barely knew Renzi when he took the job, told me. “I appreciate him. At the beginning, he asked me only one thing. He said, ‘Raffaele, if someone calls you in my name and asks something, or asks for something, don’t do it!’ ”","1847","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi’s one vice may be his keen interest in controlling what he would call “the narrative” of his entitlement. Annunziata, who admired the Prime Minister at first, now counts herself a Renzi skeptic. “He has that Bill Clinton look,” she told me. “The one where he looks deep into your eyes, promising everything, and all of a sudden the look goes over your shoulder to the next person. There was always a mystery to him. He had the sagacity to know that his moment had come. He knew the extent to which Rome was rotten, and he was good at picking up on the old age and bankruptcy of the Democratic Party—that Italy was still all about postwar politics, left and right. He felt accurately the resentment in Italy, the stagnation. So he swooped down.” Like a knight? I asked her. “Like the Vandals,” she said.","1848","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Like any politician, Renzi courts the journalists who praise him and gives wide berth to the ones who don’t. But most reporters in Rome will tell you that Renzi has two governments—his official cabinet and house advisers and his Chigi kitchen cabinet of Tuscan strategists, otherwise known as the giglio magico, or magic lily, for the flower on Catherine de’ Medici’s coat of arms—and that access to the latter is blocked. (It was to me.) The one exception seems to have been a reporter from Il Foglio, a weekly paper with close ties to Berlusconi, who described the after-hours Chigi as a place in glorious disarray, where the young Tuscans are busy running Italy, barefoot in T-shirts, eating takeout pizza.","1849","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"There is nothing new about politicians trying out their ideas and tactics on friends whose loyalty is first and foremost to them, and whose discretion is a given. Barack Obama installed his Chicago cronies David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett in the White House. David Cameron gave pride of place at 10 Downing Street to his plummy Eton crowd. The difference, with Renzi, is that his giglio magico remains an open secret, and no one can say for sure whether it is actually “running Italy” with him or simply running errands.","1850","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Some of the Tuscans in Renzi’s kitchen cabinet are in his government, too—most famously Luca Lotti, a thirty-four-year-old under-secretary of state for publications, otherwise known as the Chigi’s most accomplished fixer. (Lotti, whose wife was Renzi’s secretary when he was mayor of Florence, was instrumental in arranging the meetings that produced the Nazarene Pact.) Another is Maria Elena Boschi, who studied law in Florence a few years after Renzi and is now, to mixed reviews, his minister for constitutional reform. And a third is said to be Francesco Bonifazi, a Florence lawyer and Democratic Party deputy who, with Lotti, is hoping to revive the defunct Communist daily L’Unita as a center-left “Renziani” newspaper. The others vary, depending on Renzi’s enthusiasm and on whom you ask. “In the end, it’s the inner circle that counts for Renzi,” Franco Bernabe told me. “With the cabinet, ‘young’ or ‘woman’ didn’t necessarily mean capable. . . . Some ministers performed, some didn’t. The difference, with the Chigi group, is that Renzi trusts them”—which is to say, they perform for him.","1851","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Last fall, Renzi sent his first foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, to Brussels to become the new European high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, and today she and her replacement at the ministry, Paolo Gentiloni, have the difficult job of garnering European support for the possibility of Italian troops in Libya. ISIS is now a major player in Libya’s civil war—which, as Renzi said when he first threatened to intervene, in February, puts terrorists two hours by boat from Italy’s shores. During his first year in office, a hundred and seventy thousand refugees from the violence in Africa and the Middle East arrived on southern Italy’s islands, most of them plucked from the sea by Italian Navy ships, or from the sinking rubber boats of their Libyan traffickers. The ships were part of a humanitarian patrol-and-rescue mission called Mare Nostrum (Our Sea), which Letta’s government initiated in the fall of 2013, and which Renzi had to cancel a year later, under pressure from his coalition and, more significant, from E.U. members who argued that the success of Mare Nostrum’s rescue operation was actually encouraging migration: too much, at any rate, for a continent already packed with refugees and migrant workers to handle. The E.U. replaced Mare Nostrum with a much smaller operation called Triton, and confined it to sea and air patrolling—in other words, to deterrence. Whatever refugees it did rescue were deposited in Italy.","1852","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi, in a widely circulated op-ed in the Times in April, called Triton “dramatically inadequate.” He pleaded with Europe to take on its humanitarian share, pointing out that Triton’s budget was a fraction of Mare Nostrum’s, and amounted to only forty million euros out of the yearly E.U. budget of a hundred and forty-five billion. Less than a month later, the European Commission proposed a formula involving an emergency refugee-quota system for each of its member states, based on the state’s size, solvency, unemployment figures, and pending asylum claims. Its future is uncertain. (Britain, France, and Spain have already refused to participate.) Today, with human trafficking fast becoming one of Libya’s only profitable businesses, and refugees still arriving in huge numbers—upward of fifty thousand so far this year, not to mention the more than seventeen hundred and fifty who drowned trying, including eight hundred in a single day—the burden for Italy is undeniable. Last month, the Italian police arrested a Moroccan man who had entered Italy with a boatload of refugees in February and was now wanted for providing “logistical support” to the massacre at a museum in Tunis in March.","1853","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"At the beginning of this year, Italy’s sovereign debt—moneys owed by the state to all public and private lenders—was 2.16 trillion euros. Monti had tried to stem the debt with rigorous “European” measures, and failed. Letta had simply failed. Now it’s Renzi’s turn. None of his other reforms will mean much unless he can turn around the fiscal and economic crises he inherited. Napolitano is said to have put one condition on appointing him, and that was that Renzi choose a finance minister with international experience and standing. At the time, the most that anyone knew about Renzi’s economic views was his belief in what could be called global capitalism as a transformative—which is to say, potentially progressive—force for social and economic change. He was said to be getting economic advice from a Democratic Party deputy named Yoram Gutgeld, a veteran of twenty-four years with the growth-management giant McKinsey, and trying it out on one of his closest friends in Florence, Marco Carrai—a successful young businessman and investor whom, as mayor, he had installed as president of the Florence Airport. Carrai is not an economist. Among other pursuits, he is developing security technology in Israel, and he shares Renzi’s strong support for the country in an increasingly dismissive Europe.","1854","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi made his decision quickly. The man he tapped for the ministry of finance and the economy was Pier Carlo Padoan, a sixty-five-year-old veteran of the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, where he was the chief economist and deputy secretary-general. He came to the job with no political agenda but with a lot of good will from Europe, and a strong sense of the problems he was about to face.","1855","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"“My view of what needs to be done is to address a combination of three problems that have been rigid impediments to our growth,” Padoan told me. “And we need to do that now. One is boosting growth through tax cuts for both companies and households. Another, of course, is supporting innovation.” (Renzi, returning from his “innovation” trip to California, had promised Italy its own Silicon Valley.) “And the third is introducing the kind of structural reforms that could lead to a new European Code—one that specified that countries implementing sound reforms could benefit from an allowance if the investment involved was seen as promoting incentive and growth.” He said that the budget law under discussion would “change the logic by which public money is used.” And the ongoing tax reforms would not only simplify taxes but “change the taxpayer’s relation” to the taxes he has to pay, which is to say that tax evasion—a national pastime that Berlusconi decriminalized in 2002 and Renzi recriminalized this year—has been redefined to include the off-the-books jobs that are said to account for up to twenty per cent of Italy’s economy.","1856","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Padoan was expected to have a tempering effect on Renzi, but Renzi is a notorious micromanager. “Oops, there’s a text from Mr. Renzi, he always texts,” Padoan said, a few minutes into our conversation, texting back. Minutes later, he got a second text. He answered it, and not much later his cell phone rang. He took the call, laughing. “It’s Mr. Renzi again,” he told me. “It’s normal. That’s Renzi.”","1857","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Then, too, Padoan’s instincts are incremental: first Italy, then the world. Renzi’s are the world. In December, he added Andrea Guerra—the former C.E.O. of Luxottica, the global eyewear company that owns Ray-Ban—to his Chigi team of senior economic advisers. The team is led by a like-minded state secretary for international economic affairs named Marco Simoni, whom Renzi met when Simoni, a young professor at the London School of Economics, came to speak at the first Leopolda. “The paradox is that, in the past, Italy passed plenty of economic reforms, but they were badly conceived and badly executed,” Simoni told me. “There was no defense of income, no economic protection. We are definitely free market. But unlike Mrs. Thatcher—she’s the example we use in England—we want growth and social justice, and the fact is that countries that have externalized more, that have looked to the huge developing markets in India, China, South America, end up with a better, fairer economy at home. Our point? You can’t divorce your national and international agenda. It’s one single polity now.”","1858","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Italy’s Democratic Party, in its new, “Renziani” incarnation—think Clinton-Blair for the twenty-first century—is a warring clan of former Communists, Socialists, Social Democrats, Christian Democrats, and liberal entrepreneurs, each faction circling the others warily and hoping they will go away. I sat in on the Party’s board-of-directors meeting, on the Largo del Nazareno, late last winter. Renzi gave the opening speech. It covered the subjects he wanted to see discussed, from the attacks in Paris to the progress in Brussels, the construction-kickback scandals then surfacing in Milan, the parliamentary chaos that had left one house debating electoral reform and the other public-administration reform, and, finally, the lazy pace of the Party’s own discussions about those issues. “This isn’t a joke; discussion is not ‘optional,’ ” he said. But the only thing that most of the other speakers wanted to “discuss” was the result of a regional primary election in Liguria that Renzi’s handpicked reform candidate had won and his opposition on the left—having forced, and lost, a recount—was still protesting. Some twenty board members stood up, one by one, and presented mind-numbing catalogues of their complaints. Renzi listened for three hours, texting and typing notes, and then he looked over the notes he’d made and responded to each complaint in increasingly exasperated detail. But his closing message was succinct: No more Liguria; Liguria is over. Let’s practice being united. Stop blocking my electoral reforms, and let the party that can win this—that’s us—govern.","1859","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"“I keep saying, ‘Matteo, you have to run, run, run for the solution, because if you run fast the solution to your problem comes,’ ” Renzi’s friend and arguably most colorful supporter, Oscar Farinetti, the paterfamilias of the Eataly food-emporium empire, told me a few days later. “Matteo and I are both so busy, but in the morning, at six, we text. For six months, it’s been about the eighty-euro thing.” He was talking about an eighty-euro-a-month tax credit that Renzi started giving to low-paid workers last year, hoping to stimulate spending; by all indications, they were saving the money instead. “Matteo asks, ‘How about Eataly? Is business growing?’ At first, I had to say ‘No!’ But suddenly, in December, I could say ‘Yes!’ People started spending, and they haven’t stopped. I tell him, ‘Matteo, humans aren’t perfect. To manage the imperfection, you have to keep at it.’ ”","1860","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"When Renzi talks about his enemies, first among equals is always his own left wing. “My opposition on the left is an ideological one,” he once told me. “I don’t think it’s important to discuss anything with them anymore.” He is far more comfortable with his center-left, center-right coalition, perhaps because, in the end, he likes the idea of “center” best. But his enemies list remains long. There are still Berlusconi loyalists in parliament, though by all reports that loyalty is fizzling now. More seriously disruptive are the comedian Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement, on the populist left, and Matteo Salvini’s new “national” Lega party, on the populist right, both competing for the same anti-Europe, anti-immigrant votes. They keep Renzi busy, however undaunted he claims to be.","1861","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Grillo founded his gadfly party in 2009, and the fans who had flocked to his standup act now flock to his rallies in the Piazza del Popolo. “I’m a performer, and when there’s a strategy I know it,” he told me. “Renzi says, ‘I did this, we did that,’ and people think he’s the last chance for Italy, but, no, he’s the last chance for the bankers.” It was hard to tell whether Grillo was railing against the notion of a transformative capitalism or about the fact that Renzi, who had begun to unblock the country’s electoral system by abolishing state subsidies for political parties, was raising money for his own party from investment bankers and financiers (among them James Pallotta, the American hedge-fund manager and now the president of the soccer team A.S. Roma). Grillo’s party, which is mainly a volunteer Internet operation, has little or no money. It also happens to be the second-largest party in the Camera, although its power to do anything besides filibuster is nonexistent. Grillo forbids his deputies to enter into a coalition, and even removes the ones who disagree with him. (In a way, Renzi owes his job to Grillo, who refused to form a governing coalition with the Democrats after the parliamentary elections in 2013, when their party leader was the labor-left politician Pier Luigi Bersani.)","1862","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"David Allegranti, a young journalist in Rome, told me, “Grillo as a threat? Come on! There are Grillo deputies who believe in mermaids; there are deputies who believe that the jet streams you see in the sky are chemical weapons!” Allegranti, who comes from Florence and has written two books about Renzi, said that the Prime Minister cultivates his image as a man beleaguered by crazies because it makes him seem “more essential” to saving Italy. Maybe. Last year, Grillo made the perhaps inevitable mistake of allying his Five Star Movement with Britain’s far-right United Kingdom Independence Party, in an attempt, eventually thwarted, to form a secessionist bloc in the European Parliament. People quickly predicted that he would self-destruct. They were wrong.","1863","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Then there is “the other Matteo”—Matteo Salvini—and his “new” Lega. In the days when Lega was the powerful junior partner in Berlusconi’s coalition, it was known as Lega Nord. Its cause was separatism—Italy as a federation of fiscally independent regions—the idea being to free the prosperous North from having to pay the bills of an impoverished and, as Salvini puts it, “culturally different” South. Salvini, who took over Lega Nord in 2013 (a year and a half after its founder, Umberto Bossi, came under investigation for siphoning large amounts of party money to restore his house, an allegation he denied), has a bigger canvas. “I wish all the bad possible for Renzi’s reform plan,” he told me, on a call from Milan. “As for Angela Merkel, I say, ‘Brava!,’ for trying to defend the interests of Germany in Europe, but we are not interested in Europe. We are interested in Italy.” To that end, he has dropped the Nord from most of his speeches and has gone national with the Party. He said that the growth of Lega in central Italy had persuaded him to “coördinate all Italy” under an anti-Europe and anti-immigration banner. (“Only qualified immigration” is how he pitched this to me.) He has found a champion in France’s Marine Le Pen and her ur-Nationalist allies in Austria and Holland, and dismisses Grillo as “much too soft on immigration.” (Grillo wants Italy out of Europe more than he wants immigrants out of Italy.)","1864","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi’s concern is that terrorists now fighting over Libya could slip into Italy, undetected, in the boatloads of refugees trying to flee them. Salvini’s concern is that anyone arrives at all. He claimed that there were “twenty-five hundred Islamic cultural centers and mosques in Lombardy” alone, and talked about veiled women all over the housing projects and a proliferation of Islamist media and schools. He called it a transformation “such as we have never seen before.” In February—heartened, he says, by the support for Lega in central Italy—he launched his campaign for the South, where xenophobia can be fuelled by ignorance, fear, and racist propaganda in pretty much equal measure.","1865","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"“I went to Strasbourg to speak last year, during my E.U. presidency, and Grillo’s people were shouting ‘Mafia!’ at me, and, when I mentioned Dante Alighieri, Salvini started mocking art,” Renzi told me. He talked about listening to Obama’s State of the Union address, and how much he “appreciated the respect” that the President got. (If he had watched it instead, and seen the Tea Party contingent smirking, he might have thought again.) “This year, I will change Italy or change jobs,” Renzi said, not for the first time. “The far left is not in a position to stop my government, only to vote against it and call strikes. But the people know that this is the moment when Italy must change. The old Democratic Party got twenty-five per cent of the vote in the last national elections, but, remember, my Democratic Party got forty-one per cent in the European elections last year—that’s sixteen percentage points in one year.”","1866","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi complains about the left as often as he dismisses it. For all his bravado, he is easily aggrieved, a quality he shares with Berlusconi and, like Berlusconi, uses to elicit sympathy and support. Sergio Rizzo is an investigative journalist for Corriere della Sera and the co-author of “La Casta,” a best-selling book about the extravagant corruption of Italy’s political classes. He told me, “I think that Renzi can change the politics here, I really do, but the serious problems are that he’s very close to power, and, more important, that he tolerates only people around him who agree with him. He doesn’t take well to being crossed. Now when he has an announcement to make he doesn’t make it to his party; he goes on television instead.”","1867","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Carlo Freccero, who once ran Berlusconi’s French television channel La Cinq and came home to run a channel for him at RAI, calls Renzi “Berlusconi 2.0”—someone who grasps completely the extent to which, in Italy, politics is theatre and successful politics is a one-man show. It’s a tradition as old as the Roman emperors, with their triumphal parades and eviscerating circuses. Mussolini emulated it for twenty years, with dire consequences for the country. Berlusconi turned it into opera buffa, was in office longer than any other Italian Prime Minister, and ended up in court. “In one way, Renzi is a monument to Berlusconi,” Freccero told me. “He is a man of spectacle, of entertainment. He knows that ‘communications’ today is a trompe-l’oeil, and he’s embraced the reality of that, and the language of that. It’s a ritornello, a continual refrain: ‘Be America! Be the future! Take back the narrative of Europe! Compete!’ He wants to be every Italian’s selfie.”","1868","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Giuliano Ferrara, who founded Il Foglio and edited the paper until this year, said, “There’s something very psychological between Renzi and Berlusconi. Berlusconi has no political heirs, so Renzi is the royal baby. When Renzi was mayor of Florence and Berlusconi was under siege by the magistrates, Renzi went to his home in Milan and had a very human meeting with him. I admired that. And when he became Prime Minister he said, in effect, ‘I want to compete with you, not destroy you.’ ” That, of course, is what he is saying to Angela Merkel now.","1869","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Despite the populist filibusters and the grumbling of the ideological Old Guard, Renzi has managed to transform the political landscape of Italy in not much more than a year. On May 4th, his electoral law passed the Camera. The warnings before the voting had been strong. The editor of Corriere, referring to Francisco Franco, called Renzi a “young caudillo.” The editor of La Repubblica called his bill “weakness, disguised as a show of strength.” And one of the Democrats’ rebel-left leaders, Giuseppe Civati, described it as “genetically modified Presidentialism” and promptly quit the Party, with plans to start a new one of his own. Inevitably, more defections followed, and several Democratic deputies let it be known that they would vote against the law. Renzi had turned the electoral vote into a vote of confidence; the balloting was secret. Most of the opposition parties—including, on Berlusconi’s orders, Forza Italia—refused to vote or walked out. But the bill passed easily without them. After the votes were counted and the news went out (334 in favor, 61 opposed, 4 abstentions, 235 walkouts), it was clear that most Italians liked the prospect of electing governments that might actually last their five-year term. Corriere announced that Renzi “is today, and probably will be for a long time, unbeatable, unsinkable.” The law is due to go into effect at the end of June, 2016, assuming that the Constitutional Court approves it.","1870","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi, meanwhile, was making the television circuit. It’s now likely that his constitutional-reform bill will go straight to a national referendum later next summer—and the Senate, which he had first planned to overhaul this summer, will be radically transformed by constitutional change. An early election could come next. But Renzi must have expected to take some knocks by then, and it turned out that he got them quickly, when, late last month, seven of Italy’s twenty regions held elections.","1871","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"In Liguria—which definitely wasn’t “over”—the Democrats’ left-labor wing ran its own, breakaway candidate, splitting the Party’s vote, with the result that a coalition of the right took the region. And while the Party did win five of those seven regions, the vote was nowhere close to its benchmark forty-one per cent in Europe last year. The problem for Renzi was in part apathy. Voters in Italy tend to sit out local elections unless there’s money or a grudge or a job or old loyalties at stake, but the low turnout also contained a message. Renzi may have promised the country too much, too fast, for any politician to deliver.","1872","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Renzi, who left the country on a “surprise visit” to Italian troops in Afghanistan as the election returns came in, called them “very positive,” and produced a short statement saying, “We will push forward with even more determination in the process of renewing the Party and changing this country”—after which he ignored them. It wasn’t the worst response. Employment was rising; growth projections, which had been negative since Italy’s latest recession began, in 2012, were back above the zero line; and consumption, as Renzi put it after the G7 summit in Bavaria this month, was “showing signs of a reawakening.” People can admit to being optimistic.","1873","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Earlier this year, I had asked Marianna Madia, Renzi’s minister for public administration, how he did it, and she said, laughing, “Velocity and rupture!” When I put the question to Graziano Delrio, his former chief of staff at the Chigi (and now, in the wake of the construction scandals in Milan, his minister for infrastructure), he said that the mantra was: Decide, then we’ll see. “We wanted to give a violent shock to the Italian system,” he told me. “To the psychology, yes, to the culture, yes, but also to the economy, to labor, to business. And most important was that we started. We had a system based on nepotism and seniority. But our duty was to prepare our young people for taking power, and those young people didn’t want to wait in line while the old system got worse and worse.” A moment later, he added, “It’s been quite difficult for us to forge a social contract in a country of so much adventurism and so little clarity in its institutions.”","1874","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"It may be that, in the end, Matteo Renzi’s future in Italy depends on his future in Angela Merkel’s Europe. Many of the politicians I talked to complained about their frustration in finding common ground with the E.U.’s northern states. “We are not the United States of Europe” is how Delrio put it, talking about the days when Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman, the union’s founding fathers, could look to carbon and steel as the way to create unity and address poverty in a devastated continent.

"Merkel is a Lutheran pastor’s daughter who grew up in East Germany during the Cold War, when thrift was not an option but an order of the Politburo. In West Germany, recovery began early, with the Marshall Plan, and continued under an Allied occupation that lasted ten years. Its bombed-out cities and factories were rebuilt and, slowly, its infrastructure was restored. Konrad Adenauer, who in 1949 became the first postwar Chancellor of the Federal Republic, was a Roman Catholic, but there was also a cool Lutheran frugality lurking inside him. He was in office for fourteen years, when thrift was an option. He took it. So did Helmut Kohl, who was Chancellor in the nineteen-nineties, when the Federal Republic absorbed East Germany. The country got fat and rich during all those years, but in hard economic times its governments followed the dictum “Don’t borrow, don’t spend.”","1876","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Italy, at the beginning of the Second World War, was still largely an agrarian country. Most of its contadini were illiterate; its agricultural arrangements in many regions were close to feudal. And “infrastructure” meant the family, the Church, the party, and, in much of the South, the mafias—umbrellas of support, protection, and, of course, jobs, under different names. In that sense, Italy emerged from the war unchanged. You took care of your own, bought into the swamp, and ignored the indicators of collapse. The perimeters of a good life depended on the umbrella under which you sheltered. You built your house there, put your money under the mattress, and did not invest in anything beyond it. The government did that for you. By the seventies, it was spending and spending, spreading a patchwork quilt of employment and subsidy over your mattress. By the mid-nineties, when the reformist Prime Minister Romano Prodi was elected and tried—and failed—to mend it, the country was going broke. When Mario Monti tried, it was broke, and, as for Enrico Letta, he didn’t stand a chance. Today, when Matteo Renzi asks for stimulus money for recovery, he is starting practically from scratch. The one thing his Italy shares with Merkel’s Germany is the reality of a European divide.","1877","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"Monti told me that, when he was Prime Minister and visited Barack Obama at the White House, Obama admitted to being at a loss to know “how to engage Merkel on matters of economic policy.” Obama asked his advice, and Monti replied, “For Germans, economics is still part of moral philosophy, so don’t even try to suggest that the way to help Europe grow is through public spending. In Germany, growth is the reward for virtuous economics, and the word for ‘guilt’ and ‘debt’ is the same.”","1878","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-demolition-man"
"It’s safe to say that guilt is not a problem in a country of Sunday confessional absolution. This is a battle that Renzi has to win. “For me, the point is that Italy has come back into the discussion of ‘What is Europe?’ ” he told me, when we last talked. “In the past, the message was always that ‘Europe’ would teach Italy what to do. The real message now is that we are Europe. The perspective has changed. Politics needs passions. Otherwise, you are not the star, you are just a supporting actor.” I asked how long he was planning to play the leading role, and he said that, if all went well, he would be able to get the country to its next scheduled parliamentary elections, in 2018, and then, if he’d been successful and “the people want it,” he would run again—in which case, “on February 22, 2024, I’ll leave.

Although he finished ten points behind “uncommitted,” Carter won the state.

I met Carter at about that time, in upstate New York; he was there to meet local Party officials and, accompanied by an entourage of about two people, worked the room, saying again and again, “I’m Jimmy Carter, from Georgia!”","1882","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"So far this year, only one big-league Democrat, Hillary Clinton, has declared her candidacy, and she promptly set out for Iowa. Her visit lasted three days, taking her to “small” events, including a fast-food meal, and she brought along dozens of campaign workers, who will stay behind and keep working there. In an op-ed published in the Des Moines Register, she talked about the “great ideas” she got from her trip: “I will carry the stories and wisdom of the Iowans I met with me throughout the campaign and hopefully onto the White House.” According to the Washington Post, Clinton’s op-ed mentioned five Iowans, all of whom happened to be among the thirteen selected for one of her carefully organized roundtables. Not much was being left to chance.","1883","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"Clinton is some forty points ahead of other Democrats in Iowa, so it’s easy to write off her potential competitors, among them the former Maryland governor (and, ahem, former Baltimore mayor) Martin O’Malley and the former Virginia senator Jim Webb, both of whom are “exploring” possible runs; and the independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who calls himself a Democratic Socialist, and who has skipped the exploration step. Sanders’s appeal is close to that of the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who seems to mean it when she says she’s not running, although, as Ryan Lizza reported, she intends to make her influence felt.","1884","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"But for all that, perhaps it’s too early to declare the race over. Webb is a particularly interesting case. Like Jimmy Carter, he’s a Southerner, a veteran (in Webb’s case, a decorated combat veteran), and out of step with the Party on some issues (he strongly supports gun ownership). Yet, like Warren and Sanders, he has little sympathy for Wall Street (for years, he’s made an issue of income inequality), and he showed an early willingness to take on such issues as mass incarceration—“courageously stepping into the void, calling for a national commission to re-assess criminal justice policy,” as a Times editorial put it in 2008. (Clinton, in the wake of the rioting in Baltimore, just made it one of her issues, too.)","1885","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"The candidacies of O’Malley, Sanders, and Webb, and probably others, might be seen as an updated version of the Carter experiment—to discover, as Webb recently told George Stephanopoulos, whether it’s “possible to conduct a viable campaign” in conditions that, in 2016, seem to make the venture preposterously out of reach. The former Florida governor Jeb Bush, one of the Republican front-runners, referred to those conditions the other day when he said that a candidate shouldn’t need a billion dollars to run (this is the obscene amount that Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, give or take a few million, each spent in 2012) while announcing that he’d already set a record for fund-raising in the first hundred days. (Bush didn’t reveal figures, but the Wall Street Journal noted that the previous record was held by Hillary Clinton, who raised thirty-six million dollars in her first hundred days, in 2008.)","1886","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"Unlike the Republicans, who have already scheduled at least six debates before the Iowa caucuses, the Democratic schedule is T.B.D., and it’s possible that voters won’t even get a chance to see the Democratic candidates side by side. Clinton was often formidable in debates in 2008, when she competed with Barack Obama, as was Webb in 2007, when Democrats picked him to respond to George W. Bush’s State of the Union message. He addressed income disparity (“When one looks at the health of our economy, it’s almost as if we are living in two different countries”) and, with devastating accuracy, Iraq: “The President took us into this war recklessly. He disregarded warnings from the National Security Advisor during the first Gulf War, the chief of staff of the Army, two former commanding generals of the Central Command … and many, many others with great integrity and long experience in national-security affairs. We are now, as a nation, held hostage to the predictable ­ and predicted ­ disarray that has followed.” Webb, though, didn’t seek reëlection in 2012, in large part because he deeply disliked the business, and the politicking, of politics, a real drawback if he is serious about running for President. And if he is serious, he will no doubt have to revisit some earlier statements, such as in a 1979 magazine article in which he argued against a combat role for women in the military, and his complicated view of affirmative action. Yet he appears able to change his mind; like many others, he has been “evolving” on the question of same-sex marriage, and on “Meet the Press” said, “I think this has been a good thing for the country.”","1887","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has weaknesses that won’t simply vanish—most recently, the bad publicity surrounding the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, a charitable enterprise vulnerable to charges of mismanagement and conflicts of interest, which, as the New York columnist Jonathan Chait wrote, was “a kind of quasi-government run by themselves, which was staffed by their own loyalists and made up the rules as it went along.” All that is only increasing the appetite of the Republican contenders. There are many on that side, some of them unnervingly weird, all of them ravenous for the Presidency, and all wanting nothing more than to face a candidate who, like Jeb Bush, will have a hard time exciting voters looking for nondynastic faces and fresh ideas.","1888","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"

No one would have paid attention to him.” That was in a time before techno-consultants and bottomless wells of money, when it still seemed possible for a Jim or Martin or Bernie “Who?” to alter a race whose outcome appeared predetermined.

And, in fact, you could see the thousand-page bill they’ve produced as, in the words of the Times, “real progress,” except for one thing: their complicated, jury-rigged plan is only necessary because of the continued refusal by Congress to embrace the obvious, economically sensible solution to highway funding, namely raising the gas tax.","July 24, 2015","1890","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"The federal gas tax is, as it should be, a key source of funding for highway spending. Currently, the tax is 18.4 cents per gallon. The problem is that it has been 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. And since the cost of building and, above all, repairing roads has risen substantially in the past twenty-two years, because of inflation and because the federal highway system is deteriorating, while the revenue from the gas tax hasn’t risen nearly as much, Congress has had to find other ways to make up the difference. In recent times, those fixes have all been short term, which is why the Boxer-McConnell plan, which would fund spending for three entire years, seems to some like a real improvement.","1891","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"The problem is that the funding mechanisms the plan relies on are as gimmicky and haphazard as ever. The bill would raise money by, among other things, lowering the dividend rate paid to banks in the Federal Reserve system, raising certain customs fees, increasing collection rates on unpaid taxes, and selling off a hundred and one million barrels of oil from the country’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Some of these may, on their own, be reasonable ideas—although, if you’re going to have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve, you should probably only sell oil from it for strategic reasons, not just because you want to raise some cash. But they are, for the most part, stopgap measures, meaning that Congress won’t be able to rely on them the next time around. And, from an economic perspective, paying for operating expenses by selling off assets is not a good way to manage your money.","1892","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"What’s especially infuriating about the bill is that we already have, in the gas tax, an ideal tool for raising money to pay for highway repairs. It’s a user tax: if you don’t drive you don’t pay it, and if you drive less it costs you less. It helps to correct, at least mildly, a clear market failure: people who drive don’t pay the full costs of the externalities they create, including the wear and tear they put on roads, the pollution they emit, and the congestion they help produce. And while certain taxes disincentivize, to some degree, things we like (such as work or investment), the gas tax, by raising the cost of driving, gets us less of things we don’t like (pollution, carbon emissions, and road wear). That’s why even conservative economists, like Gregory Mankiw, have been ardent advocates of gasoline taxes. This is also an excellent moment to raise the gas tax, since oil and gas prices are so much lower than they were, making any price increase at the pump more palatable to drivers.","1893","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"Members of Congress have tried to get Washington to do the logical thing. Last year, Republican Senator Bob Corker and Democratic Senator Chris Murphy worked together on a bill that would have increased the gas tax by twelve cents over two years and then indexed it to inflation, in an attempt to insure that it kept pace with infrastructure needs. The plan wasn’t perfect (in order to make the hike palatable to conservatives, it made some temporary tax breaks permanent), but it was well considered, and would have made the value of today’s tax roughly equivalent to what it was in 1993. But the bill never even came up for a vote.","1894","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"The fundamental problem, of course, is that raising taxes, no matter how economically sensible those taxes might be, is anathema to a huge swath of the Republican Party. (It’s hardly a coincidence that the last gas-tax increase came in 1993, just before the G.O.P.’s Contract with America transformed Congress.) And Republican resistance, in turn, makes it harder for Democrats to vote for tax increases, at least those that affect ordinary citizens, because they know that Republican challengers will use their votes against them.","1895","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"Indeed, the refusal of Congress to raise the gas tax is the ultimate expression of how reflexive and irrational the resistance to taxes has become. Opposition to higher income taxes has some theoretical justification: higher marginal rates discourage people from working more and investing. Seen in one light, they’re a penalty for success. But no such argument exists against the gas tax: all it does, in essence, is ask drivers to pay for the roads they use. It’s not even fair to say that keeping this tax at its current level is a check on big government, since most federal highway spending now goes toward rebuilding and repairing roads—maintenance that even conservatives recognize we must do.","1896","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"Highway revenue has to be raised somehow. Congress should show some political spine, discard the Rube Goldberg funding schemes, and stop treating all taxes as bad ones.","1897","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"In 2013, when the Supreme Court effectively struck down a crucial section of the Voting Rights Act, the disagreement between the five conservative Justices in the majority and the four moderate liberals in dissent was about history as much as law.","August 7, 2015","1898","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"For the conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts, Jr., wrote, “Our country has changed” since the statute became law fifty years ago. Devices that once blocked minorities’ access to the ballot, like the voter fees known as poll taxes, had been outlawed for more than forty years. The percentages of whites and minorities who register to vote and then go to the polls are approaching parity in the South and other parts of the country where, half a century ago, they were far apart. It is no longer necessary, Roberts went on, for the federal government to pre-approve any proposed changes to election laws in states with records of entrenched discrimination, as the statute had required since 1965.","1899","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"For the moderate liberals, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg responded that pre-approval, or pre-clearance, was still necessary to “facilitate completion of the impressive gains thus far made” against discrimination that kept blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities defined by race or color from voting and to “guard against back sliding.” The tactics that are used today to limit the voting power of minorities, like racial gerrymandering and the adoption of at-large voting districts, are more subtle than the devices that blocked access to voting half a century ago, Ginsburg wrote. But these second-generation barriers cut “down the right to vote as certainly as denial of access to the ballot.”","1900","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"The Roberts view reflects what the Harvard historian Alexander Keyssar, in “The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States,” called the “triumphalist presumption: a deeply embedded, yet virtually unspoken, notion that the history of suffrage is the history of gradual, inevitable reform and progress.” The Ginsburg view takes into account what Keyssar described as cycles of gain and loss in the right to vote—“a history of both expansion and contraction, of inclusion and exclusion, of shifts in direction and momentum at different places and at different times.”","1901","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"Keyssar documented why Ginsburg is correct. In his authoritative and prize-winning account, he explained, “Our history is complex, at times contradictory, befitting a nation that began as a republic that tolerated slavery. The evolution of democracy rarely followed a straight path, and it always has been accompanied by profound antidemocratic currents.”","1902","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"The latest expression of these currents are strict voter-I.D. laws, which allow a voter to exercise his right to vote only if he presents a government-issued photo ID or another designated form of identification, like a utility bill or a bank statement. These laws are now in effect in ten states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures—in southern states like Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee, and in Republican strongholds like Arizona and Kansas. A state court has struck down the laws in three other states, one state agreed to soften its law at the insistence of the Justice Department in a pre-clearance process, and one state’s law is scheduled to go into effect next year.","1903","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"“The new ID laws have almost invariably been sponsored—and promoted—by Republicans,” Keyssar wrote, “who claim that they are needed to prevent fraud.”","1904","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"The type of fraud they supposedly guard against is impersonation, when a would-be voter pretends to be someone else. This fraud, Keyssar reported, “is exceedingly rare”—especially compared with voter fraud in absentee balloting, which is abundant yet largely unaddressed. There were no documented cases of voter impersonation in the history of Indiana when, a decade ago, the state legislature passed its strict photo-I.D. law, with every Republican and not one Democrat voting for it. In 2008, the Supreme Court upheld the Indiana law by a vote of 6-3; all of the Justices who voted in favor had been appointed by Republican Presidents.","1905","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"Judge Richard Posner, who wrote the majority opinion about the Indiana law for the federal appeals court that upheld it, has since said that he was wrong. Strict voter-I.D. laws, he wrote two years ago in his book “Reflections on Judging,” are “now widely regarded as a means of voter suppression rather than of fraud prevention.” In a dissent last October about another I.D.-law case, he added that the “net effect of such requirements is to impede voting by people easily discouraged from voting, most of whom probably lean Democratic.” A group of political scientists wrote last year in Political Research Quarterly that Republican-backed voter-I.D. laws “mobilize the base and champion electoral reforms that incidentally may demobilize Democratic supporters.”","1906","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"In 2012, The Government Accountability Office found that the strict voter-I.D. laws in Kansas and Tennessee had reduced voter turnout from 2008 to 2012 by approximately two to three per cent. The Brennan Center reported that, in 2014, voter-I.D. laws may have been factors in the election of Republicans to the U.S. Senate in North Carolina and to the Governor’s office in Florida and Kansas. Michael Waldman, the president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, told the Times, “There had not been this many restrictive voting laws in the states since the Jim Crow era.”","1907","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"In 2011, the Texas Legislature passed a strict photo-I.D. law, even though, in the decade before the law went into effect, only two cases of voter-impersonation fraud in the state had yielded convictions. Last October, the federal district judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi, Texas, struck down the law, holding that, in ostensibly addressing a “negligible” problem, the Texas law “creates an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote, has an impermissible discriminatory effect against Hispanics and African-Americans, and was imposed with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose” and that, in addition, it “constitutes an unconstitutional poll tax.” Ramos emphasized that voting restrictions are just one facet of the racial discrimination that has “permeated all aspects of life in Texas”—“in education, employment, housing, and transportation, which are the natural result of long and systematic racial discrimination.” She also underscored that the voter-I.D. law is just one of the forms of bullying that minorities face when they go to vote, which “poll watchers who dress in law enforcement-style clothing for an intimidating effect.”","1908","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"These efforts “to suppress minority voting” stretch back to “the early days of Texas,” Ramos wrote. From 1895 to 1944, the state used all-white primaries to disenfranchise minority voters. From 1905 to 1970, the state used literacy restrictions to keep blacks who had been enslaved or had limited opportunities for education in the Jim Crow South from voting. From 1902 to 1966, the state required that voters pay to vote, which, Ramos made clear, “was intended to, and had the effect of, suppressing the African-American vote.” Even more important, “In each instance, the Texas Legislature relied on the justification that its discriminatory measures were necessary to combat voter fraud,” as it now has with its voter-I.D. law.","1909","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"This week, by a vote of 3-0, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which includes Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, decided the state’s appeal of the judgment in the trial court. The ruling is a notable victory for voting rights, but a narrower one than headlines may have suggested.","1910","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"The Fifth Circuit agreed that Texas’s law “has a discriminatory effect in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,” overturned the holding that the law “is a poll tax,” and, most significantly, ordered Ramos to reconsider her holding that the law “was enacted with a racially discriminatory purpose.” She must reconsider the question by asking “not whether legislators were aware of” the law’s “racially discriminatory effect, but whether the law was passed because of that disparate impact.” And, as the Supreme Court had required in its 2013 ruling, among other decisions, the Fifth Circuit wrote that she must do so by focussing on “relatively recent history, not long-past history.”","1911","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"The appeals court said, “We recognize that evaluating motive, particularly the motive of dozens of people, is a difficult enterprise. We recognize the charged nature of accusations of racism, particularly against a legislative body, but we also recognize the sad truth that racism continues to exist in our modern American society despite years of laws designed to eradicate it.”","1912","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"In the meantime, as the appeals court emphasized, the Texas law “continues to be enforced.” Last fall, after the trial court’s decision, the Fifth Circuit granted a motion to allow enforcement to continue, and the Supreme Court upheld the appeals court. Lawyers who brought the case believe that, now that the appeals court has affirmed that the Texas law violates the Voting Rights Act, the trial court should enjoin the law.","1913","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"It’s likely that whoever is elected President will have the opportunity to appoint at least two Justices to the Supreme Court. As the University of Chicago’s Geoffrey R. Stone has written, the average age of the Justices who have retired in the past half century is seventy-five. Four of the current Justices are older than that. If a Democrat is elected, he or she could have the chance to transform the Court into a more moderate, even progressive, force. If a Republican is elected, he could make the current conservative Court even more so, for the next generation.","1914","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"As both a political and a legal matter, strict voter-I.D. laws and voting rights in general are areas of profound difference between Democrats and Republicans, and between the Justices appointed by Democratic and Republican Presidents. Republicans have used the pretext of protecting the security and integrity of elections to suppress the ranks of Democratic voters, while Democrats have sought to increase the ranks of voters. More significantly, Republicans have seen voting rights as an area of constitutional law in which they should take a stand against race-based decision-making. Democrats have viewed those laws and rights as areas in which they must remain vigilant about the continuing effects of racial and ethnic discrimination, which, in the past year, has been viscerally evident in Ferguson, Missouri, in Charleston, South Carolina, and in countless other communities.","1915","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"Chief Justice Roberts has been at the center of the Court conservatives’ efforts to make the law color-blind—in the Voting Rights Act case two years ago, in one that foreshadowed it in 2009, and in other cases. As Jeffrey Toobin wrote in The New Yorker, in 2009, Roberts has long been at his most doctrinaire when race is a critical factor in a law. Toobin quoted a line from a 2007 Supreme Court ruling written by the Chief Justice: “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”","1916","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"

"Pat Nolan now lives outside Washington, D.C., in Leesburg, Virginia. Recently, he rummaged in his basement for a copy of the F.B.I. audiotape of the meeting. (There was a video, but Nolan’s copy seems to have got lost when he moved east, in 1996.) Nothing on the muddy soundtrack, which plays today like an outtake from “American Hustle,” is explicitly transactional, but the agent presses for help in changing the Governor’s mind, and Nolan explains that it would be beneficial for business in general if Republicans could capture a majority in the assembly.","1945","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The sting eventually resulted in a dozen indictments, but it took five years, and Karin Watson’s coöperation, for prosecutors to file charges against Nolan. On April 27, 1993, he was indicted on six counts, including racketeering, conspiracy, extortion, and money laundering. Nolan insists that he voted for the loan because the fictional venture promised jobs, and that he took the contributions because that’s how people help elect legislators who see things their way. But Nolan’s lawyers concluded that a public that had recently endured the scandals of Watergate, Abscam, and Iran-Contra would not be sympathetic to a politician’s claim that he was just doing his job. Nolan calculated that, if found guilty, he could be in prison until his young children were in their twenties. So he quit his seat and admitted to one felony count of racketeering in exchange for a sentence of thirty-three months.","1946","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Criminal-justice reformers like to say that if a conservative is a liberal who has been mugged, a liberal is a conservative who has served time. Nolan did not emerge from prison any less conservative, but he says he experienced a profound disillusionment, which has led him to play a central role in a cause that is only now finding its moment. These days, it is hard to ignore a rising conservative clamor to rehabilitate the criminal-justice system. Conservatives are as quick as liberals to note that the United States, a country with less than five per cent of the world’s population, houses nearly twenty-five per cent of the world’s prisoners. Some 2.2 million Americans are now incarcerated—about triple the number locked up in the nineteen-eighties, when, in a panic over drugs and urban crime, conservative legislators demanded tougher policies, and liberals who feared being portrayed as weak went along with them. African-Americans are nearly six times as likely as whites to be incarcerated, and Latinos are more than twice as likely. More than forty per cent of released offenders return to prison within three years.","1947","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Several Republican Presidential candidates—Rand Paul, Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, and Ted Cruz—have been embraced by Right on Crime, a campaign to promote “successful, conservative solutions” to the punitive excesses of American law and order. In February, the American Conservative Union’s Conservative Political Action Conference, which serves as an audition for right-wing Presidential aspirants, featured three panels on criminal-justice reform, including one called Prosecutors Gone Wild. Bernard Kerik, who was Rudolph Giuliani’s police commissioner and served three years in prison for tax fraud and other crimes, now promotes an agenda of reforms, including voting rights for ex-felons. The libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch are donating money to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, to help insure that indigent defendants get competent legal representation, and they are co-sponsoring conferences on judicial reform with the American Civil Liberties Union.","1948","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"In Congress and the states, conservatives and liberals have found common ground on such issues as cutting back mandatory-minimum sentences; using probation, treatment, and community service as alternatives to prison for low-level crimes; raising the age of juvenile-court jurisdictions; limiting solitary confinement; curtailing the practice of confiscating assets; rewriting the rules of probation and parole to avoid sending offenders back to jail on technicalities; restoring education and job training in prisons; allowing prisoners time off for rehabilitation; and easing the reëntry of those who have served time by expunging some criminal records and by lowering barriers to employment, education, and housing. As David Dagan and Steven M. Teles write, in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, “Retrenching the carceral state is becoming as orthodox on the Right as building it was just a few short years ago.” They conclude that this has created a “Nixon goes to China” opportunity to reverse decades of overkill.","1949","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"This conservative transformation is often portrayed in the media as a novelty, and some progressives regard it as a ploy to cut taxes and turn prisons over to the private corrections industry. Yet it has deep roots and a tangle of motives, one of which is indeed a belief that downsizing prisons promises taxpayers some relief. (Locking up an inmate for a year can cost as much as tuition at a good college.) But for many conservatives, Nolan says, reducing spending is “ancillary.” “It’s human dignity that really motivates us.”","1950","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"In September, I met Nolan in Washington, D.C., at a German deli downstairs from his office at the American Conservative Union Foundation, where he is the director of the new Center for Criminal Justice Reform. At sixty-five, he is tall and rotund, with a round, amiable face and a thatch of gray-white hair. Since 2011, he has suffered from restricted lung capacity, complicated by a lingering case of Lyme disease, and he uses a portable oxygen tank. But he still works full time, tracking the progress of reforms state by state, drafting op-eds for fellow-conservatives, planning conferences, rallying state legislators by phone, and firing off volleys on Twitter.","1951","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"There are two main styles of Southern California Republicanism: the home-spun anecdotal optimism of Ronald Reagan and the uneasy conspiratorial resentment of Richard Nixon. Nolan is in the Reagan mold, upbeat and engaging even when he is describing what he regards as the transformative injustice of his life. He grew up on Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles; his father was an accountant, and his mother, he said, “majored in raising kids”—nine of them. By the time he was old enough to have a paper route, the integrated middle-class neighborhood had turned rough. The family was devoutly Catholic, and Nolan remains so.","1952","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"At Notre Dame High School, he joined the Young Americans for Freedom—he and his friends liked to heckle Jane Fonda at anti-Vietnam War rallies, chanting, “Barbarella bombed, why can’t Nixon?”—and in 1966 he was a volunteer for Reagan’s first gubernatorial campaign. He tried three times to enlist in the Marine officer-training program, but each time he failed the physical, owing to a knee injury suffered when a car knocked him off his bike on his delivery route. After graduating from the University of Southern California and then its law school, he represented white-collar defendants in civil cases for a few years, served part time as a reserve deputy sheriff, and went into politics. By the time of Shrimpscam, he was widely viewed as a potential speaker of the assembly, even a plausible candidate for governor or for the Senate.","1953","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“I went to the legislature very pro cop and with a get-tough-on-crime attitude,” Nolan told me. He wanted to reinstate the death penalty, which the Supreme Court had temporarily suspended. He believed that the exclusionary rule, which disallows evidence improperly obtained by the police, had become a loophole that lawyers exploited to allow guilty clients to go free. He excoriated a colleague in the assembly for proposing a law that would extend workers’ compensation to inmates injured in prison labor programs. And he was a leading sponsor of a prison-building boom in the state, which included, to his eventual regret, the Pelican Bay supermax facility, where inmates are kept in long-term solitary.","1954","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The F.B.I. sting, he says, dispelled his unconditional faith in law enforcement. In Nolan’s telling of it, trophy-hunting agents browbeat his aides and his campaign supporters to build a case against him, leaking tidbits to the press in the hope of breaking his resolve. The prosecutor loaded the charge sheet so heavily that Nolan concluded that he couldn’t risk going before a jury. Like roughly ninety-five per cent of people convicted in America, he pleaded guilty and took a lesser sentence rather than take his chances at trial. He began to wonder how many of the people he had dismissed as bad guys had simply succumbed to prosecutorial bullying. He said, “I saw that the F.B.I. and the government prosecutors weren’t interested in the truth, and that was a shock to me.”","1955","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"By the standards of American incarceration, Nolan had it easy. He served twenty-five months in two prisons that housed the least menacing felons. The Federal Prison Camp at Dublin, near San Francisco, was a compound of former Army barracks surrounded by landscaped flower gardens. There was a small coterie of white-collar criminals, but the majority of the inmates were blacks and Latinos serving time for relatively minor drug convictions. Nolan helped organize religious-study groups, and—to judge by his accounts in an unpublished memoir—he treated his fellow-inmates as a constituency to be charmed. (He still corresponds with some of them.) From prison, Nolan produced a chatty newsletter that his wife, Gail, distributed to some two thousand supporters. He had regular visits from his family and a loyal band of political friends. After ten months, he was transferred to Geiger Corrections Center, near Spokane, where the supervision was even less oppressive. Still, his time in prison exposed him to what he came to see as the cynical cycle of American justice: sweep up young men, mostly from broken families in underprivileged neighborhoods, put them away for a while, send them back onto the streets with no skills, and repeat. To call this a “corrections” system seemed a sour joke.","1956","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“I had assumed they did all they could to help prepare the guys to return to society and make a better life,” Nolan told me. “But they were just warehousing them.” There was a pervasive sense of defeat. “The implication is: you’re worthless, you come from nothing, you are nothing, you’ll never be anything.” He added that when prisoners were released the guards would say, “See you in a few months.” He was surprised, too, at the number of elderly and infirm inmates. In his memoir, he wrote that “incarcerating people who aren’t a physical threat to society is expensive and counter-productive”—something that “only a nation that is rich and vindictive” would do.","1957","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Nolan was still an inmate when he ventured into the politics of reform. In 1994, in the California Political Review, he published an attack on that year’s crime bill—President Clinton’s signature contribution to mass incarceration, which earmarked $9.7 billion for prisons, imposed tougher sentences, and, among many punitive provisions, eliminated college grants for prison inmates. Many Republicans turned against the bill, because it also included a ban on assault rifles and funded remedial inner-city programs, such as “midnight basketball.” Nolan’s objections were different: he argued that the bill would bring profits to the prison industry but do little to reduce crime. He wrote, “Above all, conservatives should ask themselves how likely it is that these bloated bureaucracies . . . will turn out to be any less rapacious, irresponsible, or concerned with the rights of ordinary Americans than, say, the IRS, just because they are packaged and marketed under the dishonest label ‘tough on crime.’ ”","1958","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The following year, when Congress was reviewing the hundred-to-one disparity in the penalties for crack versus powder cocaine, Nolan used his phone privileges to urge Republican representatives to treat the two drugs equally. “The kid on the bunk above me was doing ten years for crack,” Nolan told me. “There’s essentially no difference” between the two forms of the drug, he said, “but so many blacks were doing absurdly long sentences for crack.” Nolan says that he helped line up support from thirty-four Republican members of the House, but lost half of them when Clinton’s Attorney General, Janet Reno, endorsed the harsher punishments. “How could they let Janet Reno get to their right on drug policy?” he asked.","1959","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Unlike most parolees, Nolan had a job waiting for him. Charles Colson, a Nixon White House aide who had become a devout Evangelical Christian shortly before serving seven months in a federal prison for his part in the Watergate scandal, had organized the Prison Fellowship, a network of volunteers who visited inmates and promoted faith as a path back into society’s good graces. When the volunteers reported appalling conditions and a permeating sense of hopelessness in the prisons, Colson decided to launch a political offshoot, called the Justice Fellowship. The idea was to build a grassroots campaign to lobby Congress and state lawmakers for more humane treatment of inmates during and after incarceration, but Colson was so busy running the evangelical network that the effort languished. Colson had heard of Nolan through mutual Republican friends, who portrayed him as equally at ease talking about God and dealing with politicians. So in the spring of 1996, as Nolan was preparing to leave prison, Colson asked him to move to Washington and run the Justice Fellowship. Once there, Nolan realized that a grassroots network was already in place: fifty thousand Prison Fellowship volunteers and a couple of hundred thousand donors.","1960","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Their first test came later that year, with a proposal moving through Congress that would have sharply limited the right of inmates to file lawsuits under the First Amendment. Many prosecutors favored the measure as a way to curb nuisance lawsuits, but Nolan argued that it would also inhibit legitimate religious freedom. “You’d get some inmate suing for steak dinners on the grounds that he belonged to the Church of Filet Mignon,” he said. “But you also had wardens who wouldn’t serve kosher meals to Orthodox Jews.” Crosses that Latino prisoners fashioned from plastic trash bags were banned in some prisons as “gang attire.” Nolan and Colson asked their network to contact their legislators and raise the issue at town-hall meetings. Nolan organized a press conference in which a Republican and a Democrat—Senators John Ashcroft and Edward Kennedy—defended the rights of inmates. The proposal died.","1961","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Next, Nolan sought to enlist the fellowship in the campaign against prison rape. Studies showed that as many as one inmate in five was the victim of sexual assault, by another inmate or by prison staff. Such attacks, when inmates dared to report them, were dismissed as a hazard of incarceration. “Prison rape was a secular issue, but with moral overtones,” Nolan told me. The direct-mail firm that handled Colson’s fund-raising “didn’t want to touch the issue,” he said. “They thought, Oh, it makes people uncomfortable. It’ll turn people off.” But the volunteers agreed to rally conservative support, and, in conjunction with human-rights organizations and liberal groups, they helped secure the unanimous passage of the Prison Rape Elimination Act, in 2003. Nolan is the first to admit that the law hasn’t come close to eliminating the problem. But it did make the Justice Fellowship a force for reform beyond issues of strictly religious interest. Its members subsequently helped on the passage of the Second Chance Act, which provides federal grants to help released convicts reënter society, and the Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the disparity—to eighteen to one—between sentences for crack and powder cocaine.","1962","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"During those years, Nolan discovered a number of prominent right-wing figures who had come to support criminal-justice reform from various directions. Some, like David Keene, the former president of the National Rifle Association, whose son was sentenced to ten years for a road-rage shooting, were, like Colson and Nolan himself, influenced by personal experience. Grover Norquist, an activist famous for extracting no-new-taxes pledges from members of Congress, was attracted to the issue partly by the odor of wasted tax money, and became an early Nolan ally. Richard Viguerie, who refined direct-mail fund-raising in the service of the far right, also came to the campaign early, on moral grounds. (A substantial minority on the right, notably Catholics, have turned against capital punishment. Nolan and Viguerie are among them.) Edwin Meese, President Reagan’s Attorney General, for the most part a classic law-and-order conservative, faulted the system for failing to provide indigent defendants access to adequate legal counsel and opposed the reclassification of minor regulatory violations as felonies. (A favorite conservative talking point is that Texas has eleven felonies related to the harvesting of oysters.) Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a co-author of the 1994 Contract with America, with its unforgiving anticrime provisions, told me that he was persuaded to embrace reform because of the high recidivism rates. “It’s just stunningly stupid to have a system that keeps returning people to jail,” he told me.","1963","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"After George W. Bush was reëlected, in 2004, and the Republican majorities in Congress were strengthened, Nolan attended a seminar in Richmond, Virginia, where conservatives debated what to do with their consolidated power. Norquist and Keene separately urged him to pull together the factions of conservatism on justice reform. So he began hosting occasional off-the-record lunches where you might have seen libertarians from the Cato Institute, advocates of judicial restraint from the Federalist Society, social conservatives from the Family Research Council, and hard-core fiscal conservatives like Norquist. Attendees found a unifying theme in the arrogance and the overreach of government and the toll that it took on individual freedom and responsibility. Nolan became, mostly behind the scenes, a trusted broker, strategist, theoretician, fund-raiser, diplomat, and whip. “If Pat says something, it’s kind of the final word,” Viguerie told me.","1964","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"One place where conservative interests coalesced was the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a free-market think tank based in Austin, which helped convert then Governor Rick Perry from an indiscriminate law-and-order enthusiast to a self-styled apostle of pragmatic reform. In 2007, Perry joined reformers in the state legislature in a plan to cancel a major expansion of the state’s prisons and redirect some of the savings to addiction treatment for low-level drug offenders, as an alternative to incarceration. The prison population dropped sufficiently that Texas closed one facility in 2011 and two more in 2013.","1965","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The feat was less impressive than it seemed. When Perry became governor, in 2000, he inherited the largest and fastest-growing prison population in the country, the legacy of a prison-building program under his predecessors Ann Richards and George W. Bush. The state could easily afford to release hundreds of minor offenders without risking a spike in crime. Still, Perry’s example was one that Nolan and others could hold out to politicians who worried about being pilloried as soft on crime. Vikrant Reddy, a former Texas Public Policy Foundation lawyer who is now a criminal-justice fellow at a think tank backed by Charles Koch, said, “This is the ultimate hang-’em-high state. If you say you’ve done these impressive things on prison reform in Vermont, nobody’s really listening. If you say they did it in Texas, then you have a captive audience.”","1966","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The next step was to replicate the Texas story in other states. Marc Levin, a conservative lawyer who headed the Texas foundation’s justice-reform operation, came up with a catchy name—Right on Crime—for a new advocacy group set up out of the foundation in 2010 to share policy ideas and mobilize prominent conservatives for reform. Levin and Nolan realized that, instead of building a new coalition of name-brand conservatives for each battle, they could get supporters to sign on to a statement of principles—transparency and accountability, individual liberty, cost-effectiveness, a chance for rehabilitation, limited government, a voice for crime victims, a preference for solutions based on family and community. That way, the signatories’ names could be invoked without having to ask for permission every time.","1967","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“Sort of like Henry Ford inventing the assembly line, it allowed us to handle a large number of issues,” Nolan said. Variations on the Texas approach to reducing the prison population have since been adopted in Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky, and Mississippi. “You now have all these conservative and liberal governors touching what used to be a third rail,” said John Malcolm, a former prosecutor who oversees the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, at the Heritage Foundation. Last year in California, Right on Crime, with financing from B. Wayne Hughes, Jr., the son of a storage-locker billionaire, and with Nolan working the phones to legislators in his home state, provided support for Proposition 47, which downgraded minor drug and property crimes to misdemeanors. It passed in November.","1968","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Although right and left generally agree on the scale of the problem, they diverge on the question of its causes. The view of many on the left is distilled to its essence by the legal scholar Michelle Alexander in her best-selling 2010 book, “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness.” Alexander posited that the criminal-justice system as it exists today is the product of the country’s economic and racial history.","1969","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The fact that nearly a third of black men in this country are destined to spend time in jail or prison, Alexander argued, cannot be explained as simply a society defending itself against urban predators. In her view, Nixon’s tough-on-crime agenda and Reagan’s escalation of the war on drugs were aimed, consciously or not, at halting the advances of the civil-rights movement and perpetuating the neglect of the underclass. While race has influenced the administration of justice in this country from its beginning, she says, since the nineteen-eighties mass incarceration has decimated minority neighborhoods to the extent that it has become a malign form of containment. “It is no longer concerned primarily with the prevention and punishment of crime, but rather with the management and control of the dispossessed,” she wrote. On many days, the news seems to provide evidence for Alexander’s case: racial profiling; stop-and-frisk; the targeted prosecution of drug laws in black and brown communities; the disproportionate arrest, remand, and sentencing of minorities; the xenophobic alarm about immigration; and the quick resort to force by police and corrections officers against citizens of color.","1970","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Alexander told me that during the five years that she has been travelling around the country talking about her book she has often found conservatives “more advanced in their thinking” than liberal politicians, who, after many years of having to play tough for voters, “have become comfortable with the criminal-justice system as it is.” Religious conservatives in particular, she said, “really appreciate the moral and spiritual dimensions of mass incarceration.”","1971","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"As a theory of how we got to this point, Alexander’s view supplies a powerful logic but is of little comfort to advocates of piecemeal reforms, which she regards as “utterly insufficient.” She told me, “Some people who might have spent more than a decade behind bars may spend only a few years. Children who might not otherwise have ever known their parents may have a shot at having relationships with their mother or father, and people may receive additional support—job training or education.” However, she added, “I’m deeply concerned that many people will mistake these reforms for the kind of cultural and institutional transformation that is necessary.” The current bipartisan ferment might improve a few lives, she conceded, but repairing criminal justice requires “a radical restructuring of our society,” potentially driven by “third parties and new political formations” rather than by Republicans or Democrats. She told me, “I’m not enlisting the very people who constructed the system to take charge of now reforming it.”","1972","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“Michelle Alexander has gotten a lot of publicity, and a lot of people have been attracted by it,” Nolan said. “But I think it’s counterproductive to go and start off by punching people in the face, saying, ‘You’re part of the white slave-master mentality that has done this.’ ” On the right, the excesses of the system are most often explained as the result of too much government coddling and a breakdown of families, resulting in a surge of crime and a corresponding rise in public alarm. The war on drugs and the ensuing explosion of the prison population, many conservatives argue, were not acts of racism but responses to legitimate fears. But Nolan says, “Our rhetoric helped grow the climate in which the government could overreach. Prison became the default choice when it should be the last resort. I guess I’m somewhat defensive, because a lot of liberals say that this is a way of making up for the wrong things we did. I think that both hands were on the knife.”","1973","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Nixon and Reagan—and the 1988 campaign of George H. W. Bush, with the infamous Willie Horton TV ad—tapped a vein of white anxiety, but liberals were co-architects of the current situation. The “war on drugs” had no more outspoken champion than the liberal Massachusetts Democrat and House Speaker Thomas P. O’Neill, Jr. Reacting to the death from a crack overdose of Len Bias, a promising Boston Celtics recruit, O’Neill helped push through the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which imposed mandatory sentences, asset forfeitures, and the severe sanctions on crack. The 1994 crime bill was introduced by a Delaware liberal, Joe Biden, and championed by Bill Clinton. (In this Presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton can expect to be attacked for her husband’s tough-on-crime expedience—from the right.)","1974","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The year that Clinton signed that bill, thirty-seven per cent of Americans identified crime as the nation’s most important problem. By 2012, the number was two per cent. The crime rate has plateaued at its lowest level in decades, a development variously attributed to the ebbing of the crack epidemic, an improved economy, smarter policing, the aging of the baby boomers, and, at huge expense, mass incarceration. A new generation has come of age in safer cities, and now Democratic officials who dared not endorse less punitive approaches to crime have conservatives to give them political cover. “What I tell conservatives is liberals cannot lead on reforming the criminal-justice system,” Viguerie told me. “And so, if conservatives don’t lead, nothing happens.”","1975","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"There is a tendency, on both sides, to make ending mass incarceration seem easier than it is. In March, I went to Washington for the Bipartisan Summit on Criminal Justice Reform, hosted by the liberal activist Van Jones, the Democratic consultant Donna Brazile, Gingrich, and Nolan, and attended by several hundred reform enthusiasts. Jones called it “the Woodstock of criminal justice.” The only discordant note I heard came from Senator Cory Booker, the New Jersey Democrat who campaigned as a criminal-justice reformer. One of the sponsors of the summit—a roster that included Koch Industries and the A.C.L.U.—was #cut50, a bipartisan organization that advocates halving the prison population over the next ten years. (Nolan is listed as a partner on the group’s Web site, although he says that thirty per cent is a more realistic goal.) To accomplish such a drastic cut, Booker suggested, would entail releasing not only pot smokers and shoplifters but also people guilty of more serious crimes. He invited the audience to talk about reëxamining some offenses now categorized as violent. Nobody seemed inclined to take him up on the offer.","1976","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"There are whole areas of policy where bipartisan consensus remains far out of reach. Guns, for starters, are untouchable. (Norquist likes to provoke liberals with the creative theory that the crime rate has fallen because more Americans have concealed-carry permits.) For most Republicans, outright legalization of drugs, even marijuana, “is one we can’t touch,” Nolan says. The idea of restoring voting rights to ex-felons, which has the support of Rand Paul and Nolan as well as Bernie Kerik, appeals to many Democrats but terrifies most Republicans. “They have this image of hordes of criminals” flocking to the polls to vote for Democrats, Nolan said. Conservatives tend to look more favorably on privatizing prisons, prison services, and probation, a scheme that liberals view with deep distrust. The death penalty, which divides the right, is not on the shared agenda.","1977","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The most significant question is whether conservatives are prepared to face the cost of the remedies, from in-prison education and job training to more robust probationary supervision and drug and mental-health treatment. Joan Petersilia, a criminologist who teaches at the Stanford Law School, points to the last great American exercise in decarceration, half a century ago: President Kennedy’s Community Mental Health Act, which aimed to reduce by half the number of patients in state mental hospitals. The promised alternatives—hundreds of community care facilities—were never fully funded, and thousands of deeply troubled people were liberated into homelessness. The mentally ill now make up a substantial portion of inmates in state prisons and county jails.","1978","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“The direction forward is not really clear, because, on the one hand, the right is saying less government, less spending,” Petersilia told me. “And the left is saying we need more investment.” She offers the example of California, which for nearly five years has been under a Supreme Court order to cull the overcrowded prisons that Nolan once helped build. “The success story of downsizing prisons in California is like nothing the nation has ever experienced,” she said. “We have downsized in less than five years twenty-five per cent of all prison populations. But look what is happening at the local, community level, which is that they’ve upsized jails, and they’ve got a homeless population, they’ve got police officers complaining about the mentally ill. We didn’t answer the question: if not prisons, what?”","1979","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Nolan agrees about the cost of alternatives: “In each of the Right on Crime states, we have insisted that a large part of the savings be put back into the system.” As for his home state, Nolan says, “we were not a part of that mess.” Nolan thinks that Governor Jerry Brown failed to plan adequate prison alternatives because “he just wanted to get the court off his back.” When conservatives did venture into California, last November, to help pass Proposition 47, the measure required that two-thirds of any money saved be funnelled into alternative correctional programs. Nolan said, “Conservatives have insisted that money be plowed into services because we know that just releasing prisoners or diverting them from prisons without services would increase crime.” That is true, but it tends to be relegated to the fine print in conservative reform literature. The headlines promise tremendous savings to taxpayers.","1980","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Nolan has another worry: that one sensational crime, or a spike in the crime rate, or the distraction of more polarizing issues could send Republicans and Democrats back to their corners. “We’ve all said we’re one bad incident away from having this erode on us,” he said.

On Wednesday, Obama chose American University—the campus where John F. Kennedy outlined his vision for peace, in 1963, during the early age of nuclear threats—to make his strongest pitch to date. He framed the deal as the latest step in a half century of American policy to avert nuclear confrontation, invoking Kennedy’s diplomacy during the Cuban missile crisis and the arms negotiations with the Soviet Union launched by Ronald Reagan. Under both Democratic and Republican Presidents, he said, the historic Non-Proliferation Treaty and the SALT and START treaties introduced arms control.","August 5, 2015","1984","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obamas-hard-sell-on-iran"

"Obama ticked through the main arguments against the deal. To cheat, Iran would have to build a massive covert operation and many covert facilities. “No nation in history has been able to pull off such subterfuge when subjected to such rigorous inspections,” he said. The prohibition against making a bomb is permanent—not limited to any of the ten-to-twenty-five-year time frames for various aspects of a program. U.N. inspectors will be allowed daily access to nuclear sites, as well as the right to look at suspicious undeclared sites. “This access can be with as little as twenty-four hours’ notice,” Obama said. “And while the process for resolving a dispute about access can take up to twenty-four days, once we’ve identified a site that raises suspicion, we will be watching it continuously until inspectors get in.”","1994","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obamas-hard-sell-on-iran"
"Obama acknowledged that some of the sanctions relief—which the United States now says amounts to fifty-six billion dollars, rather than the previously estimated hundred billion—could end up in the hands of the Revolutionary Guards. At the same time, Iran now has more than a half trillion dollars in “urgent requirements” to bail out its troubled economy, Obama said. “Iran’s leaders have raised the expectations of their people that sanctions relief will improve their lives. Even a repressive regime like Iran’s cannot completely ignore those expectations.” In short, “there’s no scenario where sanctions relief turns Iran into the region’s dominating power.” He noted that the six Gulf sheikhdoms have a combined budget eight times larger than Iran’s defense spending. “If we’re serious about confronting Iran’s destabilizing activities, it is hard to imagine a worse approach than blocking this deal.” He argued that proposals to walk away from the deal and either maintain sanctions or try to get better terms were “selling a fantasy.”","1995","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obamas-hard-sell-on-iran"

But, really, his campaign began nearly five years earlier, on the floor of the Senate, on December 10, 2010, when Sanders spoke—without eating, or sitting down, or taking a bathroom break—for eight and a half hours. The “filiBernie,” people called it—“the most Twittered event in the world on that day,” Sanders wrote later–though it wasn’t, technically, a filibuster, since it wasn’t holding up any vote. “You can call it a very long speech,” the Senator suggested.

He wondered, “Would I last three hours, five hours, twenty hours?” He didn’t have a speech written out, though he had pages, scraps, and notes, and he knew what he wanted to say. He had only one rule: No “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” (“I wasn’t going to read from the phone book or sing songs.”) He figured he’d just riff off bits and pieces of old speeches until he dropped. The idea seems to have been to talk for as long as it would take for people to hear what he had to say. And that, more or less, is his plan for this election, too.","2000","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"

Was the answer of a lot of pundits in May, and into June. Sanders, though, has been drawing huge crowds. And in polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, he’s steadily gaining ground against Hillary Clinton.

He led sit-ins against segregated housing on campus; he worked for S.N.C.C.; he went to the March on Washington. He graduated with a degree in political science in 1964, the year that Ronald Reagan gave a speech on behalf of Barry Goldwater, called “A Time for Choosing,” that was aired on television the week before Election Day. The choice, Reagan said, was between the Johnson Administration, which Reagan called “socialist” (because of the War on Poverty), and Goldwater, representing the Founding Fathers, who, as Reagan imagined it, knew that “outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy.” Among Reagan’s speechwriters, “A Time for Choosing” became known as “The Speech,” since every speech Reagan gave was essentially a version of it. (For more on The Speech, see Robert Schlesinger’s “White House Ghosts: Presidents and Their Speechwriters.”) In 2011, when Bernie Sanders had the transcript of his quasi-filibuster published as a book, he titled that book “The Speech.”","2002","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"

In 1981, he took office in Burlington; Reagan took office in Washington. Sanders isn’t a Debsian socialist; he’s a socialist in the sense that Reagan used that word to describe L.B.J. “He campaigned on the promise of a better life for the working man,” Alan Richman wrote in the Boston Globe. “Nobody seemed to mind that the dream Sanders believes in is called socialism.” He drew the attention of the national press when he ran for reëlection, in 1983. In the Wall Street Journal, for instance, Jane Mayer (who is now at The New Yorker) reported that Sanders began a speech at a fundraiser for the United Way by saying, “I don’t believe in charities.” (He later explained by pointing at the donors: “Most of them were conservative Republicans busy cutting services to low-income people. Then they go collect nickels and dimes, mostly from working people, and congratulate each other on their generosity.

Kick me out of the party?” At the time, the most notable way in which he had bucked the Democratic Party had to do with gun control: Sanders opposed the Brady Bill, which placed regulations on the purchase of handguns, a position that’s come up, lately, now that the press is taking him a bit more seriously. (Sanders said then that he did not believe gun control was a federal matter; more lately, he has said that, as a man who holds a middle ground on the issue, he can broker a compromise.

The one that the Republicans cooked up in the aftermath of the Great Recession, when, partly owing to a slump in output, and partly owing to the Obama stimulus and other recession-related outlays, federal spending as a proportion of G.D.P. rose by about four percentage points—from 19.1 per cent in 2007 to 23.4 per cent in 2010. On the back of these figures, some G.O.P. scaremongers portrayed the President as a crypto-socialist intent on strangling the private sector and turning the United States into Sweden, Norway, or some other bloated welfare state where living standards are considerably higher than they are in the United States.","2013","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"Of course, none of the Republicans mentioned the last bit, but you get my drift. With federal expenditures rising sharply, the critics demanded big cutbacks, and they are still demanding them.

"What the Republicans don’t seem to have noticed is that their demand for a substantial downsizing has already been met. Thanks to a prolonged, if unspectacular, recovery in G.D.P., and to budget cuts endorsed by both parties at the local and national levels, the size of the government has been steadily falling relative to the rest of the economy. You can see this in the official statistics for federal outlays, which in 2014 fell back to 20.4 per cent of G.D.P. And you can see it even more clearly in the figures for government spending of all types, which includes spending at the local and state levels, as well as transfer payments and interest on the national debt.","2015","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"

By the start of 2012, the figure had risen to close to forty-two per cent of G.D.P. That’s not quite at Scandinavian levels of spending, but it represented a significant jump. Since then, however, there has been a big drop, and over-all spending is back close to thirty-five per cent of G.D.P.

For the first time in recent memory, the percentage of uninsured people is in the single figures. “The health law remains controversial, and that will likely continue to be the case,” Larry Levitt, a senior vice-president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which focusses on health care, told the Huffington Post’s Jonathan Cohn. “But we now have facts that can be used to judge the A.C.A. rather than hypothetical arguments, and there’s no doubt at this point that more people are getting insured and it’s making a difference in their lives.”","2018","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"

"What just happened in Britain? Well, basically, the incumbent Conservatives—a.k.a. the Tories—have won a slender majority in Parliament, an expected three hundred and thirty-one of the total six hundred and fifty seats. Prime Minister David Cameron, sometimes seen as a lightweight by members of his own party (and unrelentingly depicted as having a condom for a head by a popular British political cartoonist), is set to run Britain for another five years. Contrary to expectations, Cameron’s Labour Party rival, the young and awkward Ed Miliband (himself caricatured as the dopey Wallace character from the stop-motion animation series “Wallace and Gromit”), has been well and truly trounced. Most pollsters expected Miliband’s party to gain seats in Parliament; there was even a suggestion that he might edge Cameron out by cutting a coalition deal with another party, as Cameron did in 2010. Neither prediction came to pass. The Scots, usually Labour stalwarts, gave their votes instead to the Scottish National Party. The S.N.P. ended up with fifty-six seats, as compared with its previous six.","May 8, 2015","2023","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/david-cameron-comes-into-his-own"
"As these things are done in Britain—swiftly—Miliband committed suttee this morning, resigning as Labour’s leader. He will retain his seat in Parliament, having won reëlection in his constituency, but will languish henceforth in what the British call the back benches. Two other party bosses joined him on the pyre: Nigel Farage, the blustery, pint-swilling head of the U.K. Independence Party, and Nick Clegg, the leader of the middle-of-the-road Liberal Democrats. The upstart UKIP had hoped to appeal to the redneck fringes of the electorate with an anti-European Union, anti-immigration platform, but ended up winning only one seat in Parliament. Clegg, meanwhile, appears to have got his comeuppance for joining forces with Cameron as Deputy Prime Minister, and especially for going back on a campaign pledge not to raise university fees. (Once the Cameron-Clegg coalition came to power, those fees tripled. In Britain, where education has always been heavily state-subsidized, and was until quite recently free, many young Britons now look at college as a debt-acquirement exercise, despising Clegg as a result.) In the voting, the Lib Dems lost forty-six seats, leaving them with a mere eight. Before Clegg, the party had not been anywhere near power for many years; now it’s back to the wilderness.","2024","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/david-cameron-comes-into-his-own"
"Cameron’s win means that his new government will, as promised, introduce a referendum on whether to remain in the European Union or leave it. It remains to be seen how the Prime Minister, who has concocted an image of himself as a centrist and a consensus builder, will deal with such lighting-rod issues as immigration reform, rising housing costs and housing shortages, and the perennial Conservative-versus-Labour battle over the National Health Service. From the U.S. perspective, the election’s most substantial effect is likely to be on the so-called special relationship between Britain and America, which for the past few years has hung in an uncertain limbo. (In 2009, when President Obama was inaugurated, the Oval Office bust of Winston Churchill was swapped with one of Abraham Lincoln, a fact that U.S. conservatives, and lots of Brits, have pointed to as evidence of a diplomatic breakdown.) In spite of their uneasy beginnings, Cameron and Obama have learned to get along, and in 2011 joined forces with the French to help oust Libya’s dictator, Muammar Qaddafi, from power. Seventy years on from the loss of empire, however, Britain’s global role as a great power does not seem as serious a priority as it used to. Once the world’s most formidable naval power, it currently has no aircraft carrier (although, after much back and forth over cost, two new carriers are being built and will be ready to deploy in a few years’ time).

Both “War and Peace” and “Anna Karenina” have Tolstoy-like characters—Pierre Bezukhov and Konstantin Levin—who chafe at the self-satisfaction, relentless social striving, and oppressive economic underpinnings of the Russian aristocracy into which they were born. Both are drawn to reformist spiritual and political ideas. But in “Resurrection” the main character, Dmitri Nekhlyudov, another landowning aristocrat, goes a step further, into what appears to be full-bore rejection of his world and its values. He institutes land reform on his estates, and leaves the Russia of cities and country homes to undertake a long eastward journey to Siberia, where a household servant he seduced and abandoned years earlier has been unjustly imprisoned. Where “War and Peace” and “Anna Karenina” presented the life of a corrupt society with astonishing richness and subtlety, “Resurrection” is relentlessly preachy, prudish, and joyless.","2028","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection?intcid=mod-latest"
"There is a strain of American liberalism that offers government as a sensible, useful way to make society function better than it does now—as a problem-solving instrument that conservatives are too stubbornly prejudiced to employ. That is Bill Clinton’s liberalism. And then there’s the Tolstoyan strain, in which it’s evident that society works well only for a fortunate minority, whose elaborately enjoyed well-being may even have come at the expense of the majority. Tolstoyan liberalism is, like its namesake, élite liberalism—more Franklin Roosevelt (who grew up on an American inherited dacha farmed by peasants) than Eugene Debs, or for that matter Elizabeth Warren. Tolstoy offers a harsh critique, but from an insider’s perspective; it treats the system as deeply flawed, but not as utterly alien. In her 2016 Presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton has been publicly flirting with Tolstoyan liberalism.","2029","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection?intcid=mod-latest"
"Long before she announced her candidacy, Clinton surrounded herself with advisers from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, and banished the centrists who controlled her last campaign. Her April announcement video and first campaign speech last month hinted at a left-populist direction that continued, with more bite, in her first big economic-policy address this week. This wasn’t where her husband had ever gone, or where she had been in 2008.","2030","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection?intcid=mod-latest"
"Has she decided never again to be in the thankless position of running as a moderate in a Democratic primary campaign, no matter how prohibitive her lead? Is Bernie Sanders’s surge in the first two primary states pushing her leftward? Is she seeing research that indicates, or just concluding instinctively, that the financial crisis changed the way Americans think about the economy? Does she finally feel free to express what have always been her opinions?","2031","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection?intcid=mod-latest"
"This week’s speech left the answers to such questions where they usually are with Clinton—tantalizingly uncertain. She left all but a few specifics of her economic policies to be unveiled in speeches to come, and she made sure to praise small business, entrepreneurship, and investment. But she criticized Wall Street by name and by specific practices (her Web site has a section called “Rein in Wall Street”), and criticized Uber and AirbnB, sacred causes in Silicon Valley, without naming them, by saying that their advent is “raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future.” This demonstrates a willingness to risk alienating the subcultures where some of the Democratic Party’s biggest donors dwell. (On Friday, President Obama will appear at a fund-raiser at the San Francisco home of Shervin Pishevar, one of Uber’s founding investors.) And there was no commensurate implicit challenge to organized labor, which both Clintons and Obama have tangled with in the past.","2032","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection?intcid=mod-latest"
"It felt as if Clinton were crossing a line, policy specifics or no, in the way she was choosing to frame economic questions. First, she made it clear that the traditionally safe zone for American political discourse about the economy—calling for equality of opportunity, not equality of result—was no longer sufficient for her. Her target is “strong and steady income growth” for ordinary working people, which can presumably be measured only by how much money people wind up with, not how fair a chance they had to make it. And second, she at least toyed with the theme of resentment of the rich—another area Democratic politicians of the past generation, including Clinton herself, have generally avoided—as when she responded to Jeb Bush’s exhortation to Americans to work longer hours by saying, “Let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day or the trucker who drives all night. Let him tell that to the fast-food workers marching in the streets for better pay. They don’t need a lecture—they need a raise.”","2033","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection?intcid=mod-latest"
"Tolstoy, even though he was deep into his final holy-moralist phrase, didn’t quite know what to do with Nekhlyudov at the end of “Resurrection.” Having set out on his Siberian journey resolved to give everything away and to marry his wronged former mistress, the hero is perhaps relieved to learn that she refuses to marry him. He’s free, and it seems possible that he might return to some version of the former life he had been determined to reject. He still seems more comfortable at a dinner party than in the company of the political prisoners he encounters in the proto-gulag.","2034","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection?intcid=mod-latest"
"Hillary Clinton wasn’t born an aristocrat, but she functions as one now, and, assuming she becomes a major-party nominee, she can only take her new and rather profound critique of how well American society functions so far. She won’t, and can’t, run, or live, as a radical. So it’s a question of finding the right equipoise. The practice of American politics almost always requires rhetorical optimism; the practice of liberal American politics now seems also to require just the right measure of opprobrium directed at the way our country is run. What’s interesting about Clinton’s struggle to find the balance is that she is struggling to find it, as she hasn’t in the past. And it will be even more interesting to see what she does with it, if she gets the chance to govern.","2035","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection?intcid=mod-latest"
"Before the term “mass incarceration” started appearing on the front pages of newspapers, before Obama became the first sitting President to visit a federal prison, before Democrats and Republicans began working together on criminal-justice reform, Randy Credico was screaming about the injustices of America’s incarceration policies. He wasn’t writing angry op-eds for newspapers; he was, literally, screaming. One day in 2001, I found him in front of Kings County State Supreme Court, hollering at passersby: “They’re taking black children out of your neighborhood and putting them in Attica! This is a modern-day slave-auction block!” Another day, I caught him in front of Queens State Supreme Court, heckling the employees: “You guys who are assistant D.A.s—get a real job!

"It would have been easy to dismiss him as just another New York City crank. He certainly looked the part, with his curly hair askew, a soggy cigar stuck between his lips. But, as I learned, his animosity toward the prison system was well founded: his father spent almost a decade behind bars before he was born, and he grew up hearing horrific tales about life in prison. Born in 1954, in Monterey Park, California, Credico got an early start as a comedian and appeared on the “Tonight Show” at age thirty. On air, he compared U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick to Eva Braun; he never got invited back. He later believed that his radical politics—combined with a love of cocaine—had derailed his comedy career. At forty-three, he was searching for a second act when he saw a C-SPAN debate about New York’s Rockefeller drug laws, which were then the most punitive in the country. He decided that he would make it his cause to dismantle them.","2037","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-man-who-screamed-so-loud-the-drug-laws-changed"
"He began visiting prisons in upstate New York, and befriended inmates and their families. In the spring of 1998, he held his first protest, with a few dozen inmates’ relatives, holding up posters in the rain in front of Rockefeller Center. The protests continued for years—at Rockefeller Center, at courthouses around the city, at politicians’ fund-raisers, at the State Capitol in Albany. When then Governor George Pataki held a fund-raiser at the Yale Club, Credico was across the street with inmates’ family members, waving signs and chanting. I was a reporter for the Village Voice then, and I interviewed him many times. He seemed to spend most of his days on his cell phone: planning events, badgering reporters, fielding calls from prisoners and their relatives. He had a knack for drawing attention, and for converting an argument that had largely been made with numbers into a manifestly human drama. At one point, I calculated that he had generated more than a hundred news stories, largely by inviting reporters to his events and introducing them to the families of inmates. At the end of 2004, New York’s legislators rewrote the Rockefeller drug laws. They made more reforms in 2005 and 2009.","2038","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-man-who-screamed-so-loud-the-drug-laws-changed"
"Once his fight was over, Credico lost his focus. He turned himself into a perpetual political candidate—running for the U.S. Senate, New York City Mayor, and New York State Governor—which brought him some attention from reporters but not enough votes to pose a threat to more mainstream candidates. Cocaine and alcohol became harder to resist, and when he got drunk he had a bad habit of shooting off nasty mass e-mails to friends, acquaintances, politicians, journalists, and activists. He called various targets “shameless,” a “clown,” and a “pile of lard.” He told the leaders of one progressive group that they were all a “bunch of non working, trust funded white people.” Every morning, he would wake up unable to remember what he had written, and open his computer to discover who was no longer talking to him.","2039","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-man-who-screamed-so-loud-the-drug-laws-changed"
"Then, in August, 2014, he got arrested in the Bronx for “menacing” a police sergeant with an umbrella. He strongly denied the charge, but after his arrest his drinking got worse. “A bottle of tequila one day, a bottle of bourbon the next day,” he says. “I was so depressed. I hated going to sleep because I knew I had to wake up.” He started working on a book, which he titled “Suicide Note.” On January 16th, the twenty-third anniversary of his father’s death, he posted pictures on his Facebook page of Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, and other writers who had taken their lives.","2040","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-man-who-screamed-so-loud-the-drug-laws-changed"

"Crimmins, who has followed Credico’s activist work over the years, has a theory about what drives him. “I think all this work he’s done has been this cry of love towards his father,” he says. “I just know he thought the world of his father and never hid or ran from his criminal background, and understood early on that things can break the wrong way. You come from the wrong economic circumstances, you get in the wrong situation at a young age, you get caught up in the system, and you’re doomed.”","2042","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-man-who-screamed-so-loud-the-drug-laws-changed"
"Now sixty-one years old, Credico has been watching the same issues that he was shouting about in the late 1990s and early 2000s command national attention. He decided to find a way back into this fight, and came up with a new cause. Inspired by Columbia University student activists—who recently convinced Columbia to become the first university to divest from companies that run private prisons—Credico is trying to persuade the public officials overseeing New York City and New York State’s pension funds to do the same.","2043","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-man-who-screamed-so-loud-the-drug-laws-changed"
"He zeroed in on two companies, the GEO Group and the Corrections Corporation of America (C.C.A.). (They operate county jails, state prisons, and immigration detention facilities.) New York State’s retirement fund and New York City’s pensions funds own millions of dollars of shares in both companies. Soon Credico was talking about these investments constantly. “There’s nothing worse than the exploitation of human beings for private profit,” he says. “You can’t invest in something that feeds into human misery.”","2044","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-man-who-screamed-so-loud-the-drug-laws-changed"
"Credico has chosen a name for his campaign, EPIC (short for End Prison-Industrial Complex), and set up a Facebook page and a Web site for it. Many activists might focus on researching the companies they are targeting, but one of Credico’s first moves was to order black-and-white-striped prisoner costumes, which he plans to use when he holds protests outside the offices of the state and city comptrollers. “Whatever I have left in my bag of tricks is going to be used on this,” Credico says. “If New York rolls, I think other states would roll, too.” He may succeed again, or maybe his efforts will fizzle out. Politicians and the press are now more focused on criminal-justice reforms than they have been in years, which means his main challenge may be staying sober enough to lead his campaign.","2045","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-man-who-screamed-so-loud-the-drug-laws-changed"

The d.j. rebuffed her, and in the days that followed she and her allies took to social media to voice their dissatisfaction, suggesting that the pub was promoting “rape culture.” Before long, Fitzgerald’s conceded defeat, apologizing to the patron on Facebook and promising that “Blurred Lines” would not be played there again and that the offending d.j. would never be invited back.","2047","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"This was a small story, but something about it resonated: an account in the student paper, the Daily Tar Heel, was picked up by an irreverent site called Barstool Sports, which expressed its certainty that the complaining student was a “crazy ass feminist” who hated fun, and then by Yahoo News. The same month, Brendan Eich, the C.E.O. of the software company Mozilla, was forced to resign after critics discovered that he had donated a thousand dollars to supporters of Proposition 8, a 2008 ballot initiative to ban same-sex marriage in California. And when Dan Cathy, the president of the fast-food chain Chick-fil-A, voiced his own opposition to same-sex marriage, in 2012, two big-city mayors—Rahm Emanuel, in Chicago, and Thomas Menino, in Boston—suggested that new Chick-fil-A restaurants would be unwelcome in their cities.

"“Is this the type of country we want to live in?” That is the question posed by Mary Katharine Ham and Guy Benson, a pair of waggish conservative commentators, as they ponder the fate of the d.j. who got fired for playing “Blurred Lines.” They are the authors of a new book titled “End of Discussion: How the Left’s Outrage Industry Shuts Down Debate, Manipulates Voters, and Makes America Less Free (and Fun).” They argue that what might seem like hypersensitivity is actually a form of political combat. Borrowing from the language of soccer, they write, “America is turning into a country of floppers, figuratively grabbing our shins in fabricated agony over every little possible offense in hopes of working the refs.” Kirsten Powers, a liberal—though a heterodox one—and a Fox News pundit, delivers an even starker verdict in “The Silencing: How the Left Is Killing Free Speech.” She detects, among those she might once have considered ideological allies, “an aggressive, illiberal impulse to silence people,” which often takes the form of meta-intolerance—that is, intolerance of any view that is judged to be intolerant.","2049","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Half a century ago, the defense of free speech was closely identified with groups like the Free Speech Movement, a confederation of activists who came together at the University of California, Berkeley, after a student was arrested for setting up a table of civil-rights literature, in defiance of anti-solicitation rules. Defending free speech meant defending Lenny Bruce and Abbie Hoffman, and, later, Larry Flynt, Robert Mapplethorpe, and the 2 Live Crew. In a 1990 public-service announcement, Madonna, wearing red lingerie and an American flag, delivered a civics lesson, in verse: “Dr. King, Malcolm X / Freedom of speech is as good as sex.” She was urging young people to vote, in partnership with Rock the Vote, whose slogan was “Censorship is Un-American.”","2050","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"But as the nineteen-nineties progressed, fights over obscenity subsided and fights over so-called political correctness intensified; “free speech” became a different kind of rallying cry, especially on college campuses. Often, “free speech” meant not the right to protest a war but the right to push back against campus restrictions designed to shield marginalized groups from, say, “racial and ethnic harassment”—that was the term used by Central Michigan University, in its speech code, which banned “demeaning” expressions. The campus speech wars have since grown broader but vaguer, and many prominent recent incidents, like the “Blurred Lines” dispute, don’t involve legal claims. Instead, there are open letters and social-media campaigns, rescinded invitations and cancelled events. Young people who might, a generation earlier, have sided with the 2 Live Crew now ask to be delivered from Robin Thicke. Powers, in her book, accuses fellow-liberals of having switched sides. “Liberals are supposed to believe in diversity, which should include diversity of thought and belief,” she writes. This is a rather paradoxical formulation. (Is it possible to believe in diversity of belief?) But then the current free-speech debate is rather paradoxical, too—it can be hard to tell the speakers from the censors.","2051","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"The freedom of speech promised by the First Amendment has fluctuating limits—in general, elected politicians want more, and unelected ones (that is, judges) want fewer. In 1919, the Supreme Court ruled that speech could be regulated only if it presented “a clear and present danger,” and then, more narrowly, in 1969, only if it was likely to incite “imminent lawless action.” Each of these cases concerned a political protest: a socialist anti-conscription flyer, in the first, and a speech by a Klansman, in the second. Courts have generally allowed exceptions only for “content-neutral” regulations that restrict how people may speak, not what they can say. When private business or government funding is involved, the legal lines are more tangled. For decades, the Federal Communications Commission attempted to insure balanced news coverage with its fairness doctrine, which compelled broadcasters to present “discussion of conflicting views of public importance.” And when disputes arise on campus, courts typically distinguish between public institutions, which are bound by the First Amendment, and private ones, which may retain stronger rights to set their own rules.","2052","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"For many modern free-speech advocates, the First Amendment is irrelevant: their main target is not repressive laws but shifting norms and values. In “End of Discussion,” Ham and Benson argue that the real problem is the politicization of everyday life. “Grievance mongering, apology demanding, and scalp collecting are modeled at the national level by ruthless professionals,” they write, “then replicated straight on down the line.” In their view, the effect of all this complaining is “an insidious strain of self-censorship” among regular folks. Ham and Benson have the requisite stories to tell, including a picturesque episode involving a Minnesota university that arranged to bring a camel to campus, as a stress-relief treatment, only to cancel the appearance after protests; one student explained online that “camels are associated with stereotypes that reinforce harmful Western (read: white) perceptions of Arab people.” What Ham and Benson want is to reënergize “the rich American tradition of a loud, raucous, messy, free speech free-for-all,” complete with camels and lecherous pop songs. It is this vision of how we should speak to one another—and not an abstract belief in the right to speak—that animates their book.","2053","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Ham and Benson, conservatives striving to be evenhanded, describe hostility to free speech as a sickness to which both conservatives and liberals are susceptible, even though, in their judgment, conservatives have a stronger immune system. Powers, revelling in her status as a liberal speaking truth to the liberal powers that be, makes a more partisan case, and in some ways a more convincing one. She is battling an underlying ideology, one essential to modern liberalism: a belief that we have an urgent duty not merely to fight discrimination but to signal our disapproval of those who support it. Her examples include Voice for Life, a pro-life group that was initially denied recognition by the student government of Johns Hopkins University, partly out of concern that its “sidewalk counselling” sessions could be considered harassment of women.","2054","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Like Ham and Benson, Powers struggles to find worthy sparring partners. There is no advocacy group or high-profile politician avowedly devoted to the cause of cracking down on political speech, no national spokesperson for the war on camels. So the authors are forced to argue with evanescent Facebook groups or obscure junior faculty members or young people who had the misfortune to be quoted in the college newspaper. No doubt many liberals have grown increasingly sensitive to the uses and abuses of language. This might be a consequence of previously marginalized groups demanding respect, or it might have something to do with technological change, as the atomized Internet age gives way to the non-stop commentary of the social-media age. And it may be the case that this focus on language will prove, in the long run, unhelpful to the progressive movement. But it is hard to see how, as Powers argues, “the left is killing free speech” merely by paying too much attention to it. Last month, speaking about criminal-justice reform, President Obama issued twin exhortations. “We should not be tolerating rape in prison,” he said. “And we shouldn’t be making jokes about it in our popular culture.” To someone like Powers, this might have sounded faintly oppressive: the President telling citizens what jokes not to tell. Yet our discourse is shaped by innumerable taboos. (Just think of all the things one shouldn’t say about members of the military.) Certainly, some new taboos are emerging, even as some older ones fade away, but no one with Internet access will find it easy to claim that, in general, our speech is more inhibited than it used to be. Taboos discourage some speech, but the system of taboos is also maintained through speech. If you say the unsayable, you might well be shamed—and that shaming can have consequences—but you will not be arrested. Mostly, what inhibits speech is the fear of being spoken about.","2055","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Earlier this year, Powers took part in a debate over the proposition that “liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus.” One of the people on the other side was Angus Johnston, a historian of student activism. He cited the case of Robert J. Birgeneau, the former chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, who was invited to deliver the commencement address at Haverford College last year, but declined in the face of protests; students had demanded that he apologize for the actions of U.C.B. police officers who arrested seven students during a 2011 demonstration. Powers considers Birgeneau the victim of a “campaign of intolerance,” but Johnston sees him as a perpetrator. “Birgeneau, an administrator who presided over the beating and arrest of student protesters, is portrayed as a free-speech martyr,” he said. “The students who just wanted to talk to him about that are portrayed as his oppressors.” Johnston conceded that “stifling” was worrisome, but insisted that the true culprits were administrators—liberal, perhaps, in political outlook, but motivated merely by “opposition to disruptiveness and clamor.” These days, just about everyone claims to be on the side of free speech.","2056","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Two decades ago, the argument was more even. On one side were conservative advocates like Dinesh D’Souza, who, in his 1991 best-seller “Illiberal Education,” denounced what he called “the new censorship.” On the other side were liberal scholars willing to question both the cultural norms and the legal traditions underlying free-speech claims. In 1993, the legal scholar Cass Sunstein published “Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech,” which argued that the First Amendment was meant to protect “democratic deliberation.” With that goal in mind, he wrote, the government might justifiably act to promote healthy debate, as the F.C.C. did with its fairness doctrine, or to ban corrosive and nonpolitical speech, such as violent pornography. The so-called marketplace of ideas was, just like any other market, imperfect, and could similarly be improved by careful government intervention.","2057","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Stanley Fish, the literary scholar, had even more fundamental objections to free-speech rhetoric. His mischievous contribution to the debate, published the next year, was “There’s No Such Thing as Free Speech: And It’s a Good Thing, Too,” which argued that free expression was no one’s “primary value.” On college campuses, for instance, the core educational mission routinely trumps students’ rights to express themselves. (Rules against plagiarism and disruptive behavior are both, in a sense, campus speech regulations.) Free speech, in Fish’s unsentimental account, was a “political prize,” a tag awarded by politically powerful groups to whatever forms of expression they approved of. And since all meaningful speech existed within a community, where it was shaped by what he called “productive constraint,” alarmist warnings about creeping political correctness were absurd. The question of whether to regulate so-called “hate speech” was “no more or less difficult than the question of whether spectators at a trial can applaud or boo the statements of opposing counsels.”","2058","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"In the years since, restrictive campus speech codes have been widely repealed, which is why modern free-speech advocates are often left to battle less draconian forms of censorship, like cancelled commencement addresses. Sunstein’s and Fish’s books now seem radical—but only in America, which is virtually the only place in the world that takes such an expansive view of free speech. (The U.S. is one of a handful of countries that refuse to honor a United Nations convention calling for laws against “dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred.”) In this respect, the First Amendment has something in common with the Second Amendment, which secures the right to “keep and bear arms”: both are unusually broad legal guarantees that mark a difference between America and the rest of the world.","2059","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Perhaps it is no coincidence that one of the most influential free-speech skeptics in America today is an immigrant. Jeremy Waldron is a law professor from New Zealand who teaches at New York University. In 2012, he published “The Harm in Hate Speech,” a powerful little book that seeks to dismantle familiar defenses of the right to indefensible speech. Waldron is unimpressed by the “liberal bravado” of free-speech advocates who say, “I hate what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” In his view, the people who say this rarely feel threatened by the speech they say they hate. Unfettered political expression came to seem like a bedrock American value only in the twentieth century, when the government no longer feared radical pamphleteers.","2060","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"This, in essence, was Justice Holmes’s rationale, in 1919, when he argued in an influential dissent that antiwar anarchists should be free to agitate. “Nobody can suppose that the surreptitious publishing of a silly leaflet by an unknown man, without more, would present any immediate danger,” he wrote. Free-speech advocates typically claim that the value of unfettered expression outweighs any harm it might cause, offering assurances that any such harm will be minimal. But what makes them so sure? America’s free-speech regime is shot through with exceptions, including civil (and, in some states, criminal) laws against libel. By what rationale do we insist that groups—races, communities of faith—don’t deserve similar protection? Waldron uses the term “hate speech” in a particular sense, to denote not speech that expresses hatred but speech likely to inspire it. If we want a society that recognizes the dignity of marginalized groups, he argues, then we should be willing to enact “laws that prohibit the mobilization of social forces to exclude them.” This would involve carving out an exception to the First Amendment. But there are plenty of exceptions already, and taken together they form a rough portrait of what we value and what we don’t.","2061","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Many free-speech arguments turn on a deceptively simple question: what is speech? It’s clear that the protected category excludes all sorts of statements. (The First Amendment will be of no use to someone who writes a fraudulent contract, or who says, “Hand over your wallet and iPhone,” and means it.) But judges have also agreed that some forms of speech are more important than others, and therefore more protected. They sometimes talk about “expressive conduct,” which can seem like another way of saying “useless speech”: utterances that do little more than disclose a point of view. When speech serves a clear purpose, we tend to call it something else.","2062","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"One example is political advertising; its apparent efficacy is precisely the reason that some reformers want to limit it. In the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Supreme Court considered the case of a conservative political group, Citizens United, that wanted to broadcast and advertise a documentary critical of Hillary Clinton, who was then a senator and a Presidential candidate. The F.E.C. viewed the film as an improper “electioneering communication.” The Court ruled against the F.E.C., declaring that “prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is an outright ban on speech.” Citizens United was probably the most consequential free-speech ruling of the modern era, although its detractors would say that it wasn’t about free speech at all. (Powers has said that she disagrees with the Citizens United decision, which explains why she wrote a book about free speech without mentioning it.) Earlier this year, on the first day of her current Presidential campaign, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to get “unaccountable money” out of politics, as a response to the Citizens United decision. For opponents of the decision, it is awkward, to say the least, that their leading ally is the same politician whom the plaintiffs’ film sought to criticize.","2063","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Waldron argues that hate speech could, in theory, be very consequential, and therefore a proper target for regulation. His book, which is rigorous, if rather cool-blooded, has little to say on the subject of how these harms actually occur. It begins with the hypothetical example of a Muslim father who sees a sign that shows a picture of Muslim children along with the words “They are all called Osama.” Waldron’s point is that such signs would constitute an assault on the dignity and the status of Muslims in America. (A British man who displayed similar signs in his window was sentenced to a year in prison, for “religiously aggravated harassment.”) But Waldron doesn’t succeed in showing that such a provocation really would undermine civil society. He cites the same hoary examples that have shaped recent jurisprudence: neo-Nazis marching through an Illinois town, far-flung Klansmen and their crosses. Waldron would be more persuasive if he had more to say about newer forms of hate speech, which tend to be more personal—and possibly more damaging.","2064","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Who was the d.j. that night at Fitzgerald’s? In “End of Discussion,” Ham and Benson say they tried and failed to identify him; they call him “some dude who was just trying to pay his bills by spinning records.” The complaining student, on the other hand, has been named in numerous accounts of the incident, including Ham and Benson’s, and, as a result, she has become the target of online vituperation. More than a year after the incident, a Google search for her name brings up, on the first page, a comment thread titled “EataDICK dumbcunt.” We live in a world, evidently, where a college-town d.j. who plays a popular song can inspire a Facebook protest that will eventually cost him his gig. But we also live in a world where an undergraduate who protests at her local bar can find herself vilified around the world, achieving the sort of Internet infamy that will eventually fade but never entirely dissipate.

"Perhaps America’s First Amendment, like the Second, is ultimately a matter of national preference. In Britain, Twitter users have been jailed for sending abusive tweets; in France, Twitter was compelled to help a prosecutor identify pseudonymous users accused of sending anti-Semitic tweets. But legislators in this country have had a harder time outlawing online harassment. Last year, Arizona enacted a law aimed at curbing so-called “revenge porn,” the popular term for sharing naked or sexual images of people without their consent. The American Civil Liberties Union sued, calling the law overly broad, because it could have been used to imprison anyone who shared the Abu Ghraib photographs, or the ruinous self-portraits of Anthony Weiner, the former congressman. In a settlement, Arizona agreed not to enforce it.","2066","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Speech nuts, like gun nuts, have amassed plenty of arguments, but they—we—are driven, too, by a shared sensibility that can seem irrational by European standards. And, just as good-faith gun-rights advocates don’t pretend that every gun owner is a third-generation hunter, free-speech advocates need not pretend that every provocative utterance is a valuable contribution to a robust debate, or that it is impossible to make any distinctions between various kinds of speech. In the case of online harassment, that instinctive preference for “free speech” may already be shaping the kinds of discussions we have, possibly by discouraging the participation of women, racial and sexual minorities, and anyone else likely to be singled out for ad-hominem abuse. Some kinds of free speech really can be harmful, and people who want to defend it anyway should be willing to say so.","2067","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"On social media, the posts are often public, but the forum itself is decidedly not. Most of the time, disputes about online harassment are handled not by government investigators but by administrators from the small number of companies that dominate social media. We are outsourcing some of our most important free-speech decisions to these sites, which must do what the First Amendment often prevents government from doing, at least explicitly: balance the value of free speech against other, competing values. Earlier this year, a journalist named Lindy West wrote about the many ways she has been harassed online: she said that just about every day someone calls her “a fat bitch (or some pithy variation thereof)”; one particularly enterprising foe apparently created a satirical Twitter account in the voice of West’s father, who had recently died. In the aftermath, Dick Costolo, the C.E.O. of Twitter, conceded, “We suck at dealing with abuse.” A few months later, Twitter announced that it would begin allowing users to report abuse even if they weren’t the targets, and that it would require users suspected of harassment to provide their phone numbers, to make it harder for people banned from the site to re-register. Compared with a jail sentence, the threat of account termination may seem mild. But, as social networks grow more powerful, online erasure may come to seem more intimidating. And free-speech activists might find that tech executives make even more effective censors than college administrators do.","2068","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"The rise of social media illuminates the incoherence in Ham and Benson’s book, which both celebrates the power of the First Amendment and mourns the kind of “free speech free-for-all” that, they suggest, the First Amendment is powerless to protect. The Constitution, as currently interpreted, seems to offer little help in fostering the kinds of conversations they believe to be so vital. It’s not hard to imagine a time, not long from now, when advocates decide that more proactive measures are needed in order to protect our speech rights online. Imagine a law written to make sure that controversial users—pastors dedicated to “curing” gay people, say, or activists reproducing the Charlie Hebdo images of the Prophet Muhammad—wouldn’t be blocked or suspended by social-media networks merely for speaking out.","2069","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"When government officials tell a private corporation to allow citizens to speak, are they upholding the First Amendment or flouting it? That was the question that President Reagan considered in 1987, when Congress moved to enshrine the fairness doctrine, arguing that it was necessary to “ensure the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources.” Reagan vetoed the bill, and delivered a stern statement explaining why. He said that government had no business telling radio and television stations what kinds of political discussions they should broadcast. Any effort in that direction would be “antagonistic to the freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment.” In his view, robust debate was important—but free speech was more important still. ♦","2070","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Two months ago, in the first speech of his Presidential campaign, Donald Trump departed from his prepared text in order to speak—vehemently and apparently extemporaneously—about the issues that concerned him most. One of the first was immigration, and he suggested, somewhat paradoxically, that unauthorized immigrants from Mexico were out-competing American workers (“They are beating us, economically”) and also undermining American society. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems,” he added, and then he provided a taxonomy: “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists—and some, I assume, are good people.”","August 19, 2015","2071","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"Some observers thought that the speech was a political disaster, especially because of that one extraordinarily inflammatory word: “rapists.” But it’s clear, in retrospect, that this speech marked the beginning of the Trump surge. The speech inspired weeks of coverage, making Trump—who was unapologetic—the biggest story in political media. A few weeks after the speech, NBC announced that, “due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants,” it would no longer broadcast his Miss U.S.A. or Miss Universe pageants, and he would no longer appear on “The Apprentice,” the long-running reality show. It is possible that, by disrupting Trump’s television career, NBC only made him more motivated to succeed in politics. Less than a month after his launch speech, a poll put Trump, for the first time, atop the Republican heap. It is likely that, by using the R-word, Trump helped establish himself as the only Republican candidate eager to speak his mind on an issue that most of the field would prefer to avoid: immigration.","2072","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"This past weekend, Trump released his first detailed policy statement, on the topic that made him a front-runner; it is called “Immigration Reform that Will Make America Great Again.” He called for more immigration officers, tougher penalties for visitors who overstay their visas, a “pause” in the issuing of new green cards, the end of “birthright citizenship,” and the construction of a “permanent border wall”—to be paid for, he said, by Mexico. This last proposal drew plenty of scorn, since it is hard to imagine how the Mexican government might be induced to spend billions of dollars on a barrier at the behest of U.S. politicians. (Trump suggested that, in the face of Mexican recalcitrance, the U.S. could “impound” remittances from unauthorized workers and charge higher fees to visitors from Mexico.) But some Trump skeptics seemed pleasantly surprised. The editors of National Review, who had previously accused Trump of “intellectual failure” for his unclear statements on immigration, offered qualified praise for the new plan. “It is sensible in its basic outline,” they wrote, “and better in many respects than the ideas presented by his rivals.”","2073","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"On Tuesday night, during an interview with Bill O’Reilly on Fox News, Trump reiterated his call for “a big, beautiful, powerful wall” to be built on the border with Mexico. On the matter of birthright citizenship, O’Reilly said that Trump’s plan to abolish it would be foiled by the Fourteenth Amendment, which says, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.” Trump, needless to say, was unperturbed. “Many lawyers are saying that’s not the way it is,” he replied—referring, perhaps, to advocates and scholars who argue that the Fourteenth Amendment has been widely misinterpreted.","2074","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"Earlier this summer, it seemed that Trump’s presence in the race could actually make it easier for the other Republican candidates to avoid talking about immigration. They could merely affirm that Trump’s comments about “rapists” were “extraordinarily ugly” or “offensive and inaccurate,” repudiating him without making any specific commitments of their own. Trump’s new proposal may compel them to have the kind of policy discussion that Presidential campaigns are, in general, designed to avoid.","2075","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"In early June, Pew published a new poll chronicling the country’s mixed feelings about immigration. Among other things, the poll provided yet more proof that, when it comes to immigration, Republican politicians are often out of step with Republican voters. When asked to choose between two assertions about the impact of immigration on the U.S., sixty-three per cent of Republicans agreed that immigrants “burden” the country by taking jobs, housing, and health care; only twenty-seven per cent agreed that they “strengthen” the country “through hard work & talents.” But the Republican majority was in the national minority: over all, respondents chose “strengthen” over “burden,” by a margin of fifty-one to forty-one. The numbers explain why, especially in general elections, Republican candidates like Mitt Romney and John McCain have taken pains to emphasize America’s hospitability to immigrants. But the numbers also help account for the frustration among Republican voters who have noticed that, when it comes to immigration, their own party is ignoring them.","2076","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"At the same time, the Pew poll captured a broader ambivalence about immigration. Although Democrats said that they wanted unauthorized immigrants to be able to remain in the country, only forty-eight per cent said that they should be able to apply for citizenship; only twenty-four per cent said that legal immigration should be increased. Meanwhile, a majority of Republicans agreed that granting legal status to unauthorized immigrants was “like a reward for doing something wrong”—and yet a majority of Republicans, even conservative Republicans, said that unauthorized immigrants should nevertheless be “allowed to stay legally.”","2077","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"It is hard to have a consistent position on U.S. immigration laws, partly because the laws themselves seem so inconsistent, and inconsistently enforced: an immigrant who evades armed guards at the border might subsequently arrive in a so-called sanctuary city, in which the federal statutes seem not to apply. Immigrants rearranging—and sometimes risking—their lives must take into account not only the laws that currently exist but also the ways in which those laws will or will not change in coming decades. One of Trump’s simplest and boldest ideas is to end birthright citizenship, the constitutional doctrine under which anyone born inside the U.S. is considered a citizen of it. (Immigration-restriction advocates argue that birthright citizenship incentivizes unauthorized immigration.) Automatic birthright citizenship is widespread in the Americas, but not beyond them; European and Asian countries have more restrictive rules. In other words, birthright citizenship is both an American tradition and a global anomaly, which means that ending it could seem either radical or common-sensical, depending on one’s perspective and objectives.","2078","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"Already, Trump’s call for an end to birthright citizenship has brought some clarity to the Republican conversation on immigration. Scott Walker, who used to support a comprehensive reform that would allow unauthorized immigrants to remain in the country, told Fox News in March, “My view has changed.” In an interview with Breitbart last week, he talked about the need to “secure the border,” but offered few details. It wasn’t until earlier this week, when a reporter asked him about Trump’s proposal, that Walker seemed to say, apparently for the first time, that the U.S. should “absolutely” end birthright citizenship. Meanwhile, Marco Rubio said he was “open to doing things that prevent people who deliberately come to the U.S. for the purposes of taking advantage” of birthright citizenship, but said that Trump’s proposal to eliminate the doctrine was “really not a workable plan.” And Jeb Bush said, “We ought to fix the problem, rather than take away rights that are constitutionally endowed.”","2079","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"For a time, it seemed that Trump’s campaign might be merely a spectacle, albeit a captivating one. But with the release of his plan, he seems to have started something even more engrossing: a substantive political debate.

With the national vote roughly even (assuming that the polls are accurate) and the election being carried out under Britain’s constituency-based and first-past-the-post system, everything comes down to how things play out in roughly a hundred battleground seats, or, as they are called in the U.K., marginal constituencies. Over-all vote shares don’t automatically translate into numbers of seats in the House of Commons. Still, most of the pollsters are projecting that the two major parties will win roughly an equal number—somewhere around two hundred and seventy-five, which would leave both of them well short of the three hundred and twenty-six seats needed for a majority.","2082","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-dead-even-u-k-election-could-come-down-to-the-scots"

Polls published as far back as January also showed the race tied. Polls published in March showed the same thing. Right up until the last couple of weeks, though, the overwhelming consensus of opinion among British pundits was that David Cameron and the Conservatives, who for the past five years have been the senior partner in a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, would enjoy a significant bounce as the election approached.","2084","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-dead-even-u-k-election-could-come-down-to-the-scots"
"The basis of this consensus was never fully clear to me. Doubtless, some of Fleet Street’s finest papers were taking guidance from their right-wing proprietors, and from Conservative Party H.Q., which has been assiduously promoting the last-minute-surge theory. In fairness, though, there were also a couple of reasons why it sounded vaguely plausible. The British economy has grown faster than those of its European counterparts over the past couple of years, and virtually all the polls showed the Conservatives with a considerable lead over Labour on the key issue of economic management. Moreover, Ed Miliband, Labour’s youthful leader, who has been subjected to a withering and extended character assault by the Tory press, had yet to show that he could withstand the rigors of a campaign.","2085","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-dead-even-u-k-election-could-come-down-to-the-scots"
"If the polling projections turn out to be accurate, however, neither the economy nor the Labour leader’s perceived weakness is looking sufficient to deliver the election to the Conservatives, and this has to be scored as a big victory for Miliband. At this time last year, many people in his own party thought that he had no chance of being the next Prime Minister, and there was even gossip, in some quarters, about replacing him. But the forty-five-year-old North Londoner—who took over the party leadership, in 2010, after a bruising contest with his own brother, David, the foreign secretary in the last Labour government—has overcome his critics, both internal and external. Rather than softening his progressive positions on issues like taxing the rich and regulating monopolies, which had led to him to be labelled “Red Ed,” Miliband stood his ground, and, during the election campaign, his performance has exceeded most people’s expectations. While nobody could mistake him for one of the great Labour orators of the past, such as Nye Bevan or Tony Blair, he has been articulate and forceful, and, crucially, he didn’t make any big gaffes.","2086","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-dead-even-u-k-election-could-come-down-to-the-scots"
"Indeed, if it weren’t for what is occurring in Scotland, where the Scottish National Party (S.N.P.) looks like it will sweep the board, Miliband would be on the verge of a great victory. On the basis of history, Labour could have been expected to add to the forty seats it currently holds north of the border. Adding, say, forty-five Scottish seats to the two hundred and seventy-five or so that it is projected to win in England and Wales would have brought Labour close to a majority, which would almost certainly have allowed it to cobble together enough additional support from minor parties to form a government. Miliband would have become the seventh Labour Prime Minister, and the first or second Jewish Prime Minister, depending on how Benjamin Disraeli is categorized. (Dizzy came from a Jewish family that converted to the Church of England, and he was buried in an Anglican graveyard.)","2087","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-dead-even-u-k-election-could-come-down-to-the-scots"
"Miliband could yet win, through. If the Conservatives end up with the most seats, Prime Minister David Cameron and his sidekick George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, will surely seek to form another coalition with the Liberal Democrats, which are in danger of being reduced to a rump party. (Many Liberal voters, who tend to be “liberal” in the American sense of the word, have never reconciled themselves to cohabiting with the Tories.) If Labour gets more seats in the Commons than the Conservatives, Miliband will probably seek to form a minority government, relying on the tacit support of the S.N.P.","2088","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-dead-even-u-k-election-could-come-down-to-the-scots"
"But the strength of the Scottish separatist party has greatly complicated things. The S.N.P. benefited politically from last year’s referendum on independence, even though it didn’t get the result it wanted; its plainspoken new leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was the star of this campaign. Not only has the S.N.P. surge made it tricky to predict what will happen over the next week or two, it has raised the larger question of whether, despite the referendum result, Scotland might end up departing from the Union. If the fate of the British government hangs on the votes in the House of Commons of a party that is committed to getting out of Great Britain, English resentment toward the Scots, which is already evident, will escalate sharply. Indeed, it is not completely beyond the bounds of speculation that the English could end up declaring independence from Scotland!","2089","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-dead-even-u-k-election-could-come-down-to-the-scots"

It was the first burger I ever had. It was very tasty.” When she reached Columbus, she paid her brother a thousand dollars, which he turned over to the guides, or coyotes, who had made the trip possible.","2103","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Eventually, Flores got a job as a cashier at a Wendy’s. “It was really hard for me, because I couldn’t tell what the Americans wanted,” she said. “When I learned more English, I started taking orders.” She soon met David Flores, who was also in the United States illegally. They got married and had twin boys, David and Luis, in 2000, and a third son, Iker, four years ago. “David has always been a really good person and a really good father,” Flores said. “In Mexico, we are used to men not washing dishes and not doing anything around the house, and he is the opposite.” Today, David operates a taco truck, which he stations in a parking lot near the small duplex apartment where the family lives, just outside Columbus. David is in the truck from 11 A.M. to 9 P.M. on weekdays, and on Sundays he works at McDonald’s. When Olga is not caring for the children, she is in her kitchen, preparing the rice, intestines, and tongue for the truck.","2104","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Like many people who have arrived illegally from Mexico, Flores has built a productive life here. She is a longtime resident, has no criminal record, and is the parent of American citizens. Through much of Barack Obama’s Presidency, there was a political near-consensus regarding the need to address the status of immigrants like Flores. Under the immigration-reform law passed by the Senate in 2013, she would have had a path to become a citizen; under the executive actions announced by President Obama in 2014, she could have obtained work papers and a driver’s license. But the House failed to vote on the Senate’s immigration bill, and a federal court in Texas has placed Obama’s initiative on hold.","2105","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The result is a comprehensive breakdown in public policy. During the Obama Administration, which purports to be dedicated to easing the plight of residents like her, Flores and her peers have faced greater threats of deportation than at any time in decades. Republicans, for their part, have ended their brief experiment, reflected in the Senate bill, in bipartisanship on immigration. The Party is now close to united in opposition to any initiative that might offer Flores and others the chance to become American citizens. Flores, and the roughly eleven million people in similar situations, have no choice but to wait and worry.","2106","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Donald Trump, in his speech announcing his candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination, in June, addressed the issue of illegal immigration from Mexico. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” (The crime rate among first-generation immigrants is significantly lower than that of the general population, according to Bianca Bersani, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.) Trump’s remarks prompted several of his business partners, including Univision and Macy’s, to sever their ties with him, but the comments have led to relatively little examination of the lives of the immigrants themselves.","2107","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"For many years, Flores’s legal status existed for her as a kind of background anxiety, affecting her life in modest ways. Because traffic stops by the police could lead to deportation, she drove the family car as little as possible, and never out of state. “Here, at least, we know the city, we know the streets, we know which are one-way or two-way,” she said. “If we go somewhere else, we are scared that we don’t know the area.” Now her situation has taken on a new urgency. Early this year, her son Iker had a series of infections that proved resistant to treatment. “The first two times that I took him to the doctor, they said it was an ear infection and then a throat infection, and they did not draw blood. On the fourteenth of February, we noticed that he had some red dots on his ears. That’s when they drew blood. Four days later, they told me he had cancer of the blood”—acute lymphocytic leukemia. Iker has begun a course of chemotherapy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, in Columbus, which is likely to take three or four years.","2108","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"“Before I had children, I thought about what if the police would pick me up—I would just leave, go back to Mexico, even though I haven’t been there in a long time,” Flores told me. “Now that my child is sick, I really do worry. Medicine back home is very different. When you go to the doctor, you have to take money before things happen. He has a higher probability of surviving in the United States. Now we have to stay.”","2109","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"When I visited the Floreses’ apartment, Olga demonstrated a trick with sour cream that she had learned during a stint working at Chipotle. She emptied a five-pound jar into a metal bowl, then whipped it with a wooden spoon. “If you whip it first, it comes out of the squirt bottles easier,” she said. The family’s duplex is in a town-house development. There are two refrigerators squeezed into the kitchen, to accommodate the restaurant-size quantities of food that the family must buy and prepare every week for the taco truck. Iker sat on the sofa watching cartoons on a big-screen television. He’s an outgoing kid, who moves seamlessly between English and Spanish, but he has been having a tough time with the chemotherapy. He’s weak and very thin, and has trouble keeping food down. Lately, he has been struggling to walk up the stairs to his bedroom, so Olga is carrying him around more than she once did. His brothers help out, but at this moment they were at the truck, helping their father.","2110","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Shortly after Iker’s cancer was diagnosed, Flores went to see Julie Nemecek, an immigration lawyer in Columbus, to ask about her options for establishing a more secure basis for remaining in the United States. Nemecek had handled many similar cases before. “Most of the people I hear from have been in Ohio for a long time, and the vast majority are undocumented, because they snuck across the border,” she said. “They have made lives here. They have been in hiding, hoping that when they drive to work or take their kids to school they won’t get stopped.” Nemecek offers clients like Flores little reassurance. “Everything is in limbo, so people are uncertain, and they feel hopeless,” she said.","2111","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"When Barack Obama ran for the Presidency, he pledged to enact comprehensive immigration reform, but he didn’t push the issue in his first two years in office, when Democrats had strong majorities in both houses of Congress. Instead, he made what became known as a “down payment” for a bipartisan immigration bill later in his Presidency.","2112","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"“There was definitely in the Obama Administration an intention to do tough enforcement as a down payment for comprehensive immigration reform later,” Marc Rosenblum, of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, said. Rosenblum is the deputy director of the institute’s U.S.-immigration-policy program. “The idea was to prove to Republicans that he could be trusted on enforcement, so that he could get a path to citizenship in return.”","2113","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The first part of the down payment was to toughen enforcement at the Mexican border. Under Obama, a record number of agents are patrolling the border: nearly twenty thousand, roughly five times as many as there were two decades ago. In the light of this change, the Obama Administration has claimed that the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border has reached a forty-year low. (The faltering economy during Obama’s first term, which made the United States a less promising destination, was certainly another important factor in the decline.)","2114","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The more controversial part of Obama’s down payment involved immigrants who had already arrived and settled in the United States. The Administration greatly expanded a program known as Secure Communities, in which information was shared between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the F.B.I. Whenever anyone was arrested and booked, his or her fingerprints would be sent to the F.B.I., as before, but now the information would also go to the immigration authorities. “It was a huge force multiplier,” Rosenblum said. “The program was pitched as a tool to find serious criminals, but, at least initially, the vast majority of people were picked up for traffic violations and very minor offenses. A lot of these people ended up being deported.” Julie Nemecek recalled, “Around 2010, the number of my Mexican clients increased, with enforcement getting really, really heavy because of Secure Communities. People were getting picked up left and right when their only offense was driving without a license or drunk driving.” As a result of tougher enforcement, deportations soared under Obama. Since 2009, removals of illegal immigrants have averaged more than four hundred thousand per year, compared with an average of two hundred and fifty thousand per year under George W. Bush.","2115","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Secure Communities had an enormous impact on the day-to-day lives of Latinos in the United States. “There are people who are not a safety threat who are snared into the deportation apparatus,” Clarissa Martínez, the deputy vice-president of the National Council of La Raza, a leading Hispanic-rights organization, told me. “Also, when you start deputizing local law enforcement to help apply immigration law, you are going to have abuses, and that’s what happened. People feel that regardless of whether you are first-, second-, third-generation American, the folks who are going to be stopped are going to be Latinos.” Rosenblum said, “Until the last decade or so, the chances were, if you made it past the border, you were not going to get deported, unless you were committing serious crimes. But, with the crackdown, the broader immigrant community felt under attack. They lived here, and suddenly they were unable to work, unable to drive.”","2116","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Still, the underlying theory was that Secure Communities would be the stick, and comprehensive immigration reform would be the carrot—and the goal appeared within reach after Obama was reëlected, in 2012. The defeat of Mitt Romney brought Republicans to the realization that they had to broaden their appeal to Hispanics, the fastest-growing group of potential voters in the nation. In March of 2013, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, released a report that said the Party “must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.” In short order, many Republicans in the Senate, including such prominent figures as John McCain and Marco Rubio, did just that, and a bill that included a path to citizenship for people like Olga Flores passed by a vote of sixty-eight to thirty-two.","2117","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The battle over immigration reform presents a clash of fundamentally different visions of the role of the federal government. The President and his allies assert that their position is based on a combination of realism and compassion. They argue that it’s impossible to deport all of the country’s illegal immigrants. In addition, they say, it’s heartless to break up families who are long settled in the United States.","2118","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Opponents of reform, who are led by Jeff Sessions, a Republican senator from Alabama, believe that national security, along with the rule of law, compels a different approach. “If everyone who enters the country illegally can stay and become a citizen, that just encourages more people to come illegally,” Sessions told me. “If people see that they have nothing to fear after they cross the border and settle here, then that creates an incentive for more people to come, and that’s wrong. If they are here illegally, they should be deported.” What’s more, he argues, a porous border invites criminals, including terrorists, to settle in the promised land of the United States.","2119","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Yet John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House, and Eric Cantor, the Majority Leader, described themselves as supporters of immigration reform, and it was clear after the 2012 election that the votes were there to pass it. “Boehner promised the President that he was going to bring a bill to the floor,” a former White House aide told me. “There’s always a significant House-versus-Senate rivalry, so the Senate bill itself was going to be a nonstarter in the House. But some sort of reform bill was sure to pass if it came to a vote.” Virtually all of the Democrats in the House, as well as some Republicans, supported comprehensive reform along the lines of the Senate bill, but immigration reform was anathema to the Tea Party. Boehner asked staff from the House leadership to come up with a proposal that modified the Senate bill without gutting it. The result was an outline of recommendations, but conservatives in the House persuaded Boehner to back away from them.","2120","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"After the passage of the Senate bill, chances for any sort of reform bill in the House began to recede. The government shutdown, for two weeks in October of 2013, poisoned relations between the President and congressional Republicans. Then, on June 10, 2014, Cantor lost a primary to a poorly funded and largely unknown challenger, who focussed his campaign on Cantor’s alleged softness on illegal immigration. The victor, David Brat, went on to win the seat. Republican support for reform suddenly vanished. As the former White House aide told me, “There was always this germ of hope, but then Eric Cantor lost his primary. There was probably a five-per-cent chance before that, and it went to zero.”","2121","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Olga Flores speaks English imperfectly, so some of our conversations were interpreted by Jessica Pantaleon Camacho, who works as an assistant in Julie Nemecek’s law office. Pantaleon Camacho was born in Mexico twenty years ago and brought to the U.S. illegally as a three-year-old. “When I started going to high school, I convinced myself that school was the only way I could get my family out of the situation,” she told me. “I took all Advanced Placement classes starting in my sophomore year. I graduated near the top of my class.” Her teachers wrote enthusiastic recommendations to colleges, and Pantaleon Camacho was accepted at several schools, with scholarship offers. “When I was about to graduate, we had to decide what school,” she said. “That’s when they told me that I needed a Social Security number. I wasn’t able to provide it.”","2122","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Pantaleon Camacho is among the “Dreamers,” the term that has come to define the group of people who were brought illegally to the United States when they were children. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, known as the DREAM Act, was presented several years ago as a modest alternative to the round of comprehensive immigration reform that was stalled in Congress at the time. The law would provide a path to citizenship for people like Pantaleon Camacho, who had essentially lived their entire lives as Americans. It failed, and the President began taking a series of unilateral executive actions designed to ease the plight of the Dreamers. On June 15, 2012, the Obama Administration announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The program would give as many as 1.7 million people work authorization and a two-year reprieve from deportation, which was renewable for another two years. In most cases, this meant that the Dreamers were also eligible for driver’s licenses and, in some states, for in-state tuition at state universities. Almost eight hundred thousand individuals applied for DACA coverage, and about eighty-four per cent of them were approved.","2123","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Pantaleon Camacho was one of them. “It has changed my life,” she told me. “I have a Social Security number and a driver’s license. I am able to drive without fear of being pulled over and being sent back to Mexico.” Her job in the lawyer’s office is on the books. She was admitted to Bowling Green, a state university in Ohio, but she is ineligible for any scholarship assistance, so she takes classes at a local community college. “It all comes out of my own pocket,” Pantaleon Camacho told me. Her situation is much improved but still tenuous: her DACA status expires roughly at the end of the Obama Administration, and no one knows what the next President will do with the program.","2124","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"DACA did nothing to help families like the Floreses, in which the parents came to the U.S. as adults and the children were born here. By 2014, immigration activists began putting greater pressure on Obama to take executive action to help more families. “When Boehner pulled out of the process, that’s when there was a total focus on the President, because the legislative door had been shut,” Clarissa Martínez, of La Raza, said. The White House felt the heat. “There was a period in 2014 when the immigration activists gave up on Congress and said it’s now on the President,” the former White House aide said. “They started calling him Deporter-in-Chief. The President brought them all in. He said by criticizing him they were letting the Republicans off the hook. He said he needed more time. He said, ‘I will do everything I can at the end of the summer.’ ” But Democratic Senate candidates in competitive races, like Kay Hagan, in North Carolina, implored the White House not to take any controversial steps on immigration before the midterm elections. Obama agreed; activists seethed; virtually all the Democratic candidates, including Hagan, lost anyway.","2125","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Finally, on November 20, 2014, just a few weeks after the elections, Obama launched his long-awaited series of executive actions on immigration. As the President explained in a rare prime-time address from the White House, the centerpiece was an initiative called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, known as DAPA. This program, which would be run by the Department of Homeland Security, was aimed at the parents of American citizens who were themselves illegally in the country but had been law-abiding residents of the United States since 2010. Following a case-by-case review, they would receive an immigration status known as “deferred action,” enabling them to apply for work permits and driver’s licenses. DAPA was intended to cover about 3.6 million people, more than thirty per cent of the illegal immigrants in the United States. The D.H.S. made plans to hire as many as three thousand new employees, some of whom would work in Arlington, Virginia, in an eleven-story building that the government leased for $7.8 million a year. (Also on November 20th, Obama expanded eligibility for the DACA program, and replaced Secure Communities with a program that targets serious criminals.) According to Obama’s plan, the government would begin accepting applications for deferred action under DAPA in February, 2015.","2126","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"“DAPA is of tremendous magnitude,” Clarissa Martínez said. “It’s what Americans want of the undocumented community—that they come forward, go through criminal-background checks, and those who are working do so legally. For the American public, it sounds practical and pragmatic to give people who have deep roots in the community and have good moral character a chance to get right with the law. The announcement of these programs was an incredible step forward and the biggest progress we’ve seen on the issue in two decades.”","2127","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The Floreses pride themselves on using fresh, authentic ingredients for their food truck. Olga showed off a large maguey leaf, from a variety of agave, which David was about to cut up, toast, and use as a seasoning for the meat before he grilled it. “The best things,” Olga said.","2128","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Olga Flores has not closely followed the twists and turns in immigration policy, but, like most immigrants, she was aware of DAPA and planned to take advantage of it. There is a cruel asymmetry to immigration law: the people with the most at stake have the most trouble understanding it. This is because, even for lawyers, immigration law is notoriously complicated. It’s related to, but ultimately very different from, other criminal or civil litigation; immigration law has its own traditions and doctrines—and the rules often change. For civilians, the morass is difficult to navigate, and for non-English-speaking immigrants the law can be nearly impenetrable. Still, everyone knew that Obama’s November 20th directives were hugely significant. On the night of Obama’s speech, many immigration-rights groups around the country held viewing parties to celebrate the news. Flores was hopeful, too. “We were very excited,” she told me.","2129","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"But two weeks after Obama’s announcement Texas and sixteen other states sued the federal government to stop the DAPA program. Eight states joined later. The heart of the case against the Administration is the contention that Obama overstepped his authority in establishing the program. “The case isn’t about any particular immigration policy; it’s about the rule of law,” Scott Keller, the Texas solicitor general, told me. “DAPA rewrites the immigration statutes, and the executive does not have unilateral authority to do that. Congress has not granted the executive the power to deem people who are unlawfully in the country to be eligible for work permits, Medicare, unemployment benefits, and access to international travel. Congress has done quite the opposite. The executive can’t do it alone.”","2130","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Obama Administration lawyers fired back from several directions. First, they argued that Texas and the other states lacked standing—that is, that they had no right to file the case in the first place, because DAPA imposed no obligations on the states. “The core of Texas’s argument is that they will have to pay for driver’s licenses for the beneficiaries of DAPA,” an Administration official told me. “But that’s not enough to get them standing. It’s a very incidental expense, and they could raise their prices to cover it, anyway. States don’t get to sue just because they don’t like the policies of the federal government, and that’s what this case is really about.” The plaintiffs have argued that they have standing because DAPA will encourage illegal immigration, which would be an imposition on states. Yet fourteen states and the District of Columbia filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of DAPA, asserting that the program would actually help, not burden, individual states. “When immigrants are able to work legally—even for a limited time—their wages increase, they seek work compatible with their skill level, and they enhance their skills to obtain higher wages, all of which benefits State economies by increasing income and growing the tax base,” the brief explains.","2131","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"On the merits, too, Administration lawyers argued that the President was within his rights to extend these benefits to undocumented people. “This whole case is a matter of enforcement priorities,” the official said. “We can deport four hundred thousand people a year, but we can’t deport all eleven million undocumented people here, so the President has a right to establish his priorities for the limited time he is in office. And he’s saying that he is not going to deport people with children and ties to the community who are willing to undergo a background check.” George H. W. Bush had a similar program for a select group of immigrants, and it proceeded with little fanfare and no legal challenge.","2132","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Like the plaintiffs in many civil cases, the Texas solicitor general had wide latitude in choosing the court where he wanted to file the suit. Lawyers often do some judge-shopping if they think it will help them win their cases, and it was quickly evident that the Texas lawyers shopped wisely. Keller’s predecessor brought the lawsuit in Brownsville, close to the Mexican border. The local federal judge assigned to the case, Andrew Hanen, had already shown a marked hostility toward President Obama’s immigration policies. Hanen had been appointed to the district court in 2002 by George W. Bush, and, in earlier rulings, he had called the President’s deportation policy “misguided” and asserted that it “endangers America.”","2133","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"According to the President’s plan, the government was going to begin accepting applications for deferred action under DAPA on February 18th. Less than forty-eight hours before the program went into effect, Judge Hanen filed a hundred-and-twenty-three-page opinion issuing a preliminary injunction that put DAPA on hold. In the case known as Texas v. United States, he ruled that Texas and the other states did have standing to challenge the law, and then he ruled against the Administration on an esoteric but important matter. Hanen held that the Administration had failed to follow the correct procedures in putting DAPA into effect; he said that the Department of Homeland Security should have given the public the chance to be heard in what’s known as notice-and-comment rule-making before implementing the new policy. The opinion did not directly address the underlying legality of DAPA, but the judge offered clear hints that he was dubious about the program. DAPA “does not represent mere inadequacy; it is complete abdication,” Hanen wrote. “The D.H.S. does have discretion in the manner in which it chooses to fulfill the expressed will of Congress. It cannot, however, enact a program whereby it not only ignores the dictates of Congress, but actively acts to thwart them.”","2134","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"In a further rebuff to the Administration, Judge Hanen issued a stay on DAPA covering the entire country, even though his jurisdiction covered only part of Texas. Administration lawyers rushed an appeal of Hanen’s stay to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit—one of the most conservative circuits in the country. On May 26th, a panel of the appeals court ruled, two judges to one, that Hanen was correct to enjoin DAPA. Earlier this month, during a hearing before another three-judge panel, the same two judges maintained their skepticism about Obama’s immigration initiative. Regardless of what the Fifth Circuit ultimately rules, the losing party will still have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. As Jeff Sessions, Obama’s chief adversary in Congress, put it, “The courts may take longer than the President will be in office.” The Department of Homeland Security has put the plan to hire three thousand people to administer DAPA on indefinite hold.","2135","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"It’s always been a key part of the Administration’s plan to establish DAPA before the end of Obama’s term, making it difficult for any successor to withdraw a benefit that has already been granted. But by delaying his actions until after the 2014 midterms the President may have given his opponents, in Congress and in the courts, the time and the tools to unravel his most important work on immigration.","2136","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The oncology and hematology clinic of Nationwide Children’s Hospital is a determinedly sunny place. The furniture in the waiting room is colorful, the pictures on the walls cheerful.

His prognosis is good; his cancer has a very high survival rate. Iker has become used to the chemo port affixed to his chest. But the treatment sessions, which last as long as twelve hours at a time, are gruelling. This visit was to check his blood to see if he was ready for a chemo session the next day.

He had been attending a Head Start program when he became sick, but he’s had to drop out. “The timing for DAPA was perfect for us,” Olga told me. “Even a few days before he was diagnosed, he was going to school nine to two.

"At one point, immigration represented a kind of exception to the polarization that dominates contemporary politics in Washington. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama pushed Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform. And the Senate passed its bipartisan immigration bill only two years ago. But, as the Presidential campaign has heated up, the issue has come to split the parties in stark ways. “The experience under Obama and Bush has upped the ante on what we want to hear from candidates that are vying for the Presidency in 2016,” Clarissa Martínez said. “Both Obama and Bush said they wanted to get it done, and their hearts may have been in the right place, but they both ran into trouble with Congress. That’s why hearing that somebody believes in immigration reform is not good enough. We want to know what they will do on their own as President.”","2139","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Trump’s comments about immigrants from Mexico drew condemnation from many Republicans for his impolitic tone, but, in their substance, his views are widely shared within the Party. At various times, Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, Marco Rubio, the Florida senator, and Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor, all supported versions of immigration reform that would allow people like Olga Flores to become citizens. All have tacked right. Bush has talked recently of a path to “legalized status” for undocumented aliens rather than a path to citizenship; he also said recently that he would repeal DACA and DAPA. Rubio has said that he now favors a piecemeal approach to immigration, rather than a comprehensive bill; and Walker recently said, “I don’t believe in amnesty” for those who have entered the country illegally. Rubio and Walker have also denounced DACA and DAPA. The other Republican candidates have talked about immigration almost exclusively in terms of border enforcement. Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, recently asked a group of supporters to “imagine a President that finally, finally, finally secures the borders,” and he criticized Obama’s “lawlessness and the President’s unconstitutional executive amnesty.”","2140","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Hillary Clinton, in contrast, has staked out a position to the left of President Obama. In an appearance in Las Vegas, in May, Clinton said, “We can’t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship.” She said it was “beyond absurd” to think that all eleven million illegal immigrants in the country could be deported. And she said that she would expand DACA and DAPA. “If Congress continues to refuse to act, as President I would do everything possible under the law to go even further,” she said, suggesting, for example, that she would extend protection to the parents of Dreamers.","2141","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"For now, though, the only certainty for Olga Flores and others in similar situations is more uncertainty. If Clinton wins, and Congress remains in Republican hands, the new President will be reduced to attempting the same kind of piecemeal executive actions as Obama—if the courts even allow those to proceed. If a Republican wins, Flores’s chances of deportation will rise. Either way, the issue will remain on the national agenda, even as the opportunity to come to any solution continues to recede. ♦","2142","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"In a scene midway through HBO’s “Show Me a Hero,” one that functions as a metonym for the series, a Yonkers city councilman named Hank Spallone—played with toothpick-chewing gusto by Alfred Molina—and a photographer drive through the Schlobohm housing projects. They’re hunting for images to inflame voters: lurid proof that poor black people come from “another culture.” But their presence also changes what they see. When their sedan lingers, two giggly teen-age girls go silent, then shoot their middle fingers up in defiance. Click goes the camera. Meanwhile, a weary older woman walks by, lugging groceries. The photographer raises his lens—but then doesn’t bother.","2143","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"Written by David Simon and Bill Zorzi, directed with unshowy simplicity by Paul Haggis, and based on the excellent nonfiction book by Lisa Belkin, “Show Me a Hero” is an attempt to refocus that picture—to find beauty in daily struggles and civic courage, not in bad-boy fantasies. The six-episode miniseries, set in the nineteen-eighties and nineties, is a dramatization of the battle to desegregate Yonkers, punctuated by swigs of Maalox. As anyone who followed the real-life story knows—don’t Google it if you don’t want spoilers—it has one happy ending and one very sad one. (The title comes from F. Scott Fitzgerald: “Show me a hero, and I’ll write you a tragedy.”) It’s the latest effort by Simon, the creator of “The Wire” and “Treme,” to forge an effective model for the message drama, with plots torn not from the headlines but from the op-ed page. Well cast, solidly structured, and emotionally stirring, the show is as sincere as the Bruce Springsteen songs that make up its score, a ballad of pragmatism with a passionate heart. And, no, that’s not code for “boring.” The series builds and deepens, stanza by stanza, and then it soars.","2144","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"To a large degree, this is because of Oscar Isaac, who plays Nick Wasicsko, in a star performance agile enough to elevate scenes that might veer into agitprop. When “Show Me a Hero” begins, Wasicsko, a former cop, a flirt in a thick Pacino mustache, gets picked by the Democrats to run for mayor, challenging the incumbent, who lost support over a judicial decree to build low-income housing. Wasicsko tells voters that he’ll fight the ruling, then wins big, becoming the nation’s youngest mayor. Only then must he face facts: any court appeal is doomed, and, anyway, would bankrupt the city. Somehow, he needs to make this unpopular plan work.","2145","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"Right away, the white residents who elected Wasicsko turn against him. Civic meetings boil over into near-riots. Former supporters spit in his face. They rock his car, then shatter the windshield—and these scenes, filmed in the locations where the events the show is based on occurred, feel wild and kinetic, placing us right in the action. But Wasicsko barrels forward. What begins as practicality evolves into spiny principle: he’s a dreamy realist, a civic puzzle-solver, which proves to be its own kind of idealism. He builds bridges as they get wiped out. As his troubles increase, Wasicsko’s eyes become wells of need: he’s diligent, canny, a good listener, but he’s hooked on adoration.","2146","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"The show’s wonkiest policy debates are also its liveliest scenes, as the white men who run the city wheedle to get that mysterious force worshipped by Donald Trump: leverage. In one scene, the city planner Oscar Newman (Peter Riegert, in an Amish beard) proposes scattering just a few town houses within each white neighborhood, to discourage the “criminal element.” An A.C.L.U. lawyer (the appealingly shaggy Jon Bernthal—few shows have made such a nostalgic case for men’s hair of the eighties) calls this racist. Newman doubles down, citing research. “Public-housing residents are no different than any other renters,” he argues later. “They will jealously guard and maintain what’s theirs.” He fights for specific features, like front yards facing the street. It’s clear that Simon and Zorzi are in Newman’s camp, which favors make-it-work facts over ideology, but the show also respects the debate’s prismatic quality: the judge has his priorities, as does HUD, as do the politicians hedging career bets. Even the bigoted residents, who cloak their fears in talk of property values, are flawed, human, and, in a few cases—as with one resident, played with warm humility by Catherine Keener—capable of change. It’s a dark take on politics, but a bright one on democracy.","2147","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"If the show has a weak spot, it’s in the depiction of Schlobohm, with its grim canyons of drug dealers and struggling families. In the first few episodes, we get glimpses of four black and Latina women, all single mothers: a teen-ager with a criminal boyfriend; a laborer yearning for the kids she left behind in the Dominican Republic; a young widow; and an elderly health aide gone blind (the terrific LaTanya Richardson Jackson). The performances are solid, the real-life details affecting, but the stories feel stiff, disjointed, their peripheral quality underlined by aesthetic choices. (Springsteen dominates, while hip-hop leaks through doors.) It’s only once we get to the housing lottery that these plots click: there’s uneasy power in a shot of the women’s closed faces beside their kids’ open giddiness, praying for a Golden Ticket, even if that means living among strangers who hate them. It’s an ugly numbers game, but it’s the only one in town.","2148","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"In interviews, Simon likes to call himself the “PBS of HBO.” And, truly, there’s something beautiful and Wasicsko-esque about his dogged desire for TV drama to reflect the best values of journalism. (He’s been working on “Show Me a Hero” since before “The Wire,” as the subject matter has become ever more relevant.) In an era of sociopaths and conspiracies that go all the way to the top, “Show Me a Hero” is less a breakthrough experiment than a refreshing throwback, echoing certain of the grittier, now forgotten network series of TV’s early decades, such as the social-worker procedural “East Side / West Side.” Simon’s shows are unashamed of their mission to educate and to illuminate, and, if advocating for them can make a critic feel as if she were hawking a standing desk, so be it.","2149","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"But Simon is wrong to suggest that, for viewers, the choices are Yonkers or zombies. The truth is, progressive politics are experiencing a TV boom these days—a revival of the medium’s do-gooder legacy—but they’re often nested in genres taken less seriously: comedies, shows aimed at women and teens, sci-fi. Take CBS’s deceptively procedural-shaped “The Good Wife,” which has explored, with surprising granularity, the risks of N.S.A. surveillance and the insidious effects of big money on Democratic politics. Or ABC Family’s teen soap “The Fosters,” so sharp on judicial issues for kids in the foster system. TV’s most nuanced explorations of health care are on BBC’s “Call the Midwife,” set among Anglican nurse-midwives after the Second World War, and HBO’s mordant black comedy “Getting On,” about a geriatric ward corroded by for-profit funding. The most vivid critique of capitalism since “The Wire” was HBO’s humane “Enlightened”; later, in an entirely different genre, USA’s sizzling dystopia “Mr. Robot” picked up that radical thread. These shows make left-wing arguments without the signifiers of TV seriousness: realism, male protagonists, big-name Hollywood directors.","2150","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"The most striking example is Jenji Kohan’s women’s-prison series, “Orange Is the New Black,” which is so tonally perverse that the Emmys can’t figure out whether it’s a comedy or a drama. The third season, currently streaming on Netflix, is both a scathing denunciation of the privatization of the prison system and a voice of advocacy for labor unions—though you’ll rarely hear it described that way. With its scenes of shower sex, “Orange Is the New Black” has got the side eye from those who prefer their prison politics straight, so to speak. The characters are demographic cousins of the women on “Show Me a Hero,” but they’re blown up, not life-size. Still, the show’s themes are right out of the Marshall Project: solitary confinement; the joke of a “job fair”; financial corruption, which leaves inmates literally flooded with excrement (a story that reflects a prison where the show is filmed); untreated mental illness; and the fraught “compassionate release” policy of removing elderly inmates. As Simon’s shows do, “Orange Is the New Black” draws from nonfiction: one plot, about a mother and daughter, feels inspired by Adrian Nicole LeBlanc’s “Random Family.” But the series rejects realism, mining instead an outrageousness that verges on the vaudevillian.","2151","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"The third season begins, in a few early, atypically weak episodes, as the Litchfield Prison is taken over by an outside company, a data-driven corporation of Amazonian proportions. Only gradually do we see the effects of the profit motive. Untrained guards are hired for cheap, while experienced ones become temps. The food is replaced with sickening gruel. “Orange,” too, has a brutal lottery scene, in which inmates are randomly assigned to a garment sweatshop. Most provocatively, the show draws parallels between the inmates and the guards, who are trying to unionize.","2152","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"The season’s richest story—a slow-motion collision between the Latina cook Gloria and the trans black hairdresser Sophia—was, on the surface, highly intimate and domestic, a story of mothers clashing. But “Orange” is always, damningly, about how institutions crush the illusion of the individual. In the season’s final episodes, Sophia winds up in solitary, punished “for her own protection.” You could tell her tragic story in many styles, bleak or arch, mythic or hyperrealist, and each of these approaches would be valuable, and provocative, in its own way. Authenticity is a useful goal, but it can take many forms. As anyone who has used Instagram knows, the no-filter option is also a filter. ♦","2153","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"On Friday night, Donald Trump and his red “Make America Great Again” baseball cap headed down to the Ladd-Peebles football stadium in Mobile, Alabama, where, in a long and rambling address, he regaled a crowd estimated by police and fire officials at around twenty thousand people. Among other subjects, he spoke about his big lead in the polls and joked about holding the 2016 election early. “I’d like to have the election tomorrow,” Trump said. “I don’t want to wait.” In another sign of the progress he is making, one of Alabama’s two Republican senators, Jeff Sessions, greeted Trump onstage and praised his tough stance on immigration.","August 22, 2015","2154","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"To say that Trump is flying high would be an understatement. Not only is he crushing his Republican opponents in the polls, many of his critics in the media have thrown in the towel. Having dismissed his candidacy, poked fun at him, and portrayed him (with every justification) as a draft-dodging, racist, sexist huckster, the campaign press is now paying him the ultimate compliment and taking him seriously.","2155","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"On the day of the rally, USA Today reported, with no evident irony, that Trump and his allies were plotting “a path to victory” in the G.O.P. primaries. The Washington Post said that Trump’s Republican rivals were being forced to adopt new strategies to ride out the “Trump tornado.” And a front-page story in the Boston Globe quoted Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, who said, “What is happening with Trump is not a fluke. Yes, he is a great entertainer, but he is able to take advantage of a number of dynamics in American politics as they exist right now. This is an important moment.”","2156","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"We shall see. Perhaps Skocpol is right, and Trump’s rise in the polls represents a deep and lasting political phenomenon. Perhaps, as I suggested a couple of weeks ago, it will wither away, like the candidacies of previous G.O.P. candidates who tickled the party’s base at roughly this stage of the campaign, such as Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain. In any case, setting aside Trump’s ultimate fate, his current position demands explanation. How is he doing it? Here are five vaguely plausible theories that I have seen put forward recently.","2157","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"1. He’s a rich celebrity. “Trump is the personification of a 21st-century America fascinated by the super rich and obsessed with celebrity,” James Pindell wrote in the Globe’s Friday story, citing interviews that he’d conducted with a number of historians. It’s not just that Trump’s ceaseless self-promotion and his role on “The Apprentice” have created a level of name recognition that his rivals can’t hope to match. With his status as a bona-fide celebrity, he can get his message out without having to worry about how it is intermediated by the political press, or about whether he is winning the “invisible primary” for the support of moneyed élites. Indeed, rather than being tested by the media, Trump is exploiting it mercilessly, especially the broadcast media.","2158","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Virtually everywhere you look on cable television there is an “exclusive” Trump interview. Since he draws much higher ratings than any other candidate, he knows the cable networks will keep inviting him on and giving him lengthy prime-time interviews, regardless of what he actually says. (This, surely, was the message of the Megyn Kelly dust-up.) The other candidates are forced to rely on occasional onscreen appearances (the debates, especially) and paid media (that is, advertising)—if they can afford it. The celebrity gulf puts them at an enormous disadvantage, which, for now at least, they are failing to surmount.","2159","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"2. He can’t be bought. As the political success of Michael Bloomberg showed, the idea of a billionaire candidate who doesn’t need to kowtow to vested interests can have considerable appeal to American voters. Trump is a populist version of Bloomberg, and he has no compunctions about pointing out how beholden his opponents are to rich donors—who are largely guys like him. During the first televised G.O.P. debate, he was eager to say that he had contributed to the past campaigns of many of his rivals in the full expectation of receiving something in return. He also claimed, effectively, to have paid Hillary Clinton to appear at his wedding. This wasn’t just boasting: it was exploiting his unique position to the maximum.","2160","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Given the widespread belief among voters that most politicians have been hopelessly corrupted by the demands of fund-raising, Trump’s appeal isn’t necessarily confined to ultra-conservatives. Appearing on the Fox Business Network recently, Ralph Nader, the longtime crusader against money in politics, who has mounted two Presidential campaigns as an independent and two as the Green Party nominee, called Trump “a breath of fresh air.” “The two-party tyranny that blocks voter choices and dominates the political scene on behalf of big business needs to be broken up and Trump is the one to do it. It takes a billionaire,” he said. When even someone with Nader’s progressive credentials is making this argument, is it any wonder many other Americans find it attractive?","2161","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"3. G.O.P. voters like his policies. When Trump accuses the Mexican government of sending its criminals to the United States and talks about deporting millions of undocumented workers en masse, many commentators, myself included, see him as engaging in misleading, impractical rabble-rousing. But, as I pointed out earlier this week, the demagoguery is working. Trump isn’t merely matching the more conservative Republican candidates on the immigration issue: he’s beating them. In arecent CNN poll, forty-four per cent of likely Republican voters picked Trump as the candidate who could best handle illegal immigration. (Jeb Bush came in second, with just twelve per cent.)","2162","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"And immigration isn’t the sole issue on which Trump’s views are striking a chord. His tough-on-trade rhetoric resonates with G.O.P. voters, particularly middle-income and low-income white men. Indeed, a recent survey by Pew Research suggested that Republicans, as a group, are now more skeptical of trade agreements, such as the new Trans-Pacific Partnership, than the Democrats are. As Newsweek’s Matt Cooper pointed out in a prescient piece back in June, Trump largely has this issue to himself. Dependent as they are on corporate money, most Republican candidates—from Jeb Bush to Marco Rubio to Scott Walker to Ted Cruz—support trade agreements. Trump, by contrast, is free to take a populist line, which he is doing with great enthusiasm.","2163","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"4. He’s the rider on a white horse. On the radio a while back, I heard Pat Buchanan, who ran for President as a conservative insurgent twice in the nineteen-nineties, and again in 2000, compare Trump to Huey Long, the legendary Louisiana populist who assailed the rich, the corporations, and the metropolitan élites during the twenties and thirties. Like Long, Trump could speak to ordinary folk in a language that they could understand and relate to, Buchanan said. Long was a Democrat, of course, who espoused some policies—such as expanded public services, stricter regulation of business, and higher taxes on the rich—that Trump, in his current incarnation, might well dismiss as socialism. But there still might be something to the comparison. Long “spoke so directly to the people, and that is Donald Trump’s appeal,” Richard D. White, the author of “Kingfish: The Reign of Huey P. Long,” told the Boston Globe. “It is a purely personal relationship with his listeners. It is not based on factual issues.”","2164","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Of course, the divide between populism and demagoguery is often in the eye of the beholder. White, who is now the dean of E.J. Ourso College of Business, at Louisiana State University, highlighted Trump and Long’s penchants for dressing in fancy suits and using incendiary language toward minorities. “The oversimplification of issues is very dangerous, and when you combine that with negativity and fear, the combination is classic populism,” he said. At least one Republican, Frank Luntz, the pollster and strategist, has also suggested that Trump’s candidacy could be dangerous. “There’s something happening out there that is profound, but you gotta be careful; when you tap into it you better have a way to direct it,” Luntz told Politico. “Trump has tapped into it. Bernie Sanders has tapped into it and they’re doing well, but you’re tapping into fire—that’s how hot the anger is. We are in a dangerous political environment that requires a higher standard for the candidates running. It requires them not just to stoke the anger, it’s already there. It requires them to provide the balm of solutions.”","2165","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"5. He’s just a summer diversion. Asked about Trump’s performance in the televised debate and his subsequent comments about Megyn Kelly, Hillary Clinton said, “It’s all entertainment. I think he’s having the time of his life, being up on that stage, saying whatever he wants to say.” Despite Trump’s comments about why she attended his wedding, Clinton is doubtless enjoying the sight of him toying with his Republican rivals, one of whom she may well end up running against. But she also raised a serious point. These days, Presidential campaigns are ludicrously long and bloated. Is there anyone, faced with the prospect of another year and a half of focus-group-tested politicking, who wasn’t secretly (or not so secretly) a bit relieved that Trump entered the fray and provided a diversion?","2166","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"In a column published on the Cook Political Report earlier this week, Amy Walter compared the G.O.P. electorate’s embrace of Trump to a post-college summer fling. “The summer before a presidential election year is a lot like dating in your early 20s. You are unattached and care-free. You want to connect with someone passionately and fall hopelessly in love,” she wrote. “Meanwhile, your parents want you to meet a guy like Jeb Bush.” No wonder G.O.P. voters are dallying with Trump, Walters added. He’s “everything your parents hate. He’s loud. He’s disrespectful. He probably smokes and drives a motorcycle. But, you don’t care.” Eventually, though, you settle down with the responsible guy.","2167","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Which explanation is the most persuasive? Obviously, there is a bit of truth in all of them. I still tend to think his appeal will fade, but it could take a while. In the meantime, Hillary Clinton is right about him enjoying himself. “It’s been wild,” he told the crowd in Mobile, adding, “The reason I am leading is because I know the game. . . . You people are looking for somebody who knows what he is doing.”","2168","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"

American and Iranian diplomats began meeting last week in Vienna.

"Mohammad Nahavandian, chief of staff for the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, was among the senior Iranian officials who attended the second volleyball match. He knows Washington well. He earned his doctorate at George Washington University, a few blocks from the White House, and at one point had a green card. He told me when I called on him at Tehran’s Executive Office Building recently that he was “realistically optimistic” about a nuclear deal. “The odds are for success,” he said. “However, to be realistic, one should not ignore the fact that there are forces on both sides who either do not want this negotiation to succeed or are very pessimistic about the outcome, because of the mistrust which has been built through these difficult decades.”","2173","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/endgames-with-iran-volleyball-nuclear"
"On the day of the volleyball final, Iran’s parliament approved preliminary draft legislation restricting the outside world’s ability to inspect Iranian facilities. It limited inspections to “conventional” sites and stipulated that “access to all military, security, and sensitive non-nuclear sites, as well as scientists, is prohibited.” The terms could scuttle a deal. Transparency—the ability to verify that Iran will honor international limits on its program—is the whole point of the negotiations.","2174","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/endgames-with-iran-volleyball-nuclear"
"The legislation’s tough language is very much about sovereignty—and suspicion. “Our nuke facilities were inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but some information was given to others,” Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the bill’s sponsor and chairman of the Committee on Foreign Policy and National Security, told me, as the bill was being prepared. “We lost some of our scientists—assassinated by Mossad. If they ask for interviews with scientists, would it guarantee that they would not be assassinated? Trust is a two-way street. Mistrust is a two-way street, too. If they don’t trust us, we don’t trust them.”","2175","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/endgames-with-iran-volleyball-nuclear"
"Tehran has already acknowledged, however, that it will have to sign the so-called “additional protocol,” which gives “further inspection authority” to the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency “to provide assurance about both declared and possible undeclared activities and to get a more complete picture of a state’s overall nuclear program.” In these final days of negotiating a deal, the challenge for the Americans and the Iranians will be defining precisely the difference between “complete” and “everything.”","2176","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/endgames-with-iran-volleyball-nuclear"

It’s all about words.”","2177","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/endgames-with-iran-volleyball-nuclear"
"The Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, now the lead Iranian negotiator, described the often tortuous talks as an “unholy exercise.” If the diplomacy fails, he told me, “It won’t be the end of the world. The U.S. will have lost a major opportunity, probably unique. But, for us, our population is accustomed to making necessary sacrifices to preserve its dignity and its rights.” He went on, “It’s not about nationalism or chauvinism. It’s simply about having historical depth. Several years are a brief period in the history of a country with millennia as its depth.”","2178","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/endgames-with-iran-volleyball-nuclear"
"In a hopeful sign, the proposed Iranian legislation stripped out the tougher amendments and, in the end, limited its own power to kill a deal. It mirrored congressional action last month in the United States, when Republicans and Democrats backed off some of their most demanding amendments. “We want to help the country and not create new problems,” Ali Larijani, the speaker of parliament, said. The legislators ultimately opted to defer a final decision on the nuclear deal to the Supreme National Security Council. It is led by President Rouhani, a former nuclear negotiator who won the presidency, in 2013, by vowing to end a decade of tensions—and international sanctions—over Iran’s nuclear program.

The line about twenty-five hedge-fund managers making more than all the kindergarten teachers in the country was actually delivered by President Obama a few weeks ago. But, in placing C.E.O.s and hedge-fund managers center stage, and comparing their outsized remuneration and avarice to the tribulations of ordinary working people, Clinton was acknowledging not just the economic realities of modern America but the fact that the center of gravity in her party has shifted.","2185","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-goes-populist-up-to-a-point"

"In promising, prior to Saturday’s speech, to end mass incarceration, expand voting rights, and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented workers, Clinton had already shifted to the left on issues that are major concerns to key elements of the modern Democratic coalition. Until now, though, she hadn’t said very much about the issues of wage stagnation, inequality, and corporate piggery, which progressives like Sanders, Warren, and Mayor Bill de Blasio (a conspicuous absentee from Saturday’s rally) have seized upon. Rhetorically, at least, Clinton answered calls for her to make clear where she stood on these issues: the middle of an article by Robert Reich or Joseph Stiglitz, or so it seemed.","2187","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-goes-populist-up-to-a-point"

"There remains, of course, the question of what Clinton intends to do about these evils. She said that she would encourage companies to invest for the long term, change the tax code so that it “rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas,” and “give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.” All of these may be worthwhile policies, but it’s hard to see them having much impact on the great divide she had just identified, particularly the dramatic concentration of income and wealth at the very top of the earnings distribution.","2189","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-goes-populist-up-to-a-point"

"On Monday night, the brief, frantic skirmish between Donald J. Trump and other forces in the Republican Party seemed to have stalled. The weekend had started so well for those in the G.O.P. who thought that their cohorts’ Trump fever might break; on Friday evening, he had besmirched Megyn Kelly, of Fox News—their own Megyn Kelly—in terms that seemed disqualifying. Trump appeared, in short, to have said that a woman they admired was having her period when she was asking hard questions as the moderator of the G.O.P. candidates’ first debate. And who, even among those who took pleasure in Trump’s disparagement of Mexicans (and other immigrants), John McCain (and other prisoners of war), and Rosie O’Donnell (and women generally), wanted to think about something like that? And yet, two days later, it was Trump who, catching his breath from calling his critics “deviants” and “sick,” was tweeting that Kelly’s boss, Roger Ailes, had called him to negotiate a peace. “He is a great guy & assures me that ‘Trump’ will be treated fairly on @FoxNews. His word is always good!”","August 11, 2015","2192","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"A few hours later, Ailes put out a statement confirming the accord, and Kelly, of whom Trump had also said, “She’s zippo … I have no respect for her,” told Fox viewers that it was “time to move forward.” By then, Reuters/Ipsos had released a new, post-debate poll; it found Trump still, somehow, in the lead among Republicans, with twenty-four per cent. Jeb Bush came in second, with twelve per cent. It was a small poll, with a margin of error of more than six per cent, but it was another indication that the debate and the Donald, rather than helping to narrow the field, have left it even more wide open than it was before. And Trump is still crashing through it.","2193","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"Why did the other Republicans think that Trump would crumple in shame? He never has before. It is a measure of the 2016 Presidential race that the strongest point Trump raised in his defense over the weekend—he called into the Sunday news shows on every major channel except Fox—was that, a minute or two after crudely insulting Kelly in a CNN interview (“And you know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her—wherever”), he had crudely insulted her colleague Chris Wallace in similar terms (“You know, blood pouring out of his eyes, too”). By “wherever,” he told George Stephanopoulos, on ABC, “I was referring to nose, ears. They’re very common statements. And only a deviant would think of what people said.” He hadn’t specified those parts, he said, because he just wanted to move on and talk about important things, like “jobs.” In fact, he moved on to talk about how Chris Wallace, in his view, compared to his father, Mike, the longtime CBS correspondent. “The great Mike Wallace was a friend of mine. In fact, he interviewed me on ‘60 Minutes.’ It was a phenomenal ‘60 Minutes’ .… And the son is only a tiny fraction of Mike, believe me.” The lady is a lightweight; the loser never lived up to his dad. These are stock characters in Trumpland, where one can also bump into the occasional Killer or Great Guy.","2194","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"There are, after all, a few problems with Trump’s argument that he was just, in the Wall Street Journal’s memorable phrase, using “facial hemorrhages as a metaphor for anger.” One can begin with the obvious: more of Kelly’s body was implicated than was Wallace’s, and Trump has a long history of slurs aimed at women’s anatomy, which was what Kelly was asking him about. But stranger still is the idea that there was any anger to describe, literally or metaphorically. “Look, she asked me a very nasty question. I have nothing against Megyn Kelly, but she asked me a very, very nasty question,” Trump said. She was “very inappropriate,” and “very angry.” And yet, in the video, she is calm, and never stops smiling. She did not, it is true, surrender or laugh appreciatively when he interrupted her to make a joke about how he thought another woman was ugly. Is that what an angry woman looks like from the Republican debate stage?","2195","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"If Trump is betrayed by the “wherever,” the Republican Party is undermined by its capacity to look at every manner of assault on women and say, in effect, “Whatever.” There is a muddle in the matter of the Party’s message on Trump and Kelly. For one thing, the Republican men rushing to Kelly’s defense do not look much like beacons. Erick Erickson, the conservative activist, said that he was so appalled that he was disinviting Trump from his RedState Gathering conference. Erickson is the man who called Wendy Davis, the Texas legislator, “Abortion Barbie,” and, writing about Michelle Obama, speculated about whether “Obama’s Marxist harpy wife would go Lorena Bobbitt on him.” Kelly once chastised Erickson on Fox for saying that wives contributing more to the family income than their husbands was unnatural and bad for children. (As I’ve written before, Kelly is a smart woman who, occasionally, stops pretending that the men around her at Fox are making any sense at all.) At the RedState conference, Jeb Bush congratulated Erickson on his gentlemanliness in disinviting Trump, saying, “I tell you what, you’re on the side of women.” Bush, who had turned to the topic when Erikson mentioned his wife, continued, “Come on! Give me a break. I mean, do we want to win? Do we want to insult fifty-three per cent of all voters? What Donald Trump said is wrong.”","2196","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"The problem is that Bush and the other Republicans are not clear in their own minds about why Trump is wrong. Last week, Bush said, “I’m not sure we need half a billion dollars for women’s health issues” (he later said that he “misspoke”)—a quote Trump brought up on the Sunday shows, when talking about how he would be “phenomenal to the women” who were, themselves, phenomenal. There is plenty of menstruation-free misogyny at play, starting with the assumption that women are an alien group “we” have to be careful not to offend. The hope among Republicans is that they will never have to say whether their politely unspoken assumptions are the same as Trump’s loudly stated one—that, having roused the base, Trump is so crass that he will flame out. Jeb Bush seems particularly vulnerable to this presumption. But this does not seem to be a political moment in which tackiness alone is going to get someone off the debate stage. The greatest fear, within the G.O.P., seems to be that Trump will force them to look rude. And it has left them paralyzed.","2197","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"It was a classic Trump move to ask, with outrage and wounded innocence, why anyone would think that mentioning blood and a woman’s anger in the same sentence would have a certain implication. (It’s actually a decent question, as disingenuous as Trump was to pose it.) His G.O.P. opponents thought that the answer was too obvious and unpleasant to talk about. The offense for them was the application of a stereotype to Kelly. They weren’t about to engage with or challenge any stereotypes about women themselves.","2198","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"When the other G.O.P. candidates challenge Trump, it tends to be by arguing that he is not a real Republican—he was once pro-choice, and he has given money to Democrats. On the first point, the G.O.P. risks alienating women voters when candidates, like Marco Rubio, rush to stake out ever more extreme positions on restricting reproductive rights, a point that Hillary Clinton seized upon on Monday. On the issue of political donations, Trump’s comment, in the debate, that he gives money to all sorts of candidates to buy access and to get them to do what he wants, has been a hard one for his opponents. They seem to find talking about their donors almost as mortifying as talking about Megyn Kelly’s body. At the debate, Trump had said that Clinton had to go to his wedding because he’s donated to her family’s foundation. Clinton said that she’d gone because she “thought it was going to be fun.” Did the G.O.P. think that a Trump candidacy would be fun, too?","2199","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"

Obviously somewhat taken aback, Trump tried to downplay his sexist remarks as “fun, it’s kidding,” and then complained, peevishly, that Kelly hadn’t been nice to him.","2204","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

Given a record like that, Wallace asked, why should we trust you with the nation’s finances? Trump replied that these were just four deals out of hundreds he’d done, and that, like many businessmen, he had only been using the bankruptcy laws to his advantage. And he personally had never gone bankrupt, he added. He should have stopped there, but he didn’t. When Wallace followed up with a question about the last bankruptcy, of the Atlantic City-based Trump Entertainment Resorts, in 2009, which cost nearly a thousand jobs, he couldn’t resist another tribute to his capitalist acumen: “I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City before it cratered,” he said. “I made a lot of money in Atlantic City, and I’m proud of it.”","2205","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

In the recent past, Trump’s run-ins with the media have only helped him, and we’ll have to wait for some post-debate polls to see whether this happens again.

Trump said that he had contributed to “everybody,” including several people on the stage, and explained that his donations were strictly transactional. “When they call, I give,” he said. “And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me.” His donations to the Clinton Foundation provided an example of how this worked, Trump went on. “Hillary Clinton: I said, ‘Be at my wedding,’ and she came to my wedding.

Most of his policy positions are solidly right-wing; his record is solidly right-wing. But he has one issue on which he’s broken ranks with his party—Medicaid.

"In the late nineteen-eighties, in Switzerland, Iranian officials met with collaborators of A. Q. Khan, the scientist who fathered Pakistan’s nuclear-bomb program. The parties may also have met in Dubai, where Khan maintained a secret office above a children’s store called Mummy & Me. In 1987, the Iranians received a one-page document that included the offer of a disassembled centrifuge, along with diagrams of the machine. They reportedly ended up paying as much as ten million dollars for information and materials that helped Iran advance its nuclear program during the nineteen-nineties. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a scientist sometimes described as the closest thing to an Iranian Robert Oppenheimer, oversaw the Orchid Office, working secretly on detonators and on the challenge of fitting something like a nuke on a missile. In 2003, the agency confronted Iran with evidence that it maintained a clandestine nuclear program. Tehran denied any wrongdoing and parried inspectors, then built a centrifuge facility under a mountain near Qom, whose existence was revealed by the United States, Britain, and France in 2009.","2216","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/a-good-enough-deal-with-iran"
"This record of deception is one reason that the nuclear accord that Secretary of State John Kerry brought back to President Obama last week runs to a hundred and fifty-nine pages of text and annexes. Paragraph after paragraph seeks to close loophole after loophole. “Every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off, and the inspection and transparency regime necessary to verify that objective will be put in place,” the President said last week. If Iran tries to build a bomb before 2025, he insisted, inspections and surveillance will provide the world with at least a year’s advance warning.","2217","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/a-good-enough-deal-with-iran"
"The deal’s fine print does include remarkable Iranian concessions, such as the sale or the downblending of almost all Iran’s enriched uranium, and the disabling of a heavy-water reactor at Arak, which could be used to make plutonium. Yet the deal has weaknesses, too. Its protocols for surprise inspections of military facilities could allow Iran to delay the arrival of investigators for more than three weeks, ample time to hide contraband equipment. And although Iran must now provide the I.A.E.A. with answers about its secret atomic history, the accord does not spell out how forthcoming it must be. Inevitably, some uncertainty about Iran’s past weapons experiments—and, therefore, its present bomb-making capacity—will remain.","2218","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/a-good-enough-deal-with-iran"
"Congress has until mid-September to act on the deal. It seems unlikely that legislators will scuttle it; Republicans appear implacably opposed to Obama’s diplomacy, yet they may not have the votes to override the veto that he has promised. But, to see the deal through, the President will have to persuade wary Democrats to back him. They face lobbying by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies. Netanyahu continues to intervene in American politics on the Iran matter, despite his slim odds of success and the damage he continues to cause to the U.S.-Israeli alliance. Yet he is a canny campaigner. Speaking on National Public Radio, he homed in on the accord’s surprise-inspection regime as “woefully inadequate” and “completely porous.”","2219","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/a-good-enough-deal-with-iran"
"In fact, the accord is tighter and more prescriptive than many I.A.E.A.-enforced agreements, including the one with North Korea that broke down a decade ago. Obama’s best argument, however, is not the fine print but the fact that the deal is better than any other realistic course of action. Certainly it is better than preëmptive war. A more nuanced question that Congress will now debate is whether Obama could have done better by maintaining economic sanctions longer and negotiating for tougher terms. That is an illusory choice, the President argued last week, because, “without a deal, the international sanctions regime will unravel.” If he is right about that, the accord is more attractive still. The coalition that negotiated the deal now on the table—the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France, Germany, and the European Union—represents an extraordinary front of unity against nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. Holding that rare alliance together will make it easier to challenge Iran later if the ayatollahs do cheat or go for a bomb after the termination of the agreement.","2220","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/a-good-enough-deal-with-iran"
"The most persuasive argument against the deal is that relieving economic sanctions would replenish Iran’s treasury without any requirement that it stop sponsoring terrorism, as the State Department reports that it continues to do. Shiite Iran and insecure Sunni states led by Saudi Arabia are locked in intensifying sectarian conflicts from Yemen and Iraq to Syria. Iran arms Hezbollah and Hamas in their dead-end mini-wars of rocket terror against Israel. An expansionist Iran with new resources and legitimacy might make the Middle East’s present deterioration even worse. Obama has not always acknowledged this risk, but, in an interview with Thomas Friedman in the Times last week, he said, “People’s concerns here are legitimate. Hezbollah has tens of thousands of missiles that are pointed toward Israel.” Smaller Sunni states, too, he said, have “legitimate concerns” about Iran’s “dangerous” behavior, and he added that he would further strengthen the defenses of Israel and support Sunni allies.","2221","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/a-good-enough-deal-with-iran"
"But nuclear-arms control in the Middle East is inseparable from the region’s suffering and its conventional conflicts. This has been the case since the beginning of Iran’s program; the revolutionary regime first turned to A. Q. Khan’s salesmen in the wake of Saddam Hussein’s grotesque use of chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq War. In Syria, aid workers have reported that the Bashar al-Assad regime, an Iranian ally, has again used crude chlorine-gas bombs against civilians and insurgents. In Yemen, Saudi bombers are killing and maiming innocents indiscriminately. In Iraq and Syria, isis has enslaved women from religious minorities. No nuclear-control contract crafted in European luxury hotels is likely to survive for a decade amid spreading sectarian violence of that character.","2222","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/a-good-enough-deal-with-iran"

"The stated purpose of Texas House Bill 2 is pretty uncontroversial. As the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals put it last week, in an opinion upholding the law, H.B. 2 aims “to provide the highest quality of care to women seeking abortions and to protect the health and welfare of women seeking abortions.” The problem is that H.B. 2—which requires that all doctors who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a hospital within thirty miles of their practice, and that every facility where abortions are performed meet the elaborate construction standards of ambulatory surgical centers (A.S.C.s)—will in fact make abortions not safer, but rarer. Its provisions are so onerous (the trial court found that building or buying an A.S.C. would cost an abortion provider millions of dollars) that all but nine or ten of the forty-one abortion providers that operated in Texas before H.B. 2 passed, in 2013, have been forced to close.

As the American Medical Association and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists argued in an amicus brief, abortion is already extremely safe, with a mortality rate of .0006 percent, and a 0.2 percent risk of serious complications. Most of the A.S.C. requirements, which concern things like operating room dimensions and maintaining sterile environments, are irrelevant to abortions, which require neither operating rooms nor external sterility. “By imposing unnecessary A.S.C. and privileges requirements on abortion providers and facilities, H.B. 2 harms women’s health by reducing access to safe and legal abortion,” the brief concluded. Texas has barely tried rebutting that evidence. Its argument, accepted by the Fifth Circuit, is essentially that the legislature doesn’t have to listen to doctors when deciding medical policy.","2225","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-dishonest-attack-on-abortion-rights"
"The legislators who voted for H.B. 2 and the lawyers defending it have been careful to maintain that the law is about making abortions safer, not harder to get. So have the pro-life leaders who lobbied for it—but not their followers. That has led to some surreal effects. While the state’s lawyers spent last summer’s district court trial arguing that it would be easy to get an abortion under H.B. 2, pro-life groups carrying posters with pictures of fetuses rallied outside the courthouse in support of the law. Last week, Texas Alliance for Life director Joe Pojman hailed the Fifth Circuit ruling as a victory for “the health and safety of women,” in a press release titled “Federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Upholds Pro-Life House Bill 2.” And in an amicus brief filed Monday night opposing a stay of the ruling, Texas Alliance for Life and two other pro-life groups trumpeted their role in getting the law passed, and their commitment to eradicating abortion—and then insisted that H.B. 2 would do no such thing.","2226","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-dishonest-attack-on-abortion-rights"
"It’s clear to both supporters and opponents that H.B. 2, like similar laws in other Republican-controlled states, is designed to prevent women from getting abortions. The only place that fact isn’t obvious is the one place it matters: in court. In a 1992 case called Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court held that regulations that impose an “undue burden” on a woman’s right to an abortion are unconstitutional. An undue burden, the Court said, exists when “a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion.” (Jeffrey Toobin wrote about Casey’s undue-burden standard last year.) As a result, Texas can’t admit that H.B. 2’s real purpose is to make it harder for women to get an abortion; if it did, even the conservative Fifth Circuit would have to strike down the law. Yet the purpose of H.B. 2 has received oddly little attention in the convoluted legal challenges. Federal District Judge Lee Yeakel’s opinion did conclude that the law’s purpose was improper, but that finding was practically a footnote. The portion of the Fifth Circuit ruling overturning his finding was similarly brief.","2227","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-dishonest-attack-on-abortion-rights"
"Most of the debate around H.B. 2 has instead focussed on the “effect” part of Casey’s vague standard: How far can the state force women to drive to get an abortion before the distance counts as a substantial obstacle? How many women need to be burdened for the law to be struck down statewide? Judge Yeakel held the law unconstitutional because it would leave seventeen per cent of Texas women of childbearing age—some nine hundred thousand women—more than a hundred and fifty miles from the nearest abortion provider. (In a previous round of litigation, the Fifth Circuit held that anything less than a hundred-and-fifty-mile journey could never be an undue burden.) A panel of three Fifth Circuit judges, all appointed by George W. Bush, reversed Yeakel, holding that the law could only be struck down if it burdened a “large fraction” of women, and that seventeen per cent is “nowhere near” a large fraction. (Technically, the panel dismissed the plaintiffs’ statewide challenge to the law on procedural grounds, but it also ruled on the merits of the case.)","2228","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-dishonest-attack-on-abortion-rights"
"The Fifth Circuit did agree to exempt one clinic in McAllen, near the Mexico border, since its closure would force the disproportionately poor women of the Rio Grande Valley to drive an average of two hundred and thirty-five miles to the nearest facility, in Houston or San Antonio. But the court denied similar relief to a clinic in El Paso, even though women there are now five hundred and fifty miles from the nearest Texas provider. Because those women can get abortions just a few miles away in New Mexico, the court reasoned, “it would ignore reality” to say they are being unduly burdened.","2229","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-dishonest-attack-on-abortion-rights"
"The court’s embrace of reality turned out to be selective. On the question of H.B. 2’s purpose, the judges refused to see through the state’s justifications, holding, “All of the evidence referred to by the district court is purely anecdotal and does little to impugn the State’s legitimate reasons for the Act.” Some of the evidence of H.B. 2’s purpose is indeed anecdotal—but anecdotes can tell a clear story. At trial, four of the state’s expert witnesses admitted, when confronted with incriminating emails, that their reports had been ghostwritten by Vincent Rue, an anti-abortion activist with no medical training, best known for inventing “post-abortion syndrome” in the nineteen-eighties. (Rue drafted at least one witness’s rebuttal report before she had even read the report she was supposedly rebutting.) And, in an act of Texas-sized chutzpah, forty-four Republican state legislators signed an amicus brief in support of the law that had been prepared by Americans United for Life, whose website declares, “Americans United for Life, the nation’s premier pro-life legal team, works through the law and legislative process to one end: Achieving comprehensive legal protection for human life from conception to natural death.”","2230","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-dishonest-attack-on-abortion-rights"
"But the most telling evidence that H.B. 2’s purpose is to restrict abortion access is the fact that no reasonable legislator could have expected it to accomplish anything else. As the plaintiffs put it in their brief, citing a Supreme Court case, “the effect of a law in its real operation is strong evidence of its object.” The fact that the legislature knew H.B. 2 would close all but a handful of abortion providers without making abortions safer strongly implies that preventing abortions was the purpose of the law, not a side effect.","2231","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-dishonest-attack-on-abortion-rights"
"In finding H.B. 2 constitutional, the Fifth Circuit interpreted Casey’s undue-burden test as requiring only some “rational basis” for thinking the law will serve a legitimate interest, no matter how speculative or unsupported by the evidence. But the Seventh and Ninth Circuits have blocked similar laws using a different analysis, holding that the undue-burden test requires balancing the obstacles a law imposes against the strength of the state’s justification for it. That means that the Supreme Court, which tends to intervene to resolve such disagreements among Circuits, will likely decide H.B. 2’s ultimate fate.","2232","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-dishonest-attack-on-abortion-rights"
"If the Supreme Court does weigh in and find H.B. 2 unconstitutional, it will most likely do so by endorsing something like the Seventh and Ninth Circuits’ balancing test, not by finding an unconstitutional purpose. That would be a missed opportunity. When courts play along with the fantasy that laws like H.B. 2 are what legislatures say they are, they encourage the suspicion that the legal system values form over substance, cleverness over justice. It isn’t just about abortion. Texas’s voter-identification law, plainly designed to prevent young, poor, and minority voters (i.e., Democrats) from casting ballots, is based on a similarly flimsy pretext of combating the nonexistent problem of in-person voter fraud. Striking down these sham laws using a balancing test may get the right result, but it invites states to keep tweaking the balance of interests versus burdens until it finds a formula—two hundred miles from the nearest clinic? A hundred and seventy-five?—that passes muster in court. It’s up to judges to defend constitutional rights from these disingenuous attacks. That’s their purpose.","2233","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-dishonest-attack-on-abortion-rights"
"When will the Fed start to raise interest rates? Who will win the 2016 Presidential election? Obviously, these are two very different questions, but they are also connected. Without wanting to sound too much like the great historical materialist James Carville, I’ve always believed that politics is the flip side of economics, and vice versa, because they share a common framework.","June 9, 2015","2234","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"In this case, the framework describes a country still feeling the after-effects of the deepest economic slump since the Great Depression. How can that be? Didn’t the recession officially end six years ago, in the summer of 2009? Yes, it did. That’s when the gross domestic product stopped declining and turned upward. The National Bureau of Economic Research, which adjudicates these things, decided that uptick in G.D.P. was sufficient to mark the recession’s trough. But the downturn was so drastic, and the recovery has been so moderately paced, that some of its consequences are still lingering.","2235","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"You can see these consequences in the figures for wages and income, which show, for example, that the median U.S. household income in 2014 was still sitting about six per cent below the level it reached in 2007, the year the slump began. You can also see the consequences in polling data suggesting that many Americans believe the economy is still in recession. (More precisely, they thought this at the start of the year, which is when the most recent poll I could find on the subject was taken.) And you can see the consequences in the public hostility toward Wall Street, which remains largely undiminished.","2236","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"As it happens, the economists who work on Wall Street also follow this issue closely, and in the past few days they’ve produced two pieces of research that both suggest that the economy won’t be fully recovered until 2017 or thereabouts, by which point we might well be justified in calling the previous ten years a “lost decade”—the phrase popularized by the economists Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff in their famous studies of past financial crises and their aftermath.","2237","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"The first analysis that caught my eye, thanks to a story on Bloomberg Business, came from the economics team at Deutsche Bank. It looked at G.D.P. per person, which is perhaps the broadest measure of how an economy is doing. G.D.P. per person recovered to its 2007 level in the fall of 2013, which some analysts took as an indicator that things had returned to normal. The bank’s analysts beg to differ. They define a recovery “as being complete when all of the real output per capita that was lost as a result of the crisis (relative to the pre-crisis peak) has been recovered.” For instance, if the economy suffered a cumulative loss during the recession of ten per cent of G.D.P. (per person), relative to the 2007 level, it would have to make up that entire ten per cent before the rebound could be considered complete.","2238","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"From this perspective, the recovery, attenuated as it has been, still has some ways to go. “If real GDP per capita continues to grow at its post-crisis rate of 1.4%, the output lost due to the crisis will only be fully recovered in Q4 2017, exactly ten years after the recession began,” the analysts write.","2239","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"The other interesting update, from David Mericle, an economist at Goldman Sachs, looks at the labor market. After last week’s employment report, which showed that the economy created two hundred and eighty thousand jobs in May, it is tempting to assume that things are back to normal here, too. After all, in the past two years, the economy has created 5.6 million jobs—a fact highlighted in a recent blog post by Jason Furman, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers—and the official unemployment rate is now 5.5 per cent, down from a peak of ten per cent in October, 2009.","2240","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"Mericle doesn’t deny that things have improved: no reasonable person could. He simply asks, “When will the labor market return to full employment?” Clearly, the answer to that question depends on how “full employment” is defined, but there is no universally agreed-upon definition of the term, except that it is meant to indicate the level at which inflation could be expected to start accelerating. Mericle’s interpretation employs a couple of reasonable-looking metrics: an official unemployment rate of five per cent, which is where the jobless rate sat in December, 2007, when the recession began, and an “underemployment rate” of nine per cent. The underemployment rate, as measured by the Labor Department, includes the unemployed, plus people working part-time for economic reasons and those “marginally attached to the labor force.” It provides a broader take on how the labor market is doing than the official unemployment rate, and it is watched closely by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues.","2241","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"Based on what’s been happening recently to G.D.P. growth, job creation, and labor-force participation rates, Mericle concludes that the official jobless rate will reach full-employment level in the first quarter of next year. But the underemployment rate won’t hit nine per cent until the end of 2016. And it won’t dip below the full-employment level, which is the point at which inflation could be expected to start accelerating, until the first quarter of 2017.","2242","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"So what does all this mean for the two questions I started with, regarding when the Fed will raise interest rates and who will win the Presidential election?","2243","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"As far as the Fed’s deliberations go, the new research provides more backing for Yellen’s “go easy” approach. Ever since she took office, she has made clear that she wants to give the economy plenty of time to recuperate, and that she is concerned about the danger of aborting the recovery by rapidly raising interest rates. That doesn’t mean the Fed won’t take any action at its September meeting: if job growth remains strong throughout the summer, it will probably go ahead and increase the federal funds rate by a quarter of a point. But the rate-hike process will be gradual and data-dependent. The threat of rising inflation is still pretty distant: it doesn’t provide a justification to rush things.","2244","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"The 2016 election will, of course, turn on more than economics. But, because many Americans have yet to see the recovery reflected in their paychecks, the Republicans will seek to play up and exploit a general feeling of malaise. However, they also sought to employ this strategy in 2012, when the unemployment rate remained above 7.5 per cent. It didn’t work then, and it’s far from guaranteed to work next year. In order to persuade the American public that the G.O.P. has the wherewithal to raise living standards and move the country beyond the “lost decade,” the party will need to come up with some specific and fully costed proposals, of which there are currently few signs.","2245","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"

But his frustration—that the bigger message of his foreign policy is being lost in the political furies over Iran—was conspicuous.

The most striking piece in the room is the smallest: The 1906 Nobel Prize, the first won by an American and the first by a U.S. President, is encased behind glass. It went to Teddy Roosevelt for mediating an end to the Russo-Japanese war. Only two other Presidents–Woodrow Wilson, for the League of Nations, and Jimmy Carter, after leaving office, for promoting human rights—had won it before Obama was named, just months after his election, more for his spirit than any specific achievement.

Even so, he went on, “It is possible for leaders or regimes to be cruel, bigoted, twisted in their world views and still make rational calculations with respect to their limits and their self-preservation. And what we’ve seen, at least since 1979, is Iran making constant, calculated decisions that allow it to preserve the regime, to expand their influence where they can, to be opportunistic, to create what they view as hedges against potential Israeli attack, in the form of Hezbollah and other proxies in the region.”","2259","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-on-war-and-peace"

In 1976, the Times introduced Trump, then a little-known builder, to readers as a “publicity shy” wunderkind who “looks ever so much like Robert Redford,” and quoted an admiring observation from the architect Der Scutt: “That Donald, he could sell sand to the Arabs.” Over the years, Trump honed a performer’s ear for the needs of his audience. He starred in “The Apprentice” for fourteen seasons, cultivating a lordly persona and a squint that combined Clint Eastwood on the high plains and Derek Zoolander on the runway. Once he emerged as the early front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, this summer, his airport comings and goings posed a delicate staging issue: a rogue wind off the tarmac could render his comb-over fully erect in front of the campaign paparazzi. So, in Laredo, Trump débuted a protective innovation: a baseball hat adorned with a campaign slogan that he recycled from Ronald Reagan’s 1980 run for the White House—“Make America Great Again!” The headwear, which had the rigid façade and the braided rope of a cruise-ship giveaway, added an expeditionary element to the day’s outfit, of blazer, pale slacks, golf shoes—well suited for a mission that he was describing as one of great personal risk. “I may never see you again, but we’re going to do it,” he told Fox News on the eve of the Texas visit.","2274","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"When Trump announced his candidacy, on June 16th, he vowed to build a two-thousand-mile-long wall to stop Mexico from “sending people that have lots of problems.” He said, “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” Three of the statements had no basis in fact—the crime rate among first-generation immigrants is lower than that for native-born Americans—but Trump takes an expansive view of reality. “I play to people’s fantasies,” he writes in “The Art of the Deal,” his 1987 memoir. “I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration—and a very effective form of promotion.”","2275","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s campaign announcement was mocked and condemned—and utterly successful. His favorability among Republicans leaped from sixteen per cent to fifty-seven per cent, a greater spike than that of any other candidate’s début. Immigration became the centerpiece of his campaign. “Donald Trump has changed the entire debate on immigration,” Rush Limbaugh told his listeners last month. As the climax of events in Las Vegas and Phoenix, Trump brought onstage Jamiel Shaw, Sr., whose seventeen-year-old son was killed, in 2008, by a man who was in the country illegally. Trump stood by while Shaw told the crowd how his son was shot.","2276","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Before departing for Laredo, Trump said, “I’ve been invited by border patrols, and they want to honor me, actually, thousands and thousands of them, because I’m speaking up.” Though Trump said “border patrols,” the invitation had in fact come from a local branch of the border-patrol union, and the local, after consulting with headquarters, withdrew the invitation a few hours before Trump arrived, on the ground that it would not endorse political candidates. Descending the airplane stairs, Trump looked thrilled to be arriving amid a controversy; he waded into a crowd of reporters and described the change of plans as the handiwork of unspecified enemies. “They invited me, and then, all of a sudden, they were told, silencio! They want silence.” Asked why he felt unsafe in Laredo—which has a lower crime rate than New York City or Washington, D.C.—he invoked another “they”: “Well, they say it’s a great danger, but I have to do it. I love the country. There’s nothing more important than what I’m doing.”","2277","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump was now going to meet with city officials instead of with the union. He disappeared into one of seven S.U.V.s, escorted by a dozen police vehicles—a larger motorcade than Mitt Romney merited as the Republican nominee. He passed shopping malls, churches, and ranch houses with satellite dishes in the front yard. Some drivers waved; others stared. A car had been positioned along the route with a sign across the windshield: “Mr. Trump, Fuck U.”","2278","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

I sat beside a Latino family and asked the father what had attracted him to the event. He said that a friend involved in the border patrol had called him and asked him “to take up the spaces.” He’d brought five relatives. I asked what he thought of Trump’s politics. He paused and said, “I like his hotels.” Trump told the group, “I don’t think that people understand the danger that you’re under and the talent that you have.

"What accounts for Donald Trump’s political moment? How did a real campaign emerge from a proposition so ludicrous that an episode of “The Simpsons” once used a Trump Presidency as the conceit for a dystopian future?

"In New Hampshire, where voters pride themselves on being unimpressed, Fred Rice, a Republican state representative, arrived at a Trump rally in the beach town of Hampton on an August evening, and found people waiting patiently in a two-hour line that stretched a quarter of a mile down the street. “Never seen that at a political event before,” he said. Other Republicans offer “canned bullshit,” Rice went on. “People have got so terribly annoyed and disenchanted and disenfranchised, really, by candidates who get up there, and all their stump speeches promise everything to everyone.” By the night’s end, Rice was sold. “I heard echoes of Ronald Reagan,” he told me, adding, “If I had to vote today, I would vote for Trump.”","2298","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"To inhabit Trump’s landscape for a while, to chase his jet or stay behind with his fans in a half-dozen states, is to encounter a confederacy of the frustrated—less a constituency than a loose alliance of Americans who say they are betrayed by politicians, victimized by a changing world, and enticed by Trump’s insurgency. Dave Anderson, a New Hampshire Republican who retired from United Parcel Service, told me, “People say, ‘Well, it’d be nice to have another Bush.’ No, it wouldn’t be nice. We had two. They did their duty. That’s fine, but we don’t want this Bush following what his brother did. And he’s not coming across as very strong at all. He’s not saying what Trump is saying. He’s not saying what the issues are.”","2299","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s constant talk of his money, his peering down on the one per cent (not to mention the ninety-nine), has helped him to a surprising degree. “I love the fact that he wouldn’t be owing anybody,” Nancy Merz, a fifty-two-year-old Hampton Republican, told me. She worked at a furniture company, she said. “But the industry went down the tubes.” Her husband, Charlie, used to build household electricity meters at a General Electric plant, until the job moved to Mexico. Now he parks cars at a hospital. Trump, in his speech, promised to stop companies from sending jobs abroad, and the Merzes became Trump Republicans. They are churchgoers, but they don’t expect Trump to become one, and they forgive his unpriestly comments about women. “There are so many other things going on in this country that we’ve got be concerned about,” Nancy said. “I’ve seen a lot of our friends lose their houses.”","2300","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s fans project onto him a vast range of imaginings—about toughness, business acumen, honesty—from a continuum that ranges from economic and libertarian conservatives to the far-right fringe. In partisan terms, his ideas are riven by contradiction—he calls for mass deportations but opposes cuts to Medicare and Social Security; he vows to expand the military but criticizes free trade—and yet that is a reflection of voters’ often incoherent sets of convictions. The biggest surprise in Trump’s following? He “made an incredible surge among the Tea Party supporters,” according to Patrick Murray, who runs polling for Monmouth University. Before Trump announced his candidacy, only twenty per cent of Tea Partiers had a favorable view of him; a month later, that figure had risen to fifty-six per cent. Trump became the top choice among Tea Party voters, supplanting (and opening a large lead over) Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Governor Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, both Tea Party stalwarts. According to a Washington Post /ABC News poll conducted last month, the “broad majority” of Trump’s supporters hailed from two groups: voters with no college degree, and voters who say that immigrants weaken America. By mid-August, Trump was even closing in on Hillary Clinton. CNN reported that, when voters were asked to choose between the two, Clinton was leading fifty-one per cent to forty-five.","2301","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

I didn’t expect that answer in New Hampshire, I remarked. She replied, “They’re everywhere, and they are sucking our economy dry.” Hazelton nodded again, and said, “And we’re paying for it.”","2302","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"When the Trump storm broke this summer, it touched off smaller tempests that stirred up American politics in ways that were easy to miss from afar. At the time, I happened to be reporting on extremist white-rights groups, and observed at first hand their reactions to his candidacy. Trump was advancing a dire portrait of immigration that partly overlapped with their own. On June 28th, twelve days after Trump’s announcement, the Daily Stormer, America’s most popular neo-Nazi news site, endorsed him for President: “Trump is willing to say what most Americans think: it’s time to deport these people.” The Daily Stormer urged white men to “vote for the first time in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests.”","2303","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Ever since the Tea Party’s peak, in 2010, and its fade, citizens on the American far right—Patriot militias, border vigilantes, white supremacists—have searched for a standard-bearer, and now they’d found him. In the past, “white nationalists,” as they call themselves, had described Trump as a “Jew-lover,” but the new tone of his campaign was a revelation. Richard Spencer is a self-described “identitarian” who lives in Whitefish, Montana, and promotes “white racial consciousness.” At thirty-six, Spencer is trim and preppy, with degrees from the University of Virginia and the University of Chicago. He is the president and director of the National Policy Institute, a think tank, co-founded by William Regnery, a member of the conservative publishing family, that is “dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of European people in the United States and around the world.” The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Spencer “a suit-and-tie version of the white supremacists of old.” Spencer told me that he had expected the Presidential campaign to be an “amusing freak show,” but that Trump was “refreshing.” He went on, “Trump, on a gut level, kind of senses that this is about demographics, ultimately. We’re moving into a new America.” He said, “I don’t think Trump is a white nationalist,” but he did believe that Trump reflected “an unconscious vision that white people have—that their grandchildren might be a hated minority in their own country. I think that scares us. They probably aren’t able to articulate it. I think it’s there. I think that, to a great degree, explains the Trump phenomenon. I think he is the one person who can tap into it.”","2304","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Jared Taylor, the editor of American Renaissance, a white-nationalist magazine and Web site based in Oakton, Virginia, told me, in regard to Trump, “I’m sure he would repudiate any association with people like me, but his support comes from people who are more like me than he might like to admit.”","2305","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"From the beginning of the current race, the conservative establishment has been desperate for Trump to be finished. After he disparaged the war record of Senator John McCain, the New York Post gave him a front-page farewell—“DON VOYAGE”—and a Wall Street Journal editorial declared him a “catastrophe.” But Trump carried on—in part because he had activated segments of the electorate that other candidates could not, or would not. On July 20th, three days before his trip to Texas, Ann Coulter, whose most recent book is “¡Adios, America! The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole,” appeared on Sean Hannity’s show and urged fellow-Republicans to see Trump’s summer as a harbinger. “The new litmus test for real conservatives is immigration,” she said. “They used to say the same thing about the pro-life Republicans and the pro-gun Republicans, and, ‘Oh, they’re fringe and they’re tacky, and we’re so embarrassed to be associated with them.’ Now every one of them comes along and pretends they’d be Reagan.”","2306","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"From the pantheon of great demagogues, Trump has plucked some best practices—William Jennings Bryan’s bombast, Huey Long’s wit, Father Charles Coughlin’s mastery of the airwaves—but historians are at pains to find the perfect analogue, because so much of Trump’s recipe is specific to the present. Celebrities had little place in American politics until the 1920 Presidential election, when Al Jolson and other stars from the fledgling film industry endorsed Warren Harding. Two decades ago, Americans were less focussed on paid-for politicians, so Ross Perot, a self-funded billionaire candidate, did not derive the same benefit as Trump from the perception of independence.","2307","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"Trump’s admirers hear in his words multiple appeals. Michael Hill heads the Alabama-based League of the South, a secessionist group that envisions an independent Southern republic with an “Anglo-Celtic” leadership. In 1981, Hill began teaching history at Stillman College, a historically black college in Tuscaloosa. He applied for jobs at other schools, and was turned down, which he attributes to affirmative action. In 1994, he co-founded the League, which put him at odds, he said, with “civil-rights-age, older black faculty and administrators, looking down their nose at this uppity white boy coming out here, talking about the Confederate flag and all that kind of stuff.” In 1999, he left Stillman. He told me, “If academia is not for me, because of who I am—a white Southern male, Christian, straight, whatever—then I’m going to find something that is. I’m going to fight this battle for my people.” Hill was moved by Trump’s frequent references to Kathryn Steinle, a thirty-two-year-old woman who, on July 1st, was walking with her father on a pier in San Francisco when she was fatally wounded in what police described as a random shooting. When police arrested Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a repeat felon who had been deported from the United States five times, Trump adopted the story of “that beautiful woman” as “another example of why we must secure our border immediately.” Hill told me, “That struck such a nerve with people, because a lot of this political stuff is abstract, but, as a father, I’ve got a daughter as well, and I could just see myself holding my daughter, and her looking up at me and saying, ‘Help me, Daddy.’ ” Hill, who condemns immigration and interracial marriage and warns of the influence of “Jewry,” said, “I love to see somebody like Donald Trump come along. Not that I believe anything that he says. But he is stirring up chaos in the G.O.P., and for us that is good.”","2310","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"I joined Hill at a League of the South meeting one afternoon in July, at its newly built headquarters, on a couple of verdant acres outside Montgomery, Alabama. It was the League’s annual conference, and there were about a hundred men and women; the older men were in courtly suits or jackets, and the younger set favored jeans, with handguns holstered in the waistband. The venders’ tables had books (“The True Selma Story,” “Authentic History of the Ku Klux Klan”), stickers (“The Federal Empire Is Killing the American Dream”), and raffle tickets.

"After years of decline, the League has recently acquired a number of younger members, including Brad Griffin, a thirty-four-year-old who writes an influential blog under the name Hunter Wallace. Short and genial, he wore Top-Siders, khaki shorts, and a polo shirt. As we talked, Griffin’s eyes wandered to his two-year-old son, who was roaming nearby. Griffin told me that he embraced white nationalism after reading Patrick Buchanan’s “Death of the West,” which argued, in Griffin’s words, that “all of the European peoples were dying out, their birthrates were low, and you had mass immigration and multiculturalism.” Griffin once had high hopes for the Tea Party. “They channelled all that rage into electing an impressive number of Republicans in the South, but then all they did was try to cut rich Republicans’ taxes and make life easier for billionaires!” he said. “It was all hijacked, and a classic example of how these right-wing movements emerge, and they’re misdirected into supporting the status quo.”","2312","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Griffin had recently told his readers that his opinion of Donald Trump was “soaring.” He sees Trump’s surge as a “hostile takeover of the Republican Party. He’s blowing up their stage-managed dog-and-pony show.” Griffin is repelled by big-money politics, so I asked why he spoke highly of Trump. “He’s a billionaire, but all of these other little candidates are owned by their own little billionaires.” He mentioned Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers. “So I think Trump is independent.”","2313","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

When Hill took the stage, he told his compatriots that the recent lowering of the Confederate flag was just the beginning. Soon, he warned, adopting the unspecified “they,” they will come for the “monuments, battlefields, parks, cemeteries, street names, even the dead themselves.” The crowd was on its feet, cheering him on. “This, my friends, is cultural genocide,” he said, adding, “Often, as history has shown, cultural genocide is merely a prelude to physical genocide.” I ducked out to catch a flight to Des Moines: Trump was speaking the next day in Iowa.","2314","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"It must be stated clearly that (to the delight of the far-right extremists I spoke with) a great many Republicans are mortified by Trump—horrified by his campaign of fear, embarrassed that others in the Party are not, and desperate to move on. But Trump’s strategy has its logic. Gary Johnson, who as a Republican served two terms as the governor of New Mexico, before becoming the 2012 Libertarian Party Presidential candidate, told me that anyone who runs for office discovers that some portion of the electorate is available to be enraged and manipulated, if a candidate is willing to do it. “I ran across this constantly,” he said. “This eight per cent out there that bangs their fist on the table and says, ‘The biggest problem we’re facing is immigration!’ And I’m going, ‘No! No! This is not the case!’ ” Johnson cited a poll that at that point put Trump’s support among Republicans at eighteen per cent, and told me, “I don’t think there’s an eighteen-per-cent element of this country that is just outright racist. But there is a segment out there that is, and he has definitely appealed to that.” Most people, in Johnson’s view, are animated by other parts of Trump’s pitch—“that he’s going to get in and make the tough deals, and nobody’s going to screw with him, because he’ll drop bombs.” That coalition—the fearful and the frustrated—is powerful. “That’s how you begin to get to eighteen per cent,” Johnson said.","2316","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"As people turned up in Oskaloosa, I encountered some of the fearful. A construction worker named Ron James, wearing a T-shirt that said “Every-Juan Illegal Go Home,” told me that the “invasion of illegals” is eroding American culture: “We’re getting flushed down the toilet.” But the vast majority of the room, as best I could tell, was more like Stephanie DeVolder, an elegant fiftysomething, with blond hair and bright-green eyes, who had worked as a sales rep for Dice, a job-search site. She was glad that Trump had “brought up the horrific treatment of the veterans,” and that “he is a foremost believer in the military,” and she admired his work on television. “I bought the videos of ‘The Apprentice,’ and watched the whole thing,” she said. “He is a phenomenal judge of character, and he actually does have a heart. He is absolutely amazing.” His fame had guided her to his political views, and, in time, she had concluded that he was “absolutely right about border security.”","2317","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Emerging from the wings, in a navy suit, a white shirt, and a pink tie, Trump paused midway across the stage to spread his arms in a gesture of astonished, grateful embrace. For years, Trump has been compared to P. T. Barnum, but the comparison doesn’t capture his range; on the campaign trail, he is less the carnival barker than the full cast—the lion, the fire-eater, the clown with the seltzer—all trussed into a single-breasted Brioni suit. Music from the “Karate Kid” soundtrack blared—“You’re the best around! Nothing’s gonna ever keep you down!”—and, for a moment, Trump looked genuinely startled by the ardor of the stargazers in the crowd. At the lectern, he said, “It’s a terrific place, Iowa.” Then he monologued for an hour, off the cuff, on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server (“What she did is very criminal”); Scott Walker (“Finally, I can attack!”); the Veterans Administration (“the most corrupt group of people in all of Washington”).","2318","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"As always, he created a powerful set piece about Mexican criminals who are allowed to “roam around, shooting people and killing people,” as he put it. He described this as a hidden scourge: “Such a big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it.” He reminded the crowd of his trip to Laredo: “I told the pilots, I said, ‘Fly a little bit away from the border, please. Fly a little bit inland.’ It’s a whole scary thing.” He said that when he returned to New York his wife had greeted him in tears. “You made it safely from the border!” she cried. As always, he spoke of Kathryn Steinle’s murder—“Kate, beautiful Kate”—and of the death of Jamiel Shaw’s son, “shot by an animal, an animal that shouldn’t have been in this country.” He urged Iowans to be afraid, even if they didn’t see the threat. “When you’re afraid to walk into your own country, it’s pretty bad,” he said. “Hard to believe. You don’t have that problem in Iowa, in all fairness. But it’s pretty rough out there.”","2319","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"Trump has always weaved in and out of racially charged controversies. In 2000, he secretly ran ads opposing a Catskills casino backed by the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, because it would rival his businesses in Atlantic City. Beneath a picture of drug paraphernalia, the ad asked, “Are these the new neighbors we want?” Tribal leaders denounced the message as “racist and inflammatory,” and Trump and his associates were fined by New York State for concealing the true source of the ads. In March, 2011, Trump, who was considering a Presidential run, resurrected the crackpot theory that Barack Obama is not an American citizen, declaring, “I want him to show his birth certificate.” (It had already been publicly available for more than three years.) Trump’s declaration gave the issue new prominence. At the time, Trump’s on-again, off-again political adviser, the former Nixon aide Roger Stone, said that the decision to become a birther was “a brilliant base-building move.”","2321","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s phantasmagorical visions of marauding immigrants are part of a genre in which immigration and race are intermingled. In recent years, hoaxes and theories that were once confined to the margins have been laundered through mainstream media outlets. In 2013, Fox News repeatedly broadcast warnings about the “knockout game,” based on a self-published book by the white nationalist Colin Flaherty, which described black men randomly attacking white pedestrians. In a study published in the journal Race & Class, Mike King, a sociologist at SUNY-Oneonta, searched for a single actual case of the knockout game and found none. The news reports were largely patched together from unrelated viral videos of street violence. Bureau of Justice statistics show, King wrote, a “marked decrease in random assaults, including black assaults on white strangers.”","2322","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"Taylor, who calls himself a “racial dissident,” was slim and decorous in gray trousers and a button-down when we met. For years, he and others have sensed an opportunity on the horizon to expand their ranks. When Obama was elected in 2008, Stormfront, the leading white-supremacist Web forum, crashed from heavy traffic. The Klan, weakened by lawsuits and infighting, barely exists anymore, but the Internet draws in young racists like Dylann Roof, who is accused of the June 17th massacre of nine people at a church in Charleston. The attack inspired a broad effort to remove the Confederate flag—from the state capitol and from the shelves of Amazon and of Walmart and a host of other retail stores. Defenders of the flag were galvanized, and they organized more than a hundred rallies around the South, interpreting the moment, months after racial unrest in Ferguson and Baltimore, as a sign of a backlash against political correctness and multiculturalism. Trump’s language landed just as American hate groups were more energized than at any time in years. Griffin, the blogger for the League of the South, told me that the removal of the flag had crystallized “fears that people have about what happens when we become a minority. What happens when we have no control over things? You’re seeing it play out right now.”","2324","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

They were white men, in white-collar jobs, and each had a story of radicalization: Chris, who wore a pink oxford shirt and a tie, and introduced himself as an employee of “Conservativism, Inc.,” the Republican establishment, said that he had graduated from a public high school where there were frequent shootings, but he felt he was supposed to “ignore the fact that we were not safe on a day-to-day basis because of all of these blacks and the other immigrants in our schools.”","2325","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

In a study published in 2011, Michael Norton, a professor at Harvard Business School, and Samuel Sommers, a professor of psychology at Tufts, found that more than half of white Americans believe that whites have replaced blacks as “the primary victims of discrimination” today, even though, as Norton and Sommers write, “by nearly any metric—from employment to police treatment, loan rates to education—statistics continue to indicate drastically poorer outcomes for Black than White Americans.”","2326","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"In early August, the Republican candidates convened in Cleveland for their first debate. I watched it on television with Matthew Heimbach, the young white nationalist in Cincinnati, and some of his friends. Heimbach, whom anti-racist activists call “the Little Fuhrer,” for his tirades against “rampant multiculturalism,” founded the Traditionalist Youth Network, a far-right group that caters to high-school and college students and pushes for the separation of blacks and whites. Stocky and bearded, Heimbach is ambitious. He graduated, in 2013, from Towson University, in Maryland, where he attracted controversy for forming a “white student union.” He has met with European Fascists, including members of the Golden Dawn, in Greece.","2329","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Heimbach rents part of a house on a placid side street and works as a landscaper. He and his wife recently had their first child, a boy named Nicholas. When I asked Heimbach how he got involved with Fascist politics, he laughed. “I was not raised like this,” he said. “I was raised to be a normal small-town Republican.” The son of teachers in Poolesville, Maryland, an hour from Washington, he, like Brad Griffin, credited Buchanan’s book “Death of the West” for seeding his conception of a desolate future. “Even if you play the game, even if you do everything right, then the future, when it comes to your income, when it comes to benefits, when it comes to everything, we are going to be the first generation in American history to be living worse than our parents.” He went on, “My own parents tell me, ‘Well, you should just shut up, you should go get a normal job, and get a two-car garage, and then you’ll be happy.’ ”","2330","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"On the economics, Heimbach’s narrative is not wrong. During a half-century of change in the American labor market—the rise of technology and trade, the decline of manual labor—nobody has been hit harder than low-skilled, poorly educated men. Between 1979 and 2013, pay for men without a college degree fell by twenty-one per cent in real terms; for women with similar credentials, pay rose by three per cent, thanks partly to job opportunities in health care and education. Like many ultraconservatives, Heimbach had largely given up on the Republican Party. He said, “We need to get the white community to actually start speaking for the white community, instead of letting a bunch of Republicans that hate us anyway, and don’t speak for our values, be the unofficial spokespeople.”","2331","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Hovater told me, “I think he’s, like, dog-whistling,” adding, “He’s saying we should probably favor more European immigration, or maybe more of just a meritocracy sort of system, but he’s not coming out and saying it, because people will literally stamp him: ‘Oh, you just hate Mexicans.’ ” Hovater hopes that Trump will find a way to be more forthright: “Why not just say it?”","2333","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

He is taking inspiration from Trump’s populist success. “Just like we’re seeing with Trump, if the people honestly feel like you’re fighting for them, they’ll rally behind you,” he said. He knows that his views are “extreme,” but Trump’s success tells him that people support tone over substance. “People will be, like, ‘Well, I’ll take the fighter, even though I might disagree with him on some things,’ ” he said.","2334","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

We don’t win anymore,” he said. “We can’t do anything right.” Matthew Parrott, a Web developer who was sipping coffee from a cup adorned with a swastika, said, “He was sassy without being comical. He struck exactly the tone he needed to give the people supporting him exactly what they want more of.” He went on, “The political system hasn’t been providing an outlet for social-conservative populism. You had this Ron Paul revolution, and all the stuff about cutting taxes, small government, and that’s just not the electrifying issue that they were expecting it to be. Simple folks, they want the border secure. They want what Donald Trump is mirroring at them. I think he’s an intelligent businessman who identified what the people want to hear.

Other Republicans recoiled, convinced that Trump’s nativist turn would taint the Party’s image as ruinously as Mitt Romney’s “self-deportation” comments in his race against Barack Obama. At the time, Trump himself disapproved of Romney’s approach, saying, in November, 2012, “He had a crazy policy of ‘self- deportation,’ which was maniacal.

I will say that people that are following me are very passionate.

In doing so, he pulled America into a current that is coursing through other Western democracies—Britain, France, Spain, Greece, Scandinavia—where xenophobic, nationalist parties have emerged since the 2008 economic crisis to besiege middle-ground politicians. In country after country, voters beset by inequality and scarcity have reached past the sober promises of the center-left and the center-right to the spectre of a transcendent solution, no matter how cruel. “The more complicated the problem, the simpler the demands become,” Samuel Popkin, a political scientist at the University of California in San Diego, told me. “When people get frustrated and irritated, they want to cut the Gordian knot.”","2343","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump has succeeded in unleashing an old gene in American politics—the crude tribalism that Richard Hofstadter named “the paranoid style”—and, over the summer, it replicated like a runaway mutation. Whenever Americans have confronted the reshuffling of status and influence—the Great Migration, the end of Jim Crow, the end of a white majority—we succumb to the anti-democratic politics of absolutism, of a “conflict between absolute good and absolute evil,” in which, Hofstadter wrote, “the quality needed is not a willingness to compromise but the will to fight things out to a finish. Nothing but complete victory will do.” Trump was born to the part. “I’ll do nearly anything within legal bounds to win,” he wrote, in “The Art of the Deal.” “Sometimes, part of making a deal is denigrating your competition.” Trump, who long ago mastered the behavioral nudges that could herd the public into his casinos and onto his golf courses, looked so playful when he gave out Lindsey Graham’s cell-phone number that it was easy to miss just how malicious a gesture it truly was. It expressed the knowledge that, with a single utterance, he could subject an enemy to that most savage weapon of all: us.","2344","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Trump has bequeathed a concoction of celebrity, wealth, and alienation that is more potent than any we’ve seen before.

"On July 4th, the night before a referendum asked the Greek people to decide how far their debt-ridden government should accommodate the demands of its main creditors—the “troika” of the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund—Yanis Varoufakis, the country’s minister of finance, sat outdoors at an Athens restaurant, wearing a T-shirt with an outline of Texas on the front. In January, Varoufakis, an economist who had been teaching at the University of Texas at Austin, abruptly entered Greek politics, becoming the public face of the country’s defiant negotiations with European leaders. After months of fatigue, he had slept for much of the day, and he was in a good mood. Varoufakis, who is fifty-four, had the peace of mind of someone who was certain of an election result and already savoring the satisfactions to follow. His government, the left-wing Syriza party, would lose. The people would vote “yes”—that is, in favor of making more concessions than Varoufakis and Alexis Tsipras, the country’s forty-year-old Prime Minister and the leader of Syriza, had said that they could stomach. Varoufakis would resign as a minister, and would never again have to endure all-day meetings in Brussels and Luxembourg, listening to other European finance ministers scold Greece for its disobedience. And he would no longer need to marshal scant supplies of discretion to disguise the fact that he and Tsipras had, in recent weeks, lost significant faith in each other. Varoufakis had not given up his hostility toward the troika, or the economic arguments underpinning that hostility, but he spoke as if Syriza’s weeklong campaign of slogans and street protests in support of ohi—“no”—were already archived in Greece’s long history of resistance to external aggressors. A “yes” vote, Varoufakis declared, was “inevitable.”","2346","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"

Galbraith had been acting as an unpaid adviser on an informal international team that included Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at Columbia University.

If it’s not granted, then default.’ ”","2347","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"

When a passerby took Varoufakis’s hand—the minister preferred a right-angled bro-shake with Greeks—he kept shaking it with an almost violent intensity. It had been a disorienting few days, during which Greeks often described an event or a conversation as having taken place a while ago, before realizing that it had happened only yesterday. Aristides Baltas, a philosopher of science who is currently serving as the minister of education, told me that time had become “dense.”","2348","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"At the end of the previous week, negotiations between Greece and its troika creditors had stalled, and Tsipras called the referendum. On June 28th, the European Central Bank declined to increase the level of day-to-day credit available, under a program called Emergency Liquidity Assistance, to Greece’s ailing private banks; they were almost out of cash, after months of a slow-motion bank run. Greeks were hoarding euros at home. Varoufakis set in motion what he called “a tragic mechanism” to restrict withdrawals. (The next night, a Monday, he told Stratou, on returning from work, “Honey, I shut the banks.”) Greeks could now withdraw from A.T.M.s no more than sixty euros a day. A shrunken economy shrunk further, although it was still possible to make unlimited electronic transfers within Greece. Determined to empty bank accounts, for fear that deposits would be devalued or lost, Greeks paid their bills: Varoufakis spoke of “huge” sums flowing into the tax office.","2349","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"The government had made contingency plans for a temporary alternative currency, in the form of electronic I.O.U.s. On June 30th, Greece missed a payment to the I.M.F., joining three other countries in arrears: Somalia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe. Three days later, Klaus Regling, the head of the European Stability Mechanism, which was managing the debt that Greece owed to the countries of the E.U., e-mailed Varoufakis to remind him that, because of the missed I.M.F. payment, the European Financial Stability Facility had the option of asking for immediate repayment of E.U. funds. “I personally owe €142.6 billion,” Varoufakis said. “It’s my name on the contract.” He recalled that his response, delivered with war-weary humor, and some contempt, was a two-word quotation of the King of Sparta: “Molon labe,” or “Come and get it.” On the night of July 3rd, Varoufakis was mobbed as he passed through a crowd of tens of thousands of Greeks, to a final rally for the “no” cause.

"After months at the center of a global political spectacle, Varoufakis still carried himself as an outsider: informal, ironic, somehow alone on the stage. This demeanor had sometimes given his tenure the air of a five-month-long ted talk. At the restaurant, Varoufakis’s commentary on the recent tumult, and on the likely catastrophic events to come, sometimes seemed amused almost to the point of blitheness. He asked after Galbraith’s children, then noted that, a few hours earlier, a member of Germany’s parliament had visited his apartment, confessing, “I don’t believe in what we’re doing to you.” The legislator was a Christian Democrat—the party led by Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, who had it in her power to ease Greece’s crisis.

There would be a “strategic restructuring,” Varoufakis said, and then elections.

Instead of six to eight per cent of gross domestic product, an alarming enough figure, the deficit would be 12.5 per cent. Greece was already known to have severe, long-standing economic weaknesses: tax evasion, corruption, oligarchic habits, a failure to make products that other countries desired. The country’s credit rating plummeted, along with its reputation for statistical candor.","2361","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis, then a professor with a side career in online punditry, made the case for defaulting with the banks. “I said that we are insolvent, and we have to embrace our insolvency,” he recalled recently. The case against defaulting on banks was reinforced by memories of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, in 2008, and its global consequences. The government raised taxes, froze wages, and cut pensions. The economic argument for austerity—for reducing public spending in difficult times—rests on the idea that investors will be comforted by such displays of discipline. But Greece remained unable to borrow at affordable rates. In April, 2010, Papandreou declared the Greek economy to be “a sinking ship” in need of international aid. Two weeks later, a hundred thousand anti-austerity protesters descended on Syntagma Square. Three people died when a petrol bomb was thrown into a nearby bank.","2362","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"That May, the troika institutions agreed to lend Greece a hundred and ten billion euros. Germany’s direct contribution was more than twenty billion. That bailout, and a subsequent additional loan of a hundred and thirty billion euros, came with three kinds of obligation: Greece needed to privatize state assets, such as Athens’s port; reform institutions and practices perceived to be inefficient, including its health-care and welfare systems, in ways likely to result in mass dismissals; and adjust its budget through further tax increases and spending cuts, to the point where Greece’s income significantly exceeded its spending on everything but its repayments. In an economy without growth, such a surplus becomes a measure of austerity. The target was 4.5 per cent of the country’s G.D.P.","2363","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Criticism of these arrangements, largely shaped by Germany’s demands, is now widespread, and unites Paul Krugman, the economist and Times columnist, Norman Lamont, the Conservative former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, and analysts at the I.M.F. The bailouts turned an unmanageable private debt into an unpayable institutional debt. Although the new loans were largely long-term and low-interest, they carried provisions that intruded on the everyday spending decisions of the state and, in the opinion of many observers, crushed hopes of economic growth. Writing at the time of the first bailout, Varoufakis described it as punitive—a rerun of the Versailles Treaty, this time with Germany as the enactor, rather than the victim, of economic retribution.","2364","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"In April, 2012, Dimitris Christoulas, a retired pharmacist living on a meagre pension, shot and killed himself beside a cypress tree in Syntagma Square, leaving a note that described the Greek administration as “a Tsolakoglou government”—a reference to the puppet Prime Minister during Greece’s Nazi occupation. Christoulas’s death became a focus of national rage. The cypress tree became brocaded with staples from generations of political flyers.","2365","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"By last winter, when Greece’s fourth Prime Minister in four years called a snap election, the debt exceeded three hundred billion euros. Measured against G.D.P., Greece had more than double the government debt of Germany or America. If, by then, Greece’s economy was showing modest signs of recovery, few could feel it: youth unemployment had reached sixty per cent. Varoufakis wrote that his country was being subjected by the troika to “a fiscal waterboarding” enabled by supine Greek leaders. He told me that these politicians “never negotiated.” Troika representatives sent orders by e-mail, and the Greeks “just executed them.”","2366","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis, a mathematical economist with a modest academic reputation, had become a popular writer in Greece. When the snap election was called, he interrupted his professorship at the University of Texas, flew home to Greece, and launched a ten-day election campaign whose sole expense was the cost of gas for his motorcycle. He was running for parliament, with the aim of becoming the finance minister in a Syriza government. The vote was held on January 25th. Syriza doubled its number of seats in parliament, and Tsipras formed a government in coalition with a small right-of-center party that shared its opposition to the troika’s terms. Varoufakis was elected with a larger share of the vote than any other candidate, and he was named the finance minister. His only previous experience of representative office was as the (white, Greek) leader of the Black Students’ Alliance at the University of Essex, a British institution, in the late seventies. Privately, he asked himself, “What have I done?” On his blog, he borrowed some thoughts of defiance—and, by implication, certain failure—from Dylan Thomas. “Greek democracy today chose to stop going gently into the night,” Varoufakis wrote. “Greek democracy resolved to rage against the dying of the light.”","2367","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"A few years ago, Varoufakis told Yorgos Avgeropoulos, a documentary filmmaker, that the difference between a debt of ten thousand euros and one of three hundred billion euros is that only the latter gives you negotiating power. And it does so only under one condition: “You must be prepared to say no.” Upon his election, Varoufakis used the less than ideal influence available to a rock climber who, roped to his companions, announces a willingness to let go. On behalf of Tsipras’s government, Varoufakis told Greece’s creditors, and the world’s media, that his country objected to the terms of its agreements. This position encouraged widespread commentary about Greece following a heedless path from “no” to default, and from default to a “Grexit” from the euro currency, which might lead to economic catastrophe in Europe and the world.","2368","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"It was as if Christopher Hitchens had woken up one day as Secretary of State. Varoufakis was no longer writing elegantly prosecutorial blog posts about Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F.; he was meeting with Lagarde. Within days of Greece’s election, an academic with Marxist roots, a shaved head, and a strong jaw had become one of the world’s most recognizable politicians. He showed a level of intellectual and rhetorical confidence—or, perhaps, unearned swagger—that lifted Greek hearts and infuriated Northern European politicians. His reluctance to wear a tie seemed to convey the impossibility of containing his manliness.","2369","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"I first met Varoufakis at the end of April, when his political career had barely begun. He hadn’t yet taken down Instagram photographs of birthday cakes and swimming pools, and when he recalled meeting high-level officials he indulged in the kind of candid, if self-flattering, storytelling that most politicians save for their journals. He teasingly referred to George Osborne, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, as “Georgie.”","2370","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis was more willing than most elected officials to allow that his career might soon end. It wasn’t clear how long a smiling, steely “no”—even when underwritten by sane economic theory, a popular mandate, and a level of charisma that inspired a member of the Portuguese parliament to proclaim, online, “Damn, the Greek finance minister is sexy”—could serve as the primary international posture of a bankrupt nation hoping to stay in a currency union. Varoufakis was still negotiating for the right to negotiate, while relations between him and Greece’s creditors were publicly souring. It was as if he’d landed in a brisk parable about the illusory power of the Great Man in history. “I don’t care,” he said of his political future. He simply wanted a less punishing deal with creditors, at which point he and Tsipras, by private agreement, would—for one day—wear ties. “But when they say to me, ‘You can keep your job if you sign on this dotted line of a program that is deflationary,’ well, I might as well let the other guys come and do it.”","2371","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"We were on a Lufthansa flight from Washington to Munich. As we stood in the aisle, Varoufakis told me that he’d had “a very pleasant and quite surprising” ten-minute conversation with President Barack Obama, at a Greek Independence Day celebration in the East Room of the White House. “The setting was appalling,” he said. “All these people were pushing in to talk to him and hug him.” John Stamos, the actor, was at Varoufakis’s right shoulder. “But we probably had a more serious conversation than I would have had in the Oval Office.”","2372","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Obama, Varoufakis said, had told him that he didn’t envy him. (In fact, many politicians surely do envy circumstances where there’s so little to lose, professionally, by acting on long-held beliefs in exactly the way demanded of them by a clear-voiced electorate.) Varoufakis told Obama that things were tough: “You inherited a mess when you came to office, but at least you had your central bank behind you. We inherited a mess and we have a central bank”—the European Central Bank—“trying to choke us.”","2373","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"According to Varoufakis, Obama replied, “Don’t underestimate how tough it was for me,” adding that bailing out Wall Street was “contrary to my politics” and “political poison.” He urged Varoufakis to “swallow bitter stuff.” (The White House declined to comment about the conversation.)","2374","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis had gone to Washington for three days of back-to-back meetings at a spring gathering of the world’s senior financial officials. Shortly before his White House appointment, he and Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s powerful finance minister, had both spoken at the Brookings Institution, with a half-hour pause between their appearances. This was not quite long enough to suppress jokey talk, in the audience, about the risks of an accidental summit in the foyer. (At a joint press conference in Berlin, in February, Schäuble said of their first meeting, “We agreed to disagree”—a statement with which Varoufakis immediately disagreed.)","2375","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Since 2010, Greece’s economic fate has been determined largely by representatives of Germany, Europe’s largest economy, in particular by Merkel and Schäuble. The ill feeling between the two nations draws on memories of the Second World War, and is shaded by German perceptions of Greeks as “insufferable spendthrift overreachers,” as Varoufakis once put it. The distrust was not eased when, during a televised interview on a German current-affairs program, Varoufakis was shown a 2013 clip of himself speaking at the Subversive Festival, in Zagreb—an event that also featured Oliver Stone. In the clip, Varoufakis described having made the case, three years earlier, that Greece should default and “stick the finger to Germany”—he raised a finger—“and say, ‘Well, you can now solve this problem by yourself.’ ” The clip’s editing dishonestly disguised the fact that Varoufakis had been referring to 2010—when he did argue for defaulting on the private bank loans—but his unusually flustered on-air response was to insist that the clip had been faked, and that he had never made the gesture in his life.","2376","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"The two Brookings appearances displayed contrasting forms of certainty, or arrogance. Varoufakis charmed with rhetoric: European leaders, he suggested, seemed intent on solving a continental crisis “by exporting it to the rest of the globe.” Schäuble spoke as though he were briefing colleagues, his combative thoughts smoothed by an avuncular delivery. “In Europe, we have good reason not to provide financial assistance without demanding something in return,” he said, amiably. A little later: “Even Yanis Varoufakis, who is a famous economist, is not the first economist in world history—no!”","2377","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"At the White House, Varoufakis repeated a line that he had used at Brookings: “Mr. President, my government is planning, and I am planning, to compromise, compromise, and compromise, but we’re not going to be compromised.” (“He liked that,” Varoufakis recalled.) Varoufakis told him, “Mr. President, of course one has to suffer costs in order to get the benefits, but the question is the balance. There has to be a positive balance.” He went on, “We are being asphyxiated for trying to simulate what you did, right?”","2378","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Obama showed more solidarity than Varoufakis was expecting. “I know—austerity sucks,” Obama said. (“He used those words. Very un-Presidential.”) According to Varoufakis, the President was referring less to austerity’s unpleasantness than to its ineffectiveness. Obama meant that austerity “doesn’t work—it creates misery, and it’s self-perpetuating, and it’s self-defeating.”","2379","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis told Obama that he hadn’t felt quite the same comradeship when speaking with the U.S. Treasury Secretary. “Jack Lew is not toeing the Obama line,” he said.","2380","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"

"Varoufakis changed planes in Munich, and flew on to Athens. On the jet bridge, a Greek woman urged him, “Be strong. Keep saying no.” And, on a day when the lead story in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung quoted an unnamed source, from among Greece’s creditors, describing Greek negotiators as “incompetent and inexperienced,” a man with a German accent introduced himself, saying, “People tell me I look like you.” He also had a shaved head and, like Varoufakis—who wore Doc Martens shoes to the White House—had carried some youthful fashion thoughts into middle age. Varoufakis posed for a joint photograph.","2382","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"On the tarmac, a frugal ministerial Hyundai awaited. We drove out of the airport and into a car advertisement—a stretch of empty, velvety highway built shortly before the 2004 Summer Olympics. I later spoke to Elina Psykou, a Greek filmmaker, whose next movie will be set in the Athens of this era. She described her script as a study of denial.","2383","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"It was a Sunday, which gave Varoufakis a break from a weekday habit of checking his phone every minute or two for real-time data about the finances of the Greek state. “I don’t care about stock markets,” he said. “They can fall as much as they want.” Rather, the figure that commanded his attention was an unpublished one: “The balance, the bottom line.” After the election, Varoufakis had refused to sign an agreement keeping Greece on the previously agreed path, which impeded a final, €7.2 billion payment of bailout money. This action helped return Greece to recession, and did nothing to forestall its debt repayments. The Greek crisis had already become one of contraction, poverty, and unemployment, but this spring Greece’s debtor status took on a banana-republic dimension. Pensioners withdrew their life savings from banks, and Greeks anticipated their government running out of cash. In the car, Varoufakis acknowledged his job’s discomforts, then brightened: “At least it makes more sense than people looking at their Bloomberg terminals just to make a margin call, right?” He was not downcast, and could still muster the thought that Merkel, in time, would help to engineer a deal.","2384","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"In Washington, however, there had been little to encourage him. He said that he had told troika representatives, “If they think that, with this Chinese water-drop torture, we’re going to succumb, they’ll be disappointed. So the blood will be on their hands.”","2385","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"As we drove, Varoufakis talked of his father, George, whose example of stubbornness had helped shape him. In 1946, during Greece’s civil war against Communist insurgents, George Varoufakis was arrested as a student leftist, and refused to sign a denunciation of Communism. He was imprisoned for four years, and repeatedly tortured. His signature would have freed him. I later met the senior Varoufakis—the courtly chairman of a steel company who, at ninety, still goes to the office every day. He told me that for years after he was freed he couldn’t listen to Johann Strauss: his torturers had “put on waltzes, very high, in order not to hear our voices, our screaming.”","2386","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"After George Varoufakis returned to college, a female student kept an eye on him for a paramilitary right-wing group—“Stasi stuff,” as Yanis put it. But she fell in love with George, and they married. Yanis was born in 1961. During the military dictatorship of 1967 to 1974, Varoufakis’s uncle, a libertarian, was imprisoned for participating in small-scale terrorism. Varoufakis recalled his excitement when charged with smuggling notes to him on prison visits.","2387","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"In the Hyundai, Varoufakis’s phone rang, and he talked for a minute in Greek. Afterward, he smiled; it had been a cabinet colleague who was “blessed with natural optimism.” He went on, “Without knowing anything, he says, ‘Welcome back, I’m sure you did a fantastic job, everything will go fantastically well!’ ” Varoufakis laughed. “How the fuck does he know?”","2388","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"The day after Varoufakis returned from Washington, he rode his motorcycle to the ministry. He met with three German bankers who, in an attempt at solidarity, arrived without ties, then he chaired a discussion about the creation of a more autonomous Greek tax authority—a long-standing ambition of the troika. Much Greek income goes unreported. According to a 2012 analysis, the average declared monthly income of self-employed Greek medical workers was sixteen hundred and twenty-eight euros; those workers spent an average of sixteen hundred and sixty euros on monthly debt repayments.","2389","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"That evening, Varoufakis rode to Maximos Mansion, a few minutes away, to see Tsipras. Varoufakis described his Washington meetings, and made the case for the new tax body. They were together for three and a half hours. “He bought it, so that was good,” Varoufakis later recalled.","2390","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"After ten, he e-mailed me, and I went to his home, on the top floor of an apartment building in northern Athens. Varoufakis and Stratou had just moved in. Their previous apartment, in a building belonging to Stratou’s parents, was featured in Paris Match earlier this year, in photographs that showed Varoufakis at the piano, and larking around on a roof with Stratou, the Acropolis behind them. The photographs became a small scandal. Although that apartment did not look opulent, Stratou and her family are known to be well off, and to many observers the couple appeared rather comfortable at a time of national privation. The more cutting charge might be vanity: they seemed overly confident in their lean, well-tailored, Mediterranean allure, and had failed to anticipate the posed garishness of the Paris Match style. “Aesthetically, it was horrible,” Varoufakis told me. “It was my fault.” Given that fuss, it seems unkind to report that their new home is lovely: thousands of square feet of high-bourgeois modernism involving art, parquet flooring, and low, pale sofas.","2391","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis and Stratou attended the same private secondary school, in Athens, although they don’t recall meeting. In 1978, Varoufakis enrolled at the University of Essex, a radical college northeast of London, where he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. He recalled that, as the face of the Black Students’ Alliance—a role he was persuaded to take by black students—he would “get up and say, ‘We blacks believe . . .’ And then everybody would laugh.” He continued, “Then I would look at them and say, ‘Black is a state of mind, and we Greeks are the blacks of Europe, together with the Irish.’ ”","2392","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis and Stratou’s relationship accommodates the kind of recurring, and mostly amiable, friction suggested by the phrase “O.K., you tell the story.” Varoufakis said that, as a foreigner in Britain during the Thatcher era, he always felt the threat of street violence. Stratou, who studied at St. Martin’s College, a few years later, disputed this memory. Varoufakis cried out, “You were in paradise, in London!” This spring, a Greek Web site speculated that Jarvis Cocker, the former lead singer of Pulp, was referring to Stratou in “Common People,” the band’s much-loved 1995 single. The autobiographical song starts, “She came from Greece, she had a thirst for knowledge / She studied sculpture at St. Martin’s College.” It goes on to quote her: “I want to live like common people / I want to do whatever common people do.” Varoufakis later told me that Stratou was the only Greek sculpture student at St. Martin’s at the time.","2393","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis studied economics, but came to think of it as “computerized astrology” in its mainstream academic form. (He has written of his hope, as a professor, to present economics as “a contested terrain on which armies of ideas clash mercilessly.”) He turned largely to mathematics before returning to economics with a Ph.D. thesis about the dynamics of workers’ strikes. He also briefly competed in professional car races. “I was very good at qualifying”—when other drivers weren’t on the track—but “crap at the races.” He added, “I was either insufficiently aggressive or, when I would try to overcompensate, too aggressive. I crashed a number of times.”","2394","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis, who has compared his place in economics to that of “an atheist theologian ensconced in a Middle Ages monastery,” held various junior posts at British universities before joining the faculty at the University of Sydney, where he met his first wife, a Greek-Australian historian. In 2000, Varoufakis returned to Greece, to take a professorship at the University of Athens. He published on game theory, and occasionally advised George Papandreou, then in opposition. Varoufakis recently described him to me as having the economic mind of a five-year-old. Varoufakis never voted for Papandreou; nor did he immediately align with Syriza when it was founded, in 2004, as a grouping of small leftist parties. “I was in tune with them, but they were all over the place—ecologists, Communists.”","2395","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"In 2005, he separated from his wife, not long after the birth of their daughter; she and her mother live in Australia. He later met Stratou, who asked for his advice about an art project involving fraught or disputed borderlines. Soon after, they embarked on a yearlong series of trips to photograph such borders in Cyprus, Kashmir, and elsewhere. He wrote an accompanying text, “The Globalizing Wall,” and began publishing personal and cultural essays. He was emerging as an all-purpose public intellectual in the mold of Slavoj Žižek.","2396","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Being “of a Marxist disposition,” as Varoufakis told me, he had tended to see calm as a prelude to turmoil: “Most of my colleagues in economics think of crises as preventable accidents—a mistake of some policy—whereas, if you look at the world from my perspective, capitalism generates them.” Before 2007, he said, he had begun to feel “very jittery” about the instability of a system in which the flow of global capital had come to rely on what he saw as America’s deliberate policy of causing its deficits to rise. Later, in a spirited book, “The Global Minotaur,” which some reviewers described as conspiratorially inclined, he recycled a metaphor that he’d once used to critique U.S. foreign policy. America was an economic beast held in check only by the constant movement of overseas money through Wall Street. “By 2007, I realized that we were facing the prospect of a new Great Depression,” he said. Then, after the Lehman Brothers collapse, “the statements from Europe were mind-bogglingly stupid,” he said. “Like, ‘This is an Anglo-American problem. We are safe because we have safe practices in the banking sectors of Europe.’ Yeah, right.”","2397","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"When the crisis hit Greece, Varoufakis began his blog, and, with Stuart Holland, a British academic and former politician, published an essay, “A Modest Proposal.” It suggested ways in which the E.C.B. and the E.U. could press the banks holding bonds of struggling eurozone countries to forgive much of this debt, and envisaged a Europe that could issue its own bonds and fund stimulus investments—effectively putting German savings to work in Ireland and Greece. Varoufakis, who had argued against Greece’s decision, in 2001, to adopt the euro, wrote that if there was going to be a currency union then it should not be half-baked, and should function more like the one that joins California and Alabama.","2398","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis recognized the many frailties in Greece’s economy, but he preferred to talk of a banking crisis rather than a debt crisis, and of a European crisis rather than a Greek one. If Greece had over-borrowed, the real villains were the lenders standing in line for bailout funds. The euro had created a delusion: banks had lent to Greece as if it were a student backed by wealthy parental guarantors. But there were no such guarantees, and when the lending stopped Greece was trapped by the currency that had indulged it. The country couldn’t painfully devalue its currency, like, say, Argentina at the start of the century. (A devaluation makes your people poor but your goods enticingly cheap.) And the euro lacked a body like the Federal Reserve, or the Bank of England, that could feed newly minted cash into the Greek economy; to Varoufakis’s frustration, the E.C.B. wasn’t that kind of bank.","2399","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"In part because Varoufakis had once advised Papandreou, his views were widely noticed. “I acquired the two things I hate—fans and enemies,” he told me. One night in 2011, he was in bed when the phone rang. A man threatened Varoufakis’s family with violence if he didn’t stop criticizing a particular Greek bank.","2400","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"At the time, Golden Dawn, Greece’s neo-Nazi party, was gaining support. Stratou said to Varoufakis, “Either you don’t get involved, or you get into politics to protect us, or we get out of the country.” In 2012, Varoufakis was offered a visiting professorship at the University of Texas, and they moved to Austin. Varoufakis taught a graduate class on the crisis and, with Galbraith, revised “A Modest Proposal.” “They were knights trying to save the world!” Stratou told me, laughing at her choice of words but sincere in her admiration.","2401","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Tsipras, a former civil engineer, was elected to parliament in 2009, and became Syriza’s leader. In 2014, he urged Varoufakis to represent the party in elections for the European Parliament, which meets in Brussels. Varoufakis declined. In that election, Syriza won more seats than any other party. Greece’s right-of-center government was weakened, and it was further weakened that November, when the troika announced that Greece had fallen short of its promised reforms and demanded additional action—including spending cuts—before releasing a payment of €7.2 billion. By now, a Greek election was likely, with Syriza’s victory almost inevitable. Tsipras had admired Varoufakis’s writing and felt that he would be an effective minister of finance, despite his inexperience and his limited links to Syriza. Varoufakis agreed to come home. According to Stratou, he “felt that, when he’s eighty years old, looking back, if he hadn’t taken that opportunity it would feel like a betrayal of his own country.” She recalled how often he said, “If I were in conversation with Merkel, this is what I would do . . .”","2402","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Two days after Varoufakis was sworn in as minister, he slipped into Syntagma Square, alone. Yorgos Avgeropoulos, the documentary filmmaker, was waiting there to introduce him to Emmi Christoulas, the daughter of the pharmacist who had committed suicide. Varoufakis laid a flower by the cypress where Christoulas had died. (Varoufakis didn’t alert the press, or mention it to me, but he allowed Avgeropoulos to film it.) Tsipras’s first act as Prime Minister was to lay flowers at the memorial in an Athens suburb where two hundred Greek resistance fighters were executed by Nazi forces, in 1944. German newspapers took note of the symbolism.","2403","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"At the ministry, Varoufakis answered a call from Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch minister of finance. Dijsselbloem is the current president of the Eurogroup, the constitutionally ambiguous but all-powerful committee comprising the finance ministers of countries using the euro. (There are nineteen such countries; nine others, including the U.K., are in the E.U. but not in the eurozone.) Nobody in the Eurogroup has more power than Schäuble, but Dijsselbloem has taken on the role of enforcer—or, to quote one unfriendly observer, water carrier. If Greece wanted to modify the economic “program” mandated by the troika’s loans, the Eurogroup’s blessing was required. In Varoufakis’s description, the nineteen governments could be divided into three groups: “There is a very small minority that believes in austerity, and in this program.” Germany leads this minority. A second group—Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Baltic states—has pursued austerity programs, and now fears that Syriza, if successful, would leave those countries exposed to radical domestic opposition. “Then there’s another group, of substantial countries like Italy and France—especially France—who don’t believe in austerity. But they fear that if they side with us they will be punished.” Their punishment would be austerity.","2404","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Greece’s arrangement with the troika was set to expire on February 28th. If Syriza did not commit to the existing terms, and the program lapsed, the E.C.B. would no longer be obliged to supply emergency lines of credit to Greek banks, which would consequently run out of cash. The country would have to print its own money, taking it out of the euro. Varoufakis’s declared hope was that, before February 28th, the Eurogroup would agree to a “bridge”—a short-term renewal of loans, which would provide time to negotiate modifications to the program. Syriza could, for example, delay privatizations at a time when prices for state assets were unusually low, and uphold an election promise to raise state pensions and the minimum wage. Varoufakis also wanted some debt relief.","2405","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"On the phone, Varoufakis recalled, Dijsselbloem “was perfectly pleasant,” asking, “What do you want to do?” Promising to negotiate in good faith, Varoufakis requested the bridge. According to Varoufakis, Dijsselbloem said, “Sounds reasonable. I’ll fly in in a couple of days.”","2406","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"“It was downhill from that moment,” Varoufakis said.","2407","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Arriving in Athens, Dijsselbloem asked the same question, and Varoufakis gave the same answer. This time, Dijsselbloem replied, “That will not do.” (“I have no doubt that he was pulled into line between the telephone conversation and the visit,” Varoufakis told me. He declined to name Germany explicitly, but added, “You can imagine.”) Varoufakis asked Dijsselbloem, “Are you threatening me, on Day One, with Grexit?” Dijsselbloem said that a crashed program wouldn’t necessitate Greece’s exit from the euro.","2408","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"“But the banks will shut down,” Varoufakis said.","2409","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"“Yes, sure,” Dijsselbloem replied. (Last week, a spokesperson for the Dutch finance ministry said, “We never comment on reports of discussions held behind closed doors. Mr. Dijsselbloem is trying to enjoy a government summer recess. I would advise Mr. Varoufakis to do the same.”)","2410","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"At a subsequent joint press conference, Varoufakis declared that Greece would continue negotiating with the E.U., the E.C.B., and the I.M.F. individually, but not as a bloc that had the power—deeply resented—to embed its officers in Greek ministries. He was unilaterally attempting to detach debt from day-to-day interference in Greece’s governance (or, as he put it to me, “a pattern of humiliation”). Varoufakis made his point in Greek. There was a pause while Dijsselbloem caught up through headset translation. Varoufakis now claims that, privately, Dijsselbloem had acknowledged that troika reform was inevitable. But that’s not how it looked. Dijsselbloem took off his headset and stood up to leave; Varoufakis’s face displayed the smiling, embarrassed faux-innocence of someone who has said more than he planned to say in a domestic argument. Dijsselbloem “was livid,” Varoufakis told me. “He whispered in my ear, ‘You just killed the troika.’ ”","2411","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis’s fame grew the next week, after he left his suitcase in an Athens taxi. Arriving in Paris, late in the evening, at the start of a tour of European capitals, he had only the clothes he was wearing. That night, at Zara, he bought two shirts and a pair of pants. But he relied on Theodore Passas, Greece’s Ambassador to France, for a coat. “He’s a snazzy Ambassador,” Varoufakis told me. Passas lent Varoufakis a gangsterish hybrid of motorcycle jacket and hunting coat, and after Varoufakis wore it to meet George Osborne in London—over an electric-blue shirt—the European press wrote many delighted columns about a minister of state who looked as if he might be armed. Varoufakis told me, “It worked out fabulously. They called me a Russian mafioso, right?” On this visit, Lord Lamont, the British Conservative politician, who had sent Varoufakis many supportive messages (to the point where Varoufakis regarded him as “my best mate”), took him to a club on Pall Mall for breakfast. As Lamont explained to the Financial Times, “they wouldn’t accept that his national dress was not a tie.”","2412","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis told me in April that Osborne agreed with him on “everything.” Varoufakis’s habit was to believe—or claim to believe—that what a politician said kindly over lunch was more sincere than what he broadcast in public. (A spokesman for the British Treasury declined to comment on Osborne’s conversations.) Varoufakis told me that he and Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, talked “like brothers when we’re alone.” He added, “He’s saying, ‘We’ll change Europe together!’ Then we go out—press conference, microphones, and cameras—and he says, ‘Greece must try harder, must accept the conditions.’ ” Varoufakis said that, when he challenged Sapin about this, the mournful reply was “Yanis, France is not what it used to be”—that is, its power had diminished. A spokesperson for Sapin denied this account, adding that Varoufakis “is an intelligent and flamboyant man, but lacks political sense.”","2413","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Ten days after the election, Varoufakis attended his first Eurogroup meeting. “People think it’s like a courtroom drama,” Varoufakis said. “It is not. It is just grindingly boring.”","2414","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"The Eurogroup meets in private, each of the nineteen ministers sitting with a single colleague. At the meetings that Varoufakis attended, the creditor institutions were also represented. After a few opening remarks, the ministers spoke in turn. Schäuble dominated the room. “All eyes are on him, and what he’s going to say, and the tone in which he’s going to say it,” Varoufakis recalled. Then the attendees attempted to agree on a communiqué. At this point, “all hell would break loose,” Varoufakis said. When he found a draft unacceptable, he raised his hand: “Jeroen, this sentence I can’t live with. I need to add this adjective here and remove that verb there.” Schäuble often objected to Varoufakis’s suggestions. “This can go on for six hours,” Varoufakis said.","2415","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Breaking with tradition, Varoufakis’s ministry later made public his opening remarks at his first Eurogroup session. Varoufakis said, “We must earn your trust without losing the trust of our people—of the voters amongst which we enjoy, for now, sizable approval ratings. For such approval is an important capital good in Europe’s struggle to sort Greece out and to render it stable.” He went on, “It will simply not be possible for our country to grow if we remain on the growth-sapping austerity path.”","2416","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis recalled that Schäuble seemed “very cross,” and said, “When there’s a program that everybody has agreed to, that’s it. Elections cannot change anything, because, then, every time there’s an election everything will change.” (A spokesperson for the German finance ministry said, “Meetings of Eurogroup finance ministers are confidential.”) As Varoufakis put it to me, the idea that elections could change nothing was the “greatest gift one could give to the Chinese Communist Party.” That’s overheated, of course, and democratic governments tend to respect the binding agreements signed by their predecessors. But it was interesting, at Brookings, to hear Schäuble say that “France would be happy if someone could force” its parliament to pass unpopular labor-market reforms. It wasn’t quite clear what Schäuble meant by “France,” if it was neither its people nor its parliament.","2417","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"During that first meeting, Varoufakis said, he was asked to approve a communiqué that pretended “nothing had changed.” He asked to edit “the program” to “the amended program.” Recalling this request, Varoufakis described it as “very conciliatory,” although it might be more accurate to say that it was not.","2418","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Schäuble vetoed the edit. Varoufakis said, “I veto that veto.” During a break in the subsequent discussion, Dijsselbloem told Varoufakis that the opportunity to meet the deadline of February 28th—more than two weeks away—would expire the next morning, because of the time required by some countries to secure parliamentary approval of a renewal. If Varoufakis didn’t sign? Dijsselbloem said, “Then you’ve missed the train”—in other words, the loan agreement would be cancelled.","2419","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis called Tsipras in Athens. “He said, ‘Don’t sign it. Fuck him.’ No, he didn’t say that, but that’s more or less what he meant. And so I said, ‘No deal.’ ”","2420","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"The next morning, Dijsselbloem came to Varoufakis’s hotel to talk. Given that the deadline had passed, Varoufakis decided that Dijsselbloem had been “bullshitting” him, and asked, facetiously, if the train had reversed into the station. Varoufakis told me, “He had lied to a minister, when he was serving as president, on that minister’s first rookie appearance! His duty is to keep members of the Eurogroup informed about the legal process, and he lied to me about that. That’s just unacceptable.”","2421","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"On February 20th, the Eurogroup reached a temporary agreement. Greece gained an extension until June 30th, before which it could propose revisions to the program. For the moment, Syriza agreed not to pursue its key spending plans. Though Varoufakis chose to see the agreement as an opportunity “to write our own program and to be judged on that,” others saw it as Syriza in retreat. The government had shelved its campaign commitments while gaining no guarantee of revisions, and had failed to collect €7.2 billion. “The Greek government will certainly have difficulty explaining this to its voters,” Schäuble said to reporters.","2422","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis told me that, immediately after he signed the communiqué, “the troika was knocking on our door,” as if nothing had changed. “We had to say, ‘No, this is not what we signed up for.’ ” He later regretted not making his frustration more public. “I should have impressed upon the Prime Minister that we had to blast this one out of the water—condemn them for backtracking.”","2423","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"In April, as Varoufakis flew back from Washington, Greece was being assailed for not having yet submitted a comprehensive revised program. “We could have moved faster,” Varoufakis acknowledged. “Then again, the other side was really not moving at all.” The other side may not have recognized any obligation to move. To them, Varoufakis was a student late with an assignment unlikely to impress.","2424","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"He quoted a line sometimes attributed to Henry Kissinger: “Who do I call if I want to speak to Europe?” He was struggling to deal with governments and institutions that were “fragmented, both horizontally and vertically.” He explained, “Horizontally, Merkel and Schäuble don’t see eye to eye. They have different ideas of what they want from us. He wants us out of the eurozone. Merkel doesn’t.” (The spokesperson for the German finance ministry said, “Mr. Schäuble and Chancellor Angela Merkel always act in a coördinated manner.”) Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish Prime Minister, wanted Syriza out of power; François Hollande, the French President, didn’t. Varoufakis offered me an example of “vertical fragmentation”: he believed that Lagarde, the I.M.F. managing director, “doesn’t want us out, and would like to bridge an accommodation, but the little people that she sends in the troika—these people have an agenda of their own.” He went on, “I spend all my life these days on the phone, trying to avert these fragmentation problems, coördination failures, little agendas. We don’t even get to talk about important things. I’ve been saying to all these people, ‘Can we agree on four major reform bills and rush them through parliament?’ ” He had argued that interim reforms—however incomplete in the eyes of the troika—would release “a wave of optimism” among potential investors in Greece.","2425","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"But, Varoufakis said, he’d found no market in Europe for such thoughts. At the level of the Eurogroup, Varoufakis told me, the conversation was “all about the rules.” It was not a forum in which to discuss debt unsustainability, or the rarity of economic growth under austerity conditions. Varoufakis told me that he was “accused of talking about economics.” Once, Varoufakis was asked what Greece’s target surplus should be, if not 4.5 per cent of G.D.P. He “had to give a lecture” about the variables that made the question unanswerable in that form. “They’re not economists,” Varoufakis said. “Most of them are lawyers.”","2426","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis, in his negotiations, adopted a refrain: “You may not like us, but we have a few things going for us. First, we’re not corrupt yet. Second, we’re pro-European. Third, we are democrats. We want this country to be reformed. Help us do it. Don’t crash us. If you crash us, we will end up with very nasty people taking over.”","2427","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"According to a Eurogroup official, Varoufakis “didn’t seem to understand that the other people in the room were constrained by their national parliaments. They are bound by certain treaties. Those constraints fly in the face of pure economics. The eurozone is complicated, and he had no understanding or sympathy for that.”","2428","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Meanwhile, at lower-level “technical” meetings, representatives of Greece’s creditors pressed Varoufakis’s colleagues about “the granular stuff”: about modernizing the milk market, for example, or allowing notaries to compete on price. Greece’s program was built out of such policy details; Varoufakis felt that the ideas were often “anti-growth rubbish,” and that the process was pointless if it ignored economic fundamentals in a way that could only prolong a five-year dynamic of “extend and pretend.” He recalled trying to introduce a document that contained the words “debt restructuring.” He was told, “If it has those words, we can’t have it. Take it back.”","2429","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"According to troika officials, Greek negotiators barely engaged at the technical level. Initially, this appeared to reflect only incompetence, but later there seemed to be some strategy in it—an effort to force the conversation into the political realm. In the end, Greece’s milk market was discussed, in the middle of the night, by Europe’s heads of state.","2430","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"In the opinion of one troika official, Varoufakis’s disregard for the granular—like the ease with which he requested other European taxpayers to settle Greece’s account—had an undemocratic air. “One may dismiss this as technocrats looking at numbers,” the official said. “But, if something doesn’t add up and there is a gap, the gap has to be financed by somebody.” He went on, “Adding up is the essence of democracy.”","2431","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"When Greece did engage, I was told by another representative of a troika institution, “the stuff they sent us was extraordinarily naïve.” He recalled a measure, submitted by Varoufakis in March, designed to boost sales-tax compliance by hiring amateur spies: people, including tourists, would be trained to wear hidden cameras. The troika representative said, “It was stunning to see something like this in a document of a minister of an E.U. country.”","2432","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"A few days before the referendum, Gikas Hardouvelis, a senior Greek economist who was Varoufakis’s predecessor as minister of finance, sat at a café in a northern suburb of Athens, speaking with the tight-mouthed fury of someone who can no longer maintain his public discretion. That week, on successive nights, large crowds had gathered at Syntagma Square, in support of “no” (the working class) and “yes” (the middle and upper-middle classes). Across Athens, posters showed Schäuble in scowling closeup, with the text “For five years he has drunk your blood. Tell him, ‘No!’ ” When I asked an Athens bar owner how he might vote, he asked me to describe the difference between a Winchester and a Magnum. Hardouvelis, a “yes” voter, said, “Only Third World dictatorships have referendums like this, fooling the people and pretending to be a democracy.”","2433","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"On the day after the January election, before Varoufakis had been sworn in, Hardouvelis represented Greece at a Eurogroup meeting in Brussels. He told the attendees, “Remember one thing. Eighty per cent of the Greek people say they want to be members of the euro area.” In his view, “The Europeans were willing to be flexible, because they knew they had to deal with a leftist government. They were willing to give them something—on the primary surplus for 2016, perhaps.”","2434","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Hardouvelis said that Varoufakis had squandered this opportunity: “He managed to have eighteen enemies. That’s all he did!” He described Tsipras as “a guy who has never been outside Greece, has never had to deal with foreigners, so he couldn’t automatically enter the logic of the other side.” Tsipras, whose command of English is tentative, depended on Varoufakis. By the time Tsipras had reduced that dependency, Greece was nearing disaster. “I blame Varoufakis,” Hardouvelis said. “He did a huge disservice to Tsipras, because he knew very well what was going on, and he acted only to promote himself, sacrificing the country and his Prime Minister in the meantime.” This was a common theme in Athens, although it was possible to imagine the argument turned on its head: that is, an adept politician had taken advantage of an unwary but overconfident intellectual. Hasta la victoria siempre!","2435","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Some of Hardouvelis’s colleagues had recently told him that University of Sydney academics had expressed relief about Varoufakis leaving Australia, calling him “the most narcissistic man they’d ever met in their lives.” Hardouvelis noted that, in the government office that was once his own, Varoufakis was “too proud” to use the ministerial desk or the office phones. (Varoufakis worked, with a MacBook and a cell phone, at one end of a long conference table.)","2436","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Two days before the Sunday referendum, Varoufakis arrived at the ministry at midday. A hundred reporters were outside in the street. We sat at his conference table, and he described the events of the previous week—and his disagreements with Tsipras—in a way that suggested he didn’t plan to remain in office beyond the weekend. He began by saying that, in April, senior U.S. officials had warned him that Greece’s creditors “want to throw you onto the rocks.” On hearing this, Varoufakis had sought to change Greece’s negotiating stance. He began making the case to colleagues for publishing a Greek Plan, on Greece’s terms. With Jeffrey Sachs and others, he wrote a draft in three parts: a fiscal plan, proposals for debt relief, and suggestions for structural reforms.","2437","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis recalled, “I took it to the P.M., to the negotiating team, and said, ‘I think we should go this way. If you don’t like it, we can make amendments.’ ” A public plan would have been perceived, accurately, as a scornful rejection of the existing negotiations. Tsipras turned down the idea as too risky. (As someone close to the negotiations pointed out to me, one risk was that the plan’s primary author would have been evident—that is, it would be the Varoufakis Plan.)","2438","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"The consensus on the Greek team was that an agreement could be reached only through the established process. Varoufakis objected: “If we don’t manage to change the structure of the negotiation, then we will never get the agreement.” If his confidence in this strategy now seems foolhardy, it rested on what he regarded as a bedrock of logic. “An unpayable debt will not be paid,” he told me. “It’s like the law of gravity.” His goal was to persuade Greece’s creditors to concede this truth now—not years from now.","2439","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"At a meeting in Riga, Latvia, in late April, the Eurogroup’s tone toward Greece was sharply critical. One unnamed source told a reporter that Varoufakis was considered a time-waster, a gambler, and an amateur. In a tweet, Varoufakis quoted F.D.R.: “They are unanimous in their hate for me; and I welcome their hatred.”","2440","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Tsipras, unsettled by the animosity in Riga, and recognizing Varoufakis’s low opinion of the day-to-day negotiations, reshuffled his team. Varoufakis lost direct oversight of the technical talks.","2441","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"One evening in May, Varoufakis learned that, two days earlier, Tsipras had made a concession about the primary surplus that Varoufakis regarded as economically and tactically disastrous. “And the Prime Minister, being such a convivial guy, said, ‘Of course I didn’t tell you, because I knew you would disagree!’ ” Varoufakis recalled. “Which, you know, for a finance minister is a bit of a problem.”","2442","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"The creditors had been pressing for an eventual primary-surplus target of 4.5 per cent of G.D.P. Tsipras, guided by other colleagues, proposed surplus targets that, starting at one per cent, would rise to 3.5 per cent in 2018. Such a figure was still “absurd,” Varoufakis told me. “No economy in Greece’s situation sustainably produces a primary surplus of 3.5 per cent.” Varoufakis asked me to picture someone considering investing, next year, in a new enterprise in Greece. He or she might hope for profits two years later. But “if the Greek state’s debt is unsustainable in 2018, and the government has committed to a 3.5-per-cent primary surplus, what you are telling the investor is ‘You’re going to be taxed through the nose, because the state needs to have this primary surplus.’ No financially minded investor will invest in a country that makes this announcement.”","2443","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"He went on, “Tsipras gave them austerity hoping that he would secure debt relief.” In Varoufakis’s view, Tsipras “just didn’t understand,” adding, “For non-economists, it’s easy to say, ‘I had two targets, austerity and debt. It would be good to hit both of them, but if I can hit one of them—’ ” He paused. “The politician must compromise.” Varoufakis remained adamant that austerity and debt needed to be addressed simultaneously. Tsipras, meanwhile, had made a concession on the surplus that only weakened the case for debt relief. It’s hard to protest loan repayments while one is officially predicting a budget in the black. “Then they know they can take you to the cleaners,” Varoufakis said. “And then they will demand everything on everything. Which is what happened.” As he put it, sharks are not placated by a little blood.","2444","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"He considered resigning. “But I happened to be quite popular,” he said. “And if I went I’d damage Alexis badly, in the middle of negotiations.” (Tsipras had privately used the precarious metaphor of two standing dominoes.) For a month, as the June 30th deadline approached, and as Greece made further concessions, Varoufakis maintained hope that the I.M.F. might strengthen Greece’s hand by describing the country’s debt as unsustainable. The I.M.F. has a constitutional obligation to avoid making loans in which wishful thinking informs the repayment schedule. (Such an objection was made, belatedly, on July 14th.)","2445","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis felt unsupported. Although Tsipras seemed to share his urgency about debt relief, Varoufakis said, there were “comrades who were saying, ‘Look, even that doesn’t matter. Let’s just have an agreement.’ Fatigue sets in after a while.”","2446","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"At a Eurogroup meeting in Brussels, on June 25th, Varoufakis was invited to sign a deal that offered five months of limited further funding. The provisions included all of Greece’s concessions and no debt relief. Varoufakis regarded it as “the kind of offer you make when you don’t want an agreement.”","2447","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Tsipras was furious. “He’d had to tread on every red line this government had drawn,” Varoufakis said. According to Varoufakis, Dijsselbloem said, “Yanis, you can consider this a take-it-or-leave-it offer.” (Dijsselbloem has disputed this.)","2448","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis believes that the Eurogroup, having decided that Syriza “is a government we don’t want,” deliberately prolonged negotiations, in order to weaken Greece’s economy. In June, Varoufakis told Pierre Moscovici, the economic-policy commissioner for the E.U., that “Schäuble wants us out of the euro.” (Schäuble had told Varoufakis this himself.) “But he doesn’t care whether our government falls or not. And I feel that Merkel wants us in the euro, but she wants our government to fall.” According to Varoufakis, Moscovici concurred with this analysis. Schäuble’s domestic popularity, and his seniority, had given him the freedom to adopt a position toward Greece that is at odds with Merkel’s. Der Spiegel recently described Germany’s resulting approach as “a curious mix of indecision and brutality.”","2449","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"At the June 25th meeting, Varoufakis said, Schäuble announced that the deal was too soft on the Greeks for it to pass through the Bundestag. “Of course, when Schäuble speaks, the Lithuanians, the Slovaks, the Finns go along with him. They say, ‘We can’t push it through our parliaments!’ ” According to Varoufakis, “Dijsselbloem seemed quite perturbed. He wanted to pressure me to accept it. I said, ‘Wolfgang cannot push it through his parliament—why can I?’ ”","2450","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"The next morning, Tsipras brought the members of the Greek team together at a Brussels hotel, asking them to leave their cell phones outside the room. He said that he was calling a referendum of “yes” or “no” to the terms offered by the Eurogroup. The Eurogroup met once more, the next day. “That was very unpleasant, because I had to defend the principles of democracy to a group that doesn’t care very much about democracy,” Varoufakis said. “Actually, they are positively against it. I was told, in no uncertain terms, ‘How dare you put such complex issues in front of an electorate ?’ ” He requested a four-week program extension, arguing that “the Greek people should be able to deliberate on this in some peace and quiet.” The Eurogroup refused him.","2451","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"I asked Varoufakis about the sight of elderly Greeks struggling to collect social-security payments, and of lines at A.T.M.s. “We didn’t close down the banks,” he said. “The Eurogroup did. I can’t take moral responsibility for something that they did.” He went on, “There are times when you say, ‘To hell with it, I’m not going to sign something I disagree with. And stuff the consequences!’ I’m not a consequentialist.”","2452","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"I saw him at the end of the day, at the ministry. Outside, there had been a skirmish between riot police and anarchists; there was a slight sting of tear gas in Syntagma Square. The ministry had lowered a metal shutter over its glass front door. Varoufakis was standing in the lobby, quite still, shoulders set back, his motorcycle helmet looped over one arm. “The economic arguments have disappeared from the scene,” he said. Schäuble had by then spoken publicly about a Grexit. If the moment was alarming, it was also clarifying. “Now it’s ‘We’ll crash them, even if it means crashing ourselves.’ Like at the beginning of the First World War.” The metal shutter rattled upward and, on the other side of the glass, a bank of television cameras was revealed.","2453","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis was at home as the referendum results came in, two evenings later. On the TV news, maps of Greece were entirely colored in the orange of “no.”","2454","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"By the day of the referendum, the question on the ballots referred to a negotiation that had concluded. The bailout program had lapsed, and the offered terms were no longer on offer. The referendum had become an obscure gauge of national mood and self-image. Sixty-one per cent voted “no,” in support of Syriza’s line. But Greece’s banks were closed, and a Grexit now seemed imminent.","2455","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"On the night of the referendum result, Varoufakis met with Tsipras and said, “Reactivate me fully or replace me.” Tsipras offered him the Ministry of Economy, Infrastructure, Shipping and Tourism. Varoufakis declined. He resigned the next morning.","2456","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"On July 8th, after consultations with other Greek leaders, Tsipras proposed a new, three-year bailout, with fresh austerity measures. The Eurogroup responded with a proposal more severe and humiliating than anything discussed in previous months. On July 12th, Tsipras, having met with European leaders for seventeen hours, agreed to recommend the terms to his parliament. He had secured only minor modifications, and only a hint of future debt relief. Greece agreed to place fifty billion euros’ worth of state assets in a privatization trust fund; troika officials would be embedded, again, in ministries in Athens. “Read and weep,” Varoufakis wrote on his blog.","2457","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Before the deal could be signed, Greece was obliged to introduce reform legislation. On July 15th, the parliament met to discuss a first batch of measures, including pension cuts and sales-tax increases, which would immediately raise the price of hundreds of goods and services, from fertilizer to funerals.","2458","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"That night, Molotov cocktails were thrown in Syntagma Square; in a television interview, Tsipras made a baldly consequentialist case. He accepted responsibility for “signing a text that I do not believe in but that I am obliged to implement.” He continued, “The worst thing a captain could do while he is steering a ship during a storm, as difficult as it is, is to abandon the helm.” Referring to Varoufakis, he said, “Being an excellent academic doesn’t necessarily make one a good politician.”","2459","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis remained a member of parliament, and he was one of thirty-two Syriza members, out of a hundred and forty-nine, who voted “no” that night. He was regularly updating his blog and addressing his six hundred thousand Twitter followers. (Tsipras has half as many.) “I’m here to stay,” Varoufakis told an Italian reporter. In a radio interview, he said that Tsipras “didn’t have what it took sentimentally, emotionally, at that moment, to carry that ‘no’ vote to Europe—and use it as a weapon.”","2460","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"A few days later, comments that Tsipras had made to advisers were leaked to the press. He said that he had “read heroic statements,” but had “heard no alternatives to the blackmailing ultimatum of July 12th.” He asked if his leftist opponents had a plan that would look any different from Wolfgang Schäuble’s.","2461","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"When a second batch of legislation reached parliament, on July 22nd, Varoufakis voted “yes.” If he had been edging toward a sustained public challenge to Tsipras, this was a change of course. When I spoke to him on the phone the next day, he said that in the hours before the debate he’d vacillated between “yes” and an abstention. The bailout was not viable, he said: “It was a coup d’état.” Had he still been minister, he would have taken the mandate of the referendum and dared the Eurogroup: “Do it, just do it!” But he had decided to be led, he said, by a sense of solidarity with Tsipras and Syriza. He then listed various details of the legislation—omissions and inclusions—that had given him just enough permission to vote “yes.” As he described his path to compromise, I seemed to be hearing a politician becoming comfortable with the discomfort of politics.","2462","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"I had last seen Varoufakis at his ministry office, on the morning of his resignation. There was the sound of a shredder humming. In a conference room, he thanked his staff, and discussed the fact that his friend Euclid Tsakalotos had been invited to replace him. Varoufakis returned to his office, in high spirits, and started boxing up books. He observed that his resignation had pushed up the value of the euro. “I am a paragon of stability,” he said. He looked at his phone. “Now I can delete Wolfgang Schäuble’s cell number.” A colleague suggested that he save it, for prank calls.","2463","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"Varoufakis then said that he would miss his prime opponent. He liked Schäuble, “on a personal level.” Varoufakis went on, “He has a vision. It’s a wrong vision, but he’s very lucid about it. He’s a man of principle. And I like conviction politicians.” ♦","2464","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior"
"The Civilians, a Brooklyn-based theatre company, is nearing the end of a yearlong stint as artist-in-residence at the Metropolitan Museum. The term “residence” is only loosely applicable to the Civilians’ status within the institution’s walls. “We don’t have an office space,” Micharne Cloughley, a head writer with the company, explained the other day. “I spend a lot of time in the cafeteria.”","2465","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/art-census"
"Recently, Cloughley and her colleagues could be seen roving the galleries of the American Wing, researching the production that is to serve as the culmination of their residency: an ambitious investigation of what it means to be an American, titled “The Way They Live.” The Civilians specialize in “investigative theatre”—interviewing people, then compiling a play out of their words. Curators in the department have been among their interview subjects, helping to identify a dozen works that will spark reactions. Next, Cloughley and her team expanded their investigations to include the galleries’ visitors: likely interview subjects are selected on the spot, with a view to getting a broad range of ages, nationalities, and ethnicities. People listening to the Met’s audio tour on headphones are left unmolested.","2466","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/art-census"
"“Often, we are here in the morning, so then it’s literally everyone,” Cloughley said, as she walked through the galleries with a clipboard in her hand and a researcher, Tommy O’Malley, at her side. First target: a teen in bluejeans and a pink sweater who was hovering by the wall plaque for “Washington Crossing the Delaware.” She turned out to be Birgitta Gerlach, a high-school student visiting from Portland, Oregon, and told Cloughley and O’Malley that she recognized the painting. “It’s just an image you would know,” she said, though she allowed that it was much larger than her history textbook had led her to believe. She did not imagine that it was an accurate representation of events—Washington’s stance was “regal,” but not necessarily how one would position oneself in a smallish boat on a biggish river. “It’s pretty grandiose,” she said of the painting. “I’ve never learned about the British perspective on this event. There’s probably more to this than you can see.”","2467","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/art-census"
"Cloughley looked delighted. “We’ve never had anyone say that before!” she said.","2468","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/art-census"
"Next up: Reeta Parks, a teacher-librarian from Nashville, who was gazing wonderingly at Winslow Homer’s “The Veteran in a New Field,” in which a solitary Union soldier scythes a field of corn. Parks explained that she had grown up in Kentucky, in an extended family of farmers. “There were men getting out there and working very hard, and making the land work for them,” she said. Several of her male relatives had fought in the Second World War. “Three came back, and one of them was drastically changed,” she said. “They all worked the land. That was his solace. That was his comfort.” Parks’ s eyes grew moist. “I am getting emotional,” she said.","2469","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/art-census"
"“That is what good art does,” O’Malley said, encouragingly.","2470","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/art-census"
"In the Civil War gallery, Cloughley and O’Malley persuaded a skeptical-looking college student named Helen Bass to share her reactions to the painting that gives the Civilians’ show its name, Thomas Anshutz’s image of an African-American woman tending to a vegetable garden. Bass pointed to the woman’s red head scarf, and the red blossoms in the background. “Red means danger, psychologically,” she said. “There is a bunch of red. It could look like blood. There has to be some symbolic reason for it.” Bass found the image disturbing. “I appreciate old American relics like this, but it upsets me,” she said. “It’s just, like, a bad part of humanity that happened once.”","2471","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/art-census"
"Last stop: “Black Jesus,” a work by Bill Traylor, a self-taught artist who was born into slavery in 1853, became a sharecropper, and started painting at the age of eighty-five. For Cloughley and O’Malley, finding a suitable interlocutor was something of a challenge. Not the older couple, who turned them down with polite smiles; not the young man charging purposefully through the gallery, studying the museum’s floorplan on his iPad.","2472","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/art-census"
"Eventually, the Civilians benignly corralled a mother and daughter from Midland, Texas, Tracy Pierce and Chelsey Smith, in another gallery, and led them to Traylor’s work. “I don’t know if I see Jesus,” Pierce said, musingly. “It could be a self-portrait. Maybe he’s feeling crucified.” Smith said that she had recently moved to Virginia, where she works in a research lab. “It is interesting to see more diversity,” she said. “I am the only person born in America in my office. It’s pretty cool. You get different viewpoints. The more people you know, the more you grow.” Cloughley and O’Malley nodded with approval. Their work was done for the day.

"On August 11th, Hillary Clinton met privately with five Black Lives Matter activists in Keene, New Hampshire. The activists had arrived at Clinton’s campaign stop shortly before it was to begin, but they were not allowed to enter because the room was filled to capacity. So the campaign reached out to the activists and arranged a time for a meeting after the event. Last week, video of the sixteen-minute, behind-closed-doors conversation was released. Clinton appeared measured and tense at times, holding her hands tightly in front of her. She listened carefully to the activists and gave thoughtful, unscripted, and sometimes impassioned answers to questions about her past support for policies that have harmed communities of color.","August 27, 2015","2474","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"One activist, Daunasia Yancey, pressed Clinton on her role in creating a system that continues to be unfairly punitive to African-Americans. Black Lives Matter activists have good reason to scrutinize Clinton’s previous endorsement of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, signed by President Bill Clinton. The U.S. prison system became the largest in the world during the Clinton Administration, with more people in prison or jail than ever before in American history. It was her husband’s bill, but, as First Lady, Hillary Clinton lobbied for its passage. Speaking at the annual conference of the National Center for Women and Policing, in 1994, for example, she said, “We need more police; we need more and tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders.”","2475","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"During the backstage meeting after her campaign event, Clinton made an honest, candid effort to explain to the activists that the crime bill—one of the most comprehensive pieces of criminal-justice legislation in U.S. history—was a sincere attempt to address a particular set of problems that emerged during the nineteen-eighties and nineties. At three hundred and fifty-six pages, the bill included provisions that aimed to protect vulnerable populations and reduce crime, such as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, the establishment of registries for sex offenders, the Violence Against Women Act, and penalty enhancements for hate crimes.","2476","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"Returning to the subject of the Clintons’ role in creating the current mass-incarceration problem, another activist, Julius Jones, posed a pointed and personal question: “I genuinely want to know…you and your family have been in no uncertain way partially responsible…. Now that you understand the consequences, what in your heart has changed that’s going to change the direction of this country? How do you actually feel that is different than how you felt before?”","2477","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"A month ago, Bill Clinton expressed remorse for the repercussions of the bill, admitting at an N.A.A.C.P. convention that the crime bill “made the problem worse.” But if the Black Lives Matter activists expected contrition or a telling anecdote from Hillary Clinton, they must have been disappointed.","2478","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"“I don’t believe you change hearts,” she said. Then, tempering her initial comment, she continued, “You may actually change some hearts. But, if that’s all that happens, we’ll be back here in ten years having the same conversation.”","2479","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"At this moment, the respectful, cordial tenor of the meeting took a noticeably different and more contentious tone. Clinton seemed irked, and there was a testy exchange about whose responsibility it is to effect social change. The Black Lives Matter activists looked for her to show some heartfelt introspection about her role in spawning our current “era of mass incarceration.” Clinton was unyielding: social change comes about when laws, not hearts, change.","2480","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"History tells us a different story about the larger question of social change. Hearts change all the time, and when hearts change, policy changes often follow. Not all hearts change, and not at an even or steady pace. Change comes in fits and starts, but our past suggests that our hearts are constantly evolving. The abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison used fiery and fervid lectures to change the hearts of his pro-slavery detractors, and reformers including Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, and many other ex-slaves penned autobiographies to change the hearts of Northern readers by enabling them to catch sight of the unspeakable horrors endured by enslaved people. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” published in 1852, sold three hundred thousand copies in its first year. “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” made its readers acutely aware of the brutal violence, the painful family separations, and the inhumane buying and selling of children that were all commonplace under the slave regime.","2481","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"By 1960, almost ninety per cent of households had televisions, which brought racial injustice, police brutality, and violent clashes between civil-rights activists and white Southern segregationists in Selma, Montgomery, and Birmingham into American living rooms. Civil-rights protests changed hearts and inspired many Americans—black and white—to join the movement. Approximately fifty thousand young people became part of the movement in 1960, when sit-ins and other protests swept through sixty-five cities in twelve Southern states.","2482","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"As Clinton noted, we are witnessing, in our own moment, a clear and resonant declaration that hearts have changed as more Americans accept same-sex marriage. According to a June, 2015, Pew Research Center report, support for same-sex marriage is currently at a record high: fifty-seven per cent of Americans support it—the highest rate in twenty years of polling—while, just five years ago, fewer Americans supported (forty-two per cent) than opposed it (forty-eight per cent).","2483","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"At the core of the Black Lives Matter movement is an urgent and vehement cry for hearts to change. It is a call for Americans to look at images of police brutality—including the recent footage of the fatal shooting of Samuel DuBose, who was pulled over for missing a front license plate and shot in the head at point-blank range—and not only see violence but feel as though that senseless violence could happen to their sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, husbands, wives, or friends.","2484","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"Hope and change are common foundational themes in Presidential campaigns, regardless of political party, from Ronald Reagan’s “It’s Morning Again in America,” in 1984, to Bill Clinton’s “I Still Believe in a Place Called Hope,” in 1992, to Barack Obama’s “Yes We Can,” in 2008.","2485","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"Hillary hit her own most hopeful notes in her last speech as a Presidential candidate during the 2008 primary. In her concession, Hillary’s message soared: “Although we weren’t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it’s got about eighteen million cracks in it. And the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time.”","2486","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"

"In her diary, Godelieva De Troyer classified her moods by color. She felt “dark gray” when she made a mistake while sewing or cooking. When her boyfriend talked too much, she moved between “very black” and “black!” She was afflicted with the worst kind of “black spot” when she visited her parents at their farm in northern Belgium. In their presence, she felt aggressive and dangerous. She worried that she had two selves, one “empathetic, charming, sensible” and the other cruel.","2488","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"She felt “light gray” when she went to the hairdresser or rode her bicycle through the woods in Hasselt, a small city in the Flemish region of Belgium, where she lived. At these moments, she wrote, she tried to remind herself of all the things she could do to feel happy: “demand respect from others”; “be physically attractive”; “take a reserved stance”; “live in harmony with nature.” She imagined a life in which she was intellectually appreciated, socially engaged, fluent in English (she was taking a class), and had a “cleaning lady with whom I get along very well.”","2489","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Godelieva, who taught anatomy to nurses, had been in therapy since she was nineteen. With each new doctor, she embraced the therapeutic process anew, adopting her doctor’s philosophy and rewriting her life story so that it fit his theory of the mind. She continually dissected the source of her distress. “I am confronted almost daily with the consequences of my childhood,” she wrote to her mother. She’d wanted to be a historian, but her father, domineering and cold, had pressured her to be a doctor. Her mother, who was unhappy in her marriage, reminded her of a “slave.” “New insight,” she wrote in her diary. “Do not want to always nod yes like her and be self-effacing.”","2490","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Godelieva was preoccupied with the idea that she would replicate her parents’ mistakes with her own children. She married when she was twenty-three, and had two children. But the marriage was tumultuous and ended in divorce, in 1979, when her son was three and her daughter was seven. Two years later, their father, Hendrik Mortier, a radiologist, committed suicide. As a single parent, Godelieva was overwhelmed. In a diary entry from 1990, when her children were teen-agers, she instructed herself to “let my children be themselves, respect them in their individuality.” But she found herself fighting with her daughter, who was independent and emotionally distant, and depending on her son, Tom, a “victim of my instability,” she wrote. She worried, she told her psychologist, that her children were “now paying for all that has happened generations earlier.”","2491","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"The happiest time in Godelieva’s life began when she was in her early fifties and had a new boyfriend. She felt as if she had finally moved beyond the dramas of her childhood, an achievement for which she credited her new psychiatrist. “He opens the wound completely, cleans it thoroughly and closes it so it can heal,” she wrote to a friend. Godelieva, who had blond hair and a wistful smile, made many friends during these years. “She was the most beautiful woman,” Tom told me. “People would say to me, ‘Oh, I could fall in love with your mother.’ ” Christiane Geuens, a close friend, said, “People always wanted to know her. When she walked into a room, everyone knew.”","2492","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Godelieva was delighted when Tom and his wife had a child, in 2005. She promised that she would make up for her failures as a mother by being an attentive grandmother. In photographs, she is physically affectionate with Tom’s daughter, holding her as she brushes her teeth, or sitting on the bed with her, braiding her hair.","2493","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Then, in 2010, her boyfriend broke up with her, and she felt black again. She stopped wearing makeup and doing her hair, and she cancelled dates with friends, she said, because she felt ugly and old. She felt that she had lost her levensperspectief, a Dutch word that refers to the sense that there is something to live for. Tom was only thirty minutes away, but she no longer had the energy to drive to his house. She accused Tom of being insufficiently sympathetic, and Tom, who had just had a second child, blamed her for abandoning him and his family. After several months of fights, they stopped speaking. In her diary, she wrote, “I don’t think there can be fruitful contact with the children with all his aggression toward me.” Tom’s sister, a lawyer who does human-rights work in Africa, also avoided her; she found it too painful to be sucked back into her mother’s depression, which had dominated her childhood. (She has asked not to be named.)","2494","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Godelieva felt as if her emotional progress had been an illusion. She had seen the same psychiatrist for more than ten years and had consulted him on every decision, even those involving financial investments and home renovations, but she had now lost faith in his judgment. She complained to friends, “I give him ninety euros, he gives me a prescription, and after ten minutes it’s over.” Her psychiatrist acknowledged that there was no cure for her condition; the best he could do, he said, was listen to her and prescribe antidepressants, as he had been doing for years.","2495","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"In the summer of 2011, when she was sixty-three, Godelieva met a new doctor. She attended a lecture by Wim Distelmans, an oncologist and a professor of palliative medicine at the Free University of Brussels. Distelmans was one of the leading proponents of a 2002 law in Belgium that permits euthanasia for patients who have an incurable illness that causes them unbearable physical or mental suffering. Since then, he has euthanized more than a hundred patients. Distelmans, who wears leather coats and boots and artfully tossed scarves, has become a celebrity in Belgium for promoting a dignified death as a human right, a “tremendous liberation,” and he gives talks at cultural centers, hospitals, and schools around the country.","2496","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"In September, 2011, Godelieva saw Distelmans at his clinic. Four months later, she sent an e-mail to her children: “I have filed a euthanasia request with Prof. Distelmans based on psychological distress. I have gone through the entire procedure and am now waiting for the result.”","2497","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Tom and his wife had just had their third child. They both taught chemistry at Leuven University College, part of the oldest university in Belgium. When Tom received his mother’s e-mail, he showed it to his supervisor, Lies Verdonck, a doctor who was familiar with Distelmans’s work, and asked her what to do. She said there was no way that Distelmans would approve the euthanasia request without first speaking with the patient’s family. “Stay focussed on your job and your children,” she urged Tom.","2498","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"At the time, Tom was in the process of searching for a nursing home for Godelieva’s mother, from whom Godelieva was estranged. He was angry that the task had fallen to him, and felt that his mother was being manipulative. She had expressed suicidal thoughts before, and they’d passed, so he decided not to respond to the e-mail. His sister, who was in Africa, replied that she would respect her mother’s decision, but that it hurt her.","2499","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"On April 20, 2012, three months after Godelieva sent the e-mail, Tom received a short letter from his mother that was written in the past tense. She reported that her euthanasia had been carried out on April 19th, at the university hospital of the Free University of Brussels. “I donated my body to science,” she wrote. On the back of the letter, she’d left the phone number of a friend who had the keys to her house.","2500","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Tom immediately drove to the house of the friend, who offered him a drink and then explained that she and her husband had driven Godelieva to the hospital. Tom accused the couple of coöperating with a suicide. They were defensive: they said that it was Godelieva’s choice, and they didn’t want her to have to take a taxi to the hospital alone. Later, they admitted to Tom that in the car Godelieva was chatting and laughing, and they had begun to wonder if they knew her as well as they’d thought.","2501","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Tom felt his mind shutting down. He drove to his mother’s house, which he hadn’t visited in more than a year. She had just completed an addition to the first floor: before they separated, she and her ex-boyfriend had wanted to grow old in the house without worrying about stairs. The interior of the house was decorated with framed photographs of her grandchildren. Large drawings of Tom and his sister hung on the living-room wall.","2502","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"In the drawer of Godelieva’s bedroom desk, Tom found drafts of several farewell letters that she had written to friends, her neighborhood association, and a chorus that she sang in, as well as a master list with an “X” by each name, as if she were composing thank-you notes after a party. She thanked her friends for their companionship, apologized for causing them pain, and explained that “the loneliness, no chance of a cure after forty years of therapy, nothing to look forward to—all this has led me to see that the only thing remaining is a dignified end of life.”","2503","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"There was also a draft of a long letter to her children, which was far more emotional than the one she had sent. “I have not been able to handle the rift with you, Tom,” she wrote. “I have loved you very much but you have not seen it as such.” She then addressed her three grandchildren: “I have missed you very much.” She also wrote, before crossing it out, “I will not see my grandchildren grow up and that causes me pain.”","2504","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"In his mother’s living room, Tom found an article about Distelmans in De Morgen, a leading Flemish newspaper, which featured a large photograph of him sitting on a bed, wearing jeans, a patterned shirt, and a silver bangle bracelet. The reporter described Distelmans as a doctor who “cannot stand injustice.” Distelmans spoke about his disdain for doctors who assume that they know what their patients need, and told the reporter that the “euthanasia law has such a symbolic value. People have a voice.”","2505","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Tom also discovered a booklet, produced by LEIF (Life End Information Forum), an organization founded by Distelmans, that outlined the medical and legal options available to people who are dying or want to die. On the final page, the authors introduced an excerpt from “Utopia,” by Thomas More, who describes a world in which “officially sanctioned euthanasia is regarded as an honorable death.” In More’s ideal society, government officials and priests visit suffering invalids and say, “Why don’t you break out and escape to a better world?”","2506","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"In Belgium, euthanasia is embraced as an emblem of enlightenment and progress, a sign that the country has extricated itself from its Catholic, patriarchal roots. Distelmans, who was brought up as a Catholic and then rejected the Church, told me that his work is inspired by an aversion to all forms of paternalism. “Who am I to convince patients that they have to suffer longer than they want?” he said.","2507","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Belgium was the second country in the world, after the Netherlands, to decriminalize euthanasia; it was followed by Luxembourg, in 2009, and, this year, by Canada and Colombia. Switzerland has allowed assisted suicide since 1942. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that citizens have legitimate concerns about prolonged deaths in institutional settings, but in 1997 it ruled that death is not a constitutionally protected right, leaving questions about assisted suicide to be resolved by each state. Within months of the ruling, Oregon passed a law that allows doctors to prescribe lethal drugs for patients who have less than six months to live. In 2008, Washington adopted a similar law; Montana decriminalized assisted suicide the year after; and Vermont legalized it in 2013.","2508","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"The right-to-die movement has gained momentum at a time of anxiety about the graying of the population; people who are older than sixty-five represent the fastest-growing demographic in the United States, Canada, and much of Europe. But the laws seem to be motivated less by the desires of the elderly than by the concerns of a younger generation, whose members derive comfort from the knowledge that they can control the end of their lives. Diane Meier, a professor of geriatrics at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York, and one of the leading palliative-care physicians in the country, told me that “the movement to legalize assisted suicide is driven by the ‘worried well,’ by people who are terrified of the unknown and want to take back control.” She added, “That is not to say that the medical profession doesn’t do a horrible job of protecting people from preventable suffering.” Like most doctors who specialize in palliative care, a field focussed on quality of life for patients with severe and terminal illnesses, she thinks legalizing assisted suicide is unnecessary. “The notion that if people don’t kill themselves they’re going to die on a ventilator in the hospital would be humorous if it weren’t so serious,” she said. She believes that the angst propelling the movement would be diminished if patients had greater access to palliative care and if doctors were more attentive to their patients’ psychological suffering.","2509","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"In Oregon and Switzerland, studies have shown that people who request death are less motivated by physical pain than by the desire to remain autonomous. This pattern of reasoning was exemplified by Brittany Maynard, a twenty-nine-year-old newlywed who moved to Oregon last year so that she could die on her own terms rather than allowing her brain cancer to take its course. Her story appeared on the cover of People, which described her as having the “soul of an adventurer and the heart of a warrior.” She became the poster child for assisted death—a far more palatable one than Jack Kevorkian, who had previously filled that role. Unlike the patients whom Kevorkian attended to with his makeshift “suicide machine,” Maynard appeared neither passive nor vulnerable. Since her death, seven months ago, lawmakers in twenty-three U.S. states have introduced bills that would make it legal for doctors to help people die.","2510","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Opponents have warned for years that legalization will lead to a “slippery slope,” but in Oregon fewer than nine hundred people have used lethal prescriptions since the law was passed, and they represent the demographic that is least likely to be coerced: they are overwhelmingly white, educated, and well-off. In Belgium and in the Netherlands, where patients can be euthanized even if they do not have a terminal illness, the laws seem to have permeated the medical establishment more deeply than elsewhere, perhaps because of the central role granted to doctors: in the majority of cases, it is the doctor, not the patient, who commits the final act. In the past five years, the number of euthanasia and assisted-suicide deaths in the Netherlands has doubled, and in Belgium it has increased by more than a hundred and fifty per cent. Although most of the Belgian patients had cancer, people have also been euthanized because they had autism, anorexia, borderline personality disorder, chronic-fatigue syndrome, partial paralysis, blindness coupled with deafness, and manic depression. In 2013, Wim Distelmans euthanized a forty-four-year-old transgender man, Nathan Verhelst, because Verhelst was devastated by the failure of his sex-change surgeries; he said that he felt like a monster when he looked in the mirror. “Farewell, everybody,” Verhelst said from his hospital bed, seconds before receiving a lethal injection.","2511","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"The laws seem to have created a new conception of suicide as a medical treatment, stripped of its tragic dimensions. Patrick Wyffels, a Belgian family doctor, told me that the process of performing euthanasia, which he does eight to ten times a year, is “very magical.” But he sometimes worries about how his own values might influence a patient’s decision to die or to live. “Depending on communication techniques, I might lead a patient one way or the other,” he said. In the days before and after the procedure, he finds it difficult to sleep. “You spend seven years studying to be a doctor, and all they do is teach you how to get people well—and then you do the opposite,” he told me. “I am afraid of the power that I have in that moment.”","2512","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Although doctors in Belgium had been covertly performing euthanasia before it was legalized, the majority of them opposed the euthanasia law, according to a survey conducted at the time. The chairman of Belgium’s largest medical association cautioned against making “the exception the rule.” But the political composition of the Belgian government had recently shifted; for the first time since the Second World War, secular politicians (liberals, socialists, and the Green Party) had more power than Christian Democrats, who resisted legalization. Peter Backx, the former editor of Belgium’s largest medical journal, said that the law seemed like a “bit of political revenge.” At the Senate hearings on the law, the phrase “self-determination” was repeated ninety-seven times.","2513","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"The right to a dignified death is viewed as an accomplishment of secular humanism, one of seven belief systems that are officially recognized by the government. Belgian humanism, which was deeply influenced by the nineteenth-century Freemasonry movement, offered an outlet for those who felt oppressed by the Church, but it has increasingly come to resemble the kind of institution that it once defined itself against. Since 1981, the Belgian government has paid for “humanist counsellors,” the secular equivalent of clergy, to provide moral guidance in hospitals, prisons, and the armed forces. Humanist values are also taught in state schools, in a course called non-confessional ethics, which is taken by secular children from first through twelfth grade, while religious students pursue theological studies. The course emphasizes autonomy, free inquiry, democracy, and an ethics based on reason and science, not on revelation. Jan Bernheim, an emeritus professor of medicine at the Free University of Brussels, who studies ethics and quality of life, told me that euthanasia is “part of a philosophy of taking control of one’s own existence and improving the objective conditions for happiness. There is an arrow of evolution that goes toward ever more reducing of suffering and maximizing of enjoyment.”","2514","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"The Belgian Council of Ministers appointed Wim Distelmans to serve as the chairman of the Federal Control and Evaluation Commission, which reviews euthanasia deaths to insure that doctors have complied with the law. In terminal cases, two doctors need to confirm that the patient’s suffering stems from an incurable illness. For non-terminal cases, three doctors must agree. But doctors have adopted increasingly loose interpretations of disease. Distelmans told me, “We at the commission are confronted more and more with patients who are tired of dealing with a sum of small ailments—they are what we call ‘tired of life.’ ” Although their suffering derives from social concerns as well as from medical ones, Distelmans said that he still considers their pain to be incurable. “If you ask for euthanasia because you are alone, and you are alone because you don’t have family to take care of you, we cannot create family,” he said.","2515","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Last year, thirteen per cent of the Belgians who were euthanized did not have a terminal condition, and roughly three per cent suffered from psychiatric disorders. In Flanders, where the dominant language is Dutch, euthanasia accounts for nearly five per cent of all deaths. (The percentage is lower in the southern, French-speaking parts of Belgium.) The Flemish media have adopted a mostly uncritical approach to euthanasia, running numerous articles about the courage of people who have chosen to die. Last year, De Standaard, a prominent Flemish newspaper, published a long tribute to a depressed mother who was euthanized after being abandoned by her boyfriend and becoming disillusioned by her psychiatric care. “I am forever grateful to her that she handled this so well,” her twenty-four-year-old son told the paper. “I am so glad we were able to say goodbye in a beautiful way.”","2516","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"The suicide rate in Belgium (excluding cases of euthanasia) is the second-highest in Western Europe, a phenomenon often attributed to the Flemish personality type known as “binnenvetter,” a person who holds emotions inside. Joris Vandenberghe, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Leuven and a member of the Belgian Advisory Committee on Bioethics, said that he finds euthanasia requests therapeutically useful, because they prompt patients who would not otherwise seek medical help to consult with doctors about their feelings of hopelessness. He said that most of his patients, even those who are approved for euthanasia, end up deciding that they want to live. But he rejects the idea that suicide is always an indication of pathology. “There’s a whole philosophical history of looking at suicide as a rational choice,” he said. “We, as humans, have the possibility to weigh our own life and decide to end it.”","2517","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Tom believes that everyone is suicidal in at least some small way. In his early twenties, the impulse was strong. “There was a red light constantly flickering above me,” he said. He undertook what he called “aggressive reading”: Dostoyevsky, Antonin Artaud, Freud, Sándor Ferenczi, Tolstoy, Carl Jung. He found himself drawn to theories of suffering. He wanted to know what it was that made one person survive and another give up.","2518","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"When Tom was twenty-two, he enrolled in graduate school, for chemistry, but instead of studying he researched his father’s suicide. He often took the train to Ghent, where his father had worked, and interviewed his colleagues and friends. Godelieva, following the advice of her psychiatrist at the time, hadn’t told her children how their father died; she said only that he suffered from headaches. Tom and his sister quickly figured it out. Tom began to see his father as a kind of Dorian Gray figure: he had lived extravagantly, seeking pleasure, success, and distraction. He drove a new Mercedes while he owed millions of Belgian francs and was under the threat of legal action. “He could not see himself as he really was,” Tom recalled. He left a suicide note on his bathroom mirror that said, “I am a victim of the shit that exists in the world today.”","2519","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"In her diary, Godelieva wrote that she couldn’t comprehend why her husband would kill himself. But at other times she felt that she understood perfectly—“I am just like him,” she wrote—but she said that, for the sake of the children, she could never do the same. Neither Tom nor his sister thought that she would have killed herself on her own. She was passive, dependent, and averse to risk. She didn’t like to make a mess. Most of all, she trusted her doctors’ authority. Distelmans was the last in a series of charismatic and accomplished doctors whose theories she had revered. After finding strength in their guidance, she eventually became disillusioned by each treatment. “I can still hardly believe how many amateurs are walking around in this medical field,” she wrote to a friend in the late nineties, after giving up on another therapist.","2520","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"When Tom read his mother’s daily planner, he saw that she had met with Distelmans at least six times in the past eight months. Seven weeks before her death, she donated twenty-five hundred euros to LEIF, the organization that Distelmans had founded. On the bank-transfer form she had written, “Thanks to the staff at LEIF.”","2521","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Until Godelieva’s death, Tom had never given much thought to euthanasia, though he was vaguely in favor of it. “Distelmans was just a voice I heard on the radio from time to time,” he told me. Tom was brought up as an atheist, and in school he had studied non-confessional ethics. When the euthanasia law was passed, he and his wife, who were in the same graduate program, had recently fallen in love. They assumed that the law was for old people who were already dying.","2522","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Now it seemed to Tom that there were few people reflecting critically on the law. Three days after his mother’s death, the leading Belgian humanist association named Distelmans one of ten “heroes of self-determination” in the past fifty years, at a celebration for Flemish Heritage Day. When Tom complained to the ombudsman at the hospital of the Free University of Brussels, the ombudsman replied that everything had proceeded according to his mother’s “free will.” Even Godelieva’s friends reserved judgment; few had realized that she suffered from clinical depression. At her memorial service, people skirted the issue. They told one another that you never know how someone is feeling inside, and that “every house has its own cross,” an attitude that Tom described as typically Flemish. Tom likes to joke that he must have some secret French roots, because he finds it nearly impossible to contain his feelings.","2523","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Godelieva’s friend Christiane Geuens told me that she knew that Godelieva was upset about her breakup, but she never imagined that she was considering euthanasia. Less than two weeks before she died, Godelieva had spent all day at Geuens’s home. Godelieva lit a fire and then sat on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, and told stories. The only indication that something was off was the movie she decided to watch. She wanted to see “Sophie’s Choice.” She had already seen the movie and read the book, and afterward she went on about her identification with Sophie, who was so burdened by her past that she committed suicide. Geuens didn’t see how their situations were comparable, but Godelieva said that they were the same.","2524","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"

Thienpont invited him to meet with her and Distelmans, both of whom are founding members of Ulteam, a clinic for patients who have questions about ending their lives. In the past three years, nine hundred patients have come to Ulteam, half of whom complained that they were suffering psychologically, not physically.","2525","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"

"Tom said that his mother’s “absolute wish” was also to be a good grandmother. He had brought some of her papers and letters, and he began reading from the draft of her suicide letter to him and his sister. “I feel frustration and sadness because I have not been able to build a connection,” he read. Then he showed them an apology letter that he had written to his mother when he was twenty, after one of many fights. “Forgive me,” he read. “You have dealt with the worst. . . . You care about me. I am not living up to your expectations. That hurts. I don’t know how to deal with that.”","2530","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"

"When Tom saw that his reading had elicited no response, he pushed his chair back from the table and stood up. Bieseman recalled, “He was screaming, ‘You went along with the madness of my mother! You went along with her tunnel vision, her defeatism. You’ve just taken away the suffering of one person and transposed it to another!’ ”","2532","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"

They all stood up and shook hands, and Tom and Bieseman left the clinic.","2533","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Distelmans told me that he had no doubts about the way he handled Godelieva’s case. He explained that she was “a very nice person, a very warm person,” and that she had “wanted to do one decent thing in her life, and that is to die in a decent way, because the rest of her life was such a horrible mess.” When I asked if he worried about transference—perhaps she had idolized him or depended too much on his opinion—he laughed and said, “I’ve never met a patient who is willing to die to please someone else.”","2534","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Thienpont, whose practice is mostly devoted to issues surrounding euthanasia, was similarly confident about the decision to end Godelieva’s life. Since Ulteam opened, in 2011, Thienpont said it has been “overrun by psychiatric patients”—a phenomenon that she attributes to the poor quality of psychiatric care in the country. In Belgium, it is not uncommon for patients to live in psychiatric institutions for years. Outpatient care is minimal, poorly funded, and fragmented, as it is in most countries. In a new book, called “Libera Me,” Thienpont urges doctors to accept the limits of psychiatry, and argues that some patients live with so much pain, their thoughts unceasingly directed toward death, that their mental illnesses should be considered “terminal.” Before approving a euthanasia request, she does not require patients to try procedures that they think are invasive. Godelieva had never had electroconvulsive therapy, though it is effective for about half of patients with depression. “Sometimes it really is too late,” Thienpont told me. “If the patient’s energy is gone, then it is not humane to say, ‘Well, maybe if you go to a hospital that specializes in your problem for two more years it will help.’ I think we have to respect when people say, ‘No—that is enough.’ ”","2535","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Euthanasia for psychiatric patients was rare in the early years of the law, but patients complained that they were being unfairly stigmatized: psychic suffering, they argued, was just as unbearable as physical pain. Like cancer patients, they were subjected to futile treatments that diminished their quality of life. Dirk De Wachter, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Leuven and the president of the ethics commission for the university’s psychiatric center, said that he reconsidered his opposition to euthanasia after a patient whose request he had rejected committed suicide. In 2004, she set up a camera in front of a newspaper office in Antwerp and set herself on fire.","2536","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"De Wachter believes that the country’s approach to suicide reflects a crisis of nihilism created by the rapid secularization of Flemish culture in the past thirty years. Euthanasia became a humanist solution to a humanist dilemma. “What is life worth when there is no God?” he said. “What is life worth when I am not successful?” He said that he has repeatedly been confronted by patients who tell him, “I am an autonomous decision-maker. I can decide how long I live. When I think my life is not worth living anymore, I must decide.” He recently approved the euthanasia of a twenty-five-year-old woman with borderline personality disorder who did not “suffer from depression in the psychiatric sense of the word,” he said. “It was more existential; it was impossible for her to have a goal in this life.” He said that her parents “came to my office, got on their knees, and begged me, ‘Please, help our daughter to die.’ ”","2537","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"De Wachter told me, “I don’t want to kill people—I don’t think psychiatrists should kill people—but when the suffering is so extreme we cannot look the other way.” When he gives lectures, he tries to appeal to Christian audiences by saying, “If Jesus were here, I think he would help these people.”","2538","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"René Stockman, the director of a Catholic organization, Brothers of Charity, which says that it runs a third of the psychiatric institutions in Belgium, told me, “They are using our Christian vocabulary in a new context. They say they are ‘saving’ people from their bad lives, through ‘mercy’ and ‘compassion.’ I cannot accept that.” He sees euthanasia as a failure of both psychiatry and medical education. “Any questions about ethics—they say, ‘Oh, we need a specialist for that.’ They are not learning to reflect morally on what they are doing.”","2539","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"In the months after his mother’s death, Tom searched online for criticism of the Belgian approach to euthanasia, but it seemed to take only two forms: objections from Catholics, who argued that life is sacred and only God should end it, and from Holocaust survivors and their descendants, who were disturbed to see doctors delving into the business of judging whether certain lives were worth living. Although the latter concern blurs a fundamental distinction—under the Nazis, the sick and the disabled never asked to die—it was exacerbated by the fact that Distelmans led seventy medical professionals and scholars on a “study trip” to Auschwitz last year. A brochure for the trip explained that for those who are “constantly confronted with existential pain and questions about the meaning of life” Auschwitz is an “inspiring place to contemplate these issues.”","2540","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"In October, 2012, Tom compiled a list of thirty Belgian physicians and academics who had publicly questioned the law and sent them a long e-mail about his mother’s death. “The fact that W. Distelmans has euthanized my mother without contacting me or my sister keeps festering,” he wrote. “It is difficult for me to grasp that right now there is no public basis and political support to combat these absurd practices.”","2541","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Herman De Dijn, a Spinoza scholar, responded. He cautioned Tom that the Belgian media would not be receptive to his opinion. De Dijn, an emeritus professor of philosophy at the University of Leuven, said that Godelieva’s story sounded like “utopia realized: everything is neat and clean and terrible.” He was troubled by the way that his colleagues’ theories about autonomy seemed to have stiffened into ideology, a mentality that the euthanasia law both reflected and encouraged. “Once the law is there, you have people asking themselves new questions,” he told me. “Do I really have quality of life? Am I not a burden on others?” He believed that “human dignity should include not only respect for personal choices but also for connectedness to loved ones and society.” He worried that the concept had been “reduced to the ability to have certain experiences.”","2542","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Emboldened by De Dijn’s response, Tom wrote an essay that built on his theories. The seed for the essay was a notice for a lecture, called “On the Sofa with Wim Distelmans,” that he saw on the Web site of a youth organization. Over pastries and coffee, Distelmans would discuss euthanasia with teen-agers. Tom sent a version of the essay, originally titled “Euthanasia on the Sofa,” to Flanders’s leading newspaper and magazine, both of which rejected it. Eventually, it was published in Artsenkrant, a magazine for physicians. “I am afraid that the notion of ‘free will’ has become dogma, behind which it is easy to hide,” he wrote. “Wouldn’t it be better to invest in mental health and palliative care?”","2543","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"The Flemish newspaper De Morgen picked up the story and ran an article summarizing Tom’s complaints. Two days later, Jacinta De Roeck, one of three senators who sponsored the euthanasia law and the director of Belgium’s Liberal-Humanist Association, published an op-ed in the paper, asserting that there had been no abuses of the law since it was passed, ten years earlier. “Fortunately our society has started to understand that there can be mental suffering that is unbearable, and cannot in any way be lessened,” she wrote. “Sometimes a patient sees only one possible solution: euthanasia, within the perfectly drawn lines of the law. No one has the right to disapprove of this choice.”","2544","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"The next week, Tony Van Loon, a professor of moral sciences at the Free University of Brussels, who is Thienpont’s longtime partner, wrote an article in De Morgen titled “The Right to Self-Determination Is the Ultimate Answer.” Van Loon, who works with Ulteam, alluded to Godelieva’s case by describing her as “a mother who says her suffering is unbearable, in part because of the troubled relationship with her son.” He said that the patients at Ulteam had been ignored and silenced by other doctors. “May they be allowed to die like human beings?” he wrote. “Or must they wait until they are nothing more than a corpse so that their next of kin can comfort themselves with their remains?”","2545","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"In the summer of 2013, Tom asked a doctor named Georges Casteur to inspect his mother’s medical records. Casteur, the former president of the provincial council of the doctors of West Flanders, had performed euthanasia several times in his career, but he believed that it should be used only for patients who are close to death. “There’s a great difference between helping people who are already dying and helping people to die,” he told me. He didn’t understand why physicians were framing the latter as a patient’s right. “My colleagues are so against paternalism that they say, ‘You want to die? O.K., I’ll kill you.’ ”","2546","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Casteur reviewed Godelieva’s medical file at Distelmans’s clinic, with Distelmans sitting beside him. Casteur says that he learned that Godelieva had struggled to find three doctors who would say that she had an incurable illness, as the law required. One psychiatrist wrote that her desire for euthanasia was “not mature,” because she had “ups and downs.” According to Casteur, a second concluded that she could still be helped; the psychiatrist observed that when Godelieva discussed her grandchildren she became emotional and expressed doubts about her decision to die. In addition to Thienpont, Distelmans consulted Godelieva’s former therapist, who wrote that, “after recent rejection by her latest partner and by her children, her psychiatric issues will not improve.” Two weeks before Godelieva’s death, Distelmans asked if he could call her children, but she refused. “It would not change her decision anyway,” Distelmans wrote. She died with three photographs in her pocket: a picture of her holding Tom on her lap when he was a baby, a picture of her feeding one of Tom’s young daughters ice cream, and a photograph of her and her daughter walking together through a field.","2547","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Based on Casteur’s notes, Tom submitted a complaint with the Belgian Order of Physicians and the public prosecutor of Brussels, alleging that Godelieva’s condition had not been incurable. A reunion with her children and her grandchildren, he argued, might have alleviated the loneliness that was at the core of her suffering.","2548","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"When a Dutch news service reported on Tom’s complaint, Tom found himself reading all the comments online. People accused him of using Distelmans as a scapegoat, of placing his own needs before his mother’s, of not understanding the law, of being secretly Catholic. Then he saw a comment by a woman named Margot Vandevenne. “To those who reacted in such a way: you have no idea how it is to experience something like that!” she wrote. “This is an unbearable pain that you can only know when you have experienced this YOURSELF.” In a second comment, she wrote that Distelmans “euthanized my mother half a year ago because of depression, and I wasn’t told until a day after her death, and not even by the doctor.”","2549","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Vandevenne, who was nineteen and had a young son, had filed a criminal complaint against Distelmans, but she worried that nothing would come of it. The investigative process is confidential, and, in the past thirteen years, no case has been referred for prosecution. Tom encouraged Vandevenne to file a complaint with the Order of Physicians and offered to help her write it. Her mother, who was fifty-four when she died, had been mourning the recent deaths of both of her parents and suffered from depression, unexplained pain, and an inability to “find a meaningful purpose in her life,” as one doctor wrote. On March 8, 2014, Margot sent the Order of Physicians a letter protesting the circumstances of her mother’s death. “My son and I have not even had the chance to say goodbye to my mother,” she wrote. “I wonder every day whether I would have been able to change her mind if I had been informed.”","2550","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Less than a week later, the philosopher Etienne Vermeersch, the former president of the Belgian Advisory Committee on Bioethics, wrote an editorial in De Morgen accusing Tom and others of conducting a “smear campaign.” “They are filing complaints with the Order of Physicians and with the court in order to frighten generous doctors with the spectre of prosecution,” he wrote. “If this disastrous strategy succeeded, hundreds of people in extreme need would once again no longer be helped.” He wrote that Belgium “stands, ethically, at the top of the world.” He republished the editorial on a Web site and urged anyone who objected to the recent criticism to sign a petition. More than seven thousand people did, including senators and representatives, the country’s minister of social affairs and health, the former mayor of Antwerp, academics, artists, actors, journalists, novelists, sports figures, and doctors from Ulteam.","2551","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Vermeersch, who is eighty-one and was recently voted the most influential intellectual in Flanders, was one of the country’s earliest proponents of euthanasia, and he sees the law as his progeny. Last year, he successfully campaigned for legislation that made children with incurable illnesses eligible for euthanasia, and he, along with several politicians, is now working to expand the law so that people with dementia can be euthanized, provided they articulate their wishes in advance. When I met him at his home, a spectacularly messy house, with piles of boxes blocking the view out his windows, he told me that he did not think Godelieva’s case was particularly complex; he said that he’d seen cases that were more “delicate.” He described a couple who came to him for guidance after their bipolar daughter had been euthanized. They were sure that if she had waited a few months her pessimism would have lifted. Of this case, Vermeersch said, “I see that there is a problem, but you also have to look at the two sides.”","2552","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Vermeersch seemed to refer to death as an option that had upsides and downsides, like any other choice, and I mentioned that it appeared that a lot of people in Belgium were less afraid of death than I was.","2553","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Vermeersch looked at me as if he were recalculating my age downward. “How can you be afraid of nothing?” he said. “Nothing can do you no harm.”","2554","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"I said, “I’m afraid of not existing.”","2555","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"

"“After death, your relationships are finished,” he said brightly. “You are in the state you were before conception.”","2558","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Tom likes to joke that he has “seven thousand enemies,” the people who signed Vermeersch’s petition. He refers to his insecurity complex so often that it seems to have taken on a concrete existence of its own. He alternates between denouncing the leading philosophers in Belgium and feeling ashamed of the idea that he would judge anyone. “I don’t want to get trapped in a situation where I feel that I am worth something,” he told me.","2559","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Vermeersch’s petition gained Tom some notoriety, and people began introducing him to others who had become disenchanted by aspects of the law. Recently, he began corresponding with the daughter of Lily Boeykens, the country’s most prominent feminist, who asked for euthanasia because she showed preliminary signs of Alzheimer’s. After two doctors rejected her request—she was still living on her own, giving interviews, and throwing dinner parties—Boeykens, who was seventy-four, found a neurologist at the University of Antwerp, Peter De Deyn, who agreed to euthanize her. She told the doctor, who studied Alzheimer’s, that she would give him her brain for his research. In an audiotaped conversation, she explained to her daughter that “De Deyn will keep the part of my body that he needs.”","2560","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"On the morning on which the euthanasia was scheduled, Boeykens’s daughter, Kerstin, said that she called De Deyn, crying, and begged him to move her mother’s 9 A.M. appointment a few hours later, so that she would have time to drop her children off at school and then drive to the clinic. But De Deyn said that he was booked for the rest of the day. (De Deyn denies that this happened.) Records show that Boeykens died at 9:20 A.M., at which point De Deyn removed her brain and performed an autopsy. Kerstin filed a complaint with the Belgian Order of Physicians, writing that “my mother and Dr. P. P. De Deyn made a deal: brains in exchange for assistance with suicide.”","2561","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"De Deyn, who has euthanized thirty patients suffering from dementia, maintained that the euthanasia date had been determined before they discussed the donation of Boeykens’s brain. He dismissed Kerstin’s account, telling me that she was a psychiatric patient—the same thing that Distelmans said about Tom when discounting his complaints. (Kerstin said that she has no history of psychiatric treatment, a fact that her primary-care doctor confirmed.) The chairman of the Belgian Order of Physicians told Kerstin that she would not be informed of the consequences of her complaint because the process was secret. “I am pro-euthanasia—I don’t want to get rid of it,” she told me. “I just want to shut down these cowboys. They’re a clique; they protect each other.”","2562","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Last fall, Tom filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that the law in Belgium lacked safeguards to prevent abuse. His complaint referred to a recent study in the British Medical Journal, which found that only half of euthanasia cases in Flanders had been reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Commission. There were no repercussions for failing to report euthanasia deaths to the commission, a situation likely aided by the fact that nearly half of the sixteen members on the commission are affiliated with right-to-die associations.","2563","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Tom felt so aggrieved by Distelmans’s prominence that he tried not to talk about him while driving. Each time Distelmans received a prize or a grant—and there have been many—Tom took it as a personal insult. His anger at his mother was channelled toward her doctor, who seemed to be everywhere. Last spring, Tom was reviewing his eight-year-old daughter’s journal for school, as he does every night, when he saw in the pages a flyer with Distelmans’s face on it. “Euthanasia lecture: With Wim Distelmans,” it said. It had been put there by his daughter’s non-confessional-ethics teacher, who is also the chair of the local humanist chapter. Tom and his wife e-mailed the school’s principal to complain that the ethics teacher was promoting a lecture by the doctor who had euthanized the grandmother of one of her pupils. The principal apologized for causing discomfort but explained that the “flyer has only an informative character which gives parents the opportunity to get informed about this contemporary humanist subject.” She wrote that the subject of euthanasia was in keeping with the curriculum, but she said that she would advise teachers not to discuss it until after the second grade.","2564","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Tom thought about pulling his daughter out of non-confessional ethics but decided not to, because it wouldn’t make sense for her to study Catholicism—the other class offered during that period—and he didn’t want her to have to sit alone for two hours every week. She was popular, and he didn’t want her to feel like an outsider. His wife, who has an aura of quiet competence, had managed to keep their domestic life remarkably regular in the years since Godelieva’s death. They live in a suburb of Leuven, in a clean, bright, square house that they designed themselves; when they were shopping for architectural models, the word they kept repeating was “practical.” Tom’s tone of voice shifts when he talks about his children. He seems suddenly light.","2565","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"At times, Tom appeared almost bewildered by his stability—a fulfilling job, a loving marriage, three healthy children. He assumed that at some point he must have decided to live, a choice that still surprises him. He attributed it to some sort of primitive drive to know how things would turn out. “I wanted to see if I was capable of becoming someone,” he said, before adding that he still doesn’t know. When he becomes depressed or dramatic, his wife tells him to think of their children, and says, “You have no choice but to continue,” a phrase that Tom repeats often.","2566","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"On one of my last days in Belgium, Tom took me to meet his grandmother, whose flaws Godelieva had described so relentlessly that Tom had trouble seeing her as a person in her own right. Tom had always felt a little wary of her, but his grandmother had been a steady presence in his life, and he had come to appreciate that. Tom visits her about once a month, for half an hour, until they run out of things to say.","2567","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"As soon as we arrived, Tom spotted her walking down the hallway toward the cafeteria. She was dressed like a schoolgirl, in a long skirt, a maroon cardigan, and a starched white shirt buttoned to the base of her neck. Her excitement at seeing her grandson was mild. She nodded, smiled timidly, and led us upstairs to her room.","2568","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"She sat on a cushioned chair, her ankles crossed, while Tom opened her cabinet and took out an antique box of photographs, most of which had been taken at the farm where she had grown up and spent most of her life. “Good pictures, Oma,” he said as he shuffled through several piles, searching for older photographs. He finally found what he wanted: photographs of British soldiers who had recuperated at the farm after the Second World War. His grandmother had fallen in love with one of the soldiers, and they had planned to marry. But, at the last minute, to please her parents, she married Tom’s grandfather instead.","2569","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"Years later, his grandmother searched for the soldier, and, when they were in their seventies, after the deaths of their spouses, they reunited. “They had one romantic summer before he died,” Tom told me. He showed me a picture of his grandmother and the veteran standing in front of the farm, holding hands and beaming.","2570","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"I said that it was a very nice picture.","2571","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"“Yeah, but it destroyed everything,” Tom said, explaining that his grandmother had spent fifty years married to a man she didn’t love. He repeated a phrase that his mother had written several times in her diary: “You can feel whatever you want on the inside, but never let it show on the outside.”","2572","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"After we left, Tom explained that his mother had always said that she wasn’t “conceived out of love.” At the thought, he seemed to soften toward her. “She really had a tough time,” he said. “She was in pain—I’m not going to say anything different.”","2573","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment"
"He began speaking about how traumas are passed from one generation to the next, and how suicides, perhaps more than any other death, reverberate through a family. It was an idea that we’d discussed many times, and, when I didn’t immediately respond, he seemed to tire of it. “Well, it is what it is,” he said. “We have to continue.

"So on Saturday night, at the Democratic debate, in Des Moines, Iowa, it was jarring to hear Sanders, the first Presidential candidate to speak before a national audience in the aftermath of the Paris attacks, declare forthrightly, “Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS.”","2581","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"If you tuned into the event still dumbstruck by the events in France but hoping the debate would offer some clarity about how the United States should respond, Sanders’s unambiguous call for a military defeat of ISIS was promising. Clearly he had thought about this vexing issue and came to the Iowa debate prepared to explain his strategy.","2582","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"But in the next breath, he revealed he actually had no plan. “I’m running for President, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people,” he said, in a confusing and bizarre non sequitur. “And what I hear is people’s concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy. People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one per cent.”","2583","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"Next up was Hillary Clinton, and she, too, promised to explain how she would deal with ISIS. “I will be laying out, in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coördinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism,” she said. “Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.”","2584","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"You can’t get any more direct than that: she would be “laying out in detail” the whole plan. Shortly after, she added a Sanderseque promise that ISIS “cannot be contained, it must be defeated,” which would be a notable shift from simply preventing ISIS’s expansion to eradicating it. But after two hours of debate, the Clinton plan never came.","2585","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"The same was true of Martin O’Malley. He argued that ISIS represented “the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership,” and yet he never told us exactly what that new thinking and those fresh approaches would be.","2586","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"That’s not to say that there wasn’t some debate about the issue. But even those moments that seemed to highlight a difference of opinion fizzled into agreement about platitudes. At one point Clinton argued “this cannot be an American fight,” and O’Malley retorted, “This actually is America’s fight,” though he quickly added that “it cannot solely be America’s fight.” Got that?","2587","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"There was a great deal of time spent on what caused ISIS’s rise. Sanders pointed to the effects of climate change. O’Malley and Sanders both pointed to Clinton’s vote in favor of the war in Iraq, which created the vacuum that ISIS has filled. John Dickerson, the moderator, asked whether Clinton’s support for deposing Muammar Qaddafi in Libya also contributed to the massive instability in the region. Clinton herself, in a creative stroke of deflection of responsibility for her role in the events of the last twelve years, argued that terrorism is simply a long-running problem in that part of the world.","2588","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"“I think it’s important we put this in historic context,” Clinton said, before taking viewers back through the history of terrorist attacks against Americans, including the 1983 bombing of a Marine barracks in Beirut, the 1998 embassy attacks in Tanzania and Kenya, and 9/11. She was perhaps trying to show off her knowledge of the region and its history, but it seemed more like she was trying to avoid criticism that the invasion of Iraq and intervention in Libya helped fuel ISIS’s rise.","2589","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"Some of the explanation for the lack of detail from Sanders, Clinton, and O’Malley has to do with the state of the Democratic primary race right now. As extreme underdogs, Sanders and O’Malley had incentives to attack Clinton’s record on Iraq and Libya, but they have little reason to lay out a comprehensive strategy, especially when appealing to a Democratic electorate that is wary of any military intervention that could produce high casualties for Americans.

Sitting on an enormous lead, she was loath to say anything that might cause a reaction from the anti-war Democratic base that Obama tapped in 2008 to beat her. But aside from the obvious politics, she may have believed her caution was the more responsible course. She might not want to box in Obama, who has yet to settle on a new course against ISIS, by laying out her own more ambitious and detailed plan. And given her dominance in the race so far, she may not have wanted to box in the next President, either.","2591","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, I pronounced Clinton the big winner, saying that she had been “sharp, personable, and assured.” I also said that Sanders “gave a good account of himself,” but that didn’t satisfy some readers. Within hours, the complaints were raining in—on Twitter, on Facebook, and elsewhere. Had I been coöpted by the Clinton campaign? Was I watching the same debate as everybody else? Did I have a clue what I was writing about?","2594","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"

"It’s certainly possible that I, and many other commentators, got it wrong. The media has erred before, plenty of times. Back in April, when Sanders announced his candidacy, many observers wrote him off as a fringe candidate who wouldn’t have much of an impact. I didn’t make that particular error: indeed, I welcomed Sanders to the race, pointing out that he would “provide a voice to those Democrats who agree with him that the U.S. political system has been bought, lock, stock, and barrel.” That one I got right. But on the Republican side, after Donald Trump jumped in, I underestimated his staying power, as did many other members of the media. Did we get the Democratic debate wrong, too?","2596","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"Let’s look, briefly, at the case for the prosecution. At AlterNet, the alternative-news site, Adam Johnson pointed out, “Sanders won the CNN focus group, the Fusion focus group, and the Fox News focus group; in the latter, he even converted several Hillary supporters. He won the Slate online poll, CNN/Time online poll, 9News Colorado, The Street online poll, Fox5 poll, the conservative Drudge online poll and the liberal Daily Kos online poll. There wasn’t, to this writer’s knowledge, a poll he didn’t win by at least an 18-point margin.”","2597","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"At the other end of the ideological spectrum, Dick Morris, the Republican political strategist and Clinton antagonist, suggested that the media no longer understands a Democratic electorate that has moved to the left and is now highly issues-oriented. “Sanders identified and successfully focused on his two main issues: First, income inequality and the need to break up the big banks and second, the need for more restraint in committing military forces abroad,” Morris wrote on his Web site. “These two positions, clearly articulated in the debate will impel Sanders to a steep rise in the polls.”","2598","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The ultimate arbiter of who won the debate will, of course, be the public, not the pundits. But we won’t get a reliable reading of public opinion until we see some scientifically conducted surveys based on random samples of Democratic voters. The post-debate online polls weren’t of this type: their samples were self-selecting, and you would expect their results to be skewed toward the candidate with the most-committed supporters. In this race, without a doubt, that is Sanders.","2599","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The only post-debate poll I’ve seen that employed orthodox surveying techniques was carried out by the research firm Gravis Marketing, and it showed Clinton as the clear victor. Researchers for Gravis asked a random sample of seven hundred and sixty registered Democrats across the United States this question: “Who do you think won the debate?” Sixty-two per cent of respondents said Clinton, thirty per cent said Sanders, and six per cent said Martin O’Malley. It’s just one poll and its results aren’t definitive, but if most Democratic voters, in fact, believe that Sanders won, it is an enormous outlier.","2600","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The findings of the media focus groups deserve to be taken more seriously than the online polls, but here, too, representativeness is an issue. For the first G.O.P. debate, Frank Luntz, who runs focus groups for Fox News, organized a panel of Republican voters, which said that Donald Trump had performed poorly. Subsequently, Trump’s lead in the polls increased (and he excoriated Luntz on Twitter). Still, the fact that all three of the focus groups mentioned in Johnson’s article identified Sanders as the winner shouldn’t be dismissed; nor should the participants’ responses. When Luntz asked some members of his group, which consisted of Democratic voters from Florida, for a one- or two-word description of Sanders’s performance, these were some of the responses he received: “for the people,” “strong,” “straightforward,” “confident,” “direct,” “sincere,” “powerful,” “educator,” and “smart.”","2601","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"As I noted in my post-debate post, Sanders certainly “got his message through.” As Morris pointed out, it’s a message that resonates with many Democratic voters and is forcing other candidates, Clinton very much included, to adapt to it. It may also be true that Sanders benefitted from the fact that many viewers were seeing him for the first time on the national stage, and that the media underestimated this factor. “Beforehand, a third of Democrats said they didn’t yet know enough about Sanders to have an opinion on him,” Andrew Prokop pointed out in a post at Vox. “Even many of those who did know about him likely hadn’t been exposed to him all that much. So when Sanders makes the case at length for why he’s a democratic socialist, many of these voters might not have heard that before—and might like it.”","2602","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"But just because Sanders did well doesn’t mean he did best of all. In judging the winner of any debate, it’s probably wise to consider at least three questions. Who did the best onstage? Who came out on top in the polls? Who gave his or her campaign the biggest boost?","2603","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The second question I’ve already covered. The answer to the first one is subjective, though anybody who was on a high-school or college debate team knows that it’s not entirely so. Based on Clinton’s manner, her ability to react to what others were saying, and her deftness in evading awkward questions, I think she delivered the best performance, even though, as I wrote yesterday, I strongly disagreed with some of her answers, particularly those relating to Edward Snowden. Some of Clinton’s Republican critics agreed with my assessment of her manner. Trump said that she “did what she had to do.” Scott Walker, who dropped out of the race last month, said, “She came across as surprisingly very confident and I thought relatively pleasant.”","2604","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"So much for technique. The main reason that I think Clinton emerged as the winner relates to the third question: she gave her campaign a huge and much-needed boost. Of all the debate participants, she had the most to lose. After six months in which Clinton struggled to deal with the issue of her use of a private e-mail server while she was secretary of state, Democratic élites and donors were starting to question her abilities as a candidate. A poor performance on Tuesday could well have engendered outright panic. Clinton not only reassured the elected politicians, interest groups, and donors who have thrown in with her; she dealt a big blow to the “draft Biden” movement, which probably, in hindsight, needed its man to be onstage in Las Vegas.","2605","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The Clinton campaign believes that it can ultimately deal with a buoyant Sanders, even one who raises more money after the debate or gains a few more points in the polls. A panicking Democratic establishment and a swift entry into the race by Joe Biden would have presented a much more alarming scenario—one that now appears to be receding as a possibility. The Vice-President may still decide to run, but it will be harder for him to portray himself as a savior for the Party.","2606","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"

"Since Tuesday night’s Democratic debate was held in a Las Vegas hotel, let’s start with the money question: Who won and who lost?","October 14, 2015","2608","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Undoubtedly, Hillary Clinton was the biggest winner, partly because she was playing for the highest stakes. She flew into Nevada as a wounded favorite, whose stumbling performance during the past six months, much of it provoked by the issue of her personal e-mail server, had left many Democrats wondering whether she could get it together in time to win a nomination that was supposed to have been hers for the taking, let alone to win the general election. If she had come across as tetchy and defensive, as she has so often this year, or if she had committed an embarrassing verbal gaffe, the pressure on her would have increased still further, and the chances of Vice-President Joe Biden entering the race would have gone up.","2609","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Instead, Clinton delivered a performance that no doubt reminded establishment Democrats why they had rallied behind her in the first place, and reminded Republicans why she could prove to be a most formidable opponent come November, 2016. Sharp, personable, and assured, she batted off an early question from the moderator, Anderson Cooper, about her flip-flops on various issues, breezed through most of the subsequent exchanges, and received a big assist from her closest rival, Bernie Sanders, who, in perhaps the most memorable moment of the evening, declared, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails…. Enough of the e-mails. Let’s talk about the real issues facing America.”","2610","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Those comments earned the Vermont senator a warm handshake from Clinton and the biggest cheer of the night from a Democratic audience that was all too willing to believe her claim that the Republicans’ pursuit of the e-mail matter is a political vendetta. Even Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who in August said that the Republicans had raised legitimate issues about the e-mails, backed off, saying that he, too, was delighted to be discussing other issues.","2611","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Clinton, of course, would have been more than happy to talk about issues all night. As it became clear that none of the other candidates was going to take her down, she turned her fire on the Republicans, portraying them as dangerous extremists and saying, “They don’t mind having big government to interfere with a woman’s right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood. They’re fine with big government when it comes to that. I’m sick of it.” That line earned Clinton her biggest cheers of the night.","2612","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"The horse race apart, it was a substantive debate, with the candidates going into a level of detail that was rarely broached in the first two Republican debates. (Of course, there were many more candidates on stage at those events.) The matters raised ran the gamut, covering gun control, Syria, climate change, Black Lives Matter, Wall Street regulation, college funding, and paid leave for workers. On many of these issues, Clinton, Sanders, and O’Malley showed themselves to be in general agreement about what was needed, but also, in some cases, divided on how to achieve their shared goals.","2613","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"That much we knew going in. Still, it was instructive to watch Sanders say, in response to a question from Cooper about whether he considers himself a capitalist, “Do I consider myself part of the casino-capitalist process, by which so few have so much and so many have so little, by which Wall Street’s greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don’t.” And it was equally instructive, moments later, when Clinton said, “Well, let me just follow up on that, Anderson, because, when I think about capitalism, I think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families.”","2614","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"On foreign policy, too, the differences between the two front-runners came through clearly, despite the respectful attitude they adopted toward each other. Defending the Obama Administration’s decision to provide military assistance to the Libyan rebels seeking to overthrow Muammar Qaddafi, Clinton described it as “smart power at its best.” Unlike Jim Webb, the former senator from Virginia, Sanders didn’t criticize the Libya decision, but he did express skepticism about U.S. military interventions generally, describing the Iraq invasion, which Clinton voted for, as “the worst foreign-policy blunder in the history of this country.” He also said that he opposed the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria, an idea that Clinton has supported.","2615","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"All in all, the seventy-four-year-old senator from Vermont gave a good account of himself. In one sense, indeed, he made history. Not since Eugene Debs has a self-avowed socialist made such an impression in a Presidential race, in terms of the language he has invoked, the support he has garnered, and the impact his rise has had on the other candidates. Sanders’s Brooklyn accent became more pronounced as the night went on, as he railed against the “oligawky” and denied having left anyone at the “altuh.” (The latter statement was in reference to his refusal to support a 2007 immigration bill.) Afterward, he said that he wished he’d had more time to talk about rising inequality and the challenges it presents to democracy. In reality, though, he got his message through. “Here is the truth that very few candidates will say,” he said in his closing statement. “Nobody up here—certainly no Republican—can address the major crises facing our country unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class that has so much power over our economy and our political life.”","2616","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Of the second-string contenders, O’Malley fared by far the best. An articulate policy wonk, he held his own while debating the issues, and delivered the strongest closing statement, saying to those Americans who have become disillusioned about politics, “Talk to our young people under thirty, because you’ll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples. That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country.”","2617","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"By contrast, Webb and Lincoln Chafee, the former senator from Rhode Island, both looked and sounded terribly out of place. Webb started out by becoming possibly the first Democratic candidate in recent memory to boast of his service in the Reagan Administration (he worked in the Pentagon). Thereafter, he spent a lot of time grouching about how little time he was being allotted. Chafee stumbled badly in trying to explain why he voted, in 1999, to repeal the Glass–Steagall Act, which separated commercial banking from investment banking. Neither man looked like he would be around for long, though Webb did get off one good line: “Bernie, I don’t think the revolution’s going to come. And I don’t think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff.”","2618","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Clinton didn’t have the passion of Sanders or the poetry of O’Malley’s sign-off, but she had something else: the self-confidence and killer instinct of a politician who has been down this route before. Early on, before Sanders helped her out with his comment about her e-mails, she stuck it to him in his most vulnerable area: his record on gun control. She pointed out that he voted five times against the Brady Bill, which required a federal background check and a five-day waiting period for gun purchases. She also ridiculed his answer to a question from Cooper about why he had supported an immunity provision for the manufacturers of guns used to commit violent crimes. “It wasn’t that complicated to me,” Clinton said, after Sanders called the bill a complicated one. “It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity.”","2619","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"The Democratic front-runner also demonstrated the hawkish streak that infuriates some progressives and sometimes earns her grudging respect from Republicans. Asked about Edward Snowden, she repeated the discredited argument that he could have invoked whistle-blower status, and said that he had stolen a lot of information that had fallen into enemy hands. “So I don’t think he should be brought home without facing the music,” she concluded. (Ari Fleischer, a former spokesman for President George W. Bush, tweeted, “Good for Hillary on Snowden.”)","2620","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"In her closing statement, Clinton said that she wanted to get back to “the basic bargain I was raised with: if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead.” That, of course, is an entirely familiar Democratic trope. When Bill Clinton was running for President, it was dubbed the “New Covenant.” President Obama often expressed it in terms of rewarding “hardworking folks” who “play by the rules.” In this case, though, familiarity is unlikely to breed contempt—at least among the moderate and loyal Democrats whom Clinton needs to support her. Bill Clinton and President Obama won four elections between them. For one night, at least, Hillary Clinton gave Democrats reason to believe that she might be ready to follow their example.","2621","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Martin Knott, Jr., is the national finance chairman for Martin O’Malley, the Democratic Presidential candidate and former governor of Maryland. Not long ago, Knott and Damian O’Doherty, the head of O’Malley’s super PAC, flew to Kansas City, rented a car, and headed for Des Moines, to join O’Malley at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner, a prerequisite for any caucus hopeful. Knott pursues one kind of donor, and O’Doherty pursues another—inside money, outside money, you might say. Election laws forbid them from coördinating, so they have to be careful when they travel together. “We are very strict about not ending up in jail,” Knott said last week.

"Leaving Kansas City, Knott, a Grateful Dead fanatic, put on the Dead’s 1990 live CD “Without a Net.” “It seemed appropriate,” Knott said. Fund-raising for a long shot can feel like a high-wire act. Speeding through cornfields under a vast blue Iowa sky, Knott flashed back to bygone migrations to Midwestern amphitheatres. “I felt like I was back on tour, headed for Deer Creek,” he said. “ ‘Going down the road feeling bad’! And then dropping into the Jefferson-Jackson dinner—it was like dropping into a show.” He began to evolve a theory that crisscrossing the country to raise money for a Presidential candidate is a lot like following the Dead. “You know the back roads, so to speak,” he said. “On tour and on the trail, you learn how to connect with people.”","2623","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"
"Knott, who is forty-four, attended, or at least matriculated at, Xavier University, in Cincinnati, in the early nineties, and used it as a base of touring operations. In 1993, the year before he graduated, he attended forty-two shows. To many Deadheads, he is known as the Today in Grateful Dead History guy. Every weekday for the past nine years, he has sent out an e-mail blast with a link to a streamable recording of a concert from the date in question, along with some hastily typed pensées.","2624","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"
"Knott, who runs an H.V.A.C. and plumbing business in Baltimore, reckons that no one has ever raised as much money for Maryland Democratic gubernatorial candidates as he has. He comes from a family of prominent Baltimore Catholics. His grandfather on his father’s side, Henry J. Knott, was a bricklayer who became a prosperous real-estate developer; the family foundation supports Catholic charities and schools. On his mother’s side, there are connections reaching back to the old Baltimore mayor Tommy D’Alesandro, Nancy Pelosi’s father. “My great-grandfather ran her father’s and brother’s campaigns,” Knott said. He has more than a hundred first cousins.","2625","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"

The morning after the show, he was at a coffee shop in the West Village, in a pink shirt and blue suit, caffeinating for some afternoon meetings. He’s big and fit, with a John Edwards part and puggish eyes.","2626","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"
"Knott met O’Malley in 1998, when O’Malley, a Baltimore councilman, was running for mayor. “He asked me for a thousand dollars, which was a lot for me,” Knott said. “We hit it off. We were the youngest guys in the room. We were fellow-Jesuits.” They also both liked music—O’Malley is a Springsteen fan and plays in a Celtic rock band. Knott was a chairman of O’Malley’s 2006 and 2010 gubernatorial campaigns. When O’Malley asked him, in May, to run the national campaign, Knott looked to Jerry Garcia: “I was like, ‘One good ride from start to end? I’d like to take that ride again.’ ” (These are lyrics from the song “Might As Well.”)","2627","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"
"O’Malley, at the moment, is running a distant third in a field of three. But, as Knott sees it, to the extent that Bernie Sanders, as an avowed socialist, is unelectable, and that Hillary Clinton is still vulnerable (“The only person who’s ever been able to stop her is her,” Knott said), his man would be next in line. “Last I checked, three minus two is one,” Knott said. “Our focus is Iowa, Iowa, Iowa, Iowa—and New Hampshire.”","2628","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"

"You can think of the three minor candidates who were onstage at last night’s Democratic Presidential debate as ghosts, who, in addition to whatever other qualities doomed them to insignificance, represent vanished political types. Lincoln Chafee, as he noted, was the liberal Republican, a once influential, though maybe not numerous, group that was long ago expelled from its original party but has not been fully accepted by its new one. Jim Webb was the Reagan Democrat—the military-culture white Southerner who leans conservative on social issues. Martin O’Malley was the urban Catholic white-ethnic liberal, representing what’s left of the old political machines that produced the Kennedys. None of these groups could be written off in late-twentieth-century presidential politics; now, evidently, they can.","October 14, 2015","2631","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, was the undead: a representative of an ideology, socialism, that was buried with the Eugene Debs campaign of 1912, but now, unaccountably, has been resurrected, with “middle class” replacing “workingmen” in the rhetoric. Yes, Hillary Clinton won the debate, and yes, she will be the Democratic nominee, but the big surprise of the Democratic campaign so far has been voters’ response to Sanders. A year ago, nobody would have predicted that of the other Democratic presidential candidates, Sanders would be the one who mattered.","2632","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"There seems to be more going on here than Sanders’s ability to take advantage of the atypicality of Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two voting states in the campaign for the nomination. More than the other candidates, he has a simple, clear, strong message, which he repeats constantly. The packaging—Brooklyn accent, bad hair—reinforces the sense of angry authenticity. And it’s worth noting that he’s obviously uncomfortable when forced outside the tight box of economic populism. That’s why he has trouble talking about Black Lives Matter and gun control.

"One aspect of Clinton’s adept performance last night was that at every opportunity, she tried to change the subject from her Democratic opponents to the Republicans. She knows they’re her real opponents, and a far more significant obstacle to her becoming President. So, on the evidence of the debate, how do her prospects look? Merely being prepared, assured, and on-message doesn’t guarantee victory. You also have to connect.","2634","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"The big, obvious gap between the two parties at this moment is on non-economic issues. In the Republican debates, it has been interesting to see how difficult a time the more moderate candidates have had creating any general-election breathing room for themselves on issues like abortion, gun control, marriage equality, and immigration. Conversely, it was interesting to see last night how completely comfortable Clinton has become with what not long ago were dangerously liberal positions, even for a Democrat, on these issues. This year Clinton and her party are obviously betting that social issues will break strongly their way. If they turn out to be wrong, that will be an unpleasant surprise for Clinton.","2635","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"The strong feelings that Sanders has tapped into present a greater challenge for Clinton. For one thing, the voters this year, in both parties, are in an anti-Establishment mood—that explains not just Sanders’s popularity, but also Donald Trump’s and Ben Carson’s. Clinton is part of the Establishment, and there’s no way around it. She was also the least anti-Wall Street candidate on the stage last night. It was almost surreal to see Anderson Cooper, the moderator, have to define Glass-Steagall—a Depression-era piece of financial regulation that Bill Clinton effectively repealed when he was President—because the candidates were so eager to talk about it that they forgot the first rule of debate training, which is never to get technical. Clinton noted that as a senator, she represented Wall Street, and her attempts to distance herself from it were obviously well rehearsed, but not even in Sanders’s range, emotionally.","2636","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"In the Times last week, Thomas Edsall wrote a counterintuitive column arguing that the Democrats have become, if not the party of the rich, the party that has the loyalty of most rich people. Clinton would never sign on to that sentiment, but Sanders’s challenge has forced her into speaking supportively about “capitalism” and “business”—not traditionally Democratic terms—onstage. And on the Republican side, though almost everyone’s rhetoric is anti-government, we have not heard defenses of Wall Street in response to the Democrats’ attacks. The Democrats don’t automatically own economic populism in this election.","2637","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"There is no chance that the Republican nominee, whoever it is, will talk like Bernie Sanders. But it’s almost certain that he will argue that, more than Clinton, he understands the behind-the-eight-ball feeling that pervades the American middle class, and propose to do a better job of fixing it than she would. Such an argument won’t necessarily come across as hollow just because it’s coming from a Republican. Bernie Sanders is getting at something powerful, which matters to a lot more people than socialists. Clinton’s biggest challenge is finding her way to a more powerful, and perhaps less prepared, way of persuading the disempowered middle class that she can be its champion.","2638","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"Coming after the drubbing Democrats received in last year’s midterms, Tuesday was another bad Election Day for the Party. In Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, Matt Bevin, a Tea Party Republican who made rolling back the state’s participation in the Affordable Care Act a central part of his platform, defied the opinion polls to win handily, bringing the number of G.O.P. governors across the country to thirty-two. In Virginia, a well-funded Democratic bid to take control of the State Senate failed. In Mississippi, voters rejected an effort to change the state’s constitution to guarantee more funding for public schools. And in Houston, the fourth-largest city in the country, a ballot measure that would have banned discrimination on the basis of age, race, disability, sexual orientation, gender, and a number of other categories was defeated by a wide margin.","November 5, 2015","2639","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"Republicans didn’t take long to place the blame for the Democrats’ woes on President Obama, and to crow about their chances in 2016. “There were 29 democrat governors in 2008,” Ben Walters, a fund-raiser for the Presidential candidate Ben Carson, commented on Twitter. “When Bevin is sworn in there will be 17.” Referring to the election in Virginia, which was closely watched in Washington, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, tweeted, “.@GOP heads into the 2016 election with positive momentum and with the right vision to put our country back on track.”","2640","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"There is no arguing that the Democrats have suffered a series of big setbacks at the local level. In a report issued earlier this year, a Party task force that included Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, and Steve Beshear, the outgoing Democratic governor of Kentucky, noted, “We have suffered devastating losses at all levels of government since 2008 including: 69 House Seats; 13 Senate Seats; 910 State Legislative Seats; 30 State Legislative Chambers; 11 Governorships.”","2641","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"With Bevin’s victory, that last figure is now a round dozen. Even before Tuesday, there were no Democratic governors in states south of the thirty-ninth parallel. Now there aren’t any along a line stretching from the Florida Panhandle to the Great Lakes, either. It’s a similar story in state legislatures. In 2008, the Republicans controlled both chambers in fourteen states; today, they control both chambers in thirty states. Some of these states are sparsely populated, but some aren’t. In five of the ten most-populous states in the country—Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas—Republicans run the governor’s mansion and both houses in the State Legislature. If you look at a map of who controls American politics at the local level, it is a sea of red.","2642","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"How much of this can be put down to dissatisfaction with Obama? In some places, such as Kentucky, where Mitt Romney won more than sixty per cent of the vote in 2012, disapproval of the President clearly played a role. Bevin, and groups supporting him, ran ad after ad seeking to tie the Democratic candidate, Jack Conway, to the President. (Conway, in turn, ran ads trying to distance himself from Obama.) The Republicans also harped on and on about the supposed evils of Obamacare. Since Kentucky is one of the Southern states where the Affordable Care Act has had a lot of success in bringing down the rate of uninsured (Arkansas is another), Bevin’s effectiveness in demonizing health-care reform was depressing, if not entirely surprising. Rather than acknowledging Obamacare’s successes, he played on voter concerns about rising premiums, large deductibles, and restricted doctor choice. In a state with a lot of evangelical Christians, Republican opposition to gay marriage also played a role.","2643","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"The Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza wrote, on Tuesday, that Bevin has Obama to thank for his victory, at least in part. This is true. But before buying the line that Obama has been a disaster for the Democratic Party in general, two other factors should be noted. First, it isn’t anything new for the Party of a two-term President to suffer electoral losses on Capitol Hill and at the local level. It’s the norm, as Philip A. Klinkner, a political scientist at Hamilton College, pointed out in an article on Vox, last month. When Bill Clinton was elected, there were thirty Democratic governors across the country. When he left office, there were seventeen. When George W. Bush entered the White House, there were twenty-nine Republican governors. When he left, there were twenty-two. Judging by the number of governor’s mansions it now controls, the Democratic Party isn’t in worse shape now than it was in 2000.","2644","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"The other factor that needs to be taken into account is a historical one. Support for the Democratic Party and some of its policies was ebbing in Southern states like Kentucky and Mississippi long before Obama came along. The Party’s problems below the Mason-Dixon line date back to the Civil Rights Act and Richard Nixon’s Southern strategy, which was based on attracting disgruntled white Southerners to the G.O.P. Obama’s Presidency may well have sped up the electoral secession of the Confederate states from the Democratic Party, but it didn’t start the process.","2645","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"The big question now, of course, is whether this development is permanent. In mining the demographic trends that are affecting states like Texas and Florida just as much as the rest of the country, particularly the rise of the Hispanic vote, can the Democrats start to recapture some of the ground they’ve lost in the South, and also in states surrounding the Great Lakes, such as Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin?","2646","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"The short answer is that if they do, it is likely to take a while. Next year, there will be another eleven races for state governorships, and the Republicans will be hoping for wins in Missouri and West Virginia, where the Democratic incumbents—Jay Nixon and Earl Ray Tomblin— can’t run again because of term limits. The Democrats’ best shot of a gain might be in North Carolina, where the Democratic attorney general, Roy Cooper, is challenging Pat McCrory, the Republican governor.","2647","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"Since voters will also be picking a President next November, turnout should be considerably higher than it was on Tuesday and in last year’s midterms, which should help Democrats, on balance. Despite Republican inroads into the white working class, most Americans who are poor or living on modest incomes still tend to go Democratic. But getting them to vote in local elections is a big challenge in years when there isn’t a Presidential election. On the other hand, the electoral map favors the Republicans. To the extent that local races continue to be seen as referendums on eight years of Obama in the Oval Office, it is tough to see Democrats doing well in places like Missouri and West Virginia, where the President’s approval ratings are below forty per cent. And even if the Democrats hold steady in 2016, they will face another big challenge in 2018, when thirty-six governor’s mansions will be up for grabs.","2648","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"In addition to exposing Democratic constituencies to Republican efforts to cut social programs, dismantle environmental protections, and weaken labor unions, the Party’s losses at the local level are also handicapping it nationally. More Republican state legislatures means more congressional districts gerrymandered to benefit the G.O.P. And the dearth of Democratic governors is depriving the Party of potential future leaders. When it was at a low ebb during the Reagan years, Southern Democrats like Clinton and Al Gore helped revive it. Today, it is hard to identify their successors.","2649","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"After consoling themselves with their success at the Presidential level, some senior Democrats are finally facing up to the dangers facing the Party and the extent to which it has fallen behind the Republicans in organizing at the local level. The report by the D.N.C. task force acknowledged that the G.O.P.’s “stranglehold on state houses, governorships and congressional seats is a by-product of more than 30 years of organizing, fostering talent and significant financial investments at the state and local level.”","2650","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"Efforts are under way to match the Republicans. Earlier this year, the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democratic donors that includes George Soros, agreed to spend tens of millions of dollars at the local level, on such initiatives as building up progressive networks, launching ballot initiatives, and countering Republican groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council. “People have gotten a wake-up call,” Gara LaMarche, the president of the Democracy Alliance, told the Washington Post. “The right is focused on the state level, and even down-ballot, and has made enormous gains. We can’t have the kind of long-term progressive future we want if we don’t take power in the states.”","2651","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"Smart Democrats recognize that reviving their Party is a long-term project. Ironically, however, they could get a short-term boost at the local level if they lose the White House next year and the G.O.P. retains its majorities in the House and the Senate. With the Republicans exerting complete control in Washington—no screaming, please—there would be the potential for a backlash come the 2018 midterms. Democrats, however, need to do more than pin their hopes on the emergence of another unpopular Republican President.","2652","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"

"With more rumors circulating that Vice-President Joe Biden is about to enter the 2016 race, it’s a good time to take a look at what he might face. A couple of months ago, I suggested that Biden could be a more serious candidate than some people thought. But the obstacles he would face are formidable, and he will have made things even more difficult for himself by not declaring his candidacy prior to last week’s Democratic debate, in Las Vegas. In almost any other country, it would be crazy to suggest that a candidate announcing his candidacy more than a year before Election Day had missed his or her chance. The United States is different, however.","2654","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"In the past decade or two, American Presidential elections have turned into multi-billion-dollar businesses that operate in fifty states, and this imposes certain requirements on the candidates. The obvious one is that they need to raise a lot of money early. The Clinton campaign and groups associated with it have already raised more than a hundred million dollars. Bernie Sanders, who relies largely on small donations, has raised more than forty million dollars. Ultimately, much of this money will go to media companies, in the form of paid advertising. At this stage, however, the main outlays are for building campaign organizations.","2655","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"“You can’t just parachute into a state at the last minute and hope to build a campaign overnight,” Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, told the Times last week. “That’s why we made smart early investments in data, analytics, tech, digital and on-the-ground organizing to build a strong, sturdy campaign designed to fight for and earn every vote in every state.” Biden would have to start from scratch.","2656","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"In appealing to potential staffers, supporters, and donors, he would be able to point to opinion polls suggesting that, currently, he has the backing of somewhere between fifteen per cent and twenty per cent of potential Democratic voters. In late August and early September, as talk of him jumping in got louder, his support rose from the low teens to about twenty per cent, according to the Real Clear Politics poll average. Since then, though, and particularly since the debate in Las Vegas, Biden has dropped back a bit. Three polls that were carried out over the weekend—by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal; ABC News and the Washington Post; and Monmouth University—showed him getting between fifteen per cent and seventeen per cent of the Democratic vote.","2657","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"It isn’t just money and promising poll numbers that Biden lacks. It’s also endorsements in the so-called “invisible primary,” in which the electorate is made up of elected officials and other party notables. From the beginning, the Clinton campaign has made a concerted effort to bring fellow-Democrats onboard. According to an unofficial count kept by The Hill, a hundred and twenty-four senators and congressmen have already endorsed Clinton. The rest of the candidates—from both parties—have sixty endorsements between them.","2658","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"That’s just the disparity on Capitol Hill. Last week, Julián Castro, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, became the second member of President Obama’s cabinet to endorse Clinton. (Tom Vilsack, the Secretary of Agriculture, endorsed her earlier this year.) Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio, is one of the leading Hispanic politicians in the country. On Tuesday, the Clinton campaign announced another raft of endorsements, by more than fifty African-American mayors across the country. “Whether it’s her vision for economic fairness and shared prosperity or her steadfast commitment to comprehensive criminal justice reform—it’s clear that Hillary Clinton is the best candidate to be our next president,” Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, South Carolina, and the president of the African American Mayors Association, said in a statement issued by the Clinton campaign.","2659","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Picking up the most endorsements doesn’t guarantee a candidate victory. Historically, however, it has been a pretty good predictor of the eventual winner. The exception came in 2008, when Clinton picked up a lot of early endorsements but ended up losing to Barack Obama.","2660","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Biden is no Obama, of course. He doesn’t have the youth, the excitement factor, or the opportunity to present his potential ascendancy to the Oval Office as a historic turning point. (As a Hillary supporter pointed out to me yesterday, he is, after all, “another old white guy.”) What the Vice-President does have is a wealth of political experience, a reputation for honesty, and relatively high favorability ratings—and not just among Democrats. According to the Huffington Post’s polling average, forty-nine per cent of Americans think favorably of Biden, and 37.1 per cent think unfavorably of him. Clinton, by contrast, has a favorability rating of 42.2 per cent and an unfavorability rating of 51.2 per cent. (Biden also has slightly higher favorability ratings than Obama.)","2661","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"In a general election, Biden’s likability could serve him well. To get that far, though, he’s going to have persuade a lot of Democrats—Clinton and Sanders supporters, especially—to switch to him, and that won’t be easy. There is little in the polling data to suggest that the Democratic electorate is crying out for new candidates to enter the race. Many progressives like Sanders, and Clinton appeals to a broad range of Democrats. In the new Monmouth University poll, seventy-seven per cent of Democratic voters and voters who lean toward the party said that they had a favorable opinion of her. Other surveys report similar findings.","2662","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Campaigns are narratives that occupy mental space in the minds of voters. Right now, Clinton and Sanders are filling most of that mental space, and the plot has been set: insider versus outsider; establishment favorite versus scrappy underdog; first woman in the White House versus first socialist in the White House. The debate in Las Vegas confirmed this narrative. If Biden is going to bust the primary race open, he will need to provide a compelling justification for his candidacy, likely one that goes beyond the personal saga of a decent man and dedicated public servant who is seeking to fulfill the hopes of his dead son—touching and uplifting as that would be. What sort of larger narrative could that be?","2663","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Conceivably, Biden could run as a candidate who can bring together not just Democrats but Americans at large—someone who will fulfill the promise of Obama’s 2008 campaign. At this stage, however, it’s far from clear that voters in the Democrat primary are looking for a unifier. After watching the Republicans frustrate a Democratic President for eight years, many of them may prefer an outsider, like Sanders, or a partisan battler who knows how to overcome political opposition—“a progressive who likes to get things done,” as Clinton describes herself.","2664","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Realistically, Biden’s only option would be to run a populist campaign, portraying himself as a passionate defender of the middle class who will stick up for the little guy. But, of course, Clinton and Sanders are already doing that, so Biden’s pitch would have to be that he’s more authentic than they are—that he’s someone who rides Amtrak, lives modestly, supports labor unions, is skeptical of overseas military engagements, and has an emotional bond to ordinary Americans. Of course, he would also advertise his experience, his service as Vice-President, and his policy platform (whatever that might be). But the main selling point would be the one that Huey Long and other self-made populists have used to great effect: I am one of you.","2665","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"To pull off such a strategy, Biden would have to demonstrate a level of political skill that was largely absent in his previous two Presidential campaigns: in 1988 and 2008. He would also need to explain away some lines on his résumé, such as his support for a 2005 bankruptcy law that Elizabeth Warren and other critics of the financial industry regarded as a sop to credit-card companies. And, even if Biden managed to do all this, he might still need some unintended help from Clinton, or from the F.B.I. agents who are looking into how, as Secretary of State, she and her colleagues handled confidential information.","2666","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"To sum up, the Vice-President is a long shot. In the online betting markets, the odds of him getting the nomination are about four to one, which implies that the probability of him winning is about twenty per cent. After his failure to show up in Las Vegas—a major error if he was seriously intent on running—I’d guess that the real probability is even lower than that. But, if we’ve learned anything thus far in the campaign, it’s that the unexpected can happen.","2667","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Last week was a good one for Hillary Clinton. It started with her appearance on “Saturday Night Live.” Kate McKinnon did her customary Clinton impression, this time sitting in a bar, trying to forget about Donald Trump. Clinton played Val the bartender, who seemed to embody how the former Secretary of State would like to be seen: as a hardworking, wryly funny older friend, whose earned wisdom you can turn to at the end of a long day. They sang “Lean On Me,” and, after Clinton left, McKinnon pronounced, “She was real and smart and really nice in person!”","2668","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Two days later, the “Today” show found Clinton flipping pancakes for voters in New Hampshire. When she was asked yet again about her e-mail accounts, she dismissed the question and cited the extraordinarily impolitic boast made a few days earlier by the House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, who had told Fox’s Sean Hannity, “Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today?” The Republicans were embarrassed, and Clinton benefitted. Last Thursday, McCarthy was forced to drop out of the race to succeed John Boehner as Speaker of the House.","2669","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Clinton is still scheduled to testify before the Benghazi committee a week after the first Democratic Presidential debate, which will be sponsored by CNN and held on October 13th, in Las Vegas. The Benghazi hearings would seem to have little credibility left, but both events will mark a new stage of the campaign for Clinton, one in which she will have to relinquish the tight control she has maintained over her appearances. At the debate, she will be joined onstage by Bernie Sanders, who has launched a strong challenge and is now favored by twenty-five per cent of likely Democratic voters, to her forty-two per cent, and by Martin O’Malley, Lincoln Chafee, and Jim Webb, all of whom are polling in the one-per-cent range. Vice-President Biden, because he is polling at around eighteen per cent, is eligible to take part, even if he declares at the last minute.","2670","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Biden’s role has been a big open question. Another is why this first debate is so late in coming. The Republicans have already had two, each of which attracted more than twenty million television viewers, and will stage ten more. The Democratic National Committee has authorized only six. One is the Saturday night before Christmas; another is the Sunday night before Martin Luther King, Jr., Day—not times likely to attract large audiences. Given the concerns about the Presidency being passed between a couple of families, why set up a schedule that seems designed to squelch lesser-known candidates’ chances?","2671","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"The lesser-knowns have objected, but Clinton doesn’t seem to mind. One reason for that might be gleaned by looking back to October 30, 2007, when the Democrats debated in Philadelphia. Clinton was the front-runner then, too, and it was the thirteenth time the candidates had met. But it was also, arguably, the first time that her opponents—Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson, John Edwards, Christopher Dodd, Joe Biden, and, most improbably, Barack Obama—seriously challenged her, on all fronts. Edwards accused her of “doubletalk.” Obama called her out for “changing positions whenever it’s politically convenient”—she was “for NAFTA previously, now she’s against it”—and for not being “truthful.” A lot of the time was taken up asking why records of her official work in her husband’s White House were sealed in the Clinton Presidential library. She responded with what must have been intended as judiciousness but came across as obfuscation. When Tim Russert, one of the moderators, tried to determine whether she was in favor of issuing driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants—she had indicated both yes and no—she called his question a “gotcha.”","2672","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"In the days that followed, Clinton and her campaign tried to frame the debate as a Hillary-against-the-world moment, a “pile-on,” orchestrated by what she called, in a speech at Wellesley College, “the all-boys’ club.” Clinton had been considered the winner in most of the previous debates, and even many of her supporters acknowledged that this one marked a turning point. A week before, she was at 48.5 per cent in an average of polls, the highest she had ever been. (Obama registered 21.2.) Immediately afterward, she began a decline and, despite some rebounds, never matched that number again.","2673","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"From her perspective, there may have been something broken about the 2008 debates. A remarkable eighteen million people voted for her during the primary season, and she and her supporters may feel that a process that derailed her then is not one to follow now. But, if Clinton has concluded that the lesson of 2008 is to avoid debates, she does not yet understand why she lost that night in Philadelphia. Polls still show that a perception of dishonesty is her greatest problem among voters. (“They don’t trust you. They might not like you,” Savannah Guthrie told her last week.) Often, that perception is the product of unfair partisan attacks, but, as in 2008, it is also sometimes the result of her decisions. Last Wednesday, Clinton announced that she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that is a high priority for President Obama, even though she had praised the negotiations when she was Secretary of State (“the gold standard in trade agreements”) and referred to them proudly after she left office.","2674","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"The thinking appears to be that she’ll score points with Sanders voters and with organized labor, while Biden, as a loyal member of the Administration, will have to support the T.P.P.—a classic triangulation. But it echoes Obama’s nafta comment from the Philadelphia debate, just as the questions about her White House records now sound like a prelude to the e-mail issue. Fair or not, she needs to push herself to a greater level of openness, and figure out how to have a good week based on a real-world confrontation, not a comedy-sketch encounter. Clinton stayed in the 2008 race for eight months after her loss in Philadelphia. By the end, Barack Obama was a palpably stronger candidate. So, for that matter, was Hillary Clinton. A few weeks after Philadelphia, she had picked herself up and gone to the next debate, in Las Vegas—the site of this week’s meeting—where she performed well. The last question, from a young woman, was a “fun” one: “Do you prefer diamonds or pearls?” Clinton laughed. “Now, I know I’m sometimes accused of not being able to make a choice,” she said. Then she added, “I want both.” ♦","2675","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"

"In November, 1954, Dwight D. Eisenhower was mulling a matter that he mulled with some frequency: the effects of age on someone in a stressful, non-stop job like his. He’d been President for nearly two years and, in his diary, wrote down some of the reasons why seeking a second term might be a bad idea: “The greater likelihood that a man of 70 will break down under a load than a man of 50,” a need for “younger men in positions of the highest responsibility so as to symbolize the youth, vigor and virility of the Republican Party,” and, perhaps above all, the “growing severity and complexity of problems that rest upon the President for solution.” As far as he knew, he was in good shape, but intimations of mortality shadowed him, and he thought a lot about the next political generation. At a White House political dinner a few days before Christmas, he said, “We have got to begin right now, at the state level and at the precinct level, to see to it that the Party puts up the right kind of young man to run in ’56. All the programs in the world, and all the Eisenhower prestige, cannot elect some revolting old Republican hack against a youthful, able, and personable Democrat.”","September 23, 2015","2693","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"Modern readers will note a certain gender bias in phrases like “a man of 70,” “the right kind of young man,” and “virility,” and should know that these somewhat depressed observations came soon after the midterms, in which Democrats took control of the Senate and House, by majorities that the party would keep for decades. Eisenhower’s worries became far more intense several months later, in late September, 1955, when he suffered a major heart attack.","2694","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"This is a roundabout way of getting to the sensitive, impolite subject of when, if ever, a candidate might be too old for the Presidency. It is a question whose premise, in an era when the word “ageism” is embedded in the language, many are inclined to reject, in part because the motives for asking it tend to be suspect. The thuggish wing of the talk-radio community uses the age question to undermine Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, who will be sixty-eight in October. That makes her more than a year younger than Donald Trump, although age is the least of many concerns about him. Age should certainly count a lot less than the goofy ideas and inexperience demonstrated by too many Republicans. But the curious absence of a new political generation should concern Democrats, and a party whose other poll-leading 2016 candidates, declared and not, are Bernie Sanders, who is seventy-four, and Joe Biden, who will be seventy-three in November. (Barely registering in the polls are Jim Webb, who is sixty-nine, and Martin O’Malley, a relative teen at fifty-two.) Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Mike Huckabee are in their early sixties, but, for better or worse, Republicans also have half a dozen contenders in their forties and fifties. The distinct problem for the Democrats isn’t the presence of elders; it’s the absence of young women and men with the potential to be credible national candidates.","2695","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"Apart from Ronald Reagan, who at sixty-nine was the oldest President ever to be elected, Americans have tended to choose younger men for the office. Franklin D. Roosevelt was fifty when he won his first term; John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama were in their forties. Even Eisenhower, grandfatherly affect and all, was only sixty-two when he won the White House for the first time.","2696","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"In the early winter of 1956, as the next Presidential cycle began and Eisenhower recovered from his heart attack, he wrote to his childhood friend Edward E. (Swede) Hazlett to say, “We all know that when advancing years and diminishing energy begin to take their toll, the last one that ever appreciates such a situation is the victim himself.” In another letter, to a doctor who’d recently examined him and thought that he was healthy enough to run again, Ike expressed still more doubts. In “contemplating my own future duty,” he compared his job to that of a quarterback: “He may have all of the wisdom to be derived from years of experience in the game. But when the need arises, he has to throw himself unreservedly into the play…. If we merely needed a brain on the field, a quarterback could play if he had to be in a wheelchair; but that isn’t true in his case, nor is it in the Presidency.”","2697","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"At the end of February, 1956, a month after sending that letter, Eisenhower announced that he would indeed seek a second term, though he planned to let Vice-President Richard Nixon do most of the campaigning. Ike went on to win reëlection in a landslide. But his health was shakier than his doctors were willing to say, and he suffered two more serious medical alarms—ileitis, an intestinal condition, in the summer of 1956, and a minor stroke, in the fall of 1957. In October, 1960, he marked his seventieth birthday, which, until the Reagan era, made him the oldest President ever to serve.","2698","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"The country fifty-five years ago was lucky that it all turned out as it did. It was also another reminder, just ten years after Roosevelt’s death, that choosing a Vice-President is a serious matter. During the 1956 campaign, the Democratic candidate, Adlai Stevenson, made an issue of Eisenhower’s health—and the possibility that Nixon, deeply hated by Democrats, might become President. Democrats, without a successor generation in clear view, may get lucky in 2016, especially facing a Republican field whose contenders include people who say, inexplicably, as they did in last week’s debate, that George W. Bush left the country safer (Jeb Bush), or that vaccines may cause autism (Trump), or that it’s worth shutting down the government to defund Planned Parenthood (Ted Cruz, Chris Christie). Sixty years ago, Eisenhower was willing to consider the nation’s welfare ahead of personal ambition. That was an impulse rarely glimpsed in last week’s Republican debate.","2699","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"

"The days when Labor Day marked the beginning of the electoral season have long gone. Thanks to information technology, money, and the Supreme Court, we live in the era of the permanent campaign. But the end of summer still feels like a significant marker, and it provides a good moment to take stock of a set of events that surely would have prompted the good Doctor, had he been alive to chronicle them, to send out for another bottle of Wild Turkey.","2701","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Let’s start, as we must, at Trump Tower, where, last Thursday, Reince Priebus, the boyish-looking forty-three-year-old who has the unenviable task of heading up the Republican National Committee, presented a piece of paper to the fellow whose name is on the building. “I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,” the words on the paper said. “I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.” Donald Trump filled in his name in a blank space at the start of the text and signed at the bottom. He or someone else got the date wrong, writing August 3rd instead of September 3rd, but that didn’t matter: the deed had been done.","2702","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"A few weeks ago, when the loyalty pledge was first mooted, it looked like a clever insurance policy for the Republicans. After all, if Trump were to run as an independent and win even four or five per cent of the vote, he could easily hand the Presidential election to the Democrats. But as Trump extended and enlarged his position as the G.O.P. frontrunner, Priebus’s ploy came to take on a rather different aspect. From the vantage of Trump and his advisers, it must have seemed as if the Republican establishment, which they hold in utter disdain, were repeating the mistake of the Trojans and pulling the Greek horse into its midst.","2703","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"If Trump’s candidacy fails, as Priebus and his colleagues are dearly hoping that it will, whoever wins the Republican nomination won’t have to worry about Trump running as a third-party candidate: that’s the theory, anyway. But for the author of “The Art of the Deal,” this was a concession well worth making. For one thing, it assured him that his name will be on the G.O.P. primary ballot in every state, including those, like South Carolina, that had made (or threatened to make) a loyalty pledge a pre-condition for participating. Secondly, the signed pledge goes at least some way toward immunizing Trump against the charge that Jeb Bush had levelled at him on the very morning he signed it: that he isn’t a real conservative, or even a genuine Republican.","2704","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Finally, and most importantly from Trump’s standpoint, if all the other G.O.P. hopefuls go down—or rather, if they fail to get up from the prostrate position Trump’s summer stampede through the polls has left most of them in—the pledge insures that Trump will be guaranteed the support of the party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. As Jim Newell remarked at Slate, “Trump has not pledged to incorporate into his candidacy any of the cheerier tones or traditional Republican policies that the GOP establishment would like to see from him. The Republican Party, though, has agreed to incorporate Trump.” No wonder that, once Preibus had left, Trump called in the press and said he “will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands.” He added: “We will go out and fight hard, and we will win. We will win.”","2705","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"That remains an unlikely outcome, but not nearly as unlikely as it seemed a couple of months ago. Monmouth University’s poll data for June showed Trump’s favorable rating among likely Republican voters to be twenty per cent and his unfavorable rating to be fifty-five per cent. In Monmouth’s latest poll, which was released last week, Trump’s favorable rating among Republicans had jumped to fifty-nine per cent, and his unfavorable rating had fallen to twenty-nine per cent. Even in an era of declining party loyalty and footloose voters, these numbers represent an astonishing turnaround—and one that has sent pollsters searching, largely in vain, for a historical analogy. It isn’t unheard of for a previously unknown candidate to take off like a rocket before exploding at high altitude. But Trump wasn’t an unknown. He was a familiar television personality and blowhard, about whom the majority of Republicans harbored critical opinions. In just a couple of months, he has reversed many of those opinions, raising his positive rating by nearly forty percentage points and lowering his negative rating by almost thirty points.","2706","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Political scientists will be arguing for years about how he managed this feat. Clearly, his critical comments about Mexicans, and his pledge to deport as many as eleven million undocumented immigrants, struck a chord, as did his promise to renegotiate trade agreements that have cost jobs. But what really seems to have enthused the Republican electorate is Trump’s renegade attitude toward the Party establishment and the press. Every time he describes Washington as a hopeless cesspit, paints Jeb Bush as an ineffectual ninny, and jumps on anybody in the media who tries to question him, his numbers go up. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Real Clear Politics poll average showed him leading Ben Carson, another political outsider, by 27.8 per cent to 13.5 per cent at the national level, with all the other candidates stuck in single figures.","2707","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Developments on the Democratic side have been a bit less dramatic, but pretty remarkable nonetheless. At the start of the year, practically nobody in Washington took seriously the prospect of a Bernie Sanders Presidential candidacy. Indeed, some Hillary Clinton supporters were hoping that he would run, on the grounds that he would fill a potentially dangerous void to the left of Clinton with an unelectable presence. Now Sanders is running well ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire, the second primary state, and he’s gaining ground in Iowa, the first primary state.","2708","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The level of concern in the Clinton camp is perhaps best conveyed by two reports that appeared in the Times in the past few days, which were based on briefings from Clinton staffers and supporters. One of the stories said that, going forward, the candidate would seek to present a more likable side, demonstrating that she possesses a sense of humor and a beating heart. The other Times article said that the Clinton campaign is hoping to build a “political firewall across the South” starting on Super Tuesday, March 1st, when a dozen states, nine of them below the Mason-Dixon line, will vote in the Democratic primary. A firewall to contain Sanders? He was supposed to be incapable of lighting a gas stove, let alone sparking a raging brush fire.","2709","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"How did the Democratic primary come to this? Sanders deserves credit for recognizing that there is a resurgent progressive movement in the United States, one based on the proposition—shared by many Tea Party members, and even Trump—that American politics is now hopelessly corrupt. Once Elizabeth Warren made it clear that she wasn’t interested in acting as the movement’s standard-bearer in 2016, Sanders seized the opportunity. As the lone Socialist in Congress, he was never going to be accused of being an opportunist or a Johnny-come-lately to the progressive cause. But, at the age of seventy-three, he needed to show that he had the fire and the durability to be a Presidential candidate. This he has certainly done. Rather than engaging Clinton directly, he has stuck to the issues, calling for the public financing of elections, free enrollment at state universities, a breakup of the big banks, and a minimum wage of fifteen dollars an hour. All of these policies are popular, particularly with college-educated liberals, who have been flocking to Sanders in huge numbers.","2710","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The Vermont senator has earned his current position in the race. But he has also received a good deal of help from Clinton, who, despite the endorsement of many senior figures in the Party, is still struggling to recover from some self-inflicted wounds. Earlier in the year, when the stories about her private e-mail system and the tangled finances of the Clinton Global Foundation started to come out, it seemed like the money story would prove the most serious, but it is the e-mail saga that has plagued Clinton’s every step. It continues to damage her reputation. Recently, pollsters from Quinnipiac University asked a random sample of voters which word they most associated with various candidates. When Clinton’s name was mentioned, the three most popular answers were “liar,” “dishonest,” and “untrustworthy.”","2711","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"After this poll received a lot of publicity, some Hillary supporters argued that Quinnipiac had hyped the findings, and they raised some sound points. Out of a sample of fifteen hundred and sixty-three voters, a hundred and eighty-seven people answered “liar,” and it’s probably fair to assume that the vast majority were Republicans. (The sample contained six hundred and sixty-six self-identified Republicans.) Undoubtedly, much of the venom directed at Clinton is coming from ardent G.O.P. supporters, and this shouldn’t be overlooked. But it’s also true that her approval rating among independent and moderate voters has fallen sharply. In a P.P.P. poll released in April, fifty per cent of self-identified moderates had a favorable opinion of Clinton, and forty-one per cent had an unfavorable opinion. Now these numbers have flipped. A P.P.P. poll released last week showed that thirty-nine per cent of moderates view Clinton favorably, and forty-nine per cent view her unfavorably.*","2712","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The e-mail saga has surely helped to drive this turnaround. While Clinton’s insistence that she didn’t break any laws or violate any rules appears to be true, her explanation for why she did it—for the sake of convenience—beggars belief. The more she repeats this line, the harder it seems to be for voters to avoid the conclusion that she has something to hide. Last week, Clinton told NBC News’s Andrea Mitchell that she wasn’t thinking much about the server when she set it up. “We had so many problems around the world,” Clinton said. “I didn’t really stop and think, What kind of e-mail system will there be?” The day after the interview, the Washington Post reported that Clinton had personally paid a State Department staffer to set up the private e-mail server, maintain it, and keep it going. And in case you missed it, the staffer, Bryan Pagliano, has reportedly indicated that he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence rather than testify before Congress.","2713","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"To state the obvious, it’s a worrying situation for Clinton. In the past few months, she has laid out a series of liberal-leaning policies on everything from student loans to day care to short-termism on Wall Street. (On Tuesday, she outlined her plans for campaign-finance reform.) Once the televised Democratic debates get started, in October, this extensive and detailed platform, together with Clinton’s ability to master complex policy issues, should place her in a strong position. But for all the political good it’s done her so far, she could have spent her time quoting from the Book of Deuteronomy (or Thompson’s favorite, the Book of Revelation). In media coverage of the Clinton campaign, and particularly in broadcast coverage, the e-mail story has overshadowed everything else, and it isn’t going away.","2714","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"On Monday, the Times reported that an intelligence review has concluded that some of the information Clinton received at her personal account was “top secret,” although it wasn’t marked classified at the time. In all probability, there will be more such stories. Indeed, as Labor Day approached, Clinton appeared to be trapped in the same kind of three-sided vice that, over the decades, has crushed many Washington figures. Simultaneously, she had to contend with an F.B.I. investigation into whether classified information was mishandled; a hostile Congressional committee under the control of the opposition party; and a media eager to report any damaging leaks from the authorities. Small wonder that Vice-President Joe Biden was seriously considering a late entry into the Democratic race.","2715","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"All this, and there are still five months until the first primary voter casts a ballot. Before crowning Trump or burying Clinton, it is worth keeping this reality in mind—and a few others, too, such as the fact that early leads in primary races often prove ephemeral. It is certainly possible that Trump will go ahead and win the Republican nomination, but as Larry Sabato and his colleagues at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics said of Trump, in a post at Politico on Monday, “It’s far more likely he will fade long before the primary season does.” Only now is he being subjected to sustained attacks from other Republicans, and, as yet, the media scrutiny of his record has been cursory. For instance, we are still awaiting the first major investigative report into how many undocumented immigrants are employed at the hotels and golf courses that bear Trump’s name. While his bombast has served him well so far, he could yet overreact to criticism and self-destruct.","2716","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"On the Democratic side, Clinton remains highly popular inside her own party, and she has the support of important interest groups that help to mobilize Democratic voters. In the latest national poll of Democrats and voters who lean Democrat, which was released by Monmouth on Tuesday, she was leading Biden by twenty percentage points and Sanders by twenty-two percentage points. Among the electorate at large, Clinton’s favorable rating has fallen well below fifty per cent. But among the Democratic electorate, seventy-one per cent of voters have a favorable view of the former Secretary of State, and just seventeen per cent have an unfavorable view.","2717","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Seeking to solidify her position and change the post-Labor Day media narrative, Clinton on Tuesday apologized for setting up her own e-mail server, telling ABC News’s David Muir, “That was a mistake. I’m sorry about that. I take responsibility.” It remains to be seen what impact, if any, this statement will have on the polls, but many of Clinton’s supporters will welcome the interview as a step in the right direction. “As long as the email mess doesn’t sink her, Clinton could lose both heavily white Iowa and New Hampshire, and still have a fairly unobstructed path to the nomination because of her mighty position with women and minorities,” Sabato and his colleagues wrote on Politico. “This is true even if Vice President Joe Biden enters the race.”","2718","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"I’m not sure whether that final assertion takes account of the possibility of Biden jumping into the race with Elizabeth Warren as his running mate. Last week, a Boston Globe reporter asked Warren whether she and Biden had discussed this possibility during a recent meeting at the Vice-President’s residence. Rather than giving a straight answer, Warren smiled and said merely that the conversation had been a long one.","2719","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"

"“The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don’t trust the media,” Senator Ted Cruz said last night, drawing himself up in a way that made him appear to slightly inflate. Sweeping his arm across the stage, at the University of Colorado, in Boulder, he said, “This is not a cage match. And, you look at the questions: ‘Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?’ ‘Ben Carson, can you do math?’ ‘John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?’ ‘Marco Rubio, why don’t you resign?’ ‘Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?’ How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?” He got a big round of applause, which Carlos Quintanilla, one of the moderators for CNBC, tried to interrupt, asking, “Do we get credit…,” before Cruz interrupted him again.","October 29, 2015","2722","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"“The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was ‘Which of you is more handsome and why?’ ” Cruz said. That wasn’t quite how anyone who saw that debate would remember it, but the Senator just shook his head, compared the Democrats to “the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks,” and wondered at the implausibility of a debate moderator voting in a Republican primary. Quintanilla tried again to be heard over the laughter of the crowd before he managed to say, somewhat forlornly, “I asked you about the debt limit and I got no answer.”","2723","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"For the record, this was the question that inspired Cruz’s rant about insubstantiality: “Congressional Republicans, Democrats, and the White House are about to strike a compromise that would raise the debt limit, prevent a government shutdown and calm financial markets that fear of—another Washington-created crisis is on the way. Does your opposition to it show that you’re not the kind of problem-solver American voters want?” Given that Cruz’s previous responses to such crises have included filibustering the Senate with a reading of “Green Eggs and Ham,” and that he has, in just the past month, been involved in a squabble with his fellow-Republicans over his efforts to make the debt ceiling a hostage in the fight against Planned Parenthood, it was a pretty good question, which Cruz blithely ignored. And yet, in the brief tussle that followed, Cruz managed to make it sound as if he were being unjustly denied a chance to turn to the debt ceiling as the questioning moved on to the next candidate.","2724","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"Even before the debate ended, CNBC was being roundly criticized—Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, tweeted that CNBC “should be ashamed of how this debate was handled”—and, to be clear, the moderators did fail. But not for the reasons that the Republican candidates gave: Rubio said that “the Democrats have the ultimate Super PAC. It’s called the mainstream media”; Carson called a question “propaganda”; Chris Christie complained that he wasn’t being asked about ISIS, even though this was a debate about business and the economy. Nor was it because their questions were especially marked by infotainment froth. It is because the moderators utterly failed to control a group of candidates whose level of detachment from facts and vitriol seemed to surprise them when it shouldn’t have.","2725","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"It’s unclear what anyone’s best-case scenario for this debate would have been, in terms of real engagement with the issues. The shallowness of much of the rhetoric in the campaign can lead to simple questions that, to some ears, sound simplistic, but have to be asked, such as why the math in Carson’s very vague budget proposals doesn’t add up, or why, as another moderator, John Harwood, asked Donald Trump, his talk about forcing Mexico to build a wall “and make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others” (Trump: “That’s right”) didn’t amount to “a comic-book version of a Presidential campaign.” The moderators just didn’t account for the pits of deep ugliness in those shallows and didn’t know how to navigate them. They weren’t prepared for candidates who called them liars, and who, by the end, were simply ignoring both questions and time limits. Carly Fiorina, notably, just started talking when she wanted; at the very end, she had a brief blinking contest with Harwood, who surrendered with a weary “All right, go ahead.” Again, by this point in the campaign, the moderators really should have known better.","2726","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"For example, when Becky Quick asked Trump why he’d been critical of Mark Zuckerberg’s call for more H1B visas for tech workers, and Trump denied that he had been, she seemed surprised, saying, “Where did I read this and come up with this that you were?”—as if he would tell her. “I don’t know—you people write the stuff,” Trump said. A minute later, when Quick tried to follow up by noting that Trump had called Marco Rubio “Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Senator because he was in favor of the H1B,” Trump replied, “I never said that. I never said that.”","2727","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"“So this was an erroneous article the whole way around?” Quick said. “My apologies. I’m sorry.” It took until after a commercial break for her to discover that the quotes had come from Trump’s own Web site. He didn’t apologize, and it didn’t matter. Cruz had set a model for his colleagues that night: people hate reporters. Just insult them and you’ll be fine, regardless of the question you’ve been asked. It was similar to a moment Newt Gingrich had, during a debate in 2012, when he gained momentum by telling off John King, of CNN. But that was a rejection of questions about Gingrich’s personal life (“despicable” questions, Gingrich said) and not of fact-based queries altogether.","2728","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"There were some bad and petty questions. Quick pressed too much and with too much alarm about Rubio, the father of four school-age children, taking money out of his retirement savings, at a cost to him and his family of thousands of dollars. It’s more Suze Orman’s job to berate people about things like that, and what Rubio did is neither unethical nor disqualifying. Then again, it allowed him to play to his strengths, saying, “Here’s the truth. I didn’t inherit any money. My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.” He said that after getting married he had to explain to his wife “why someone named Sallie Mae was taking a thousand dollars out of our bank account every month.” Rubio did well all around (my colleague John Cassidy writes about why he was the big winner), including when Jeb Bush tried, with an ill-conceived feint, to cut him down.","2729","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"The issue was Rubio’s frequent absence from the Senate—the occasion for another of the questions Cruz objected to, based on a call in an editorial in Florida’s Sun-Sentinel for Rubio to resign. Rubio had already dealt with the question, inevitably, by attacking the press: “It’s actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today,” he said of the editorial. Bush asked if he could jump in, “because I’m a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.” Whoever told Bush, who so often in his life has been given well-paid opportunities through family or political connections, that he should put Rubio in his place by calling him an employee who had failed to provide good “service” is not advising him very well. When Rubio asked why Bush didn’t mind that Senator John McCain, whom he’d cited as a model, had missed a lot of votes, Bush underscored the patron play by saying, “He wasn’t my senator.”","2730","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"“Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,” Rubio said. And maybe it would have, if Bush had any aptitude for this sort of thing. But he lost the stage, having demonstrated only the sort of petulance that he showed last weekend, when he complained that there were a lot of “really cool things” that he could be doing besides running for President. His only memorable moment came when he bragged about how well his fantasy-football team was doing—“Gronkowski is still going strong!”—better, it seems, than his fantasy Presidential campaign.","2731","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"The Republicans might have liked a “successful” debate even less. Trump’s campaign had fought with CNBC to make sure that the debate wouldn’t go too long and that there would be closing statements, and Trump used that time to say that he had fought CNBC and won: “In about two minutes, I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.” But, once we do go out, where do we go?","2732","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"“You know, my name comes from the word shomer: guardian, watcher,” Senator Chuck Schumer told the host of a Jewish radio program in 2010. “My ancestors were guardians of the ghetto wall in Chortkov. And I believe Hashem actually gave me that name. One of my roles, very important in the United States Senate, is to be a shomer, to be the shomer Yisrael”—the guardian of Israel—“and I will continue to be that with every bone in my body.” Schumer and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s efforts to rally Democratic opposition to President Obama’s Iran nuclear deal have now failed. On Tuesday, the support of Senators Richard Blumenthal, Ron Wyden, and Gary Peters assured Obama that any Republican resolution of disapproval would not even come up for a vote. But the extraordinary identity Schumer was claiming—to be a “guardian of Israel,” without apparent fear of being at odds with American foreign policy or the Democratic Party—may be the greater loss. It’s hard to see how AIPAC, and Schumer, come out of the Iran fight with the authority they had going in.","September 9, 2015","2733","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s story, which he is sticking to, is that Israel and AIPAC have won a moral victory. Dore Gold, the director-general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, told Israel’s Army Radio that Netanyahu never intended to keep the deal from being approved but rather to raise awareness about its perils. “Most of Congress is against the deal,” as is Isaac Herzog, who leads the opposition in the Knesset, Gold added. He then returned to the claims that Netanyahu made in his speech before Congress in March—that the deal was bad, that it endangered Israel—which might have been mistaken for an attempt to convince American legislators to reject it.","2734","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"AIPAC’s influence was first advanced, in the nineteen-seventies, by hard-line Democratic senators like Henry Jackson and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who felt that the State Department was controlled by Eisenhower-era Republicans who were too indebted to oil interests and not adequately sympathetic to Israel’s plight. Ever since AIPAC managed to coördinate the defeat of Republican Senator Charles Percy, in 1984 (Percy was then the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and had argued that Jewish settlements preëmpt Palestinian rights), AIPAC has been able to present itself as a powerhouse, flush with money, focussed on Congress, and with strong claims on both Republican hawks and evangelicals and the Democratic center. Tom Dine and Steven Grossman, AIPAC leaders in the eighties and nineties, were Democratic operatives; Grossman went on to become the chairman of the Democratic National Committee under Bill Clinton. President Obama courted AIPAC’s support in 2008, assuring attendees of its yearly conference that Jerusalem would be “undivided.”","2735","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Israel, in AIPAC’s playbook, is the best judge of its defense needs, a sister democracy, and, besides, a strategic asset in a volatile region. (It proved this for the first time in September, 1970, when Israeli jets helped protect the Jordanian monarch from a Palestinian insurgency and Syrian invasion.) Schumer’s opposition to the Iran deal was supposed to signal that AIPAC remained influential among Democratic principals and fund-raisers, and that the man who chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2005 to 2009, and is now the favorite to lead Senate Democrats when Harry Reid retires, could still fend off challenges to Israeli policy—if, for example, the U.N. Security Council were to vote on another resolution condemning West Bank settlements. The signal, meant to be cautionary, seems rather weak.","2736","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Even if, as some claim, Schumer came out against Obama only because he knew he could not muster the votes to override a Presidential veto, he surely expected to make a better showing. Now progressive groups like MoveOn have rallied Democratic insurgents to call Schumer’s prospective Senate leadership into question. AIPAC officials know that Netanyahu is to blame for emancipating Democrats from AIPAC’s embrace. “Netanyahu’s speech in Congress made the Iranian issue a partisan one,” an AIPAC official told Israel’s Walla!News. “As soon as he insisted on going ahead with this move, which was perceived as a Republican maneuver against the President, we lost a significant part of the Democratic Party, without which it was impossible to block the agreement.” AIPAC’s efforts to exploit Herzog’s opposition to the deal were almost as counterproductive, given that the deal has the support of Israeli Army and intelligence leaders. Amos Yadlin, the man who Herzog said would have been his defense minister, had he defeated Netanyahu, said that the deal should not be opposed.* As Channel Two’s veteran analyst Amnon Abramovitch told me, “Herzog’s effort to gain some reputation for ‘security’ and lean to the center is an understandable political move.

"Schumer’s declaration of guardianship is not only a political but also a personal statement, and part of how many Jewish Americans of his generation understand their secular Jewish distinctiveness. It conjures the embattled, vulnerable Jews of their parents’ generation, in what often appears to be a passion play. If there is a Netanyahu at the center of this history, it is not Benjamin, the son, but Benzion, the father, who, in the early nineteen-forties, was one of the leaders of the Revisionist Zionism movement in the U.S. and, with Hillel Kook (then known as Peter Bergson), helped found the Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People of Europe. Kook and Netanyahu publicly railed against American Jewish leaders like Rabbi Stephen Wise, who was close to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, for not doing enough to raise public consciousness about the plight of European Jews. “They cannot claim, with a clear conscience, to have done everything within their power to save those condemned people,” Benzion Netanyahu wrote in 1944. “They have been too cautious, too appeasing, and too ready to swallow the meaningless statements of sympathy that were issued from high places.”","2738","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"American Jewish leaders of his son’s generation won’t make that mistake again. AIPAC’s push against the deal included a write-in campaign and a multimillion-dollar stream of television ads, under a new 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization called Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran. When Obama and the Administration’s nuclear experts appeared to be persuasive on nuclear issues, AIPAC tried to shift the conversation from Iran’s nuclear threat to its capacity, if sanctions were lifted, to fund violence in the region. (“Iran will receive up to $150 billion,” an AIPAC fact sheet warns. “Iran could then dramatically bolster its support for international terrorism.”) More and more, the Iran deal became more symbolic than strategic: if the President really cared about Israel, then he would take its side. “He accommodated radical Islamist theocrats when he should have insisted on the opposite, that the survival of Israel is non-negotiable. In effect, he betrayed the trust of the Jewish state,” Mort Zuckerman wrote even before the deal was done. In other words, as Leon Wieseltier told a reporter last month, Obama is “the first U.S. President who doesn’t really have a special feeling for Israel.”","2739","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Fortunately, that sensibility has not passed down easily to younger generations. AIPAC’s liberal rival, J Street, strongly advocated for the deal; it has an endorsement list that has grown from about two dozen candidates in 2008 to nearly a hundred for the coming election year. On the whole, Todd Gitlin and Steven M. Cohen wrote last month in the Washington Post, Jewish Americans are more likely than other Americans to support the deal. Only a fifth of Jewish Americans under forty, who are also less likely to be affiliated with synagogues and communal organizations, oppose it, according to an L.A. Jewish Journal survey from mid-July, which Cohen directed. But Jewish leaders tend to be older and more conservative than the Jewish population as a whole, as Cohen found in an earlier study, and more grounded in what the historian Salo Baron famously called the “lachrymose conception of Jewish history.”","2740","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"(Ironically, Hillel Kook, who died in 2001—and whom I knew at the end of his life—could not adjust to AIPAC’s rhetoric, either. He had returned to Tel Aviv in 1948 and sat in the first Knesset, but he rejected Likud’s evolution, including its satisfaction with a religious “Jewish state,” with which American Jews easily identified. For Kook, Zionism meant a secular “Hebrew republic,” which would have a Western-style constitution with a Bill of Rights, and exist beside a Palestinian state. He hoped Israelis would avoid what the writer Arthur Koestler called “claustrophilia.” Kook lacked, presumably, “a special feeling for Israel.”)","2741","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Netanyahu wants us to believe that the fifteen-year duration of the Iran deal is a historical “blink of an eye,” as he told Congress in March. His implicit message is that he does not expect the regional status quo to significantly change: he assumes that the settlement project will continue growing, that Palestinians will remain in despair and disarray, and that ayatollahs will remain fixated on Israel. Democrats have rejected that message, but Netanyahu retains some influence over the deal’s eventual implementation. “The provisions are complex,” Steven Simon, the former senior director for Middle East and North Africa affairs in the Obama White House, told me. “Iran will exploit this, and Israeli analysts will claim cheating.” If Iran can be presented as not in compliance, it does “raise the spectre of military action,” Simon added. Still, the presumption that any Israeli government deserves the benefit of the doubt seems obsolete. In 2010, after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton complained about Netanyahu’s settlement policy, Schumer told a conservative radio host that he had persuaded three-quarters of the Senate to sign a letter “rebuking the Administration for these confrontational stances toward Israel.” Would he even attempt this today?","2742","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"

"Fifteen years ago, as Philip Roth was reading the galleys of a memoir by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., he came to a passage about the political fevers of 1939-40, when reactionaries like Father Charles Coughlin, Henry Ford, and Charles Lindbergh brandished the twin banners of nativism and isolation. Moderate Republicans, including Wendell Willkie, a corporate lawyer who eventually won the Party’s Presidential nomination, were never likely to topple F.D.R., and some Party grandees wanted Lindbergh to run. Lindbergh was known by then not only as the daring aviator who crossed the Atlantic in the Spirit of St. Louis but also as a bigot so vile that F.D.R., upon reading one of his speeches, remarked that “it could not have been better put if it had been written by Goebbels himself.”","2744","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Next to a passage where Schlesinger raised the question of whether Republicans would put Lindbergh forward at the head of a new Know-Nothing Party, Roth wrote, “What if they had?” That marginal note became the germ for “The Plot Against America,” a counter-factual novel in which Lindbergh is elected President. “Fear presides over these memories,” Roth’s novel begins, “perpetual fear.” Anyone who dares to look past the comedy of Donald Trump’s surreal tweets and Ben Carson’s end-times ruminations will notice that the politics of perpetual fear is, in our times, the stuff of nonfiction.","2745","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Last week, the Democrats held their first debate, a five-candidate affair in Las Vegas—an unlikely place to hear denunciations of “the casino-capitalist process.” Still, it was a relatively civil and sober discussion compared with the Republican rodeos. After a year of floundering, Hillary Clinton, cool, well-schooled, forensically skilled, had her best hours as a candidate. Her performance provided relief for her supporters and a potential lure for the undecided. She was, contrary to previous reports, conspicuously human-seeming—funny, passionate, even, at times, rueful of past mistakes—a development that might have robbed her potential rival, Vice-President Joe Biden, of the rationale he needed to make a run. Bernie Sanders, the seventy-four-year-old junior senator from Vermont and unapologetic democratic socialist, spoke in a voice that suggested Larry David, on “Seinfeld,” imitating George Steinbrenner. And yet although Clinton handily won the debate, Sanders largely set the terms, pushing her toward a more full-throated progressive view of income inequality and other issues. (From offstage, the Black Lives Matter movement had an equally serious influence on the discussion of race.)","2746","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Sanders also paused for an act of clever generosity, declaring, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails!” Beaming and extending her hand, Clinton thanked him but did not reciprocate the kindness, swatting him on his weak record on gun control, citing his multiple votes against the Brady bill. And while Clinton totted up her own list of Scandinavian-style domestic goals, such as paid parental leave, she raised a brow at Sanders when he talked of “revolution” and the systemic rot of late capitalism. In case we hadn’t figured it out, Hillary Clinton wants to win.","2747","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"History may look back on the Las Vegas debate as the event that elevated Clinton the way that Barack Obama’s eloquent victory speech after the Iowa caucuses elevated him, nearly eight years ago. It might even be regarded as the moment when she boxed out Biden, raked away the underbrush of Mssrs. Chafee, Webb, and O’Malley, and made Sanders look less like a plausible contender than like a protest candidate who forced his opponent to grapple with a political system poisoned by the outsized influence of an American oligarchy comprising, as the Times has reported, a hundred and fifty-eight families.","2748","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"One debate will not erase all of what many voters see as Clinton’s complications: the lingering perception of her sense of moneyed entitlement, her lawyerly slipperiness under questioning, the walled garden of her political circle, her interventionist reflexes, her belatedness on gay marriage, comprehensive immigration, and Wall Street reforms. But if Clinton was not flawless she and her debating partners managed one distinct achievement: they accentuated the chaos, the intellectual barrenness, and the general collapse of their rivals in the Republican Party.","2749","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Consider the political spectacle on Capitol Hill, in which Speaker John Boehner, hardly a Rockefeller Republican, could no longer deal with his caucus and, with little more than a chorus of “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah,” announced his early retirement. Members of the caucus stepped forward to admit that the hearings on Benghazi were aimed less at uncovering the truth than at burying Hillary Clinton. An ambitious Party loyalist, Paul Ryan, is reluctant to run for Boehner’s chair because the House Republicans are the new Wild Bunch and, as a friend of Ryan’s put it to Politico, “he’s not a f—ing moron.”","2750","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Consider, too, the G.O.P. candidates for the White House. Donald Trump and Ben Carson, the only Republicans polling in double digits, daily clear their throats with that ritual preface of modern self-satisfaction—“I am not politically correct”—and then unleash statements, positions, and postures so willfully detached from fact that they embarrass the political culture that harbors them. Trump is willing to say anything—anything racist, anything false, anything “funny”—to terrify voters, or rile them, or amuse them, depending on the moment. The worst of his demagogic arousals are reminiscent of Lindbergh’s speeches at America First rallies and his fear, as he wrote in Reader’s Digest, of a “pressing sea of Yellow, Black and Brown.” Carson, who seems as historically confused as he is surgically skilled, has said that Obamacare is worse than 9/11, “because 9/11 is an isolated incident.” What’s more, the two men’s rivals either fall into line or lack the persuasive powers and the courage to marginalize candidates they know to be dangerous.","2751","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"In electoral terms, Democrats had to view the week’s events with confidence. But there is pathos and foreboding here for the republic. In the debate, Clinton was clear who her enemies were: “the Republicans.” Reports of the death of the radical right are premature. In 2016, the G.O.P. is likely, at a minimum, to hold its majority in the House. If there is a campaign promise in 2016 that is almost sure to be fulfilled, it is that obstructionism and political war will continue, for within the G.O.P. the politics of perpetual fear goes on corroding not just a party but a nation. ♦","2752","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"

"If you attended a Bernie Sanders rally this summer, when his seemingly quixotic Presidential campaign began gathering force, you might have noticed a few surprising things about the crowd. One was the scarcity of nonwhite faces—a problem that the campaign would soon be confronted by, very publicly. Another was how many young people were turning out to see an irascible seventy-four-year-old senator from Vermont. But that’s a little like being surprised that some millennials appreciate Neil Young or Joni Mitchell at a time when it’s easy to find songs from different decades in a promiscuous jumble online. Young people who like Bernie Sanders like him because he sounds like an old record. He’s been talking about the injustices done to working people by unequal income distribution for more than forty years. His voice, often hoarse from his habitually loud and impassioned speeches, even has the crackle of worn vinyl.","2759","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In Portland, Maine, on an evening in July, the line to see Sanders looped around the Cross Insurance Arena. Sanders’s popularity had clearly been exceeding his own expectations. In a conversation this summer, he recalled an event in Minneapolis: “I was blown away. We were driving in, we saw these lines of people snaking down the sidewalk. ‘Jesus, what is that? There’s a ballgame going on?’ ”","2760","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"At the Portland rally, I met a group of five friends who were drawn to Sanders because of his commitment to banish money from politics: he has sharply criticized the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision, in Citizens United, to permit unlimited campaign spending by corporations, and has lamented the outsize influence exerted by billionaires. Several of the friends praised Sanders’s pledge to raise the federal minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour. One member of the group, Erin Kiley, a millennial who owns Portland Flea-for-All, a marketplace of vintage and artisanal goods, said that she developed “a huge political crush on Bernie” in 2010, after Sanders delivered an eight-and-a-half-hour speech on the Senate floor to protest the extension of tax cuts instituted during the Presidency of George W. Bush. Sanders’s gruffness, didacticism, and indifference to appearances—both he and his wife, Jane, told me how much he loathes shopping—are central to his appeal. All the friends described Sanders as “authentic,” a word that many people would be hesitant to apply to Hillary Clinton. Kiley acknowledged that Sanders’s unvarnished qualities might turn off some voters, but noted that in the current election cycle “the whole spectrum of candidates is less schmoozy, polished, and warm.” She went on, “Everyone seems a little off the wall. Howard Dean was thrown off the national stage for being angry. But people like Trump because he’s an asshole and says whatever he wants.” Kiley’s friend Dawn York, who runs a vintage-clothing shop, said, “Most candidates are robotic and rehearsed.” She saw “a real person in Bernie.”","2761","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders has been known as a democratic socialist for decades. This didn’t matter much to Kiley or York, or to most other Sanders supporters I met during the next few weeks; mainly, they were impressed that he hadn’t shed the term. York thought that, because of Sanders and his “social-media-driven fans,” socialism was “getting a bit of a P.R. makeover.” She noted that sites like Reddit and Twitter were circulating videos of “Bernie explaining why he identifies as a socialist, and what it means to him, in a really positive light.” She added, “The word had a retro connection to Communism and was originally thrown at him as a damning label by his opponents. But for his supporters it isn’t a deterrent.”","2762","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"A 2011 Pew Research Center survey found that, among voters under the age of thirty, forty-nine per cent had a positive view of socialism. (Only forty-six per cent had a positive view of capitalism.) Peter Dreier, a professor of politics at Occidental College, who has written about Sanders, says that younger voters “may not be willing to entertain a whole new system, but they are open to a pretty profound critique of the current one. They’re not as naïve as Americans used to be during the Cold War—they know that there are varieties of capitalism, that there is social democracy in Scandinavia and Canada, where the government plays a bigger role in regulating corporations and in expanding the safety net.”","2763","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"At a recent San Francisco gathering for Sanders, I met Derek Zender, a twenty-three-year-old marketing student. He told me that his parents, who live in Orange County, dismissed Sanders as “a decrepit old socialist who means well but doesn’t understand how the world works.” Zender thought they were overlooking the fact that “many American institutions—Social Security, unions, Medicare, the postal service—have elements of socialism.”","2764","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In Portland, Sanders took the stage, a little hunched in a gray suit jacket. His flyaway white hair was largely subdued, but his face turned pink with exertion as he delivered an hour-long speech, during which he did not use a teleprompter and barely consulted a sheaf of loose yellow papers on the lectern. “America today is the wealthiest country in the history of the world,” he declared. “But most people don’t know that, most people don’t feel that, most people don’t see that—because almost all of the wealth rests in the hands of a tiny few.” Sanders signals his moral ferocity by choosing words like “horrific” and “abysmal” and sonically italicizing them, as in “This grotesque level of income and wealth inequality is immoral.” He was born in Brooklyn, and his unreconstructed borough growl reminds voters that he stands apart from the “oligarchy.” His hand gestures are as emphatic as a traffic cop’s. When he delivers speeches, he’ll often jab his finger at the lectern, as though he were enumerating the plagues at Passover.","2765","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Most of his policy proposals have to do with helping working people and reducing the influence of the wealthy. He would like to break up the big banks, create jobs by rebuilding infrastructure, and move toward public funding of elections—and provide free tuition at public universities. (This program would be subsidized, in part, by a tax on Wall Street speculation.) He wants to end the “international embarrassment of being the only major country on Earth which does not guarantee workers paid medical and family leave.” In the speeches I heard, Sanders rarely discussed foreign policy, though he spoke with conviction about climate change and the need for the U.S. to set an example for Russia, India, and China by using fewer fossil fuels. He tends to sound both doleful and optimistic, like a doctor who has a grave diagnosis to deliver—and no time for small talk—but is convinced that he can help his patient heal.","2766","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Huck Gutman, one of Sanders’s close friends, is an English professor at the University of Vermont; from 2008 to 2012, he served as Sanders’s chief of staff in the Senate. “It doesn’t matter what issue comes up—Bernie understands that the fundamental issue for Americans is economic,” Gutman said. “His record on abortion, on gay marriage, on a great number of things has been very good and very liberal, but he never sees those as the central issues. The central issue is: Are people doing O.K., or are a small number of people ripping them off?”","2767","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Despite this abiding interest, Sanders does not seem to have immersed himself that deeply in the extensive literature on inequality. When I spoke with him in his Senate office, I asked him how his ideas on economic fairness were formed. “No one can answer that,” he replied. “How were your ideas formed?” He did not particularly warm to discussing the theories of such economists as Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Piketty. (Gutman told me, “I read a third of Piketty’s book. I don’t think Bernie would read a page of it.” Sanders was interested less in academic arguments, Gutman said, than in hard numbers that “exemplify the disparities he sees and feels and hears about from people.”) Sanders dutifully mentioned that the economist Stephanie Kelton is an adviser to the Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, of which he is the ranking member, but he was ardent in his admiration for Pope Francis, who has condemned the “economy of exclusion.” Sanders called the Pope “an extraordinary figure,” adding, “My God, he came along right at the time we need him!”","2768","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"After speeches, Sanders spars about issues with voters or reporters. Garrison Nelson, a political scientist at the University of Vermont, who has known him for decades, says that if Sanders is walking down the street in Burlington “and somebody yells at him Bernie will talk to him—‘What’s the matter? Whadd’ya mean?’ ” He also understands the necessity of the selfie dance, maneuvering quickly into place and smiling briefly. Sanders does not excel, however, at the middle ground of casual, friendly conversation. He has no gift for anecdote. When talking to voters, Hillary Clinton has perfected the head-cocked semblance of keen interest; it’s clear when Sanders becomes bored. Nelson told me, “Bernie’s the last person you’d want to be stuck on a desert island with. Two weeks of lectures about health care, and you’d look for a shark and dive in.” Nelson has voted for him many times.","2769","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Paula Routly, who is the publisher of Seven Days, a popular weekly in Burlington, told me a story that captured the counterintuitive Sanders charm. In 2012, she hosted a gathering of alternative-newspaper publishers, and tried to show them Vermont at its most distinctive. One evening, Jerry, of Ben & Jerry’s, scooped ice cream; on another, Senator Sanders stopped by a group dinner. As Routly recalls, “There were no niceties or glad-handing before he launched into a brief but impassioned rant, tailored specifically for our group. He told us we were doing a great job of covering the arts but a lousy one reporting on economic issues. Message delivered—he didn’t want to meet anyone or eat anything or answer any questions. He was out of there.” Everyone loved it. “He only talks to people in one register, but it’s a very effective one,” Routly said.","2770","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Though Sanders is steadfastly earnest, the youthful enthusiasm for him often partakes of irony. Whimsical buttons feature the slogan “Feel the Bern,” and Tumblr is full of memes that play up the contrast between Sanders’s age and his popularity with hipsters. It’s similar to the way that some admirers of Ruth Bader Ginsburg have taken to calling her the Notorious R.B.G. Both fandoms combine admiration for progressive conviction with a slightly condescending fondness for cranky senior citizens. Rich Yeselson, a contributing editor at the left-wing journal Dissent, told me, “The sort of detached, post-Jon Stewart generation—they’re the ones putting inverted commas around what Bernie stands for. ‘Look at this grumpy old Jewish socialist from Brooklyn!’ It’s not cynical, though—they really believe in what he’s saying.”","2771","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s message is particularly potent for young people who are struggling financially. Several weeks after the rally, I wrote to Dawn York, and she said that she had been thinking about “how refreshing it was to have someone point out to us that, as hardworking Americans, some things aren’t a privilege, they are a right. . . . I’m self-employed, I started my own business three and a half years ago, and my husband works full-time for Whole Foods—and we barely get by. We own a home, we both graduated from college, and we work more than forty hours a week, and we can barely put oil in our heating tanks in the winter. We have no savings and no way to financially handle any hiccups that may come our way. And I had to be reminded that it shouldn’t be that way.”","2772","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Garrison Nelson describes Sanders as being “more from the nineteen-thirties left than the sixties one.” In June, when NPR’s David Greene pressed Sanders on whether he embraced the phrase “Black Lives Matter,” the Senator got irritated. “It’s too easy for quote-unquote liberals to be saying, ‘Well, let’s use this phrase,’ ” he said. “We need a massive jobs program to put black kids to work and white kids to work and Hispanic kids to work. So my point is, is that it’s sometimes easy to worry about which phrase you’re going to use. It’s a lot harder to stand up to the billionaire class.”","2773","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders does not argue that greater economic equality would end racism, but for most of his career he has subsumed discussions of race under class. Van Jones, a criminal-justice reformer and a former Obama adviser, derides that approach as “trickle-down justice”—and told Salon in August that he had been “warning the white populists in the Party, behind the scenes, for several months, that their continued insistence on advancing a color-blind, race-neutral populism was going to blow up in their faces.”","2774","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"

"After taking the stage, Sanders told the moderator, “Whoa, let me talk about what I want to talk about for a moment!” A few minutes later, when protesters again interrupted the proceedings, he addressed them directly: “Black lives, of course, matter. I spent fifty years of my life fighting for civil rights and for dignity! But if you don’t want me to be here that’s O.K. I don’t want to outscream people.”","2776","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"A week later, in his Senate office, Sanders sounded chastened. “The issues these young people raised are enormously important,” he said. The video showing the arrest of Sandra Bland, the African-American woman who died in a Texas jail, had just been released, and Sanders seemed shaken. “It impacted my night’s sleep,” he said. “I don’t sleep that great, and it made it even worse.” He went on, “It’s hard to imagine if Sandra Bland was white she would have been thrown to the ground and assaulted and insulted.” Sanders, speaking more broadly about police violence directed at black people, said, “I plead guilty—I should have been more sensitive at the beginning of this campaign to talk about this issue.”","2777","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"On July 25th, Sanders addressed the annual convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, in Baton Rouge. “I’m aware that many of you don’t know me very well,” he said. His tone was friendlier than usual, and he even made a joke: “I was the best and worst congressman Vermont had.” (Vermont has only one.) One of the convention’s listed sponsors was Koch Industries, and it was the first time I saw Sanders give a speech in which he did not inveigh against the company’s billionaire owners, who lavishly support conservative causes. He had folded in a quote from Martin Luther King, Jr., though, which worked well for him: “Now our struggle is for genuine equality, which means economic equality. For we know that it isn’t enough to integrate lunch counters. What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn’t earn enough money to buy a hamburger and a cup of coffee?”","2778","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In August, Sanders’s campaign issued a racial-justice platform that recommended police reform, federal funding for police body cameras, a ban on for-profit prisons, and the elimination of mandatory-minimum jail sentences. The platform also included a broad defense of voting rights. (Among other things, Sanders proposes making Election Day a federal holiday.) The document is divided into sections called “Physical Violence,” “Political Violence,” “Legal Violence,” and “Economic Violence,” strongly echoing the language and priorities of Black Lives Matter. At the same time, the platform reasserted Sanders’s core philosophy: “We must simultaneously address the structural and institutional racism which exists in this country, while at the same time we vigorously attack the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which is making the very rich much richer while everyone else—especially those in our minority communities—are becoming poorer.”","2779","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Van Jones said of Sanders, “He’s shown tremendous character in his willingness to engage and grow and change.” But Vermont is ninety-five per cent white, and Sanders needed to establish stronger bonds with black voters. No African-American leader, Jones observed, would be surprised to get a call from the Clintons. Sanders was “a reliable civil-rights vote, but not somebody who has been connected to these communities, to these kids and their neighborhoods. He’s not showing up to the funerals.”","2780","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"American politicians know the power of a personal story. The first lines of Jeb Bush’s biography on his official campaign site describe how he met his wife, Columba: “My life changed forever when I was a young man on an exchange program in León, Guanajuato, Mexico. Across a plaza, I saw a girl. She spoke little English, and my Spanish was a work in progress. But for me, it was love at first sight.” Hillary Clinton’s official online biography sounds like one of those books about great Americans aimed at young readers: her father’s drapery business and “rock-ribbed” Republicanism, her family’s Methodism, and her youthful turn as a Girl Scout all get their due. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator whose critiques of income inequality presaged Sanders’s Presidential campaign, often speaks of her parents’ economic hardship to help explain her values today.","2781","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s campaign Web site lists his educational history, says that he is married to Jane Sanders and that they have four children and seven grandchildren, and mentions that he worked as “a carpenter and a documentary filmmaker” before entering politics. That’s it for personal stuff.","2782","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"There’s something admirable about Sanders’s reluctance to attribute his political beliefs to autobiography: he doesn’t want voters thinking that his commitment to redistributive economics stems from anything other than a deep-seated sense of fairness. He has neither the conventional politician’s instinct for sharing relatable details nor the contemporary left’s reverence for personal testimony. Still, he’s running for President, and so he has reluctantly cracked open the door to his private life, even if his supporters are drawn to him, in part, because of that reluctance.","2783","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"When I asked Sanders a question about his early years, he sighed with the air of a man who knows he can no longer put off that visit to the periodontist. “I understand,” he said. “I really do. For people to elect a President, you’ve got to know that person—you’ve got to trust them.” He insisted that he was happy to talk about his life. But he couldn’t resist sermonizing first: “When I talk about a political revolution, what I’m talking about is how we create millions of decent-paying jobs, how we reduce youth unemployment, how we join the rest of the world, major countries, in having paid family and sick leave. I know those issues are not quite as important as my personal life.” And then, unnecessarily: “I’m being facetious.”","2784","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders did say that two aspects of his upbringing had exerted a lasting influence. One was coming from a family that never had much money. And the other was growing up Jewish—less for the religious content than for the sense it imbued in him that politics mattered. Sanders’s father was a Polish Jew who, at the age of seventeen, came to America shortly after his brother, and struggled through the Depression in Brooklyn. By the time Sanders was born, in 1941, his father was working as a paint salesman. Sanders had an older brother, Larry, and their mother stayed home, like most of the women in their lower-middle-class corner of Flatbush. He went to public schools, including James Madison High School, an incubator of civic talent, from which Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Senator Chuck Schumer also graduated. He didn’t make the school’s championship basketball team—a deep disappointment—but he ran cross-country, and feels that this activity accounts for some of his formidable stamina today.","2785","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"“There was tension about money,” Sanders said of his family. They lived in a three-and-a-half-room rent-controlled apartment, and his mother pined for a house. “It wasn’t a question of putting food on the table. It was a question of arguing about whether you buy this or whether you buy that. You know, families do this. I remember a great argument about drapes—whether we could afford them. And I remember going with my mother when we had to buy a jacket. We went to literally fifteen different stores to buy the damned cheapest—I mean, the best deal.” He went on, “I do know what it’s like when the electric company shuts off the electricity and the phone company shuts off the phone—all that stuff. So, for me, to talk to working-class people is not very hard.”","2786","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"I spoke with a few of Sanders’s contemporaries who had grown up in the same neighborhood, and their memories were rosier: they recalled kids playing stickball on safe, familiar streets until their parents called them home for dinner. But Sanders rarely communicates in the key of nostalgia. He’ll talk about how the “great American middle class” is being hollowed out, but unlike some populists he doesn’t dwell lovingly on the nineteen-fifties, when high-paying manufacturing jobs, union membership, and the G.I. Bill allowed single-earner families to prosper. That’s a political strength, because there are many people—African-Americans, above all—for whom the fifties cannot be recalled as an idyll.","2787","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sid Ganis, a Hollywood producer who grew up in the same building as Sanders, described their neighborhood as an enclave of “ordinary secular Jews,” adding, “Some of us went to Hebrew school, but mainly it was an identity in that it got us out of school on Jewish holidays.” Sanders told me that, in the aftermath of the Second World War, his family “got a call in the middle of the night about some relative of my father’s, who was in a displaced-persons camp in Europe someplace.” Sanders learned that many of his father’s other relatives had perished. Sanders’s parents had been fundamentally apolitical, but he took away a lesson: “An election in 1932 ended up killing fifty million people around the world.”","2788","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s close friend Richard Sugarman, an Orthodox Jew who teaches religious studies at the University of Vermont, said, “He’s not what you would call rule-observant.” But, Sugarman added, “if you talk about his Jewish identity, it’s strong. It’s certainly more ethnic and cultural than religious—except for his devotion to the ethical part of public life in Judaism, the moral part. He does have a prophetic sensibility.” Sugarman and Sanders were housemates for a while in the seventies, and Sugarman says that his friend would often greet him in the morning by saying, “We’re not crazy, you know,” referring to the anger they felt about social injustices. Sugarman would respond, “Could you say good morning first?”","2789","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders attended Brooklyn College for a year, then transferred to the University of Chicago, where he joined the Young People’s Socialist League and the Congress on Racial Equality. He also took part in protests for the desegregation of the Chicago public schools and of university-owned housing. Jim Rader, a friend who first met him in Chicago, recalls that Sanders was a “leader of the civil-rights movement on campus.” Sanders, who received a political-science degree in 1964, has said that he was a mediocre student because he found the classroom boring and irrelevant—and that he learned “infinitely more on the streets and in the community.”","2790","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"By the time Sanders graduated, both his parents had died, and his brother had moved to England. (Larry Sanders, who became a social worker and a Green Party councillor, lives in Oxford.) Jane Sanders told me that it had taken her a long time to realize quite how “alone in the world” her future husband had been during his late teens and early twenties. He did a stint on a kibbutz in Israel, worked as an aide at a psychiatric hospital, taught in a Head Start program, and had a carpentry business with a few other guys in New York. It was called Creative Carpentry, and Rader says that it was accurately named: “They advertised in the Village Voice, but didn’t know much about carpentry. They’d go to the hardware store to buy supplies, and ask the clerk how to do the repairs they’d been hired to do.”","2791","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders got married for the first time, to a woman named Deborah Shiling, just after college, and they took a road trip from New York to Vermont, where Sanders had never been. The couple ended up buying eighty-five acres of wooded land near Montpelier, for twenty-five hundred dollars. They had preceded the waves of back-to-the-land hippies. Sanders told me, convincingly, “I wasn’t a hippie.” He’d been enchanted by the thought of living in lush, green Vermont ever since he and his brother had collected some travel brochures touting the state’s farms.","2792","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders and Shiling soon divorced. (She eventually became a wine and cheese buyer for a Vermont food co-op.) In 1969, he had a son, Levi, with Susan Campbell Mott, a girlfriend. In July, Politico reported that Levi was not the product of his first marriage, as many people had assumed, in an article titled “Bernie Sanders Has a Secret.” It came as a surprise to reporters who’d covered Sanders for years in Vermont, but it wasn’t the sort of revelation likely to scandalize his supporters in 2015.","2793","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders wore his social conscience on his sleeve, but few people who knew him in the sixties and seventies would have predicted that he would become a leading candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination. In those days, he occupied himself by writing freelance articles—critiques of the stultifying effects of office work or the social-control mechanism of television—and by making very low-budget educational filmstrips. It’s safe to say that had Sanders stuck with that career he would not have given Ken Burns a run for his money. One filmstrip, a portrait of Sanders’s hero, the socialist Eugene V. Debs, was rendered with static images that remained on the screen for a good long while. Sanders himself voiced Debs, an Indiana native, making him sound like a guy from Flatbush. A narrator chided viewers that if they were like the average American “who watches television forty hours a week” they would know “such important people as Kojak and Wonder Woman” and “have heard about dozens of different kinds of underarm spray deodorants” but would likely never have heard of Debs. (Another cultural foray of Sanders’s that makes you glad he stuck with politics: a 1987 cassette tape in which he talk-sings folk songs, William Shatner style. Imagine “This Land Is Your Land” recited, in stentorian tones, over reggae-style guitar.)","2794","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"People who knew Sanders when he was in his thirties tend to share stories about how broke and frugal he was. Rader told me that when Sanders first bought land in Vermont, and was still living part time in New York, he sometimes camped out in the new property’s only shelter: a maple-sugar shack. He had devised his own equivalent of Sterno, which his friends dubbed Berno. “It was a roll of toilet paper soaked in lighter fluid inside a coffee can,” Rader said. “He’d cook over that.”","2795","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In 1971, Rader invited Sanders to a meeting of Vermont’s left-wing Liberty Union Party, in Plainfield. Sanders brought his son along, and there’s a photograph of them at the meeting: Sanders is skinny, serious, with a luxuriant head of curls, uninhibited sideburns, and Buddy Holly glasses; his towheaded toddler sits in his lap. The organizers asked if anyone would run for the Senate, and Sanders, one of the willing few, got the nod. It was the beginning of his political career, though he shared the fate of most Liberty Union candidates: he lost by an enormous margin. During the next ten years, he ran twice for senator and twice for governor, and never got more than six per cent of the vote. Nevertheless, he discovered that he had an appetite for campaigning—and a keen desire to hold elected office. “The difference between Bernie and most of the lefties is Bernie wants to win,” Garrison Nelson said. “Most lefties don’t want to win, because if you win you sell out your purity.”","2796","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In 1980, Sanders’s friend Richard Sugarman suggested that he try for mayor of Burlington. Locals were disenchanted with the five-term incumbent, a Democrat named Gordon Paquette. Sanders ran as an Independent, and won by ten votes. Even in Vermont, it was unusual to elect a socialist in the time of Ronald Reagan; Sanders was a thirty-nine-year-old man who didn’t own a suit. As Paula Routly told me, “Monied interests were shaking in their boots at first.”","2797","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Yet Sanders turned out to be a popular and effective mayor, and more pragmatic than some might have predicted. True, he travelled to Nicaragua, where he met with Daniel Ortega and found a sister city for Burlington. (Vermont reporters dubbed the mayor and his coalition the Sandernistas.) But he also presided over economic development that transformed the city into a hipper, more forward-looking place—one of those small cities that appear on lists of the most livable. And he did so without the kind of wrenching gentrification that he abhorred. His administration devised creative solutions for preserving affordable housing, including a community land trust that enabled low-income residents to buy homes. It became a model for other cities. Sanders also resisted a developer’s plan to turn the derelict Lake Champlain waterfront into a cluster of high-rises, promising instead public access and open space. Today, the waterfront has a park, a bike trail, a science center, a community boathouse, and limited commercial development. He created a youth office, an arts council, and a women’s commission, and during his tenure minor-league baseball came to Burlington. Business leaders learned, Nelson said, “not to fear him.” Jim Condon, a Vermont state legislator and a former reporter who used to cover Mayor Sanders, wrote of him recently, “He got a lot done, but not through the art of gentle persuasion. Bernie’s style was top-down and confrontational.” Still, he was reëlected three times.","2798","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders met Jane O’Meara Driscoll, a community organizer nine years his junior and a divorced mother of three young children, when she invited him to a debate during his first mayoral campaign. After he was elected, he named her the director of a new office dedicated to improving the lives of kids and teen-agers in Burlington. They were married in 1988, and spent what even Sanders admits was “a strange honeymoon,” in the Soviet Union, finalizing a sister-city relationship with the city of Yaroslavl. Jane has worked closely with him ever since, on a volunteer basis—she was his chief of staff for a year in the House, and has handled his press relations at various times. Along the way, she had served as the provost of Goddard College, in Plainfield, where she had earned a bachelor’s degree in social work, and, later, the president of Burlington College. All four children in the Sanders family are now grown. Levi Sanders works as a paralegal at Boston Legal Services; Heather directs the Sedona Yoga Festival with her husband; Carina started a woodworking school, and has served as a state legislator in Vermont; Dave is a senior executive at a quintessential Vermont company, Burton Snowboards.","2799","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Jane typically accompanies her husband on the Presidential campaign trail. She smiles more easily than he does, and looks approachable in her slacks and patterned tunic tops. In August, we met in Burlington, and though Jane was nursing a campaign-trail cough, she was animated about her husband: “I feel more, every day, that he can win. My kids find it really frustrating that they always say in the media, ‘But, of course, he can’t win.’” She went on, “I just tell them, ‘They have said he can’t do this until we prove we can. They’re gonna say he can’t until we can. And that’s what’s always happened with Bernie.’” She mentioned a Quinnipiac University poll showing that, in a general-election contest against Donald Trump, Sanders would win by eight percentage points. (The same poll indicated that Vice-President Joe Biden, who is considering entering the race, would win by twelve points.) “Bernie can defeat Republicans—he’s done it here,” Jane said. “And he’s had them join him on certain things. He’s a democratic socialist, but he’ll work with Republicans to get things done.”","2800","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"When Sanders first ran for the House of Representatives, in 1988, he lost to a Republican named Peter Smith, the scion of a banking family. During Smith’s first term, he co-sponsored an assault-rifle ban. In 1990, Sanders ran again, and the N.R.A. went after Smith, sending letters to its Vermont members describing Sanders as the lesser of two evils, since he wasn’t publicly supporting the ban. Sanders won. This is the origin of the critique that Sanders has weak gun-control credentials for a progressive. Vermont is a gun-friendly state: twenty-eight per cent of its residents own firearms, according to a recent survey, and it has some of the nation’s most permissive gun laws.","2801","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In national office, Sanders has not been a vocal proponent of strict gun control. In 1993, he voted against the Brady Bill, objecting to its imposition of a five-day waiting period to buy a handgun. And in 2009 he voted to allow guns in national parks and on Amtrak trains. Over the years, he has also voted for some restrictions, including a semi-automatic-assault-weapons ban and instant criminal-background checks. The N.R.A. has given him grades ranging from C- to F. (It’s a tough grader.) But he has never been out front on the issue, partly because it doesn’t seem to engage him deeply, and partly because he wants to retain the loyalty of voters in northeast Vermont, where hunting is popular. Sanders tends to present guns as an urban problem that Vermonters can afford not to worry about, though mass shootings can happen anywhere and suicides by gun are as much a problem in Vermont as they are in other states. He told me, “I’m proud of my state, and I think I’m in a good position to try to bridge the gap between urban America—where guns mean one thing, where guns mean guns in the hands of kids who are shooting each other or shooting at police officers—and rural America, where significant majorities of people are gun owners, and ninety-nine per cent of them are lawful.”","2802","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s congressional career did not get off to a promising start. As an Independent, he had a hard time landing committee assignments. Garrison Nelson recalls, “Bernie shows up in Washington in 1991, there’s still a chunk of Southerners in the Democratic caucus, and they do not want Bernie in the caucus.” Sanders didn’t help matters by giving more than one interview denouncing Congress. “This place is not working,” he told the Associated Press. “It is failing. Change is not going to take place until many hundreds of these people are thrown out of their offices.” He went on, “Congress does not have the courage to stand up to the powerful interests. I have the freedom to speak my mind.”","2803","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Some of his colleagues returned the favor. Joe Moakley, a Massachusetts Democrat who was the chairman of the influential House Rules Committee, told the A.P. reporter, “He screams and hollers, but he is all alone.” Another Democrat from the Massachusetts delegation, Barney Frank, was even more blunt. “Bernie alienates his natural allies,” he said. “His holier-than-thou attitude—saying, in a very loud voice, he is smarter than everyone else and purer than everyone else—really undercuts his effectiveness.”","2804","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Nelson told me that, when he ran into Sanders in Burlington, he warned him not to keep “pissing in the soup,” adding, “You’re our only representative!” According to Nelson, Sanders said, “Gary, you have no idea how totally corrupt it is.” Nelson responded, “Bernie, I’m a historian of Congress. Give me a year, I’ll give you a scandal.”","2805","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In time, Sanders became slightly more discriminating in his criticism, and made some allies. He was one of the founding members and the first chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which has grown steadily over the years, from six members in 1991 to seventy-one today. The C.P.C. produces an annual progressive budget as an alternative to the one that actually passes; it tends to operate mainly as a conscience of the left. He worked hard with Democrats to keep jobs in his state and campaigned to strengthen federal regulation of milk prices, because it helped Vermont dairy farmers. (He once wrote that he’d developed “an almost emotional attachment” to these farmers, despite not knowing “one end of a cow from the other” when he arrived in the state.) In national matters such as curbing the excesses of the Patriot Act, Sanders found that he could at least try to make incremental changes through the amendment process; in 2005, a Rolling Stone profile dubbed him “the amendment king.”","2806","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"At home, Sanders became a symbol of Vermont’s cussed uniqueness, as affectionately regarded as a scoop of Chunky Monkey. He was reëlected to the House seven times. And his ascent to the Senate, in 2006, was stunning: he trounced the Republican candidate, Richard Tarrant, one of the wealthiest men in the state, by thirty-three percentage points. But when Sanders has run for the Vermont governorship he hasn’t done well. Jim Condon, the state legislator and former reporter, notes, “That’s telling. People here like him making a lot of noise in Washington for a little state—they’re happy to send a human hand grenade down there.” But they don’t necessarily want Sanders running the state.","2807","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Since joining the Senate, Sanders has received the most attention for his gestures of defiance—such as his marathon oration against tax cuts for the wealthiest, which was published in book form as “The Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class.” Still, he has been a very active legislator. An analysis by the nonpartisan Web site GovTrack shows him tied for sixth place among senators who introduced the most bills in the 2013-14 session of Congress, and in tenth place for the number of bills that made it out of committee. The site also noted that he tends to gather co-sponsors for his bills only among Democrats.","2808","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Yet Sanders has proved himself capable of bipartisan dealmaking. In the 2013-14 session, he was the chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and though he did not serve in the military—and typically opposes military interventions—he has been a strong advocate for veterans. Last year, he worked with an unlikely ally, the Arizona Republican John McCain, to hammer out a compromise to reform the ailing V.A. health system. The bill provided five billion dollars in additional funding to hire and train new medical staff, made it easier to dismiss V.A. officials for incompetence, and allowed veterans to go outside the system if the wait for a doctor was too long. Sanders explained to reporters that it was far from the bill he would have devised on his own: “It opens up a fear of privatization, which I strongly, strongly am opposed to.” But he sounded pleased with his ball-passing skills: “When you become chairman, you can’t just say, ‘This is the way I want it.’ ”","2809","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"McCain, in turn, expressed respect for his unlikely partner, telling the Huffington Post, “Negotiating with Bernie was not a usual experience, because he is very passionate and he and I are both very strong-willed people, and we spend a lot of time banging our fists on the table and having the occasional four-letter word. But at the end of the day Bernie was result-oriented.”","2810","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders is proud of a few other Senate deals. He successfully made an amendment to the Affordable Care Act which allotted eleven billion dollars for community-health centers to provide primary care regardless of patients’ ability to pay. And, he said, he had done “everything I could do to stop the Republicans—and, sadly, the President and a few Democrats—from cutting Social Security, through the chained C.P.I.” The chained C.P.I., a different way of calculating the annual cost-of-living increases in Social Security, would likely have lowered the increases for most people, and Obama proposed adopting it in his 2014 budget. Sanders helped lead the opposition, and the President recently stopped pushing for the proposal. “It was a tough fight,” Sanders said. “But now, as a result of a lot of grassroots activism, the debate is about expanding Social Security rather than about cutting it.”","2811","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Could Bernie Sanders win the Democratic nomination, let alone the Presidency? It is unlikely, for one of the reasons that he’s running for President: money dominates the electoral system. By October 1st, Clinton had raised more than a hundred million dollars, much of it from Super pacs and big donors. Sanders, who refuses to take money from Super PACs, had raised forty-one million dollars, mostly in donations of less than two hundred dollars each. These totals leave him at a major disadvantage. Still, his haul is impressive, and in the most recent fund-raising cycle donations to his campaign were neck and neck with Clinton’s: between July and October, he raised twenty-six million dollars to her twenty-eight million.","2812","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"It’s impressive, too, that in a recent YouGov/CBS News poll Sanders is leading Clinton by twenty-two percentage points in New Hampshire and ten in Iowa. But the picture in South Carolina is quite different: there Clinton is twenty-three points ahead. That comparison highlights a key distinction between white and nonwhite Democrats. The New Hampshire and Iowa Democratic samples included too few nonwhite voters to break out. But among black Democrats in South Carolina Clinton leads, at fifty-two per cent; Sanders is at four per cent. Nationally, the comparable figures are fifty-seven per cent to ten per cent. And though Sanders quickly modified his platform to accommodate Black Lives Matter activists, he still has a long way to go to win over African-American voters. Latino voters are similarly unfamiliar with him: a Gallup poll released in late August showed that only twenty-five per cent knew of him, and those who did were almost evenly divided between favorable and unfavorable impressions. A Washington Post/ABC News poll released in September shows that, if Biden were in the race, he would attract more nonwhite voters than Sanders (though substantially fewer than Clinton).","2813","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Nor is Sanders’s trajectory likely to mirror that of Obama in 2008. Sanders supporters like to point out that, in the summer of 2007, Obama was polling behind Hillary Clinton among black Democrats. But, as Michael Tesler, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine, recently noted in the Washington Post, Obama enjoyed much higher favorability ratings among black Democrats than Sanders does now.","2814","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s commitment to recapturing some of the white working-class males that the Democratic Party lost in the Reagan years won’t necessarily help his candidacy; indeed, it could hurt his quest to connect with minority voters. As he’s found, emphasizing class over race can get a progressive in trouble. Although he’s committed to immigration reform and creating a path to citizenship, he sees an ulterior motive in some approaches to the former. “There is a reason why Wall Street and all of corporate America likes immigration reform,” he said at an event held by the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in July. “It is not, in my view, that they are staying up nights worrying about undocumented workers in this country. What I think they are interested in is seeing a process by which we can bring low-wage labor of all levels into this country, to depress wages in America.”","2815","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Angelica Salas, an immigration-rights organizer in Los Angeles, whose group was represented onstage at a Sanders rally there in August, told me that she finds the immigration platform of one of his rivals—Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland—to be more “detailed, robust, and impressive.” Latino voters, she said, had been disappointed in Obama’s immigration policy and were looking for candidates who were committed to reform: “For a long time, it was almost like having an affair with the Democratic Party—they say they love you, but they don’t want to be seen with you in public.”","2816","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Yet Sanders is doing well enough to concern the Clinton team, and that creates its own challenges. Garrison Nelson said of Clinton, “She’s not worried about Bernie. But she is worried about the Bernie effect—which is to demonstrate her relative weaknesses as a candidate.

"On the trail, Clinton has avoided mention of him; Sanders, for his part, emphasizes their policy differences. He voted against the war in Iraq; she voted for it. He has opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership; she has voiced support for those pacts. But he has rebuked reporters for pressing him to say more about Clinton herself. In a video made backstage at a rally in Iowa, he complained, “Time after time, I’m being asked to criticize Hillary Clinton. That’s the sport that you guys like. . . . I’ve known Hillary Clinton for twenty-five years. I like her. I respect her. I disagree with her on a number of issues. No great secret.”","2818","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders appears to be sticking with that approach. But the Clinton campaign may be testing out a more aggressive strategy. Correct the Record, a Super PAC backing Clinton, recently sent an e-mail to the Huffington Post suggesting that Sanders shared many views with the controversial new British Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, then noting that Corbyn had called the death of Osama bin Laden a tragedy.

"Sanders has promised not to run for President as an Independent in the general election, saying that he doesn’t want to have any role in handing victory to a Republican. But, even if he fails to secure the Democratic nomination, he has exposed a deep indignation about the distribution of wealth which other candidates cannot ignore. Sanders often says that he is not that far outside the mainstream—that a majority of Americans agree with him on many of his tenets. According to a recent CBS News/New York Times poll, sixty-six per cent of Americans feel that “money and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed”; seventy-one per cent favor raising the minimum wage, at least slightly; and seventy-four per cent believe that corporations exert too much influence on American politics and life. Other recent surveys show that strong majorities oppose any cuts in Social Security and support workers’ rights to unionize. A Gallup poll in May concluded that nearly half of Americans are “strong redistributionists, in the sense that they believe the distribution of wealth and income is not fair, and endorse heavy taxes on the rich as a way of redistributing wealth.”","2820","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"It’s hard to see, though, how these sentiments could be translated into policy in the U.S. Many, if not most, voters would likely resist paying more taxes to make such sweeping reforms possible. The American electorate seems to respond simultaneously to calls for redistributive justice and the rejection of the entity most likely to accomplish it: the federal government. And many voters might feel that matters of economic fairness are trumped by such social issues as abortion and guns.","2821","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In mid-September, Sanders spoke before the weekly convocation attended by the student body at Liberty University, the evangelical school in Lynchburg, Virginia, founded by the Reverend Jerry Falwell. Unlike many liberal élites, Sanders does not seem to prefer talking to people who share his views; because he is not an especially convivial person, he does not require conviviality from others. Sanders relishes the opportunity to enter enemy territory, where he believes that he can find secret allies.","2822","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"At Liberty, he began by acknowledging that his positions on women’s reproductive rights and gay marriage are strongly at odds with the views of many evangelical Christians. He did not make knowing jokes about these differences: as usual, Sanders was dead serious. The students were poker-faced but polite. He sought common ground by adding new valences to one or two of his standard arguments. When he called for federally mandated, paid family leave to bring America in line with the rest of the world, he dwelled a little on the preciousness of the bond between mother and baby. He was rewarded with applause. But the occasion also played to the prophetic side of Sanders—the register in which he can sound like an Old Testament preacher. Unlike his slicker rivals, Sanders is most at ease talking about the moral and ethical dimensions of politics. “We are living in a nation and in a world—the Bible speaks to this issue—in a nation and in a world which worships not love of brothers and sisters, not love of the poor and the sick, but worships the acquisition of money and great wealth.” His voice broke—all those stump speeches had been leaving deep scratches on the record. But his outrage was unmuffled. Staring at the crowd, he quoted the Hebrew Bible, his fist punctuating nearly every word: “Let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream.” ♦","2823","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"This week, David Bowers, the Democratic mayor of Roanoke, Virginia, invoked the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War as justification for keeping out Iraqi and Syrian refugees. I wonder if the mayor (who later apologized to anyone he might have offended) would have paused for one second in his headlong rush to join the anti-refugee hysteria sweeping America if he’d known that, among the residents of his city, there’s an Iraqi named Hayder. In 2003, Hayder was working as an interpreter for the 82nd Airborne Division, in Baghdad, when his convoy was ambushed by insurgents. Dragging an American sergeant out of the line of fire, Hayder was hit in both legs and nearly killed. He lost most of his right leg. Unable to work and in danger for his life, he fled Iraq with his wife and son to Jordan, where the family languished for years in deepening misery while getting nowhere in their efforts to get visas to the United States. Finally, in 2007, his case came to the attention of Kirk Johnson, an American refugee advocate, and the next year Hayder and his family were resettled in Roanoke. In 2013, he became a U.S. citizen.","November 20, 2015","2824","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"
"Mayor Bowers hasn’t tried to have the family interned, not yet anyway, though the logic of his statement could have led him there—for keeping Muslim refugees out doesn’t solve the problem of the ones already here. (Donald Trump, tossing out answers that move beyond U.S. history to that of Nazi Germany, is talking about imposing mandatory registration on all Muslims in this country.) A bill that overwhelmingly passed the House on Thursday, by a vote of 289–137, with the support of fifty Democrats, would require the director of the F.B.I., the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the director of National Intelligence all to certify that each refugee applicant from Iraq or Syria poses no threat to the United States before being admitted. According to Betsy Fisher of the International Refugee Assistance Project, this group includes fifty-eight thousand Iraqis who have applied for resettlement through a program known as Direct Access, which was created by Congress for Iraqis who can show that they worked with the United States government or with American companies, non-profits, or media outlets. If it had the chance, the Islamic State would slaughter every one of them. The same goes for the many Yazidis applying for resettlement from Iraq—members of a religious minority who have been rounded up, enslaved, and murdered by ISIS. It’s already very, very hard for people like them to get here. Iraqis and Syrians are probably the most heavily vetted refugees in the history of the world. If three top government officials are going to be required to put their names and reputations on every admission, the very, very hard will become just about impossible.

It hit the country in the form of the Palmer raids after the First World War, with the internment camps during the Second World War (Franklin Roosevelt’s most shameful act), and in the McCarthyite politics of the nineteen-fifties. Such moments were made for Ted Cruz—this generation’s Joe McCarthy. Not to be outdone by the House, on Thursday he introduced a bill in the Senate called the Terrorist Refugee Infiltration Prevention Act. It would add refugees from Libya, Yemen, and Somalia to the Syrians and Iraqis on what is effectively a black list.

"Cruz’s bill would allow two exceptions to the barred door. One is for individuals who have provided “substantial assistance” to the U.S.—though the bill would require certification from the leaders of four government agencies that it was “a level of assistance without which the United States could not achieve the purposes for which the assistance was provided or sought.” This tortured language raises the already-high barrier and would keep out pretty much every last Iraqi, of any faith, who lost his leg or his safety or his future while helping Americans in his country. The second exception, Cruz explained, is for “Christians, Yazidis, small minorities that are facing genocide.” This is a back-door way of legislating a religious test for refugees, by exploiting a powerful word that didn’t seem to move Cruz when it mattered. Last year, after Yazidis were rounded up, executed, and enslaved by the Islamic State, Cruz voted against a bill that gave President Barack Obama authority and funds to fight the organization.","2827","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"

"A lot of people in this country are disgracing themselves this week. They include politicians of both parties—though many more Republicans than Democrats—and all regions. Their motives vary: deep-seated bigotry, unreasoning fear, spinelessness, opportunism, or some unholy mix of them all. During the House hearings, Republicans kept demanding guarantees of absolute security. “I haven’t heard a single one of you say there’s no risk,” Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told Administration witnesses. There’s no such thing as no risk. Parisians could stop going out to cafés, Germans could turn back every single Syrian at the border, Americans could stop admitting anyone as a refugee, and there would still be risks. It’s absurd, and infantilizing, to demand that our officials promise to keep us absolutely safe. We don’t live that way, nor should we. Instead, we have to find the balance between safety and a decent life in a free society during an age of terror. Like every compromise, it will leave us unsatisfied.

I wish Ted Cruz, Trey Gowdy, and other panic-stricken demagogues had been in the audience. One of the Syrians, a journalist named Zaina Erhaim, screened four short films she’s made about women going about their lives in Aleppo, Syria, which is one of the least safe places in the world. Two of her subjects were on the panel—Ahed and Zein. They both work for international relief agencies in Aleppo, distributing bread and bandaging the wounded. Zein also teaches small children in a school that is literally underground. A fourth woman, Rafea, works as an activist and writer in Damascus. All four are from Sunni Muslim families, though Rafea is a self-described atheist; Ahed and Zein wore the hijab. To get to New York, Ahed had to spend several nights in the mountains outside Aleppo, since the Turkish border crossing is closed and the roads aren’t safe. Asked what she wants from Americans, Erhaim, the filmmaker, said an end to air attacks on cities, and a safe zone for civilians along the border. All of the women said that they no longer have any hope for Syria, but all of them are going back there.","2830","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"

"Yesterday, Jim Webb, who was running for the Democratic Presidential nomination, dropped out of the race, and suggested that he may run as a third-party candidate. In his announcement, he blasted the two parties and suggested that the real political force in America is independents. “Our political candidates are being pulled to the extremes,” he said, at the National Press Club in Washington. “They are increasingly out of step with the people they are supposed to serve. Poll after poll shows that a strong plurality of Americans is neither Republican nor Democrat. Overwhelmingly they’re independents. Americans don’t like the extremes to which both parties have moved in recent years, and I don’t blame them.”","October 21, 2015","2839","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"Today, Joe Biden announced that he would forgo a Presidential run, and he made a similar case that America is being damaged by excessive partisanship. “I believe that we have to end the divisive partisan politics that is ripping this country apart,” Biden said, in remarks in the Rose Garden. “And I think we can. It’s mean-spirited, it’s petty, and it’s gone on for much too long. I don’t believe, like some do, that it’s naïve to talk to Republicans. I don’t think we should look at Republicans as our enemies. They are our opposition. They’re not our enemies. And for the sake of the country, we have to work together. As the President has said many times, compromise is not a dirty word. But look at it this way, folks: How does this country function without consensus? How can we move forward without being able to arrive at consensus? Four more years of this kind of pitched battle may be more than this country can take. We have to change it.

"Finally, over in the House, as the majority party struggles to find a new Speaker, Congressman Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, floated the intriguing idea of putting together a “bipartisan coalition” to elect the next leader. He called it “basic math”: if Republicans don’t have two hundred and eighteen votes for a Speaker, they will need to nominate a candidate that can win some votes from Democrats. If Paul Ryan, who laid out several conditions in order for him to formally enter the race for Speaker, decides against running—or if he is defeated—then perhaps Dent’s idea will gain currency. For now, it seems as dead as Biden and Webb’s candidacies.","2841","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"The dilemmas faced by Webb, Biden, and Dent were different in many ways, but common to all three is a familiar structural fact of American politics that is making centrist politics seem increasingly out of reach and anachronistic. In 1950, the American Political Science Association published a major report on the state of America’s two-party system. The authors worried that the public had little idea what to expect when they voted for a Democrat or a Republican, because each party was a mish-mash of interests with little ideological consistency. What was needed in American politics were parties with more “internal cohesion,” so that when one party was in control the average voter would understand generally where it stood on the major issues. In addition, the party out of power needed to present sharp differences. The report said, “The fundamental requirement of accountability is a two-party system in which the opposition party acts as the critic of the party in power, developing, defining, and presenting the policy alternatives which are necessary for a true choice in reaching public decisions.”","2842","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"The report had many recommendations about improving politics in America, but the basic headline was one that seems amusing today: America wasn’t polarized enough. Starting in the seventies, that all began to change. This graph from the Pew Research Center documents how the two parties, which were once both coalitions of liberals and conservatives, gradually began to pull apart until they were perfectly sorted: all liberals are now in the Democratic Party and all conservatives are now in the Republican Party. There is no longer any middle.","2843","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"This great hollowing out of the political center helps to explain the week’s events. Webb’s analysis about independents being the greatest bloc of votes in America is wrong.

"One recent morning at the Jefferson Hotel, in Washington, D.C., Peter Wehner, a conservative writer who served as an adviser for the past three Republican Presidents, described his party’s problems over a bowl of oatmeal. He said, “We got clobbered in 2012”—the fifth Presidential election out of the past six in which the Republican candidate lost the popular vote. “There’s a demographic problem. White votes are going down two points every year. We’re out of touch with the middle class.” Mitt Romney—whose very hair embodies wealthy privilege—was nominated at a national convention, in Tampa, that became an Ayn Rand-style celebration of business executives, the heroic “makers.” During the campaign, Romney wrote off forty-seven per cent of the country—the “takers”—as government parasites. He went on to lose badly to President Barack Obama, whom Republicans had regarded as an obvious failure, a target as vulnerable as Jimmy Carter. In the shock of that defeat, Wehner said, some conservatives realized that “there was a need for a policy agenda that reaches the middle class.” He added, “This was not a blinding insight.”","2848","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"A generation ago, Democrats lost five of six Presidential elections; in 1992, Bill Clinton, calling himself a New Democrat, ended the streak. Clinton didn’t repudiate the whole Democratic platform—government activism on behalf of ordinary Americans remained the Party’s core idea—but he adopted positions on issues like crime and welfare that were more closely aligned with the views of the majority, including some rank-and-file Democrats. The message, Wehner said, was as much symbolic as substantive: “ ‘We’re not a radical party; we’ve sanded off our rougher edges, and you can trust me.’ ” He went on, “The hope for some of us was that our candidate in 2016 would be the Republican version of Clinton”—a conservative reformer who, having learned from past defeats, championed economic policies that placed Republicans on the side of the hard-pressed, including non-white Americans, the soon-to-be majority.","2849","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"For fresh ideas, such a candidate had only to turn to a group of Republican thinkers who call themselves “reformocons,” of whom Wehner is a leader. Last year, the reformocons published a pamphlet of policy proposals called “Room to Grow,” on health care, education, taxes, entitlements, and other topics. In an introduction, Wehner writes, “Americans do not have a sense that conservatives offer them a better shot at success and security than liberals. For that to change, conservatives in American politics need to understand constituents’ concerns, speak to those aspirations and worries, and help people see how applying conservative principles and deploying conservative policies could help make their lives better.”","2850","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"The essays don’t upend Republican orthodoxy. They argue that government should intervene on behalf of poor and middle-income Americans, but in ways that apply market principles to public policy, taking power away from Washington and giving individuals more options. Some proposals are familiar: school choice, health-care savings accounts. Others are more daring—for example, having college education underwritten by private investors, then repaid over the next decade as a predetermined percentage of graduates’ earnings. A few ideas, such as a wage subsidy that would increase the pay of workers making less than forty thousand dollars a year, building on the Earned Income Tax Credit, could easily garner bipartisan support.","2851","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Room to Grow” contains a striking description of the American economic landscape: children born into poverty with little chance of escaping it, and middle-class families overwhelmed by the rising costs of health care and education while their incomes stay flat. It’s not that different from the story that Elizabeth Warren, the liberal Massachusetts senator, tells. After years of ignoring these stark realities—or of blaming big government, in the spirit of Ronald Reagan—some Republicans have begun to sound more like Abraham Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt.","2852","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"The reformocon project shows how extreme mainstream conservatism has become in its opposition to anything involving the state. The reformocons court right-wing censure simply by acknowledging that the middle class is under pressure, and that government has a role to play beyond cutting taxes.

Governor John Kasich, of Ohio, read an essay by Wehner and Michael Gerson, a speechwriter in the Bush White House, titled “A Conservative Vision of Government,” and expressed approval to an aide. Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, sought policy advice from several reformocons, including Yuval Levin, who, as editor of the quarterly National Affairs, is the group’s foremost intellectual. Earlier this year, Rubio published a book, “American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone,” interwoven with the personal stories of struggling Floridians.

Since he entered the race, in June, slurs and feuds have been the mainstay of his media image. Less widely discussed are his positions on working- and middle-class concerns like trade, taxes, and entitlements. In his scattershot, get-out-of-my-way fashion, Trump has vowed to rewrite trade deals involving China, impose tariffs on the products of American companies that send manufacturing overseas, leave Social Security and Medicare alone, and raise taxes on hedge-fund managers. (“I want to save the middle class. The hedge-fund guys didn’t build this country.

"Trump’s popularity isn’t based on ideology. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, he draws about evenly from Republicans who consider themselves “moderate to liberal,” “somewhat conservative,” and “very conservative.” More than anything, Trump supporters are defined by class: non-college-educated whites favor him at twice the rate of those with college degrees. Trump is attracting the very blue-collar Americans whom the reformocons were aiming to bind to the Republican Party. So far, at least, these voters, many of them angry and alienated, aren’t listening to the “Room to Grow” crowd. They’re thrilling to madder music.","2857","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Working-class whites remain the most coveted demographic in American politics, even as they shrink as a percentage of the electorate. Ever since Ronald Reagan became President, Democrats have worried about their declining share of this vote. In 2012, Obama captured just thirty-six per cent of white voters without college degrees, down three per cent from 2008—partly owing to the unpopularity of the Affordable Care Act, and skewed by Obama’s abysmal numbers among white Southerners. The emergence of the reformocons shows that more thoughtful Republicans have also grown concerned about the allegiance of the Party’s presumed base.","2858","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Last year, a Gallup poll found that forty-five per cent of Republicans think that the rich should pay more in taxes.

Although government activism is anathema to conservative donors and Grover Norquist, it’s fine with a lot of Republicans making less than fifty thousand dollars a year. April Ponnuru’s husband, Ramesh, a contributor to “Room to Grow” and a senior editor at National Review, said, “Trump shows that Republican voters are not especially dogmatic conservatives—not as much as I’d like them to be.”","2859","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

But he is proving that certain beliefs the professional political class had about who Republican primary voters are—what they respond to, what they care about—were just incorrect.” In 2008, Salam, along with Ross Douthat, the Times columnist, published a manifesto that presaged the reformocon movement: “Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream.” Salam grew up in lower-middle-class, multi-ethnic Brooklyn. At Harvard, where he met Douthat, he became interested in wage subsidies “as a way to enhance the legitimacy of market economies,” he said. “There’s a natural marriage between a belief in a dynamic economy and a belief in solidarity and mutual trust, because the one tempers the other. Most human beings seek stability. A society where you allow this idea of a dynamic economy to pervade every aspect of life is very frightening to people, and certainly you’re not going to be able to build a political coalition around it.”","2860","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Salam, the son of Bangladeshi immigrants, is critical of increased immigration and believes that Trump, though the wrong messenger, has forced an important issue into the open.

Salam’s idea of a national community, united by a sense of mutual obligations and a belief in legitimate institutions, evokes the type of conservatism found in Europe. Trump, meanwhile, calls to mind Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi: a strongman, a nationalist, and a nativist, who appeals to voters of limited means by tapping into their gauzy aspirations, echoing their anxieties about decline, and assuring them a secure place in a country restored to greatness. Trump presents himself as a capitalist boss who won’t let capitalism tear apart the (white) social fabric.","2861","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

His sustained popularity shows how contradictory and irrational the Party has become. It’s as if, in 1992, Democrats had thrown their support to Ross Perot, not Bill Clinton, because Perot—while departing from much of the Party’s basic ideology and offering only crude policy simplifications—voiced the submerged feelings of many Democrats whose presence hadn’t registered with national leaders and pundits.","2863","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

The Wall Street Journal has denounced him for supporting protectionist trade policies and higher taxes on the wealthy, especially hedge-fund managers and other beneficiaries of the “carried-interest” loophole, which allows them to pay taxes at lower rates than middle-income Americans. The Club for Growth, a conservative pressure group devoted to low taxes and small government, has aired ads deploring Trump’s past positions on taxes.

"“This is like a lunar eclipse,” Wehner told me in August, when many Republicans still believed that Trump would fade by September. “The damage he’s doing—while he’s leading in the polls, that’s the face and voice of the Party, and it’s toxic.” Wehner insisted that Trump is the antithesis of real conservatism: his confidence in his ability to fix America’s problems single-handedly shows no understanding of the restraints embedded in the Constitution and the separation of powers. “In no traditional sense could you call him a conservative,” Wehner said. “Conservatism in the spirit of Madison is the idea of taking popular passions and channelling them in a constructive way. Trump is doing the opposite—he’s taking popular passions and stoking them, by demonizing the Other.” Since then, Trump’s front-runner status has been challenged by another outsider, Ben Carson, who presents even more extreme ideas, but with a whisper instead of a shout. In late September, Wehner posted an essay on the Commentary Web site called “The G.O.P. Is Killing Itself.”","2866","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Conservatism in the spirit of Madison” has almost ceased to exist. The outlook of the Republican grass roots, and of many Party leaders, is what Richard Hofstadter, writing toward the end of the McCarthy era, called “pseudo-conservative,” because “its exponents, although they believe themselves to be conservatives and usually employ the rhetoric of conservatism, show signs of a serious and restless dissatisfaction with American life, traditions, and institutions.” Republicans today have given the country conservatism in the spirit of Sarah Palin, whose ignorance about the world, contempt for expertise, and raw appeals to white identity politics presaged Trump’s incendiary campaign. So did the spectacle, in 2009, of a Republican congressman calling the President a liar during a speech Obama gave to a joint session of Congress, and Party leaders comparing Obamacare to Nazism and slavery. Earlier this year, forty-seven Republican senators wrote the Supreme Leader of Iran and declared that the President didn’t speak for the country. There have been regular threats to close the federal government in order to accomplish limited political goals. (In September, another shutdown, over the defunding of Planned Parenthood, was narrowly avoided, despite the support of nearly all the Republican Presidential candidates.) On right-wing radio, Obama is constantly accused of tyranny and treason. Once the restraints are lifted, they’re hard to restore. Trump may be the bastard spawn of the Republican Party, but his parentage can’t be denied.","2867","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In mid-September, I travelled to a small town in southeastern New Hampshire called Raymond, where John Kasich was holding a town-hall meeting in a middle-school auditorium. Eighty chairs were arranged around a stool. One of the early arrivals was a twenty-six-year-old named Mark Lynch, who had come with his grandmother. Lynch, the son of a firefighter and a factory worker, had a crewcut and stubble, and wore a Red Sox T-shirt that exposed the tattoos on his biceps. He had just finished four years of service in the Navy and was training to be a policeman. Lynch wanted to hear what Kasich had to say, but he was more interested in the billionaire with the copper comb-over.","2868","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Trump is tapping into this belief that politicians are self-serving,” Lynch told me. “He’s telling these donors, ‘I don’t need your money, I’ll finance my own campaign.’ If you look at what’s controlling government these days, it’s lobbyists and all these big corporations.” Lynch liked Trump’s positions on trade, taxes, and Wall Street. “People don’t want to see billionaires getting richer,” he said. “If Donald Trump, a billionaire in his own right, is saying billionaires in Washington and New York should be paying more—that says something.”","2869","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Lynch sounded a bit like a Sanders guy. When I pointed this out, his grandmother made a face. Lynch said that he couldn’t possibly vote for Sanders—“a self-proclaimed socialist from Vermont.” Lynch was a conservative, not so much on specific policies but in his values and in his ideas about America’s character. He didn’t want an overweening government creating costly programs and interfering in people’s lives. He just wanted a system that wasn’t rigged in favor of the rich and well-connected.","2870","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In Lynch’s eyes, his antipathy toward this privileged class didn’t make him an unwitting Democrat. “I don’t think Republicans are the party of big corporations and billionaires,” he said. “They’re for ordinary middle-class people.” The problem wasn’t conservatism but the dirty role of money in politics. Change would have to come at the hands of someone who wasn’t beholden to the system—a rich outsider like Trump.","2871","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich entered the room, dressed casually, all in black. At sixty-three, he’s lean and combative, with a slump in his posture and a jutting neck. He served nine terms in Congress, and, as chairman of the House Budget Committee, in the nineties, he was a key lieutenant of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and a crusader for balanced budgets. As he never fails to tell audiences, he helped craft the 1997 deal that brought surpluses to the federal government for the first time in three decades, though most of the credit belonged to a booming economy. Elected governor of Ohio in 2010, and reëlected overwhelmingly last year, Kasich turned the state’s deficits into surpluses, while cutting taxes. This is the essence of his stump speech.","2872","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“I’m running for President ’cause I know how to land the plane,” he said, without mentioning the name of the candidate who could well crash it. “I understand that people are frustrated. My dad carried mail on his back. My mother was a blue-collar housewife. I understand anxieties about losing jobs and ringing up college debt. I know all this. But we can beat these things.” The way to beat them was to cut the deficit and say no to special interests in Washington. He offered no policy proposals to help the middle class, besides balancing the federal budget and deregulating business.","2873","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich added a dose of spiritual uplift to this starchy message. “We need to live a life bigger than ourselves,” he said. “Life is not just about me, me, me, me, me. Do you agree with that? It’s about living a life that’s bigger than yourself. . . . I am the most flawed in this room, but at least I know I give grace and every day I can start over and try to do something positive.” There’s a strain of George W. Bush’s compassionate conservatism in Kasich. (During a run for the Presidency in 2000, Kasich admitted to wishing that he’d thought up the term.) He often mentions the working poor in the same breath as the addicted and the mentally ill, as if all three groups needed charitable help. He has supported the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio, to the abhorrence of many conservatives; he likes to say that he’ll have this accomplishment in hand when St. Peter asks him what he did for the poor. “Be a center of justice and healing,” Kasich told the audience in Raymond.","2874","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich, unlike Trump or Sanders, isn’t angry on behalf of the middle class. Ramesh Ponnuru told me, “Kasich’s problem is that he speaks down to poorer people—not to middle-class self-interest.

I can’t—” He pointed a finger at me. “What do you think I should do?” I started to describe Lynch’s views, and when Kasich realized I was talking about an ex-serviceman he found his sound bite: “Our veterans, they should be top priority.”","2880","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Lynch later told me that he was “very disappointed” by Kasich’s answer to the question about the campaign-finance system. “If you take care of the money issues in politics, it’s going to solve the problem of politicians going to Washington and either doing nothing or catering to lobbyists and big donors,” he said.","2881","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Lynch still liked Trump, but he was beginning to worry that Trump was offending too many people to be elected; Republicans couldn’t afford to abandon the Hispanic vote in Colorado and Florida. “My ideal candidate would be somebody who has a lot of Donald Trump’s views but is more polished,” he said. The best alternative, he felt, was Rubio. When I pointed out that Rubio was a Washington insider, Lynch sighed. “That’s the pickle I’m in, and a lot of people are in,” he said. “No matter who gets elected, it’s just going to be more of the same.

"Over the past few years, the key phrase for Democrats has been “income inequality.” The relentlessly widening gap between wealthy Americans and the rest—accelerated by the Great Recession and the not-so-great recovery—is at the heart of Sanders’s campaign, animates many of Hillary Clinton’s policies, and would make Warren an instant contender were she to enter the race. But “inequality” is a word that Republicans don’t like to use. Romney, during his Presidential campaign, characterized “inequality” as a code word: “I think it’s about envy. I think it’s about class warfare.”","2883","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In 2012, Wehner co-authored an essay in National Affairs, titled “How to Think About Inequality.” He concludes:","2884","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In other words, the way to think about inequality is by looking down, not up. It’s not the wealth amassed at the top but, rather, the lack of “skills, values, and habits” at the bottom that accounts for the widening income gap. Oddly, Wehner’s essay barely mentions the economic struggles of the middle class. A close look at the three middle quintiles of income, where Americans with an education, a job, and a spouse can be found treading water or sinking, would have forced him to reconsider the notion that a lack of “social capital”—as opposed to just capital—explains the entire problem.","2885","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Even though the reformocons recognize the difficulties of the middle class, they prefer to focus not on income disparities but on “mobility,” which describes how individuals fare across their own life span and in comparison with past generations. Levin told me that the word “growth”—the unconvincing mantra of supply-siders—was losing its hold on conservatives. When Jeb Bush predicted that his economic policies would lead to four-per-cent economic growth, a level not seen since the late nineties, the claim was either ignored or derided. “ ‘Mobility’ is much healthier,” Levin said. “It’s the right lens to talk about the economy.”","2886","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"But there’s a reason to look up as well as down the economic ladder, and it has nothing to do with envy or with punishing the rich. Economic stratification, and the rise of a super-wealthy class, threatens our democracy. Americans are growing increasingly separated from one another along lines of class, in every aspect of life: where they’re born and grow up, where they go to school, what they eat, how they travel, whom they marry, what their children do, how long they live, how they die. What kind of “national community” built on “mutual obligation” is possible when Americans have so little shared experience? The Princeton economist Alan Krueger has demonstrated that societies with higher levels of income inequality are societies with lower levels of social mobility. As America has grown less economically equal, a citizen’s ability to move upward has fallen behind that of citizens in other Western democracies. We are no longer the country where anyone can become anything.","2887","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Inequality saps the economy by draining the buying power of Americans whose incomes have stagnated, forcing them to rely on debt to fund education, housing, and health care. At the top, it creates deep pools of wealth that have nowhere productive to go, leading to asset bubbles in capital markets bearing little or no relation to the health of the over-all economy. (Critics call this the “financialization” of the economy.) These fallouts from inequality were among the causes of the Great Recession.","2888","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Inequality is also warping America’s political system. Greatly concentrated wealth leads to outsized political power in the hands of the few—even in a democracy with free and fair elections—which pushes government to create rules that favor the rich. It’s no accident that we’re in the era of Citizens United. Such rulings give ordinary Americans the strong suspicion that the game is rigged. Democratic institutions no longer feel legitimate when they continue to produce blatantly unfair outcomes; it’s one of those insights that only an élite could miss. And it’s backed up by evidence as well as by common sense. Last year, two political scientists found that, in recent times, policy ideas have rarely been adopted by the U.S. government unless they’re favored by corporations and the wealthy—even when those ideas are supported by most Americans. The persistence of the highly unpopular carried-interest loophole for hedge-fund managers is simply the most unseemly example.","2889","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"Thus far in the campaign, the ideas of the reformocons have scarcely made an appearance among the Republican candidates. In Washington in June, Rubio—the favorite of the reformers—gave a speech to a group of them summarizing the arguments of his book. And he became the first Republican candidate to support paid family leave when, in September, he proposed a tax credit for businesses that offer their employees between four and twelve weeks off to care for newborns or sick family members. (Critics say that the tax credit wouldn’t offset enough of the costs in wages to induce companies to permit such leaves.) For the most part, though, Rubio has left the proposals in “American Dreams” on the shelf. “Rubio has the most interesting platform, but he’s not using it,” Ramesh Ponnuru said. Rubio, the son of a bartender and a maid who both emigrated from Cuba, “has established himself as the articulate, different Republican in a biographical sense,” Ponnuru added. “He’s not working to establish himself as a problem-solver. His campaign guys must be saying, ‘You have a good story, and voters aren’t interested in policy ideas.’ ”","2891","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In April, Rubio announced a tax proposal that hardly diverges from the Republican Party line. It offers families a twenty-five-hundred-dollar tax credit per child. But the proposal also reduces income taxes beyond the levels of George W. Bush’s cuts, making them even more regressive; cuts corporate taxes by ten per cent; and eliminates taxes on most investment income and inheritance. It gives a huge windfall to the rich, amounting to trillions of dollars in tax revenue. At the same time, Rubio promises to increase defense spending and pass a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Ponnuru offered an explanation for Rubio’s lapse into conventional conservative thinking: “The problem with the campaign-finance system is that it forces the candidates to spend too much time with rich people.”","2892","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Even though Rubio’s tax plan included the usual deep cuts for the wealthy, it was unacceptable to the Wall Street Journal, which criticized the child tax credit as a giveaway. Stephen Moore, the former president of the Club for Growth, explained his opposition to the columnist Albert R. Hunt: “The more you increase things like the child tax credit, the more you will move back to the 1960s and 70s tax system with higher tax rates.”","2893","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Jeb Bush, another hope of the reformocons, issued his tax plan in September. He framed it as an attempt to support social mobility and the “right to rise”—the name of his Super PAC, which, in the first half of the year, raised more than a hundred million dollars. Such rhetoric fooled some political reporters into characterizing the plan as “populist.” Though it does eliminate the carried-interest loophole, it offers the rich more than ample compensation, in the form of a large cut in income and capital-gains taxes. According to the Times, people making ten million dollars or more a year would see their effective tax rates reduced from twenty-six to twenty-one per cent, saving them an average of a million and a half dollars a year. Bush’s plan would drain up to $3.4 trillion dollars from the Treasury.","2894","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In the end, the reformocon candidates haven’t sounded that much different from Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, and Rand Paul. All of them have had more to say about defunding Planned Parenthood, shutting down the federal government, repealing Obamacare, balancing the budget, and building a wall along the border with Mexico than about the problems of the middle class. The mantle of economic populism has essentially been handed to Donald Trump.","2895","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"At a press conference at Trump Tower on September 28th, Trump unveiled his own tax plan. “Too few Americans are working, too many jobs are being shipped overseas, and too many middle-income families cannot make ends meet,” he proclaimed. “This plan directly meets these challenges, and the challenges also of business.” What followed was a tax cut for just about everybody. Seventy-five million Americans—single people making less than twenty-five thousand dollars a year and married couples making less than fifty—would be dropped from the tax rolls altogether. But the biggest winners would be the rich: Trump would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four, and would cut the rates of the top earners by fourteen per cent, below the level proposed by Bush. Even Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform blessed Trump’s plan. In the midst of an anti-establishment revolt, supply-side dogma has an unbreakable hold on Republican politics.","2896","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

The Presidential campaign felt far away—Ohio’s primary isn’t until next March—but the state remains key to the general election. “Part of it is that Trump’s an emblem of success, and the other part of it is he taps people’s anger,” Green said. “It’s not the same anger as a few years ago, when it was ‘Where are the jobs?’ Now it’s ‘Where’s our share of the American dream?’ ” Green, who does polling research on Ohio and American politics, went on, “A lot of white working-class votes are up for grabs in this election. In recent years, they’ve gone Republican, but this year the Democrats could get a slice of them.” The Republican coalition of business interests and the white working class, he said, “is under more stress this year than it’s been for a while.”","2897","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

Canton is one of those American towns where industrial decline and population loss give a sense of uninhabited space. The Hoover vacuum company, once headquartered in North Canton, was acquired in 2007 by a Hong Kong firm that moved production to Mexico and China. An abandoned brick factory is being redeveloped for white-collar service companies and apartments.

"After a winter of continuous below-zero temperatures, many of Canton’s streets crumbled, and nearly a year later they remain impassable. The Democratic mayor, William Healy, laid the blame for the city’s infrastructure woes on climate change and John Kasich. In balancing Ohio’s budget, the Governor dramatically reduced state contributions to local governments while cutting certain business taxes and eliminating the estate tax. The result, Healy said, was a loss of seventeen million dollars to Canton—twenty per cent of its revenue—bringing spending below the level of 2007. The Mayor had to choose between keeping policemen and firemen employed or repairing broken streets. “That tells you the impact of John Kasich,” he said. “But on the national front, where you’ve got Trump, Kasich comes across as a moderate! Damaging as Kasich has been to my city, as mayor, if I had to vote for a Republican for President I would vote for Kasich over the entire field.

"Around Ohio, local governments are being forced to choose between raising taxes and neglecting services, even though the state now has a two-billion-dollar “rainy-day fund.” In his stump speech in New Hampshire, Kasich claimed that his fiscal policies helped create three hundred thousand jobs. In fact, Ohio remains below its pre-recession employment rate, meaning that the state has lagged behind most of the country during the recovery. Zach Schiller, the head of research at the nonpartisan group Policy Matters Ohio, in Cleveland, told me, “Kasich’s claims to good economic performance? I don’t know if I want to say ‘deceptive,’ but they’re certainly misleading.”","2900","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"According to Policy Matters Ohio, since 2013 Kasich’s policies, including a higher sales tax and cigarette tax, have raised average annual taxes on the state’s poorest fifth by seventeen dollars, given middle-income people a ninety-four-dollar cut, and returned seventeen thousand dollars to members of the one per cent. “We’ve engineered a tax shift to lower- and middle-income Ohioans,” Schiller said. “And we’ve reduced over-all tax revenue.”","2901","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich’s tax policies have earned him the approval of Arthur Laffer, a native of nearby Youngstown, whose famous curve—supposedly demonstrating that lower income taxes generate higher revenue by stimulating economic growth—started the revolution in supply-side economics, forty years ago. Schiller pointed out that nothing in Ohio’s recent economic experience supports supply-side theory. The same is true nationally: growth has accelerated in periods when tax rates have been higher on top earners and stalled when rates came down. Kasich, who has positioned himself as the capable, reasonable, experienced “grownup” on the G.O.P. stage, is a supply-sider at his core. As long as Republicans cling to the warped logic of trickle-down economics, their efforts to help middle-class Americans will be largely rhetorical.","2902","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

A worker named Mike Yeater said that he liked Trump’s positions on “immigration stuff and issues like that—he’s got patriotic beliefs.” But after Trump told the Detroit News that union autoworkers needed to accept lower wages Yeater stopped paying attention to him. Another worker said that he’d been reading Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-first Century,” and that he liked Sanders but was also interested in Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard professor who is running for President on a platform of radical campaign-finance reform.

"Baum calls himself an independent libertarian. “I believe in the company’s right to make money,” he said. “It helps all of us. And I also believe in the worker’s right to bargain for a fair wage.” In 2004, as president of the local, Baum led difficult negotiations; managers and workers eventually came to terms by making concessions—they needed one another to keep the steel industry alive. “This time is different,” he said. “They brought new people in to break the union. They do not respect us. They look at us as a number.”","2909","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Baum believes that “The Jungle,” Upton Sinclair’s classic novel about the Chicago stockyards, should be required reading for American corporations. “At the turn of the century, the boss would go home and sleep with your wife in order for you to keep your job,” he said. Unions, he explained, were “a necessary evil. We need them, ’cause without them—I don’t know if you’d see a return to the turn of the century, where children are working, but corporations still have that deep-rooted sense of ‘I’ll just work you.

He didn’t agree with everything Trump said, but he liked his position on trade and his tax plan—the way that it cut working-class people’s taxes to zero but also gave businesses a financial break, “because it’s killing our industries’ competitiveness.” He thought that Trump was strong enough to bring jobs back to America, and he appreciated his willingness to tell both parties, “You can’t buy me.” Baum found Trump’s insulting manner refreshing, calling it “a mirror of the way they treat us.”","2911","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

This is a country of capitalists—everybody should be rich. The problem is, the rich don’t want anybody rubbing shoulders with them. The middle class hits that wall and can’t get over it.

"In an essay in “Room to Grow,” Yuval Levin describes what makes conservatives different from liberals. Conservatives don’t emphasize the individual and the state; they focus on the space between—where families, communities, religious groups, associations, and private enterprises create a web of interrelationships. “What happens in that space generally happens face to face—between parents and children, neighbors and friends, buyers and sellers,” he writes. “It therefore answers to immediately felt needs, and is tailored to the characters, sentiments, priorities, and preferences of the people involved. This kind of bottom-up common life, rather than massive, distant systems of material provision, is what makes society tick.”","2913","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

The “massive, distant system of material provision” is their company, which is far more top-down than any federal bureaucracy. Nothing happens face to face; immediately felt needs go ignored; families don’t matter. There is no “common life” except for the workers’ desperate effort to stick together as they look ahead to weeks or months without pay—or, perhaps, a future without a job. Global competition is making these workers disposable, and so they are turning for insight and inspiration to Sanders, or Piketty, or Trump.

"In late February, 1944, when the United States was at war and national unity was in fashion, the Democratic Senate Majority Leader, Alben Barkley, announced that he was resigning, effective immediately; he put down his gavel and walked out of the Capitol building. But unlike Speaker John Boehner, who on September 24th told Republican House members that he intended to quit at the end of October, Barkley’s complaint was not a rebellion from fellow Democrats but arrogance in the White House. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, he felt, had little regard for the Senate and, with provocative disrespect, had vetoed a revenue and tax bill, something his fellow Democrats had pleaded with him not to do.","October 20, 2015","2915","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"For Barkley, who had served in Congress for thirty-one years and was sometimes mocked as Roosevelt’s lapdog, that was one humiliation too many. He declared that “there is something more precious to me than any honor that can be conferred upon me….and that is the approval of my own conscience and my own self-respect.” What followed, as the New York Herald Tribune reported, was something that bore little resemblance to the sour aftermath of Boehner’s decision: an “ovation unprecedented within the memory of Senators now living.…Senators on both sides of the floor broke the customary rule of decorum and rose in their places to applaud.…The business of the Senate was suspended for ten minutes while the congratulations went on.”","2916","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"There was no such outpouring for Boehner, and little appreciation for his futile attempts to bring stability and civility to a House divided by factions and, in the case of the House Freedom Caucus, an ideological certitude bordering on zealotry. During Boehner’s tenure the “people’s House” became a virtually rudderless organization that now seems unable even to choose a replacement leader. Its members were in full rebellion against—what, exactly? The Freedom Caucus leader, Ohio’s Jim Jordan, seems to crave more legislative anarchy: “reform” that would allow anyone to introduce, and offer for debate, even hopelessly doomed bills and amendments, a process that he said “will benefit everyone.” It has the potential to make caucus members sound like Steve Martin in his routine as a hostage-taker with three demands: a hundred thousand dollars in cash, a getaway car, “and I want the letter ‘M’ stricken from the English language.”","2917","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"Back in 1944, the Times saw Barkley’s resignation as “the greatest political crisis of [Roosevelt’s] three terms”; the Trib called it “one of the most dramatic conflicts between the executive and legislative branches” in American history. Outside Washington, there was alarm at the seeming inability of the President and Congress to cooperate; it was front-page news in wartime London, where headlines said, “Roosevelt faces grave crisis on home front” and “Democrat rages at FDR.” There was concern that Roosevelt’s leadership in foreign affairs might be compromised, especially after his veto was overturned by embarrassingly large margins (299–95 in the House, and 72–14 in the Senate).","2918","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"In the case of the Boehner, the world outside Washington didn’t seem to care very much, which was not surprising. Why should anyone care? In a list of problems facing the planet, Boehner’s pending departure, the abdication of Kevin McCarthy, the unenthusiastic courtship of Paul Ryan to take a job he doesn’t seem to want—maneuverings barely comprehensible to most Americans—would probably not rank high.","2919","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"Unlike the disarray in Boehner’s House, the intramural Democratic fight in the 1944 Senate was resolved with great haste. Roosevelt sent Barkley a “Dear Alben” message that, after recounting their differences vis-à-vis the tax bill and assuring Barkley that he didn’t doubt his good faith, went on to “hope your colleagues will not accept your resignation; but if they do, I sincerely hope that they will immediately and unanimously re-elect you.” That is precisely what happened; history’s earthquake ended overnight. Perhaps because the sixty-six-year-old Barkley harbored Presidential, or Vice-Presidential, ambitions (he wanted to run with F.D.R. in 1944; he became Harry Truman’s running mate in 1948), he still flattered Roosevelt. He told F.D.R. that he had worked for him “with an inspiration, a devotion, and a personal affection which has not been approached by any other men.” He was still able to burn bridges and then cross them.","2920","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"But if little seemed different after Barkley’s one-day drama, there was nonetheless a significant change: he emerged from his reinstatement, as the Trib pointed out, as the “majority’s majority leader” rather than a Roosevelt whip. He had become his own man, which gave him increased stature in both branches of government. Boehner’s successor, who will need approval from the forty-person Freedom Caucus, may end up being the “majority’s minority’s Speaker.”","2921","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"Alben Barkley had many of the attributes of a bloviating politician, but he did rise to this singular occasion, writing to Roosevelt that “there is something broader and more fundamental than any personal acquiescence as between you and me over matters of public policy and fundamental principles.” He continued, “In this great crisis of our nation’s history we must all seek some common ground….If we cannot trust one another…how can the people trust us?” Someday it will certainly be asked why House Republicans in the Boehner era were unable to ask the same question.","2922","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"“I am who I am,” Donald J. Trump said in August, on the eve of this season’s first G.O.P. Presidential debate, and what he meant by that was this: “I don’t have a pollster.” The word “pollster,” when it was coined, was meant as a slur, like “huckster.” That’s the way Trump uses it. Other candidates have pollsters: “They pay these guys two hundred thousand dollars a month to tell them, ‘Don’t say this, don’t say that.’ ” Trump has none: “No one tells me what to say.”","2923","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

I am who I am, the Candidate says, and my Opponents are flunkies. Trump makes this claim with unrivalled swagger, but citing his campaign’s lack of a pollster as proof of his character, while fascinating, is utterly disingenuous. The Path to Office is long. To reach the Land of Caucuses and Primaries, the Candidate must first cross the Sea of Polls. Trump is a creature of that sea.","2924","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Lately, the Sea of Polls is deeper than ever before, and darker. From the late nineteen-nineties to 2012, twelve hundred polling organizations conducted nearly thirty-seven thousand polls by making more than three billion phone calls. Most Americans refused to speak to them. This skewed results. Mitt Romney’s pollsters believed, even on the morning of the election, that Romney would win. A 2013 study—a poll—found that three out of four Americans suspect polls of bias.

"The modern public-opinion poll has been around since the Great Depression, when the response rate—the number of people who take a survey as a percentage of those who were asked—was more than ninety. The participation rate—the number of people who take a survey as a percentage of the population—is far lower. Election pollsters sample only a minuscule portion of the electorate, not uncommonly something on the order of a couple of thousand people out of the more than two hundred million Americans who are eligible to vote. The promise of this work is that the sample is exquisitely representative. But the lower the response rate the harder and more expensive it becomes to realize that promise, which requires both calling many more people and trying to correct for “non-response bias” by giving greater weight to the answers of people from demographic groups that are less likely to respond. Pollster.com’s Mark Blumenthal has recalled how, in the nineteen-eighties, when the response rate at the firm where he was working had fallen to about sixty per cent, people in his office said, “What will happen when it’s only twenty? We won’t be able to be in business!” A typical response rate is now in the single digits.","2926","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Meanwhile, polls are wielding greater influence over American elections than ever. In May, Fox News announced that, in order to participate in its first prime-time debate, hosted jointly with Facebook, Republican candidates had to “place in the top ten of an average of the five most recent national polls.” Where the candidates stood on the debate stage would also be determined by their polling numbers. (Ranking in the polls had earlier been used to exclude third-party candidates.) Scott Keeter, Pew’s director of survey research, is among the many public-opinion experts who found Fox News’s decision insupportable. “I just don’t think polling is really up to the task of deciding the field for the headliner debate,” Keeter told me. Bill McInturff doesn’t think so, either. McInturff is a co-founder of Public Opinion Strategies, the leading Republican polling organization; with its Democratic counterpart, Hart Research Associates, he conducts the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. “I didn’t think my job was to design polling so that Fox could pick people for a debate,” McInturff told me.

"Even if more people could be persuaded to answer the phone, polling would still be teetering on the edge of disaster. More than forty per cent of America’s adults no longer have landlines, and the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act bans autodialling to cell phones. (The law applies both to public-opinion polling, a billion-dollar-a-year industry, and to market research, a twenty-billion-dollar-a-year industry.) This summer, Gallup Inc agreed to pay twelve million dollars to settle a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of everyone in the United States who, between 2009 and 2013, received an unbidden cell-phone call from the company seeking an opinion about politics. (Gallup denies any wrongdoing.) In June, the F.C.C. issued a ruling reaffirming and strengthening the prohibition on random autodialling to cell phones. During congressional hearings, Greg Walden, a Republican from Oregon, who is the chair of the House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, asked F.C.C. chairman Tom Wheeler if the ruling meant that pollsters would go “the way of blacksmiths.” “Well,” he said, “they have been, right?”","2928","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

Not everyone uses the Internet, and, at the moment, the people who do, and who complete online surveys, are younger and leftier than people who don’t, while people who have landlines, and who answer the phone, are older and more conservative than people who don’t. Some pollsters, both here and around the world, rely on a combination of telephone and Internet polling; the trick is to figure out just the right mix. So far, it isn’t working.

Companies like Civis have been collecting information about you and people like you in order to measure public opinion and, among other things, forecast elections by building predictive models and running simulations to determine what issues you and people like you care about, what kind of candidate you’d give money to, and, if you’re likely to turn out on Election Day, how you’ll vote.

"A “poll” used to mean the top of your head. Ophelia says of Polonius, “His beard as white as snow: All flaxen was his poll.” When voting involved assembling (all in favor of Smith stand here, all in favor of Jones over there), counting votes required counting heads; that is, counting polls. Eventually, a “poll” came to mean the count itself. By the nineteenth century, to vote was to go “to the polls,” where, more and more, voting was done on paper. Ballots were often printed in newspapers: you’d cut one out and bring it with you. With the turn to the secret ballot, beginning in the eighteen-eighties, the government began supplying the ballots, but newspapers kept printing them; they’d use them to conduct their own polls, called “straw polls.” Before the election, you’d cut out your ballot and mail it to the newspaper, which would make a prediction. Political parties conducted straw polls, too. That’s one of the ways the political machine worked.","2932","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

"A century ago, newspapers that wanted to predict the outcome of a Presidential election had to join forces. In 1908, the New York Herald, the Cincinnati Enquirer, the Chicago Record-Herald, and the St. Louis Republic tallied their straws together. William Randolph Hearst’s newspapers did the same thing. But the best predictions were made by a national magazine, the Literary Digest, beginning in 1916. It regularly miscalculated the popular vote, but for a long time it got the Electoral College winner right. In 1920, the Digest mailed out eleven million ballots. By 1932, its mailing list had swelled to twenty million. Most of those names were taken from telephone directories and automobile-registration files. George Gallup was one of the few people who understood that the Digest risked underestimating Democratic votes, especially as the Depression deepened, because its sample, while very big, was not very representative: people who supported F.D.R. were much less likely than the rest of the population to own a telephone or a car.","2934","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

Du Bois went door to door in Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward and interviewed some five thousand people in order to prepare his study “The Philadelphia Negro.” In the nineteen-thirties, social scientists argued for the merits of a shortcut that relied on statistical science: surveying a tiny but representative sample of a population.","2935","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

In 1928, in a dissertation called “An Objective Method for Determining Reader Interest in the Content of a Newspaper,” Gallup argued that “at one time the press was depended upon as the chief agency for instructing and informing the mass of people” but that newspapers no longer filled that role and instead ought to meet “a greater need for entertainment.” He therefore devised a method: he’d watch readers go through a newspaper column by column and mark up the parts they liked, so that he could advise an editor which parts of the paper to keep printing and which parts to scrap.","2936","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"In 1932, when Gallup was a professor of journalism at Northwestern, his mother-in-law, Ola Babcock Miller, ran for secretary of state in Iowa. Her late husband had run for governor; her nomination was largely honorary and she was not expected to win. Gallup had read the work of Walter Lippmann. Lippmann believed that “public opinion” is a fiction created by political élites to suit and advance their interests. Gallup disagreed, and suspected that public opinion, like reader interest, could be quantified. To get a sense of his mother-in-law’s chances, Gallup began applying psychology to politics. The year of the race (she won), Gallup moved to New York, and began working for an advertising agency while also teaching at Columbia and running an outfit he called the Editors’ Research Bureau, selling his services to newspapers. Gallup thought of this work as “a new form of journalism.” But he decided that it ought to sound academic, too. In 1935, in Princeton, he founded the American Institute of Public Opinion, with funding provided by more than a hundred newspapers.","2937","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

He was right on both counts. This was only the beginning. “I had the idea of polling on every major issue,” Gallup explained. He began insisting that this work was essential to democracy. Elections come only every two years, but “we need to know the will of the people at all times.” Gallup claimed that his polls had rescued American politics from the political machine and restored it to the American pastoral, the New England town meeting. Elmo Roper, another early pollster, called the public-opinion survey “the greatest contribution to democracy since the introduction of the secret ballot.”","2938","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Gallup’s early method is known as “quota sampling.” He determined what proportion of the people are men, women, black, white, young, and old. The interviewers who conducted his surveys had to fill a quota so that the population sampled would constitute an exactly proportionate mini-electorate. But what Gallup presented as “public opinion” was the opinion of Americans who were disproportionately educated, white, and male. Nationwide, in the nineteen-thirties and forties, blacks constituted about ten per cent of the population but made up less than two per cent of Gallup’s survey respondents. Because blacks in the South were generally prevented from voting, Gallup assigned no “Negro quota” in those states. As the historian Sarah Igo has pointed out, “Instead of functioning as a tool for democracy, opinion polls were deliberately modeled upon, and compounded, democracy’s flaws.”","2939","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Ever since Gallup, two things have been called polls: surveys of opinions and forecasts of election results. (Plenty of other surveys, of course, don’t measure opinions but instead concern status and behavior: Do you own a house? Have you seen a doctor in the past month?) It’s not a bad idea to reserve the term “polls” for the kind meant to produce election forecasts. When Gallup started out, he was skeptical about using a survey to forecast an election: “Such a test is by no means perfect, because a preelection survey must not only measure public opinion in respect to candidates but must also predict just what groups of people will actually take the trouble to cast their ballots.” Also, he didn’t think that predicting elections constituted a public good: “While such forecasts provide an interesting and legitimate activity, they probably serve no great social purpose.” Then why do it? Gallup conducted polls only to prove the accuracy of his surveys, there being no other way to demonstrate it.

In the Presidential election of 1944, George Gallup underestimated Democratic support in two out of three states. When Congress called him in for questioning to answer the charge that “the Gallup poll was engineered in favor of the Republicans,” Gallup explained that, anticipating a low turnout, he had taken two points off the projected vote for F.D.R. In another instance, a congressman voiced concern that polls “are in contradiction to representative government”: pollsters appeared to believe that the United States is or ought to be a direct democracy.","2945","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Social scientists began criticizing pollsters, too. In 1947, in an address to the American Sociological Association, Herbert Blumer argued that public opinion does not exist, absent its measurement. Pollsters proceed from the assumption that “public opinion” is an aggregation of individual opinions, each given equal weight—an assumption Blumer demonstrated to be preposterous, since people form opinions “as a function of a society in operation.” We come to hold and express our opinions in conversation, and especially in debate, over time, and different people and groups influence us, and we them, to different degrees.","2946","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Gallup got his back up. In 1948, the week before Election Day, he said, “We have never claimed infallibility, but next Tuesday the whole world will be able to see down to the last percentage point how good we are.” He predicted that Dewey would beat Truman. He was quite entirely wrong.","2947","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Gallup liked to say that pollsters take the “pulse of democracy.” “Although you can take a nation’s pulse,” E. B. White wrote after the election, “you can’t be sure that the nation hasn’t just run up a flight of stairs.”","2948","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"In the wake of polling’s most notorious failure, the political scientist Lindsay Rogers published a book called “The Pollsters: Public Opinion, Politics, and Democratic Leadership.” Rogers, the Burgess Professor of Public Law at Columbia, had started out as a journalist and, as a scholar, he was a humanist at a time when most students of government had turned away from the humanities and toward social science. (Amy Fried, in an essay about what was lost in that abandonment, has called him “the Forgotten Lindsay Rogers.”) He had drafted “The Pollsters” before the election debacle; his concern had very little to do with miscalculation. Where Blumer argued that polling rests on a misapplication of social science, Rogers argued that it rests on a misunderstanding of American democracy. Even if public opinion could be measured (which Rogers doubted), he believed that legislators’ use of polls to inform their votes would be inconsistent with their constitutional duty. The United States has a representative government for many reasons, among them that it protects the rights of minorities against the tyranny of a majority. “The pollsters have dismissed as irrelevant the kind of political society in which we live and which we, as citizens, should endeavor to strengthen,” Rogers wrote. Polls, Rogers believed, are a majoritarian monstrosity.","2949","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"The alarms raised by Blumer and Rogers went unheeded. Instead, many social scientists came to believe that, if the pollsters failed, social science would fail with them (not least by losing foundation and federal research money). Eight days after Truman beat Dewey, the Social Science Research Council appointed an investigative committee, explaining that “extended controversy regarding the pre-election polls among lay and professional groups might have extensive and unjustified repercussions upon all types of opinion and attitude studies and perhaps upon social science research generally.” The committee concluded that the problem was, in part, quota sampling, but, in any case, the main work of the report was to defend the sample-survey method, including a landmark project founded at the University of Michigan in 1948, which became the most ambitious and most significant survey of American voters: the American National Election Survey.","2950","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"In 1952, Eisenhower unexpectedly defeated Stevenson. “Yesterday the people surprised the pollsters, the prophets, and many politicians,” Edward R. Murrow said on CBS Radio. “They are mysterious and their motives are not to be measured by mechanical means.” But politicians don’t want the people to be mysterious. Soon, not only political candidates but officeholders—including Presidents—began hiring pollsters. Meanwhile, pollsters claim to measure opinions as elusive as Americans’ belief in God, as the sociologist Robert Wuthnow points out in a compelling and disturbing new book, “Inventing American Religion: Polls, Surveys, and the Tenuous Quest for a Nation’s Faith.” In 1972, when Congress debated a Truth-in-Polling Act, longtime pollsters like Gallup attempted to distance themselves from campaign and media pollsters. Called to testify, Gallup supported the bill, objecting only to the requirement that pollsters report their response rates. That same year, in “Public Opinion Does Not Exist,” the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu revisited arguments made by Herbert Blumer. As these and other critics have demonstrated again and again, a sizable number of people polled either know nothing about the matters those polls purport to measure or hold no opinion about them. “The first question a pollster should ask,” the sociologist Leo Bogart advised in 1972, is “ ‘Have you thought about this at all? Do you have an opinion?’ ”","2951","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Despite growing evidence of problems known as non-opinion, forced opinion, and exclusion bias, journalists only relied on Gallup-style polling more, not less, and they began, too, to do it themselves. In 1973, in “Precision Journalism,” Philip Meyer urged reporters to conduct their own surveys: “If your newspaper has a data-processing department, then it has key-punch machines and people to operate them.” Two years later, the Times and CBS released their first joint poll, and we’ve been off to the races ever since, notwithstanding the ongoing concerns raised by critics who point out, as has Gallup Poll’s former managing editor David Moore, that “media polls give us distorted readings of the electoral climate, manufacture a false public consensus on policy issues, and in the process undermine American democracy.” Polls don’t take the pulse of democracy; they raise it.","2952","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"By the end of August, Trump, faltering, revealed that he is of course obsessed with his standing in the polls. “I won in every single poll of the debate,” he boasted. “I won in Time magazine.” Trump’s lead in the polls had taken so many political reporters by surprise that some people who cover polls—“data journalists” is, broadly, the term of art—began turning to data-science firms like Civis Analytics, wondering whether they, too, saw Trump in the lead.","2953","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"If public-opinion polling is the child of a strained marriage between the press and the academy, data science is the child of a rocky marriage between the academy and Silicon Valley. The term “data science” was coined in 1960, one year after the Democratic National Committee hired Simulmatics Corporation, a company founded by Ithiel de Sola Pool, a political scientist from M.I.T., to provide strategic analysis in advance of the upcoming Presidential election. Pool and his team collected punch cards from pollsters who had archived more than sixty polls from the elections of 1952, 1954, 1956, 1958, and 1960, representing more than a hundred thousand interviews, and fed them into a UNIVAC. They then sorted voters into four hundred and eighty possible types (for example, “Eastern, metropolitan, lower-income, white, Catholic, female Democrat”) and sorted issues into fifty-two clusters (for example, foreign aid). Simulmatics’ first task, completed just before the Democratic National Convention, was a study of “the Negro vote in the North.” Its report, which is thought to have influenced the civil-rights paragraphs added to the Party’s platform, concluded that between 1954 and 1956 “a small but significant shift to the Republicans occurred among Northern Negroes, which cost the Democrats about 1 per cent of the total votes in 8 key states.” After the nominating convention, the D.N.C. commissioned Simulmatics to prepare three more reports, including one that involved running simulations about different ways in which Kennedy might discuss his Catholicism.","2954","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"In 1964, a political scientist named Eugene Burdick wrote a novel called “The 480,” about the work done by Simulmatics. He was worried about its implications:","2955","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Burdick’s dystopianism is vintage Cold War: the Strangelovian fear of the machine. (Burdick also co-wrote “Fail Safe,” in which a computer error triggers a nuclear war.) But after 1960 the D.N.C. essentially abandoned computer simulation. One reason may have been that L.B.J. wasn’t as interested in the work of M.I.T. scientists as Kennedy had been. For decades, Republicans were far more likely than Democrats to use computer-based polling. In 1977, the R.N.C. acquired a mainframe computer, while the D.N.C. got its own mainframe in the eighties. The political scientist Kenneth Janda speculates that the technological advantage of the Republican Party during these years stemmed from its ties to big business. Democratic technological advances awaited the personal computer; the R.N.C. is to I.B.M. as the D.N.C. is to Apple. Then came the Internet, which, beginning with the so-called MoveOn effect, favored Democrats but, as Matthew Hindman argued in “The Myth of Digital Democracy,” has not favored democracy.","2956","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Douglas Rivers is a professor of political science at Stanford who is also the chief scientist at YouGov. He started trying to conduct public-opinion surveys via the Internet in the nineties, and has done much of the best and most careful work in the field. When he co-founded Knowledge Networks and conducted polls through Web TV, he used probability sampling as an alternative to quota sampling. The initial response rate was something like fifty per cent, but over time the rate fell into the single digits. Then came the Internet crash. “We slimmed down,” Rivers told me when I visited him in Palo Alto. “I went back to teaching.”","2957","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Rivers then started a company called Polimetrix, which he sold to YouGov for an estimated thirty-five million dollars. There he developed a method called “matched sampling”: he uses the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, which surveys a million people a year, to generate a random sample according to “fifteen variables of representativeness” and to determine who will participate in polls. “You get a million people to take the poll, but you only need a thousand, so you pick the thousand that match your target population,” he explained to me.","2958","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Sometimes when political scientists are hired by corporations their research becomes proprietary. “When I say I don’t know the secret sauce, I really don’t know it,” Arthur Lupia says of political scientists who sell their research to businesses rather than publish it in journals that would require them to reveal their methodologies. Lupia is a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, a former director of the American National Election Survey, and the lead author of “Improving Public Perceptions of Political Science’s Value,” a 2014 report prepared by a task force established by the American Political Science Association. Where once social scientists avidly defended the polling industry, many have grown alarmed that media-run horse-race polls may be undermining the public’s perception of the usefulness of social-science surveys. (Lupia jokes that horse-race polls ought to have a warning label that reads “For entertainment purposes only.”) Like Rivers, Lupia ardently believes in the importance of measuring public opinion. “It is critical for a nation that cherishes its democratic legitimacy to seek credible measures of how citizens think, feel, and act in electoral contexts,” Lupia and the political scientist Jon Krosnick have written. Otherwise, “there will be no strong evidentiary basis for differentiating propagandistic tall tales from empirically defensible and logically coherent readings of electoral history.”","2959","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"It’s an important point. But it may be that media-run polls have endangered the academic study of public opinion and of political behavior. Public disaffection with the polling industry has contributed to a plummeting response rate for academic and government surveys.","2960","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Those surveys are invaluable, the political scientist Sidney Verba has argued. “Surveys produce just what democracy is supposed to produce—equal representation of all citizens,” Verba said in a presidential address before the American Political Science Association in 1995. “The sample survey is rigorously egalitarian; it is designed so that each citizen has an equal chance to participate and an equal voice when participating.” Verba sees surveying public opinion not only as entirely consistent with democratic theory but as a corrective to democracy’s flaws. Surveys, Verba argues, achieve representativeness through science.","2961","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"The best and most responsible pollsters, whether Democratic, Republican, or nonpartisan, want nothing so much as reliable results. Today, with a response rate in the single digits, they defend their work by pointing out that the people who do answer the phone are the people who are most likely to vote. Bill McInturff, of Public Opinion Strategies, told me, “The people we have trouble getting are less likely to vote.” But the difficulty remains. Surveying only likely voters might make for a better election prediction, but it means that the reason for measuring public opinion, the entire justification for the endeavor, has been abandoned. Public-opinion polling isn’t enhancing political participation. Instead, it’s a form of disenfranchisement.","2962","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"“There are all kinds of problems with public-opinion research, as done by surveys,” Lupia admits. “But a lot of the alternatives are worse. A lot of what we’d have would be self-serving stories about what’s good for people. ‘When given a clear choice between eggs and bananas, ninety-eight per cent of the people prefer one or the other.’ Prior to the polls, I can say that, and you have no check on me. But if there’s a poll you have a check.”","2963","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"That’s a good point, too, except that there isn’t much of a check on political scientists who don’t reveal their methods because they’ve sold their algorithms to startups for millions of dollars. Whether or not they’re making money, people who predict elections want to be right, and they believe, as fiercely as Lupia does, that they are engaged in a public good. I asked Doug Rivers what role the measurement of public opinion plays in a democracy. He said, “The cynical answer is ‘Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down.’ ” (He was quoting a Tom Lehrer song.) But Rivers isn’t cynical. He believes that polling “improves the quality of representation.” I asked him to give me an example. He said, “You couldn’t have had the change in gay marriage without the polling data.” Everyone cares where the rockets come down.","2964","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

There were Bernie Sanders posters on the walls and cutouts of Rand Paul’s head popping out of a jar of pencils. Crowdpac is the brainchild of Steve Hilton, a former senior adviser to David Cameron, and Adam Bonica, a young Stanford political scientist. Their idea is to use data science to turn public-opinion polling upside down. “There had been an explosion in the use of data, all structured to advance campaigns,” Bonica says. “They’d take information from voters and manipulate it to the politicians’ advantage.

The pledges would be converted to donations automatically, as soon as someone decided to run.

"Curiously, Sanders seemed to agree with them, taking his definition of “socialism” from its nineteen-thirties opponents, the people Roosevelt called “economic royalists.” “Let me define for you, simply and straightforwardly, what democratic socialism means to me,” Sanders said. “It builds on what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all Americans.”","2978","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"

Accusations of “socialism” trailed liberals for decades after Roosevelt parried his opponents, from Ronald Reagan’s attacks on Medicare to the Republicans’ refrain against Obamacare. Democrats, like Roosevelt, have furiously defended themselves against the charges. But now a candidate whose ideal American economy does in fact look a lot like Eisenhower’s—strong unions, secure employment, affordable college—is waving the red flag, and finding favor with large numbers of Democratic voters.","2980","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"The new eagerness to embrace the word reflects the climate that a Pew poll captured, in 2011, when more respondents between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine reported a positive view of “socialism” (forty-nine per cent) than “capitalism” (forty-six per cent). (Gallup polls regularly find that a slim majority of Democrats express a positive view of socialism, but an overwhelming majority supports “free enterprise,” suggesting, charitably, some ideological flexibility.) Those under-thirty respondents are, of course, the first voters of the post-Soviet era, whose formative experiences are of a not very heroic unipolar world of American power and market-oriented ideas. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet empire put the word “socialism” up for grabs again: it may have landed in the dustbin of history at first, but that left it free for scavenging and repurposing.","2981","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"A decade before the Wall fell, the United States saw the quieter but also momentous collapse of the pro-government consensus that dominated the middle of the twentieth century. The Eisenhower paradox—that he was a big-government, welfarist conservative—is no paradox at all: he led the center-right at a time when the center was deeply welfarist and big-government. American politics after the Second World War was founded on the core idea of the earlier Progressive movement, which both F.D.R. and his cousin Theodore championed: the old ideals of personal liberty, economic opportunity, and civic equality could not survive in a laissez-faire industrial economy. Values once associated with small government now needed big government—the regulatory state—to preserve them. So, in 1937, F.D.R. urged that government should “solve for the individual the ever-rising problems of a complex civilization,” and, in 1965, L.B.J. echoed him, warning that “change and growth seem to tower beyond the control and even the judgment of men.” Strong government was the answer: a counter-power to wealth and to economic crisis. Their world was also Dwight Eisenhower’s.","2982","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"Ronald Reagan’s declaration, in his 1981 inaugural address, that “government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem” announced a new era. Government did not in fact shrink, thanks largely to military spending and retirement benefits, but the willingness to say that it could provide what F.D.R. had called “a permanently safe order of things,” let alone F.D.R.’s economic “Second Bill of Rights,” was almost forgotten. The market was the new all-purpose solution, even before the Soviet collapse and the subsequent elevation of disruption, innovation, and self-branding as the language of emancipation.","2983","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"So, between roughly 1979 and 1989, two figures went into the wilderness: the long-dominant American idea that strong government was necessary to humanize a market economy, and the word “socialism” as a name for a different kind of society. Exiled as opponents, they returned as friends. Bernie Sanders’s socialism is Eisenhower’s and F.D.R.’s world if Reagan had never happened: economic security updated by the continuing revolutions in gender, cultural pluralism, and the struggle for racial justice.

"The mid-century political settlement between government and markets that Eisenhower took for granted never really had a name. It was not a fighting faith. “Welfare capitalism,” which is a pretty accurate name for a market system that redistributes for common benefit, sounds like the worst of both worlds. “Socialism” is historically inaccurate, and using it to name Eisenhower-era welfarism may come at the cost of further burying its other, more radical meanings. But some of the term’s appeal, as a name for Sanders’s program, is that it sounds more radical than it is. The radical label accentuates the feeling that something has gone wrong in economic life. It marks the intensity of dissent.","2985","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"In this way, Sanders’s use of the word harkens back to pre-Soviet, even pre-Marxist socialism. Then the term named a clutch of objections to industrial capitalism: the physical toll of the jobs, the equal and opposite toll of unemployment and economic crisis, widespread poverty and insecurity in a world where some lived in almost miraculous luxury. Assessing the socialists of the nineteenth century, whose programs ranged from the nationalization of industry to the creation of village coöperatives, John Stuart Mill doubted that they understood how markets worked, but he admitted their moral claims unreservedly: “The restraints of Communism would be freedom in comparison with the present condition of the majority of the human race.”","2986","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"Mill predicted that capitalism would burn out its fuel of cupidity and become a realistic version of what socialists (and communists) wanted. Worker-owned co-ops would out-compete traditional enterprises by aligning workers’ motives with the company’s success. At the same time, with poverty overcome, people would care less about getting richer, and spend their time in what Mill felt made life worthwhile in the first place: conversation, friendship, appreciation of poetry and painting. His optimism came from faith that, once people had less to fear from material want and from one another, they would find new ways to coöperate without the narrowness and cruelty of old hierarchies. He applied exactly the same premises to the relations between men and women, insisting that absolute legal equality would spur new discoveries about how to live and who to be—new creativity in gender identity (not his term but certainly his thought) and new experiments in how equals could care for one another. This humanistic faith in gender equality was one of the most accurate social prophecies in modern thought, but the same faith in egalitarian coöperation was a nonstarter in economic life.","2987","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"Mill was hardly alone in expecting capitalism to work out its kinks. Eisenhower’s world lacked a name for its settlement between government and markets partly because that settlement was the new normal, and the normal doesn’t need a name. Mature capitalism was supposed to produce only a moderate level of inequality. A strong government, staffed by public-minded experts, would iron out economic wrinkles. The remaining problems for reformers were remedial: bringing in previously excluded populations, especially African-Americans and isolated Appalachians. For those already on the inside, the challenges were those of what the liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith called “the affluent society”: how to want less, enjoy life more, and help build a post-materialist paradise of humanism. It is no coincidence that L.B.J., who supported the civil-rights movement and launched the War on Poverty, also promoted the National Endowment for the Humanities to enrich the lives of those whose historical labors were over. He described his Great Society program as seeking an economy that satisfied “the desire for beauty and the hunger for community,” where “the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.”","2988","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"That is the lost world to which Sanders’s “socialism” points back. The return of the label, though, doesn’t mean that anyone knows how to get more radical than tacking toward Scandinavian social democracy, with its socialized health care and higher education and generous family leave. Sanders isn’t much of a socialist compared to F.D.R., either. At the heart of Roosevelt’s program was the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which greatly strengthened the hand of unions, essential parts of every welfare-capitalist order in the twentieth century, from Scandinavia to Canada. Sanders, astonishingly, didn’t once mention unions in his Georgetown speech. Roosevelt proposed a maximum income of twenty-five thousand dollars (the equivalent of about four hundred thousand dollars today), which we won’t be hearing from Sanders. Sanders’s socialism is a national living wage, free higher education, increased taxes on the wealthy, campaign-finance reform, and strong environmental and racial-justice policies.","2989","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"This is not a program for a different kind of economy, based on coöperation and deepened democracy— what socialism used to stand for, which powered it as both a threat and a hope. The heart of Sanders’s program, like F.D.R.’s, is economic security: like F.D.R., he argues that “true freedom does not occur” without it. In the same way, he sees a strong government as protecting individualism from an economy that bats people around like the gods in Greek dramas. Calling this once mainstream idea socialism is a way of saying how far it feels from where we find ourselves now, how radical a step it would be to get back to it.","2990","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"On the morning of October 10th, Marco Rubio, Florida’s junior senator, mounted a small stage at the Elks Lodge in Boulder City, Nevada, a popular retirement spot near Las Vegas. In his twenties, as an obscure Republican state legislator, Rubio exhibited such innate political skill that Dan Gelber, the Democratic leader of the Florida House, warned his colleagues, “When Marco Rubio speaks, young women swoon, old women faint, and toilets flush themselves.” Now that he was a Presidential candidate, Rubio was trying to speak to as many different audiences as possible. The Elks Lodge was decorated modestly, with just a few campaign banners hoisted amid the taxidermy—a demonstration of thrift intended to contrast with the front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, the billionaire Donald Trump, and to counter claims that Rubio occasionally spends more money than he should.","2991","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The attendees were predominantly older white couples, who were seeing Rubio in person for the first time. The son of Cuban immigrants, he grew up mostly in Miami, but he lived in Las Vegas from 1979 until 1985, when he left, after eighth grade. “I love coming back to southern Nevada, because it’s a place where I actually learned so much about the American Dream,” he said. “My father was a bartender at Sam’s Town”—an Old West-style casino, seven miles off the Strip. “My mother was a maid at what was then called the Imperial Palace.” He went on, “They used to have a show called ‘Legends in Concert.’ We saw that show, like, ten times. I met ‘Elvis’ and ‘Marilyn Monroe.’ You know you’re getting old when the Legends in Concert are people you used to listen to in high school.” Big laugh. Adam Hasner, a friend who served with Rubio in the Florida House, told me, “When you’re running for office in Miami-Dade County, you’re spending a lot of time in senior centers.”","2992","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At the age of forty-four, Rubio has lively dark eyes, soft cheeks, and downy brown hair affixed in a perfect part. He sometimes asks crowds to see him in the tradition of a “young President who said, ‘Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.’ ” (J.F.K. was forty-three when he entered the White House.) Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, is only five months older than Rubio, but nobody calls him boyish.","2993","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"If the Democrats nominate Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, the Party will be offering the oldest candidate that it has ever run in a general election, and Rubio has taken to saying, “Never in the modern history of this country has the political class in both parties been more out of touch with our country than it is right now.” But in policy terms Rubio can appear older than his years. His opposition to same-sex marriage, to raising the minimum wage, and to restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba puts him out of step with most American Latinos. In the Spanish-language media, he is sometimes described as un joven viejo—a young fogey.","2994","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After a summer submerged in a raucous primary field, Rubio had recently climbed into third place. He was ahead of Jeb Bush, his former mentor, and far behind Trump and Ben Carson. Trump’s campaign marched to the sound of a dirge—“The American Dream is dead,” he told crowds—and Rubio presented himself as a sunny alternative, a way out of Trump’s sulfurous moment. “We’re very blessed to have so many good people running for President,” he said earnestly to the crowd in Boulder City.","2995","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I had seen Rubio at half a dozen events—in Iowa, New York, Nevada—and his speeches were blemished only by a tic: he occasionally slips into a singsong cadence, turning his story into a breathy schoolboy lullaby about the “new American century.” On the whole, he is impressively consistent. Rubio in Dubuque in October was nearly indistinguishable from Rubio in Miami in April, the political equivalent of a well-managed restaurant chain: “Repeal and replace Obamacare,” scrap President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran “on Day One,” create the “most affordable business taxes in the world”—all the while heeding the populist frustrations of the moment. Vowing to remake higher education, he said, “When I’m President, before you take on student loans you’re going to know how much people make when they graduate from that school with that degree. You’re going to know that the market for philosophers has tightened over the last two thousand years.” In 2012, Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, spoke worshipfully of “job creators.” Rubio rarely mentions them. He returns, over and over, to his central task: how to make helping the poor and the middle class a Republican issue. He tells crowds, “We can no longer allow big government to be used as a tool of crony capitalism.”","2996","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But, at bottom, his campaign is only partly about policy. In a contest against a real-estate tycoon and the son and brother of former Presidents, Rubio is campaigning on the vision of a country where “the son of a bartender and a maid” can reach the White House. “It’s not just my story—it is literally our story,” he told the Boulder City crowd. “In this nation, we are all but a generation or two removed from someone who made our future the very purpose of their lives. Whether or not we remain a special country will be determined by whether or not that journey is still possible for the people trying to make it now.”","2997","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The applause was long and loud, and as Rubio climbed down from the stage to pose for selfies I asked the first couple I saw what they made of him. Cornelia Wallace, a retired nurse from the Chicago suburbs, said, “Well, I’ve got tears welled up in my eyes.” She laughed at her own reaction. “It touched my heart,” she said, and shrugged. “I get a passion from him that I don’t get from the others.”","2998","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In Las Vegas, Rubio was staying at the Bellagio. We met in a suite appointed in the Vegas Italianate style—leather, chrome, photos of fountains. When I stopped by one morning, the windows were shrouded by heavy burgundy drapes, and Rubio was worried about his voice. “I’ve been coming down with something,” he said, crossing the conference room to retrieve a bottle of water. “My throat is always feeling dry.” Doctors had told him it was an allergic reaction. “I said, ‘How come I’ve never had allergies before, and now, suddenly, the last four years I’ve developed allergies? And the answer the doctor gave me was: ‘Well, because you’re travelling to places that you never used to travel to before.’ ”","2999","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

"Rubio, who was spending three days in Nevada, had scheduled both public and closed-door activities. On the first night, he met with Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and donor. In April, Politico had published a story headlined “RUBIO TAKES LEAD IN SHELDON ADELSON PRIMARY,” which reported that Rubio had been calling Adelson every two weeks. I asked Rubio about it, and he said, “I don’t know about every couple of weeks, but I talk to him quite a bit.” Adelson spent about ninety-eight million dollars in connection with the 2012 campaign, including twenty million on the campaign of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. He has yet to commit to a candidate in 2016. Rubio described Adelson and himself as natural allies. “The only thing Sheldon Adelson has talked to me about policy-wise is Israel,” he said. “And he doesn’t have to convince me on that, because I’m pro-Israel with or without Sheldon’s support.”","3001","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s campaign had invited donors from around the country to join him at the Bellagio, for a football-themed retreat. The guests attended a “breakfast and team talk” and a strategy session called “Quarterbacking Victory.” One afternoon, they played flag football at a nearby sports complex, and Rubio was the quarterback on both teams. Over the years, he has developed the ability to disarm jaded donors. Bob List, the former governor of Nevada, told me about watching Rubio work a roomful of prosperous Las Vegas businessmen. At one point, Rubio was asked where his inspiration for politics originated. “He said, ‘I remember one day my father took me in the car, and we drove over to the neighborhood where Liberace’s house was.’ ” List noted, “And everybody knew where Liberace’s house was.” He went on, “He said, ‘We would drive around that neighborhood, and he’d show me where all the rich people lived, and he’d say, “Son, if you want to live like these people, you can do it.” ’ ” List shook his head and said, “He’s good-good.”","3002","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio, who has entered six elections and never lost, is alert to the appearance of overweening ambition. “All my life I’ve been in a hurry to get to my future,” he wrote in his memoir, “An American Son,” published in 2012, his second year in the Senate. In conversation, he sometimes answers so quickly that his friend Dennis Baxley, a Republican in the Florida House, once gave him a piece of advice. “I said, ‘Marco, don’t change anything you’re saying, but just wait, like, three seconds before you say it, and you’ll look so pensive.’ ” When things go wrong, Rubio’s impatience can suggest a man climbing too fast for his own good. In Washington foreign-policy circles, people remember a moment at the Brookings Institution, in April, 2012, when Rubio was delivering a major foreign-policy speech. Reaching the final page, he discovered that it had been removed accidentally from the lectern. Some politicians might have improvised; Rubio stopped awkwardly, in mid-sentence, and asked for the page to be returned.","3003","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For Republican strategists, the loss of the 2012 Presidential election contained signals that spoke to the Party’s future. Latinos are the largest minority group in America, but in 2012 “there was more talk about electrified fences than there was about higher education and tuition,” Peter Wehner, a Republican speechwriter and strategist who served in the past three Republican Administrations, told me. “You can’t win elections when you do that.” Romney, who had called for the “self-deportation” of immigrants, received just twenty-seven per cent of the Latino vote—seventeen points less than what George W. Bush received in 2004. For years, Republicans have believed that they should be faring better with Hispanic voters. Ronald Reagan liked to say that Latinos are Republicans but “just don’t know it yet.” Lionel Sosa, a Texas adman who was hired to run Reagan’s outreach program to Latinos, recalled, “Ronald Reagan told me, back in the 1980 race, ‘Latinos are conservative people. As Republicans, we share the same basic conservative values. We believe in hard work. We believe in family.’ ”","3004","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For Wehner and other reform-minded conservatives, the lessons of 2012 were also economic. “The middle class felt vulnerable and nervous, because of stagnant wages for twenty-five years and skyrocketing costs in health care and higher education,” Wehner told me. “The Party needed an agenda, and it was out of touch with middle-class concerns.” The reformers urged the Party to get over same-sex marriage (a “losing battle”), focus on economic anxiety, and, above all, identify a leader who could articulate a vision that reached beyond Party orthodoxy. As Wehner put it, “You need a figure like a Bill Clinton or a Tony Blair, who can reassure the base and inspire them, but also to signal to people who are not voting for you, ‘We get it.’ ”","3005","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Whit Ayres, a leading Republican analyst who has been Rubio’s pollster for the past five years, drew a somewhat different lesson. He agreed about the demographic reality. “Unfortunately for Republicans, the math is only going to get worse,” he wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. “Groups that form the core of G.O.P. support—older whites, blue-collar whites, married people and rural residents—are declining as a proportion of the electorate. Groups that lean Democratic—minorities, young people and single women—are growing.” He calculated that, in order to win, a Republican Presidential candidate would need at least forty per cent of the Latino vote. But in “2016 and Beyond: How Republicans Can Elect a President in the New America,” published earlier this year, Ayres made a subtle distinction between style and substance. He wrote that polls have found “no evidence that America has shifted to the left.” In his view, America remains a center-right country, the Party’s core ideas are sound, and the problem lies in finding “the right candidate, the right message, and the right tone.” He tested a range of ways of presenting core Republican ideas and composed a list of dos and don’ts. Don’t say we have to reform entitlements or “we will never balance the budget.” Do say that entitlement reform is “the only way to save popular programs.”","3006","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The Party’s plans to change its tone did not last long. In the 2014 midterm elections, conservative candidates seized on reports of a surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the Mexican border, spurred largely by gang- and drug-related violence in Central America, and proclaimed an immigration crisis. Though the number of undocumented immigrants apprehended at the border was at its lowest level in decades, voters who were anxious about jobs and opportunity responded to increasingly militant language. When Trump announced his candidacy, this summer, he said of Mexicans, “They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” Mel Martínez, the former Florida senator (the chamber’s first Cuban-American) and a former head of the Republican National Committee, told me, “Republicans say, ‘Mel, what do we have to do to get the Hispanic vote?’ And one thing I would say is, ‘First of all, stop offending Hispanics!’ ” He urged the parties not to regard a diverse range of voters as a single bloc. “The bottom line is that we are not ‘Hispanics.’ We’re Cuban-Americans, we’re Mexican-Americans, and so forth.” Cuban-Americans represent only about four per cent of the Latino population, and their votes and interests are not always in accord with those of other Latinos. For one thing, many Latinos resent the accelerated path to citizenship that Congress bestowed on Cuban arrivals during the Cold War, a privilege not granted to Colombians, Guatemalans, and others who have faced repression.","3007","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"“There are persuaders and there are crusaders, and I think Rubio is a persuader,” Wehner told me. “When you’re losing Presidential elections on a consistent basis, you’ve got to nominate somebody who is a persuader.” A conservative Super PAC ranked Rubio as the ninth most conservative member of the 114th Congress, but, unlike Ted Cruz, who amplifies confrontation, he excels at rounding off the corners of conventional conservative prescriptions. “I want to be the world leader in renewables,” he tells crowds. “But we better also be the world leader in oil and natural gas.”","3008","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At times, Rubio’s desire to embrace competing views becomes unworkable. In January, he voted for a Senate resolution affirming that climate change is real, but he often voices doubts about the role of humans in it. I mentioned that this puts him at odds with the young generation that he wants to represent. He said, “People who are passionate about climate change come to us and say, ‘The environment is changing because of human activity. The scientists say so.’ And then they say, ‘And here’s what we want you to do.’ And so they present me with this idea, and I look at this idea, and I ask them, ‘Well, if I pass this, how many inches or feet of sea rise will it prevent?’ And they’ll say, ‘Well, it won’t prevent any.’ I say O.K. Then I turn to the economists and say, ‘What impact will this law have on the economy?’ And they say, ‘It will increase the cost of living, it will cost jobs, it will make America less competitive economically.’ And so I say, ‘So you’re asking me to pass something that’s bad economically and does nothing for the environment other than lead the way by example? I think that’s a bad trade-off. I’m not supporting those laws.’ ” (Ken Caldeira, a senior scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science’s Department of Global Ecology, at Stanford, told me, “If Senator Rubio is talking to scientists who say that avoiding greenhouse-gas emissions won’t help avoid sea-level rise, he is talking to the wrong scientists.”)","3009","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s inclusiveness can invite caricature. He considers himself a Catholic, but he attends two churches—an evangelical Protestant service on Saturdays and a Roman Catholic Mass on Sundays. He used to proclaim his love of nineties-era hip-hop—particularly Tupac Shakur—but recently he has also taken to praising cross-genre artists, such as Drake and the Weeknd, who blend electronic dance music with hip-hop, rap, and R. & B. “It’s a twenty-first-century ability to take music and use it in a way that motivates people,” he said last month on CNN, mirroring his campaign rhetoric. “Some of it is blended with other sounds that are sampled from recordings that others have had in the past, and you see traditional artists being brought in and their voices used on an electronic soundtrack.”","3010","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s ecumenism is one reason that prominent Democrats consider him the most worrisome contender. David Axelrod, Obama’s former chief strategist, told me that Rubio “seems to be able to build bridges between the two factions of the Republican Party.” He said, “There is a real civil war going on between populist anti-government Republicans and the establishment conservatives, and Rubio has thus far been able to escape that divide.” Axelrod added, “But it’s going to be harder as time goes on, and he is probably going to have to plant his feet in one place or another.”","3011","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked Rubio if it concerned him that Republicans often appear to be at war with themselves. A day earlier, the House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, facing intense criticism by conservative members of his party, had abandoned plans to run for Speaker. “If the alternative was they all went into a smoke-filled room and cut a deal outside the limelight, everyone would say, ‘Oh, then it’s a done deal, it’s a stagnant process,’ ” Rubio said.

"Marco Antonio Rubio was born in Miami in 1971, the third of four children. (The oldest, Mario, became an Army Green Beret and, later, a city official in Jacksonville; Rubio’s sisters, Barbara and Veronica, live in Miami.) For years, he described himself, in political terms, as the “son of Cuban exiles.” “Nothing against immigrants, but my parents are exiles,” he said during his Senate campaign. “Folks that are exiles are people that have lost their country.” But in October, 2011, the Washington Post and the St. Petersburg Times reported that, according to immigration records, his family had left Cuba voluntarily, as émigrés, aboard a commercial flight, in May, 1956, more than two and a half years before Fidel Castro took power. Like many other immigrants, Rubio’s parents, Oriales and Mario, left in pursuit of jobs and opportunity. (Mario, the bartender, died in 2010.) The Post suggested that Rubio had embellished his story to gain cachet with political refugees, some of whom regard pre-Castro migrants with suspicion. Rubio called that suggestion “outrageous,” saying that he had relied on his family’s “oral history.”","3013","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s allies have defended his misstatements as an innocent error, but Guillermo Grenier, a sociologist at Florida International University, who studies the political attitudes of Cuban-Americans, told me that the explanation left many people unconvinced. “I think the dominant view is that he was misrepresenting his life story to make it more like the community he was trying to represent,” Grenier said. In a speech to the Hispanic Leadership Network, in January, 2012, Rubio said that the controversy had turned into “a blessing in disguise.” He explained, “It made me do something that we don’t do enough of. And that’s go back and discover who our parents were when they were our age.”","3014","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

When the family moved to Nevada, he immersed himself in Mormon reading, and joined the Mormon Church, along with his mother and one of his sisters. A few years later, they reëmbraced Catholicism, “mostly at my instigation,” he wrote in “An American Son.” He also recalled that he was an “inattentive and undisciplined student.”","3015","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

But he writes vividly about the most influential figure in his childhood—his maternal grandfather, Pedro Víctor García, whom he calls “my closest boyhood friend.” According to Rubio’s biographer Manuel Roig-Franzia, in 1962 García arrived from Cuba without a visa and was eventually ordered to be deported. He stayed anyway, becoming an undocumented immigrant. The Cuban missile crisis saved him; commercial air travel to Cuba was suspended, and, eventually, he was granted permanent residency. In Rubio’s recollection, his grandfather spent much of his retirement in an aluminum chair on the front porch of his daughter’s home, smoking cigars and advising Marco on the alleged perfidy of Jimmy Carter:","3016","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

But when the family ran low on money his father crossed the picket line. “I accused him of selling out and called him a scab,” Rubio wrote later. “It hurt him, and I’m ashamed of it.”","3017","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

The arrest added to the strain on the family. Rubio’s grade-point average at the end of his senior year was 2.1; he was allowed to graduate after attending summer school.

"At his swearing-in, Jeb Bush presented him with a faux-precious sword from a “mystical warrior.” (The inscription, “Unleash Chiang,” had been a rallying cry in the nineteen-fifties for right-wingers who wanted to arm Chiang Kai-shek’s government in Taiwan, so that it could attack mainland China. In the Bush family, however, the slogan was a tennis-court joke that George H. W. Bush used when he was preparing to serve.) Jeb told the audience, “I can’t think back on a time when I’ve ever been prouder to be a Republican, Marco.” Rubio displayed the sword on a wall of his office.","3027","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For the work of political arm-twisting, he relied on two fellow-representatives, David Rivera and Ralph Arza—or “Boris and Natasha,” as Dan Gelber, the minority leader, nicknamed them, after the “Rocky and Bullwinkle” villains. “I said it jokingly, but there was a little bit of truth,” he told me. “Something would pop up in a bill, and I’d wonder how the hell it got there. Then I’d look at them and they’d smile.” Rubio’s lieutenants proved to be problematic. Arza was forced to resign from the legislature in 2006, after he used the word “nigger” in a drunken message left on a colleague’s voice mail. He pleaded guilty to intimidating a witness and agreed to undergo alcohol and anger counselling. Rivera (who had bought a house with Rubio in Tallahassee, to use when the legislature was in session) went on to Congress but has been the target of state and federal investigations into his income and into his alleged role in supporting a shadow candidate to undercut his rival in the 2012 campaign. He has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged. The Bush campaign, in a slide presentation to donors, has cited the friendship with the “scandal-tarred” Rivera as evidence that Rubio is a “risky bet.” Rubio aides tell reporters that the candidate rarely sees Rivera anymore, but Rivera and Arza were among Rubio’s supporters at the Republican debate in Cleveland.","3028","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio has struggled to manage his personal and professional finances. On several occasions, he used a Republican Party American Express card to charge personal expenses—$3,765 for landscaping stones at his house, ten thousand dollars for a family reunion in Georgia, a hundred and thirty-four dollars in a hair salon. In each case, he made good on the charge before it was publicly reported and explained it as a mixup. A state ethics commission investigated the incidents and cleared him, but that hasn’t stopped his opponents from bringing them up.","3029","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"His income has fluctuated dramatically. In 2000, his first year in the legislature, he was still saddled with student debt. As he ascended in the House leadership, he was hired by Broad & Cassel, a prominent law and lobbying firm, and his annual income grew to more than four hundred thousand dollars. In 2012, he received a contract for his memoir, worth at least eight hundred thousand dollars, and yet, even with his rising income, he cashed out sixty-eight thousand dollars from a retirement account, paying a heavy tax penalty. When reporters asked about it, he said, “My refrigerator broke down.” Political rivals wondered if he had a gambling problem, and searched for evidence but found none. Indeed, Rubio has incorporated the questions about his financial dealings into his self-narrative. “Here’s the truth,” he said, flanked by prosperous rivals, during the third Republican debate, in Boulder, Colorado. “I didn’t inherit any money.” He added, “But I’m not worried about my finances. I’m worried about the finances of everyday Americans.”","3030","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

Between 1994 and 2012, the Latino share of Nevada’s electorate tripled, from five per cent to fifteen per cent. So far, Latinos have been voting mainly for Democrats. Senator Harry Reid won a tight reëlection fight in 2010 largely because he received ninety-four per cent of the Latino vote.

(After lobbying his parents to find a way to cover the tuition, he arrived to find that he hated the uniforms, the extra schoolwork, and the distance from his friends, and he pleaded to go back to public school. “I made life unbearable in our house, and within a week, my parents had relented,” he writes. “I cringe today when I remember how selfishly I behaved.”)","3033","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Drawing on the ideas of reform-minded conservatives, Rubio told the audience, “We have government policies that, quite frankly, have not allowed this economy to grow fast enough and create better-paying jobs.” He went on, “These are the impediments to upward mobility: an economy that isn’t creating better-paying jobs and a higher-education system that’s too expensive or inaccessible. And the result is we are leaving people behind.”","3034","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The crux of Rubio’s economic argument is that the poor and the middle class are facing different problems from those his parents faced. He opposes raising the minimum wage, arguing that it will lead to automation and outsourcing. He wants a greater share of young people to consider trade schools and apprenticeships instead of incurring the debts of a four-year education. “You’re going to have eighteen-year-olds in this country making fifty thousand dollars a year making cars, making seventy thousand dollars a year as a welder!” he says. (His rhapsodies about welding have been ridiculed, because the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the median wage for welders is less than thirty-eight thousand dollars.)","3035","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio told the audience that the notion that “big government is good for the people who are trying to make it” is a “lie.” He said, “When the government dominates the economy, the people that can afford to influence the government—they win. And everybody else is stuck.” He went on, “They know that you can’t start a business out of the spare bedroom of your home if you have to fill out fifteen permits and hire lawyers and lobbyists, and they love it because that means they have no competition.”","3036","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At one point while Rubio was in the Florida House, he and David Rivera visited Washington and got in touch with Mel Martínez, who was then in the Senate. “I walked him around the Capitol, and he was like a kid with his eyes popping out, you know? ‘Oh, my gosh, this is so cool. Oh, my gosh,’ ” Martínez recalled. Within a few years, Rubio was back, with a purpose. “I invited him to lunch in the Senate dining room, and I got the definite impression that he was kind of fishing around as to if I was going to run for reëlection or not,” Martínez said. “I thought it was a bit premature to be talking about that.”","3037","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After term limits forced Rubio out of the Florida House, in 2008, he worked as a consultant for hospitals, a television pundit, and a college instructor, but by 2009 he was antsy. Martínez had announced his retirement, and Rubio wanted to challenge Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor, for the vacant Senate seat, but Party leaders had chosen Crist, and they told Rubio that they would oppose him with money and endorsements. Rubio’s friend Dennis Baxley received a text message from him: “I can’t quit thinking about U.S. Senate. They want me to do Attorney General of Florida instead, but what do you think?” Baxley said, “I texted him back. I said, ‘What does your wife think?’ She’s the spiritual depth gauge.” Jeanette approved.","3038","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio began more than thirty points behind, and almost dropped out. But he sensed that Crist was vulnerable on the right. Small, far-right rallies were gathering steam around the state; they eventually became the Tea Party. Driving around Florida in an F-150 pickup, Rubio went to rallies, and he portrayed Crist as an ally of Obama. He accentuated new priorities. Previously, progressive immigration activists had considered him an ally, because he supported tuition assistance for the children of undocumented workers and used his power to bury hard-line anti-immigration bills. But now he renounced the tuition program; he made use of the phrase “illegal aliens,” and condemned the Dream Act, which would have protected undocumented young people, as a step toward “a blanket amnesty.”","3039","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

(Before his campaign, he had said that the law would be akin to creating a “police state.”) He also received help from Jeb Bush, who introduced him to top donors and helped him secure endorsements. He got the nomination, and won the general election by nearly twenty points. At his victory party, Bush introduced him. The Weekly Standard hailed Rubio as “the most important freshman senator.” In the Senate, Rubio maintained his opposition to the Dream Act.

"In 2012, Mitt Romney considered Rubio as a possible running mate. Democratic researchers had assembled and released an opposition-research file that focussed on Rubio’s relationship with Rivera and on the financial errors, portraying them as evidence of ineptness or profiteering. In the end, Romney chose the Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan. In materials shared with donors and reporters, the Bush campaign has alleged that Rubio was rejected because of concerns about his background. But Beth Myers, the Romney adviser who oversaw the Vice-Presidential search, told Politico last month that that is “simply wrong,” and went on, “I can say that Senator Rubio ‘passed’ our vetting and we found nothing that disqualified him from serving as VP.”","3041","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After Romney lost, the G.O.P.’s official autopsy concluded that the Party had to “embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.” A small group of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate were organizing the first push for a bill that could satisfy both the left and the right, by combining a path to citizenship for eleven million undocumented immigrants with border-control measures. The group coveted Rubio’s participation, because he had both Tea Party support and Latino heritage. In December, Senator Dick Durbin, of Illinois, the No. 2 leader in the Democratic majority, encountered Rubio in the Senate gym and recruited him to what became known as the Gang of Eight. Time put him on the cover with the tagline “The Republican Savior.” He blitzed conservative media and white Evangelical audiences, arguing that border security and citizenship had to be “interwoven” in the bill. “It’s literally impossible to do one part without doing the other,” he said.","3042","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But his staff was ambivalent: his political strategists worried that it would cost him conservative support. After Rubio signed on to the bill, Glenn Beck declared, “What a piece of garbage this guy is.” But Rubio stayed with it, and when the bill reached the Senate floor, on June 27, 2013, he delivered the most powerful speech of his career, recalling that the first words that his father learned in English were “I am looking for work.” He quoted from the inscription on the Statue of Liberty, and said, “Here in America, generations of unfulfilled dreams will finally come to pass.”","3043","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The bill passed the Senate, but Rubio’s poll numbers were dropping, and he was having second thoughts. He was the only one of the eight senators who did not attend a news conference after the vote. In the weeks ahead, he walked away from the immigration bill. He told Sean Hannity, of Fox News, that repealing Obamacare was “more important” than his legislation. In October, he dismissed the bill as something “the Democrats in the Senate are demanding.” He stopped talking about immigration almost entirely. Matt Viser, of the Boston Globe, searched the Congressional Record and found that Rubio referred to immigration a hundred and thirty-five times on the Senate floor in 2013. In the next two years, he mentioned it twice. (The House never brought the bill up for a vote, and it died.)","3044","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio had come to Washington with ambitions to cut the debt, reduce spending, and curb E.P.A. rules in Florida, but none of those plans succeeded. In his first year, his only successful bill was a measure that designated September as National Spinal Cord Injury Awareness Month. He began losing enthusiasm for the Senate. The failure of the immigration bill hastened the process.","3045","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio had talked about running for President, but in Florida political circles few people imagined that he would run in 2016 if Bush did. “I didn’t conceive of them both deciding to compete, because the relationship goes so far back,” Baxley said.

"For those with strong ties to both Rubio and Bush, Rubio’s decision was discomfiting. The Miami Republican operative Al Cardenas, who gave Rubio his first job out of law school (and attended his wedding), and pushed for him to be a Vice-Presidential candidate in 2012, told Fox Latino, “I had hoped he would stay in the Senate,” adding, “It’s like running against your uncle for the president of the company.” When Rubio was asked why he did not defer to his mentor, he replied, “I didn’t know there was a line.” Asked about the sword that Bush gave him, Rubio told reporters, “I have it somewhere at home.

It was nicknamed the Ellis Island of the South. Flanked by enormous American flags, he told the crowd, in a message that pointed at both Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, “Yesterday is over.” At the announcement, demonstrators from Latino advocacy groups carried signs declaring “El Sueño de Rubio Es Nuestra Pesadilla” (“Rubio’s Dream Is Our Nightmare”). On “Despierta América,” the morning newscast on Univision, the host Satcha Pretto noted the presence of the protesters, and said, “Many immigrants are already asking themselves, ‘Does he want to support us or deport us?’ ”","3048","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

I don’t remember buying new shoes when I was a kid. But I think a lot of people go through that, in different ways.” He learned English from “Sesame Street.” “So I was the family translator until I was eight.” His older brother found work bagging groceries, and the family moved to West Las Vegas, another troubled part of town.","3050","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Murrieta became a naturalized citizen in 2010—“my American birthday,” he calls it. “It was the most beautiful moment of my life. And I registered to vote literally the moment after that, because all I ever wanted to do was vote.” In 2013, he worked nationally on immigration reform and labor issues. “I was blessed to be able to be in a lot of the rooms where policy was being discussed.” He said that Latinos would be receptive to a Republican message, but he thinks that the LIBRE Initiative promotes the interests of big business rather than the interests of the community.","3051","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked what he made of Rubio’s work on immigration reform. “He was for it before he was against it,” he said. “I’m an immigrant kid from the poorest parts of Vegas, and my family is touched by every form of immigration.” His brother-in-law and sister-in-law are undocumented. “This bill would have saved my family a lot of fear. You know, we still live in fear that our family is going to be torn apart.” He went on, “I’ve seen Marco Rubio give us lip service. I’ve seen him and his staff say that they support us. But then, when the spotlight is put on them, they don’t have the muscle to stand. And that’s not what we need in a President. We need someone who can stand up and stay true to what he’s said.” He added, “One of us has forgotten where we came from.”","3052","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The more we talked, the more dispirited Murrieta became about the state of the immigration debate in America. The Obama Administration’s executive actions, announced in 2014, would have shielded members of his family against the threat of deportation, but then a court ruling blocked that protection.

"A Gallup poll released in August found that among Hispanic voters Bush has a net favorability rating of eleven points; Rubio trails him, with five points. Clinton’s net favorability with Hispanics is forty points. But when I asked Lionel Sosa, Reagan’s Latino outreach director, how he thought Rubio would do with Hispanics in a general election, he said that although he had heard the criticisms, he thought they would fade. “The first Latino that has a chance to become President?

"It was, perhaps, inevitable that Marco Rubio would open the deepest cut in the troubled campaign of Jeb Bush. For days before the third Republican debate, the Bush campaign had been criticizing Rubio for missing Senate votes this year. During the debate, Bush sensed an opportunity and turned to face his former protégé. “Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work,” Bush said. “I mean, literally, the Senate—what is it, like, a French work week?” He delivered the line awkwardly, like a principal making a cameo appearance in a school play.","3057","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

The phrase “Someone has convinced you” was lethal. Bush—suddenly in the role of the misled, desperate old pol—smiled wanly and tried to speak, but Rubio turned to face the camera. “My campaign is going to be about the future of America—it’s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage,” he said. “I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.” It sounded like a eulogy.","3058","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

On October 30th, Paul Singer, the hedge-fund billionaire, who donated more money to Republican candidates and causes last year than anyone else in America, sent a letter to dozens of donors, encouraging them to help raise money for Rubio, calling him “perfect for this moment” and the best choice to “navigate this complex primary process, and still be in a position to defeat Secretary Clinton in November 2016.” Rubio had been courting Singer for weeks.","3059","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

He ordered a cappuccino, and then called after the waitress, “Can I get a double shot of espresso in it?” He looked tired. He was trying to maintain a semblance of a routine: six hours of sleep, a gym visit for “anything that gets your heart rate up for thirty minutes,” a morning call to his kids on the way to school, and an uninterrupted block of time at home with his family on Sundays.","3060","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

More than four in five Americans—an equal share of Republicans and Democrats—believe that money plays too large a role in political campaigns, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released in June. While Rubio was getting help from Singer, and perhaps Adelson, a nonprofit group called the Conservative Solutions Project—which, by law, can conceal the identities of its donors—was running millions of dollars’ worth of ads promoting him, more than any similar group devoted to a Presidential candidate.","3062","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked Rubio if he thinks Americans will worry that he is beholden to big backers. He shook his head, and said, “I’ve never had a single donor come to me and say, ‘I’ll support you, but only if you support this initiative.’ ” I said that sounded like a false standard, an unrealistic description of political influence. He continued, “People may not believe this, but the vast majority of big donors in America don’t really ask a lot of government—at least on our side of the aisle. What they really, largely, want is to be treated fairly and be left alone.” He added, “I’ve never changed any item on my agenda in search of a supporter.”","3063","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"On several issues, Rubio has taken a position that suits the faithful in the primaries but is guaranteed to repel voters in a general election. His most obvious vulnerability is on abortion. In the first Republican debate, Rubio said that his opposition to abortion extends to cases of rape or incest—a position at odds with that of more than three-quarters of Americans. Axelrod told me, “No exceptions is a position so extreme that no Republican candidate has ever held it. Presidential races are defined by moments. Maybe he will try to amend that position, but in the age of video it’s hard to extinguish a declarative statement like that.” When I asked Rubio about it, he said, somewhat confusingly, “Look, I personally believe that all life is worthy of protection, and therefore I don’t ever require, nor have I ever advocated, that I won’t support a law unless it has exceptions.” After some more twists and turns, I sensed that we had reached the line he plans to use in a general election: “My goal is to save as many lives as possible, and I’ll support anything that does that. Even if it has exceptions.”","3064","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"During the third debate, he had said that it was time to end an immigration system based largely on family ties. “That’s the way my parents came, legally, in 1956, but in 2015 we have a very different economy.

"“I understand the argument,” he said, but he thought it was unfair. “In 1956, two people with barely any command of English, who had no formal education of any sort, were able to find jobs. In the twenty-first century, those jobs are scarce. . . . So I don’t think, for the country, it makes sense to continue to allow people to immigrate here in large numbers who we know do not have the skills or the education they need to succeed economically. It’s just a change based on new economic reality.”","3066","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked what he thought would have happened to his parents if they had faced the system he is proposing. “It’s not clear what would have happened to them,” he said. “We can all get into hypotheticals about what would have happened two hundred years ago, or one hundred years ago, or fifty years ago, when somebody’s relatives came, but the world changes, and our policy has to keep pace with that.” He seemed dissatisfied with that answer, and went on, “Unlike most of the other people running, I live surrounded by immigration. My family are all immigrants. My kids go to school with kids who are immigrants. So this is not a theoretical issue for me. I live it personally. And it is hard. You know the stories of people that are here illegally, but it’s heartbreaking, because they came because they don’t want their daughter to be abducted by a drug gang in Central America. But the flip side of it is, every country in the world has immigration laws. And America has to have immigration laws, and if you don’t enforce them you don’t have laws. So this notion that somehow to be compassionate you have to be lawless is something I don’t buy, and I think most Hispanics don’t buy it.”","3067","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s campaign faces a range of tactical questions—Does he have the organization to win an early state? Will he lose his home state to Trump? Could Cruz win with only conservative and evangelical voters?—but the larger question will be harder to solve: Rubio has succeeded in politics by straddling as many positions as possible. He is the Catholic at the Protestant church, the quarterback of both teams, the joven viejo.

It’s really long. Only because I’m just so fascinated by the leadership he provided.” He went on, “Churchill was a guy who was largely ignored through much of the thirties as a warmonger, and a guy that was crying wolf, and Chamberlain was this heroic figure that was going to achieve peace in our time by diplomacy. And I think, in many cases, we’re kind of at a similar moment, where many of us, including myself, are warning about dangers that are percolating around the world and what they could turn into.

Jeb Bush, after straining, for months, to distance himself from his brother’s invasion of Iraq, said, “We should declare war” on the Islamic State, and called for the deployment of American troops “without their hands tied.” In a Democratic debate on the day after the attacks, Clinton said that the Islamic State “cannot be contained—it must be defeated.” She declined to identify the threat as “radical Islam,” saying that the term was “painting with too broad a brush” and risked alienating allies in the Muslim world.","3071","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio held up that point as a flawed gesture of diplomacy. “I don’t understand it,” he said on ABC’s “This Week,” the next day. “That would be like saying we weren’t at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren’t violent themselves.” It was a shrewd reply—the cool placement of safety over diplomacy—that nevertheless avoided Bush’s sharp turn toward war.","3072","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But in reaching for a broad rhetorical vision Rubio presaged an instinct for aggressive intervention.“This is a clash of civilizations,” he told ABC. “There is no middle ground on this. Either they win or we win.” It was the politics of absolutes, a vocabulary that harks back to the with-us-or-against-us logic of an earlier era. Even George W. Bush disavowed the clash-of-civilizations argument. Rubio stopped short of specifying how many troops he wants to send to the Middle East, but he left no doubt that he believes such action is unavoidable. In an article that Rubio wrote for Politico, he said that the United States should “provide direct military support to Sunnis and the Kurds if Baghdad fails to support them.” He also called for no-fly zones in Syria, for grounding Bashar al-Assad’s Air Force, and for the establishment of “safe zones” to “stem the flow of refugees and provide a place to train and arm rebel fighters.” He said that he would “oppose Russia and Iran” in their efforts to buttress Assad’s regime.","3073","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In one of our conversations, I asked Rubio if his instinct for intervention was out of step with a generation that is exhausted by war and confrontation, young men and women who have come of age in the years since September 11th. He responded instantly: “We’re not Luxembourg. We’re the United States of America—the highest-profile, most important, most influential country in the world.” He went on, “And we may ignore problems that exist far away, but those problems don’t ignore us. America, in the world today, is the only nation capable of convening collective action.”","3074","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Barely two months before the first Iowa caucus, the debates about national security and immigration were converging in ways that Rubio seemed well positioned to exploit. In the days after the Paris attacks, more than thirty governors said that their states would resist the resettlement of Syrian refugees. Rubio, as he so often does, found a way to embrace two sides of a painful question, expressing both empathy and tough-mindedness. He said of the refugees, “It’s not that we don’t want to—it’s that we can’t.” ♦","3075","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Like many parents, I suspect, my first reaction to the news of the shootings at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, on Thursday was to think of the families of the victims, and my second reaction was to turn away and mutter some obscenities. With the implacable grip that the gun lobby has on Congress, there is virtually no prospect of the United States following the example of nearly every other advanced country and restricting the supply of deadly firearms to civilians. Given that seemingly immutable reality, what is there left to say? Quite a lot, it turns out.","October 2, 2015","3076","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Evidently, President Obama felt the same frustration and hopelessness that many others did. But rather than resigning himself to the situation, he went down to the White House briefing room and issued one of the most powerful statements that he has delivered since taking office. We should be grateful that he did. Even if it doesn’t do much immediate good, it will be there in the record, to remind historians where the primary blame lies for this ongoing national disgrace.","3077","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The President started out by saying some words about the victims and their families, and said, “America will wrap everyone who’s grieving with our prayers and our love.” Then he said, “It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America—next week, or a couple of months from now…. We are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.”","3078","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Earlier this year, the President recalled, he made this point in an interview, noting that the country persists with lax gun laws despite repeated mass killings. “And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day! Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to this.”","3079","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Obama’s emotion—his anger—was palpable. He went on: “We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out. We need more guns, they’ll argue. Fewer gun-safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?”","3080","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Whether they believe it or not, supporters of the gun lobby were already out there making this argument—on cable shows, on conservative Web sites, and on social media. Some of them argued that the shooter targeted Umpqua Community College because it was a “gun-free zone,” a claim that has been disputed. Others accused President Obama of playing politics—apparently ignorant of, or oblivious to, the fact that he had already addressed this very criticism.","3081","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"“What’s also routine is that somebody, somewhere, will comment and say, ‘Obama politicized this issue,’ ” the President said. “Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.” He challenged news organizations to “tally up the number of Americans who’ve been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who’ve been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports.” He went on: “We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?”","3082","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"We all know the answer.","3083","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The Republican Party has long exercised a veto on any meaningful addition to the gun laws. And among its current crop of Presidential candidates, there is no sign of anybody breaking ranks. Reaction to the shooting ranged from nonexistent to predictably depressing. As far as I could see, Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina, the third- and fourth-place candidates in the polls, didn’t say anything on Thursday about what had happened in Oregon. In a message on Twitter, Jeb Bush called the massacre a “senseless tragedy.” Donald Trump, in an interview with the Washington Post, referred to it as a “terrible tragedy.” He also said, “It sounds like another mental-health problem. So many of these people, they’re coming out of the woodwork.” Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, took a similar line. “Obviously, there are those who are going to be calling for gun control,” he said on “The Hugh Hewitt Show.” “Obviously, that’s not the issue. The issue is the mentality of these people.”","3084","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"That is a familiar trope, of course: it’s not the guns that are the problem, it’s the shooters. There was no suggestion from anybody on the Republican side that what had happened might justify a reconsideration of gun laws, let alone a significant recasting of them. Even those G.O.P. candidates who have previously expressed support for some forms of gun control, such as Chris Christie and George Pataki, didn’t have anything to say on that subject.","3085","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The Democratic candidates, by contrast, were united in calling for action. Speaking to reporters in Massachusetts, Hillary Clinton said, “We have got to get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe.” She suggested that it wasn’t a hopeless task: “I know there is a way to have sensible gun-control measures that help prevent violence, prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands, and save lives. And I am committed to doing everything I can to achieve that.” Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, said in a tweet, “Tweets won’t stop this. Thoughts and prayers won’t either. Only real gun reforms will stop mass shootings from occurring nearly every day.” Bernie Sanders, who has been accused by Clinton allies of shifting his positions on gun control, called for “sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them.”","3086","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"But Democrats aren’t entirely blameless. After experiencing a political backlash during the nineteen-nineties, when the Clinton Administration pushed through gun-control measures that included a ban on assault weapons, too many members of the Party adopted a craven approach as, during the Bush years, Republicans in Congress rolled back some of the reforms. Even President Obama, who urged for stricter gun control during his 2008 campaign, can’t entirely escape criticism. During his first term, when for two years the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, his Administration didn’t propose any actual gun-control legislation. It wasn’t until 2013, after the massacre in Newtown, that the White House made a serious effort to persuade Congress to act—one that failed in the face of implacable Republican opposition.","3087","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"If you listened closely to Obama on Thursday, you would have noticed that, in his words of anger and despair, he didn’t entirely spare himself, or the rest of us, from responsibility. “This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America,” he said. “We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.”","3088","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"That is true. But it is also true, as Obama pointed out, that “this is not something I can do by myself.” To break through the politics of hopelessness, it will evidently take something more than blood—the blood of women, men, children, teachers, pastors, janitors, pensioners, first responders, anybody who happens to be in the way—being shed. “I hope and pray that I don’t have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances,” Obama said. “But based on my experience as President, I can’t guarantee that.”","3089","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The riskiest gamble of the Obama Presidency, the nuclear agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran, was basically won today. A rancorous congressional debate is still to come, but thirty-four senators have now vowed to support the deal, effectively blocking efforts on the Hill to eventually kill it.

The Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump, the Texas senator Ted Cruz, and the conservative talk-show host Glenn Beck are planning a “Stop the Iran Deal” rally at the Capitol, on September 9th, the day after Congress returns from recess and begins to debate the terms. The rally is co-sponsored by Tea Party Patriots, the Zionist Organization of America, and the Center for Security Policy. It’s likely to be as colorful as it is combative. On “Meet the Press” last month, Trump warned that the deal would be a boon to the Iranians. “They are going to be such a wealthy, such a powerful nation,” he said. “They are going to have nuclear weapons. They are going to take over parts of the world that you wouldn’t believe. And I think it’s going to lead to nuclear holocaust.”","3091","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"Former Vice-President Dick Cheney has joined the debate. He is scheduled to give a major address on Iran in Washington next week, at the American Enterprise Institute. “Nearly everything the president has told us about his Iranian agreement is false,” Cheney wrote on Friday, in a Wall Street Journal piece adapted from his book. “He has said it will prevent the Iranians from acquiring nuclear weapons, but it will actually facilitate and legitimize an Iranian nuclear arsenal. He has said this deal will stop nuclear proliferation, but it will actually accelerate it, as nations across the Middle East work to acquire their own weapons in response to America’s unwillingness to stop the Iranian nuclear program.”","3092","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"The focus in Washington is already shifting, however, to whether the Democrats might be able to win seven more endorsements—for a total of forty-one—to invoke a filibuster that would prevent the deal from even coming to a vote in the Senate. Republicans, with limited Democratic support, have been hoping to pass a Resolution of Disapproval in both the Senate and the House by September 17th. Obama pledged that he would veto it. Support from thirty-four senators now means that the President would be able to sustain his veto—if it comes to that.","3093","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"“We’ve always said that our goal was for the Administration to be able to implement this deal—whatever that took in Congress,” a senior Administration official told me Wednesday.

"So far, the prospects of the Democrats blocking a vote altogether are sketchy. Even support for the nuclear agreement—announced on July 24th, after twenty months of tortured diplomacy between Iran and the world’s six major powers—is either tepid or reluctant in both houses of Congress. Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat from Maryland who retires next year, became the decisive thirty-fourth voice in the Senate on Wednesday. Her views reflected those of many fellow-Democrats.","3095","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"“No deal is perfect, especially one negotiated with the Iranian regime,” Mikulski said. “I have concluded that this Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is the best option available to block Iran from having a nuclear bomb. For these reasons, I will vote in favor of this deal.” She, like many others, had caveats. “However, Congress must also reaffirm our commitment to the safety and security of Israel,” she said.","3096","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"

The lobbying has been ferocious, the media blitz of anti-deal television ads sometimes apocalyptic. Two Democratic senators—Charles Schumer, of New York, and Robert Menendez, of New Jersey—have announced opposition to the deal.

Maryland’s Ben Cardin is also reportedly torn.","3097","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"Secretary of State John Kerry, in a push to mobilize more votes, sent separate letters to the Senate and the House today, pledging to work with Congress on new legislation that would guarantee the security of allies, notably Israel and the Gulf countries, as well as check Iran’s behavior in the region. Israel’s security, Kerry wrote, is “sacrosanct.”","3098","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"Kerry also made an emotional final pitch for the deal, before congressional debate begins next week, in a speech in Philadelphia. “The outcome will matter as much as any foreign-policy decision in recent history,” he said. “To vote down this agreement is to solve nothing. . . . To oppose this agreement is—whether intended or not—to recommend . . . a policy of national paralysis. It is to take us back directly to the very dangerous spot that we were in two years ago—only to go back there devoid of any realistic plan or option.”","3099","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"The White House has long claimed that the deal with Iran was about only one issue and does not represent an attempt at rapprochement between Washington and Tehran. But the Administration’s arguments increasingly hint at future possibilities. “The Iran agreement is not a panacea for the sectarian and extremist violence that has been ripping that region apart,” Kerry said in Philadelphia. “But history may judge it a turning point, a moment when the builders of stability seized the initiative from the destroyers of hope, and when we were able to show, as have generations before us, that when we demand the best from ourselves and insist that others adhere to a similar high standard—when we do that, we have immense power to shape a safer and a more humane world.”","3100","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"

In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, he called the agreement “a beginning for a better understanding for other issues as well.” A more “realistic approach and attitude” by the United States toward Iran would be reciprocated, he said. Larijani is a powerful figure and a conservative. The son of a grand ayatollah, he is a former Presidential candidate.

"On Friday, October 2nd, Jeb Bush was onstage at a college auditorium in Greenville, South Carolina, for a public interview with Alan Wilson, the state’s attorney general and a prominent figure in the right-wing firmament. Bush is sixty-two, but, thanks to a low-carb Paleo diet, he looks younger than he did when he left the Florida governor’s office eight years ago for a life in the business world. A trim physique, however, hasn’t boosted his appeal to potential voters. A new national poll showed that Bush’s support had sunk to four per cent; South Carolina, which has one of the most conservative Republican electorates in the country, and will hold its primary early next year, just after Iowa and New Hampshire, is crucial to winning the nomination. Once considered the front-runner, Bush is trailing a clutch of candidates, among them Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who have never held public office and encourage comparison to buffoons.","3103","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Jeb has presented himself as the most electable Republican candidate: willing to break with Republican orthodoxy on domestic issues such as immigration and education, and committed to breaking, if vaguely, with his brother’s legacy on foreign policy and to being, as he has said, his “own man.” Before Bush officially entered the 2016 campaign, he remarked to a group of C.E.O.s at a conference in Washington, D.C., that a successful candidate had to be willing to “lose the primary to win the general,” and should campaign “without violating your principles.” He meant that one must avoid the perennial trap of party primaries, in which “base voters,” the hard-core conservatives, force politicians to take extreme positions that will prove unpopular in a general election and, when later disavowed, expose the candidate as a phony. “It’s not an easy task, to be honest with you,” he noted. (Hillary Clinton faces a similar problem in her race for the Democratic nomination.)","3104","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But in his conversation with Wilson, and in a subsequent interview with me and other reporters, Bush veered toward the right. On domestic affairs, his view was neatly summarized by his answer to a question about gun control. It was the day after the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, and yet Bush rejected any calls for new legislation. He noted that he had confronted similar pressure for government action after tragedies while he was governor: “Look, stuff happens. There’s always a crisis, and the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.”","3105","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush was pilloried by Democrats for his “stuff happens” remark, but he defended it, telling me that the government doesn’t have a solution to every problem, and that sometimes government action makes matters worse. Some variety of a laissez-faire philosophy is standard for modern Republicans, at least on most domestic issues. But, increasingly in recent months, Bush, like a number of his colleagues, has been making the case for aggressive intervention abroad. Two days earlier, Russia had carried out its first air strikes in Syria. When I asked Bush how he would respond if he were President, he said that it was the lack of American action that had created the dire situation in Iraq and Syria, and invited the Russian military to bolster the Assad regime.","3106","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I think we need to stand up to Putin, not just as it relates to Syria,” Bush told me. “This sends a signal all around the world of the United States pulling back, not being serious. Our allies don’t believe that we’re going to have their back. And this emboldens our enemies.” Bush offered no details on how to “stand up to Putin” or what, exactly, he would do to pacify the killing floor of the Middle East and South Asia and reconcile the tangled rivalries and interests there. But his message to the base was clear: We must do something. And we must do it now.","3107","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush’s view represents a return to a simplistic interventionism that seemed discredited in the wake of the Iraq debacle. For decades, the G.O.P. has been split into two camps. The realists, who dominated the Presidency of Bush’s father, George H. W. Bush, emphasized diplomacy and coalitions over go-it-alone displays of force, and a skepticism about America’s ability to shape the internal dynamics of foreign countries. They also expressed a willingness to tolerate tyrannical regimes that advance U.S. interests or create greater stability in volatile regions of the world. The other camp—variously described as idealists, hawks, and neoconservatives—dominated the Presidency of Bush’s brother. They have more often called for the overthrow rather than the containment of hostile regimes, and they remain committed to exporting American-style democracy to places where it has never flourished.","3108","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"The hyper-interventionist foreign policy of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney was widely blamed for the Republican Party’s loss of Congress in 2006 and of the Presidency in 2008. But many hawks, once more in full voice, now believe that the Obama years—the emergence of ISIS, the crisis in Syria and Iraq, Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, the rise of Putin at a time of Russian isolation and economic weakness—have vindicated Bush. “Any Presidential candidate, the first thing he or she needs to do is put up a map of the Middle East in 2009 and one today,” John McCain, a leading hawk in the Senate, told me, as we discussed foreign policy in his office. “And point out that it is this President’s failures. He said he got out of conflicts. He got out of conflicts, but the conflicts didn’t end.”","3109","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Obama thinks that intractable foreign-policy crises should be guided by the physician’s maxim of “first, do no harm”—or, as his aides have said privately, “Don’t do stupid shit.” To Republican hawks, this sounds like a willful and dangerous abdication of American power and influence. Lindsey Graham, who is one of the long-shot Presidential candidates and McCain’s closest ally in the Senate, has called for ten thousand American troops to be sent back to Iraq. Last week, Chris Christie said that he would set up a no-fly zone in the Syrian airspace in which the Russians are now operating, and shoot down any planes that entered it.","3110","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But of all the Republican candidates vying to reform the world of foreign affairs only one belongs to a family of Presidents that, for better or worse, did so much to give that world its present shape. When Jeb Bush began his campaign, he enlisted as advisers some of the realists from his father’s camp, including the former Secretary of State James Baker. But the heaviest contingent consisted of his brother’s liege men: Paul Wolfowitz, the Defense Department official who made the ideological case for invading Iraq; John Hannah, who had been an adviser to Dick Cheney and pushed bad intelligence into Colin Powell’s famous speech at the U.N. making the case for war; Porter Goss, the former C.I.A. director who condoned waterboarding as an interrogation technique; and Stephen Hadley, the former national-security adviser, who took the blame for false assertions that President Bush made about nuclear yellowcake allegedly sought by Saddam Hussein from Niger.","3111","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

(Reich denies that he or the U.S. played any role in the coup.) In May, Jeb Bush, after providing a series of confusing responses on the issue, said that, given what is now known about the condition of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear-, biological-, and chemical-weapons program in 2003, he would not have invaded Iraq. Not all of his advisers share this sentiment.","3112","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I can defend the invasion of Iraq,” Reich told me. “What did the invasion of Iraq do? It caused all of the people who would’ve otherwise come and attacked us and killed Americans on our soil—it caused them to go to Iraq and die there. That may sound very brutal, or whatever, but we have seen what has happened when you have an Administration like the current one, that did not realize what Bush had done; sent the troops home from Iraq; created a vacuum that was filled by ISIS. And they’re killing Americans and everyone else—they’re mostly killing Muslims. I lay that at the feet of the Obama Administration.”","3113","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He added, “All Republicans say what I just did . . . but it’s not reported. Nobody listens. It goes against conventional wisdom.

Well, history is beginning to tell a different story.”","3114","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"The American public’s appetite for military interventions runs in cycles. After the triumph of the Second World War, policymakers were emboldened to roll back Communism, but the miasma of Vietnam instilled a wariness of major overseas military entanglements that spanned the Carter and Reagan Presidencies. In 1991, the relatively quick and successful Gulf War sparked a new bipartisan consensus that American force could again be deployed wisely if it was undertaken with overwhelming strength and with the benefit of an international coalition. The lack of intervention in Rwanda was widely seen as a moral calamity for which politicians, including Bill Clinton, have apologized.","3115","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"That uneasy consensus lasted through the 2001 toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan. But the invasion of Iraq in 2003 came to be seen as such a catastrophic mistake that even its progenitor could not avoid casting blame on his own circle. George W. Bush, during his last two years in office, forced out Donald Rumsfeld and marginalized Dick Cheney. It was too late to save his own popularity. When voters went to the polls in November, 2008, Bush’s job-approval rating dipped to twenty per cent, the lowest of any outgoing President in the history of polling.","3116","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Voices of restraint can still be heard in the Party’s debates, including on Jeb Bush’s team. One adviser, in contrast to Reich, told me, “I’m sure he’s not going to invade Iraq again. We did that one. You can’t compare him to his brother, because his brother was operating in a different environment. We had just been attacked; we didn’t know what was coming next.”","3117","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Senator Lindsey Graham, whose candidacy is essentially limited to a hard-line foreign policy, said his opponents were trying to sort out the politics of interventionism. “Here’s the problem,” he said, “Republicans know it’s not popular to be for Obama’s foreign policy, but they’re nervous about how far to go. They’re trying to find out where the public is, and trying to take the public’s pulse. They’re trying to figure out where the market is—where’s the sweet spot?”","3118","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, who is also running for President, told me that he thinks he’s found it: a foreign policy that channels Reagan, by far the most popular Republican in modern history. In Cruz’s Senate office, we sat under an enormous painting depicting Ronald Reagan’s 1987 speech at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, in which he declared, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.”","3119","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz is forty-four, eighteen years younger than Jeb Bush. Other politicians of his generation, including Marco Rubio, also forty-four, were strongly influenced by 9/11, but Cruz told me that he draws more lessons from Reagan’s fight against Communism than from Bush’s and Obama’s fight against terrorism. “The foreign-policy events that shaped my world view the most did not occur in the past two Presidencies,” he said. “I believe in peace through strength. It’s worth underscoring. Reagan went through eight years in the Presidency, and the biggest country he ever invaded was Grenada.”","3120","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He emphasized that “among Republicans there is a spectrum of views of foreign policy. At one end, there is Rand Paul”—a non-interventionist who is the most skeptical of further involvement in Syria and Iraq. “At the other end, I would put John McCain. Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio are very similar to McCain. I would describe my views as a third point on the triangle.” He believes that “America should always be a clarion voice of liberty, and that the bully pulpit of the Presidency has enormous power. There is power to speaking the truth on a global stage.” He added, “However, speaking for freedom is not the same thing as using U.S. military force. Historically, America has always been reluctant to engage in military force.”","3121","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Reagan’s foreign policy was rhetorically idealistic but also deeply pragmatic. Although he described the Soviet Union as “the evil empire,” he was quick to negotiate with Gorbachev. Soon after Hezbollah attacked the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, in 1983, killing two hundred and forty-one Americans, Reagan said that a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon would send a “signal to terrorists everywhere: they can gain by waging war against innocent people.” But then he did it anyway, after concluding that the troops’ mission was unclear and that their presence offered too inviting a target to extremists.","3122","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"This strain of pragmatism was powerful enough that George W. Bush called for a “humble” foreign policy in his 2000 campaign, and condemned the kinds of democracy-building interventions for which he would later become known. Cruz strives to return the G.O.P. to its pre-9/11 philosophy. “If and when U.S. military force is required,” he told me, “it should, No. 1, always be to directly further the vital national security of the United States. No. 2, we should use overwhelming force. And, No. 3, we should get the heck out. It should not be the objective of our armed forces to engage in nation-building, to transform foreign nations into robust, utopian democracies.”","3123","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"While many Republicans now criticize Obama for not doing enough in Syria, Cruz was among those who opposed Obama’s 2013 request to strike Syria. “He repeatedly tried to justify this as ‘vindicating international norms,’ or as ‘the violation of international law,’ ” Cruz said. “It’s not the job of our military to behave like a law professor in a faculty lounge, vindicating international law. It’s the job of our military to protect the safety and security of three hundred and thirty million Americans.” He said that although “Assad is a monster” who “has used poison gas” and “killed hundreds of thousands of his own citizens,” he worries about what might happen “if the attack succeeds and you topple Assad, and the weapons then fall into the hands of Al Qaeda or Al Nusra or ISIS or any of the other radical Islamic terrorists.” (Donald Trump has said that he’s happy to have Russia in Syria fighting ISIS, though he failed to note that, so far, Russia has been mainly targeting U.S.-trained rebels, not ISIS.)","3124","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz added that the military commanders he has consulted insist that “the most potent tool to use against ISIS is overwhelming airpower.” He maintained that arming the Kurds in northern Iraq was a better alternative to sending U.S. troops. “We need boots on the ground, but they don’t necessarily need to be American boots,” he said. “The Kurds are our boots on the ground.”","3125","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But Cruz’s prescription may be more like Reagan’s supply-side tax cuts than like Reagan’s foreign policy: it promises enormous benefits with very little sacrifice. Graham, who wants American troops to lead the fight, scoffed at Cruz’s argument. “The Kurds don’t have any offensive capability,” he said, pointing out that Shiites and non-Kurdish Sunnis in Iraq and Syria would be as concerned about Kurdish advances as they are about ISIS. “They’re not gonna go down to Ramadi! Go ask the Kurds, ‘Would you help us liberate Syria?’ And they’d say, ‘Thank you, but no thank you.’ If you want to create a war to end all wars, have a marauding band of Kurds going through the Middle East.”","3126","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz has calculated that, despite the rise of ISIS, Republican voters are still hungover from the costly interventions of the Bush years, and that they share his skepticism about the ability of American troops to accomplish much in Iraq and Syria. “There are some politicians in Washington who approach foreign military action as if they’re playing Risk,” he said. “They want to deploy troops and command them in battle.” He added, “A number of politicians treat American boots on the ground as a talisman to demonstrate that they’re really tough.”","3127","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Obama, who has said that he was elected to end wars, not start them, has bombed more countries than George W. Bush did. But in fighting terrorism he has chosen to use drones and other forms of airpower, Special Forces, and proxy armies. Obama was skeptical about intervening to stop Muammar Qaddafi’s forces as they marched on a helpless population in Benghazi, Libya. He had to be talked into the operation by, among others, Hillary Clinton, and the result—a failed state in Libya that has created a haven for terrorists—shaped his skepticism about intervening in Syria.","3128","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Early on, key Republicans seemed to endorse Obama’s cautious approach. When Marco Rubio ran for the Senate in 2010, he supported Obama’s drawdown of troops in Iraq. As a former city commissioner in West Miami and then a state legislator, Rubio knew the foreign-policy issues that important Florida constituencies care about, such as the Jewish community’s staunchly pro-Israel views and the Cuban-American community’s fierce opposition to Castro. He had little experience with broader foreign-policy questions. In his early months in Congress, he supported attempts at diplomacy with Iran. During the 2013 fight over budget cuts, Rubio advocated for government-spending reform. He has since grown less cautionary, arguing for an increase in military spending and calling it the “most important obligation of the federal government.”","3129","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio, who was a leader in the Florida House while Jeb Bush was governor and is now his nearest opponent in the race, though they are both well behind Trump and Carson in most national polls, has recently positioned himself as one of the most hawkish Republicans running for President. McCain noted that Rubio, like others, had shifted into his camp after the emergence of ISIS, and he joked that Rubio has a history of switching positions, which McCain gently mocked by licking his finger and holding it in the air.","3130","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Recently, Rubio told me that he no longer believes that Obama’s drawdown was wise. “We are retreating from Afghanistan and Iraq, not anticipating the vacuum that would be left behind and the potential that creates for radicalism,” he said. His shift might seem political, but he suggested that it was the result of becoming immersed in issues, as a senator, to which, as a candidate, he had given little thought. He noted that some of his opponents, including Jeb Bush, have never held federal office. “I’m a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee,” Rubio said. “I spend a significant amount of time working on these issues on a daily basis. So most certainly I’m going to have more insight than someone reading briefings from the staffers.”","3131","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio’s foreign policy is a clear response to Obama’s alleged retreat from the world. The President’s biggest mistakes, in this view, were all failures to intervene more aggressively. Rubio has said that he would have forcefully taken the side of demonstrators in Iran during the 2009 Green Revolution. “The President was so intent on negotiating with Iran’s tyrants that he did little to help its people,” he remarked in a speech in Washington in 2011.","3132","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But the key issue for many emerging Republican hawks was Obama’s failure to attack Assad when he used chemical weapons. Obama had drawn a “red line,” but then retreated. Instead, he accepted a deal negotiated with Putin to place the weapons under international control. “Everyone heard him,” Reich said. “He said, ‘I didn’t draw the red line, the world drew a red line.’ No, Mr. President, the world didn’t stand before the cameras in the White House and say that it was drawing a red line; you did. . . . It’s very dangerous.”","3133","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"George Shultz, who is ninety-four and is also a Bush adviser, was Reagan’s Secretary of State. He said that the red line was one of the biggest mistakes of Obama’s Presidency. “I don’t think the President realizes how much damage was done,” he said. “I remember when I was in marine boot camp, at the start of World War Two, and the sergeant hands me this rifle and says, ‘Take good care of this rifle—this is your best friend. Remember one thing: never point this rifle at anybody unless you’re willing to pull the trigger.’ No empty threats. That’s boot-camp wisdom. With Obama there are empty threats lying all over the place, and they undermine his credibility.”","3134","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"This outlook relies on some revisionist history. When Obama asked Congress for authorization to bomb Syria in 2013, several Republicans, Rubio among them, voted against the resolution in the Foreign Relations Committee, and many others announced that they would oppose it on the Senate floor. It never came to a vote. Rubio said that the Administration’s proposed attack was not sufficiently robust; now he cites the failure to use force as the reason for much of the current chaos, including Putin’s recent involvement.","3135","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio told me that years ago he warned that the power vacuums in the Middle East were being filled by Islamic extremists, and he noted ISIS’s growing role in Afghanistan, where it had previously had little presence. “If they continue unabated a year from now, we could live in a world where ISIS is now operating in vacated spaces in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya,” he said. Rubio is a favorite of G.O.P. hawks. Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas billionaire who spent some $100 million in the 2012 election and is wooed by almost every Republican candidate, is reportedly also a fan. But Rubio sounds more cautious when asked for details about how to defeat ISIS.","3136","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“Intervening doesn’t mean ground troops,” he said. “Intervening can be a lot of things.” He went on, “A full-scale invasion, sending a hundred thousand troops to Iraq right now, is probably not the best way to defeat ISIS. Because it very well may be what they hope will happen, because it will allow them to point to radicals around the world and attract more recruits and more funding. I think that the better approach is to empower Sunni tribes to defeat them. And they need a lot of help from us, including air strikes and special-op forces.”","3137","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"What Rubio laid out wasn’t very different from Obama’s current plan. When pressed, he conceded that many more American troops might be necessary. “There’s no magic number,” he said. “I don’t know if nine thousand is worse than eleven thousand. What matters is: first you have to establish a mission—what are you trying to achieve? Then you have to allow the military to come up with operations and how to achieve that mission. And that will determine the number in the mission, not the other way around.”","3138","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio, Graham, and many other Republicans believe that the nation’s foreign policy suffers from timidity, not from overexertion. The problem is in the execution, not the intervention itself. “Here’s what I’ve learned,” Graham told me. “If you don’t have a plan after you take Afghanistan down, after you take Iraq down, after you take Libya down, after you take Syria down, you’re going to regret it.”","3139","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Given the failed states and the civil wars gripping Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, I asked Graham for an example of a successful intervention that would bolster his case for a more hawkish foreign policy. We were sitting outside, in Manchester, New Hampshire, and he was eating nachos. He looked at me excitedly, racing to swallow so that he could get to his answer: “How about Germany and Japan?”","3140","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Even as Bush watches his opponents solidify their foreign-policy positions, he has struggled to come to terms with his brother’s ideology. His opponents criticize him for being vague or unengaged. Graham told me, “I think he’s a work-in-progress. I think he’s been out of the game for ten years. . . . He’s gotta convince people that three Bushes are not one too many.”","3141","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Jeb Bush’s troubles began almost as soon as he declared his candidacy and included the eighty-five-year-old James Baker on his list. As Communism began to collapse, in 1989, Bush and Baker helped engineer a soft landing for the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the gradual reorientation of Europe’s Eastern Bloc countries toward the West. Hawks pilloried them for not asserting themselves strongly enough. When Bush went to Kiev, Ukraine, for instance, and warned Ukrainians not to secede from the Soviet Union, the address was mocked as the “chicken Kiev” speech. In 1991, after assembling a United Nations-backed coalition to push Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, Bush and Baker ignored the pleas of American neoconservatives who wanted U.S. forces to march on Baghdad and overthrow Saddam following the uprisings against his rule. They were again demonized. Wolfowitz said that it was as if America were “idly watching a mugging.” In 2006, Baker co-chaired the Iraq Study Group, which recommended a dramatic change in Bush’s policy in the Middle East, including the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Iraq and diplomatic engagement with Iran and Syria, policies that Bush rejected.","3142","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"When Baker appeared on Jeb Bush’s list, neoconservatives expressed alarm. His foreign-policy views—diplomacy, stability, and serious doubts about interventions requiring large numbers of U.S. troops—are closer to Obama’s than to George W. Bush’s. Jeb Bush faced a revolt from donors and excoriation in neoconservative publications. A few weeks after Jeb’s announcement, Baker was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at a Washington gala dinner for J Street, the liberal-leaning pro-Israel group founded in 2008 to act as a counterweight to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Commentary published an article about “Jeb Bush’s James Baker Problem” and warned that Jeb may be Baker’s “kindred spirit.” Mark Levin, an influential talk-radio host, wrote that “Jeb Bush turns to Israel-hater, Jim Baker, for foreign policy advice.” Adelson reportedly sent word to Bush that he should pressure Baker to cancel the speech. Bush declined, and Adelson’s allies leaked that Adelson wouldn’t support Bush.","3143","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"At the J Street dinner, Baker criticized Benjamin Netanyahu for “diplomatic missteps and political gamesmanship,” and spoke about his own role in the first Bush Administration’s withholding of loan guarantees to Israel in order to pressure the government to halt settlement construction. William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, called Baker “anti-Israel,” and tweeted, “Thankfully, James Baker doesn’t speak for today’s Republican Party.” Morton Klein, the president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America, told Bloomberg that Bush’s association with Baker would cost the candidate: “There are many mega-donors who will not be with him because of that.”","3144","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In May, Bush appeared in New York, at the Metropolitan Club, before an audience of financiers organized by Paul Singer, a hedge-fund manager and the kind of Republican mega-donor Klein had warned about. Someone asked Bush to explain Baker’s influence on his policymaking. According to the Washington Post, Jeb “said that he respected Baker, but maintained that he is not part of his foreign-policy team.” CNN, which cited four sources and the notes of someone present, quotes Bush as saying, “What you need to know is that who I listen to when I need advice on the Middle East is George W. Bush.” The Bush campaign later insisted that Jeb was speaking narrowly about Israeli policy. Either way, the message was clear: the hawks were back in control of Republican foreign policy.","3145","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Lately, in his effort to be his “own man,” Bush has displayed a willingness to move even further to the right than his brother. At the October 2nd interview in South Carolina, Wilson asked him about the U.S. prison at Guantánamo Bay. During George W. Bush’s tenure, the prison became such a source of shame for America that even Bush, who was loath to acknowledge mistakes or to bow to international pressure, said in 2007, “It should be a goal of the nation to shut down Guantánamo.” Jeb disagrees. Wilson asked if Guantánamo prisoners should be moved to maximum-security facilities in the U.S. “No,” Jeb said. “There is no option for these folks. They should stay where they are. Even if it’s—it’s expensive. It’s the nicest prison you’ll ever want to be in, by the way. And the rights of these terrorists are way beyond what a lot of people get in a lot of different circumstances. They’re not being mistreated at all. But there is no other option.”","3146","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"If the economy improves, and Democrats continue to maintain an advantage on domestic issues, the Republican candidates will increasingly highlight foreign policy, an area of perceived vulnerability for Obama and Clinton. McCain, who lost to Obama in 2008, said, perhaps hopefully, “National security, foreign policy, and terrorism will play a greater role in the decision-making of the American people than at any time since 1980.” He insisted that although Bush’s record on foreign policy contributed to his own defeat, “it has gone from a significant negative” at the start of the Obama Administration “to what has become more and more of a positive.”","3147","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In August, Bush travelled to Simi Valley, California, to give a speech on foreign policy at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Bush called Reagan “a leader of clarity and resolve, not given to idle words,” someone “who took command of events, rebuilt America’s strength, and moved the world toward peace.” But when he shifted from Reagan’s Cold War successes to more recent events his speech sounded more like a tribute to the Administration of George W. Bush.","3148","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“No leader or policymaker involved will claim to have gotten everything right in the region, Iraq especially,” he said. But he argued that, whatever mistakes were made, it was the surge of troops in 2007 that “turned events toward victory.” The surge “was a success—brilliant, heroic, and costly.” It was Obama who lost Iraq, not his brother. The “premature withdrawal was the fatal error,” Jeb said, referring to Obama’s gradual drawdown, “creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill—and that Iran has exploited to the full as well.”","3149","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He then turned this logic against the Democrats’ most likely nominee. “ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat,” he said. “And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the President himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away. In all her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly one time.”","3150","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Clinton herself has tried to create some distance from Obama’s record. Since leaving the Administration, she has repeatedly said that as Secretary of State she urged Obama to do more in the early days of the Syrian uprising against Assad, when moderates could still be found in that country and American intervention could, arguably, have made a difference. Obama has dismissed that view as “a fantasy.” But, whatever Clinton actually believes about the correct course in the Middle East, she has already shown that she will adopt the campaign position that best suits her politically. In early October, facing a challenge from the left from Bernie Sanders, she reversed her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that she championed as Secretary of State.","3151","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"It’s easy to attack Obama as feckless in the face of the chaos in Libya, Syria, and Iraq. Less apparent is how to translate vague campaign promises to do something into a plan that won’t put more American lives at risk. After Jeb Bush spoke with Wilson in South Carolina, he met with reporters backstage. His aides were scrambling to contain any fallout from the “stuff happens” remark, which had immediately elicited a response from President Obama, and echoed one of the most notorious statements of the Bush Administration: Rumsfeld’s declaration during the chaos in Iraq that “stuff happens.” After defending his remark, Jeb Bush then took some questions about Syria, Iraq, and Putin.","3152","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He has called for a no-fly zone over Syria that would help a Sunni-led army fight a two-front war against Assad and ISIS, but it’s unclear who would make up the forces. He told reporters that American airpower in Syria is “restricted by lawyers kind of imposing all sorts of conditions.” He would change the rules, he said, so “that it would be there to fight to win.” He didn’t specify which rules he would lift, but, as Graham noted, almost every military expert dismisses the idea that airpower alone can defeat ISIS. “The only way you destroy a big ground opponent is with another big ground opponent,” Graham told me. “You’re not going to bomb ISIL into submission. You gotta go tear the caliphate up by the roots. That means going into Syria on the ground.”","3153","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"To fight ISIS in Iraq, Bush made the familiar argument that America should arm the Kurds and “embed with the Iraqi military,” both of which Obama is effectively doing. When asked whether he would send more troops, Bush said that the U.S. already has thirty-five hundred troops in Iraq and that the real issue was how to better integrate them into Iraqi forces. Pressed further, he conceded, in a roundabout way, that he would be willing to send more American troops back to Iraq.","3154","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I would listen to the military commanders and I would create a strategy,” he said, a phrase that politicians revert to whenever they want to avoid details. “If it required more supportive troops, fine.” The statement was a reminder of Bush’s continuing dilemma: can he get the nomination without violating his principles? In the months since the start of his campaign, he has only clouded the matter of what, precisely, he stands for.","3155","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"At one point, someone asked Bush a churlish question about his father’s 1991 statement regarding the possibility of “a new world order” after the Cold War ended. Bush used it as an opportunity to talk about Obama’s alleged retreat from the world.","3156","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I don’t even know what that means anymore,” he said. “In 1992, it meant the end of Communism, and that the United States needed to play a constructive role in forging peace and security, and we still have that role to play. We have threats that are created by our absence. Just look at what’s going on in Syria as an example of that, where we have no strategy, where Putin, agile as he is, ends up injecting himself into something that makes it harder for me to imagine that this brutal Assad regime will depart.” He thought for a moment and added, “American leadership matters.” ♦","3157","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, is an unusual politician. When he speaks, he often sounds as though he has just graduated from college with double honors in clichés and platitudes. “I share a sense of optimism for America’s future,” he said in his first answer during Wednesday night’s G.O.P. debate, in Boulder, Colorado. He continued, “Our greatest days lie ahead.” Later, in his closing statement, Rubio said, “We can’t just save the American dream—we can expand it.” I waited for him to talk about “a shining city upon a hill,” but he didn’t get around to it.

"Early on in the debate, Jeb Bush, the benighted ex-front-runner, sought to score some points off of Rubio by criticizing him for his poor attendance record in the U.S. Senate. “Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work,” Bush said, busting in on an interchange between Rubio and Carl Quintanilla, one of the CNBC moderators, about an editorial in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that accused Rubio of ripping off the voters who elected him in 2010. “I mean, literally, the Senate—what is it, like a French work week?” Bush went on. “You get, like, three days where you have to show up? You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.”","3160","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Rubio was prepared. He’d already demonstrated that fact by seeking to turn Quintanilla’s question into an attack on the media, a tactic that many Republicans adopt when they’re under fire, because it often works for them. First, Rubio pointed out that one of his Democratic predecessors, Bob Graham, missed more than thirty per cent of his votes in the Senate, in 2004, when he ran for President. Then he said that John Kerry and Barack Obama—two more senators who ran for the White House—missed even more votes than Graham did. “So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement,” Rubio said.","3161","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"That response earned him loud cheers from the crowd. Bush waded in with his admonishments anyway. When the former Florida governor had finished, Rubio said, “I get to respond, right?” Becky Quick, another of the moderators, told him he had thirty seconds. “Well, it’s interesting,” Rubio began. “Over the last few weeks, I’ve listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you’re modelling your campaign after John McCain, that you’re going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.

"Rather than answering the question, or doing something else to knock Rubio off balance, Bush said that McCain wasn’t his senator. “Well, let me tell you,” Rubio said. “I don’t remember you ever complaining about John McCain’s vote record. The only reason why you’re doing it now is because we’re running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.” Bush mumbled something, but the applause for Rubio virtually drowned him out. “Here’s the bottom line,” Rubio went on. “My campaign is going to be about the future of America; it’s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage. I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush. I’m not running against Governor Bush. I’m not running against anyone on this stage. I’m running for President because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.”","3163","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"I wrote all of this down at length because it was what the political pros call “a moment”—something that lasts for more than one news cycle and helps define the event in the public consciousness—which is what all of the debaters are seeking. In attacking his fellow-Floridian, Bush was clearly looking for a moment to change the narrative of his sagging campaign. But because Rubio was sharper and better prepared—he had clearly come with the McCain answer in his pocket, in case Bush attacked him—the moment turned out to be his.","3164","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"In fact, it may have been more than “a” moment. If you believe some of the commentators who were waxing lyrical about Rubio’s performance after the debate, it was “the” moment in which he publicly confirmed that he has displaced Bush as the regular politician most likely to be the Republican nominee. The Fix, one of the Washington Post’s political blogs, ran a piece headlined “How Marco Rubio owned Jeb Bush in Wednesday’s GOP debate.” At The New Republic, Brian Beutler suggested that Bush should do himself and the G.O.P. a favor by dropping out of the race.","3165","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"That’s laying it on thick. Bush kept his cool, and his campaign is right when it says that this contest is a marathon. But when your best-received line is “I’m seven-and-oh in my fantasy-football league,” in response to a question about whether fantasy sports is gambling, the night can only be classified as another disappointment. Rubio, on the other hand, went on to deliver several more zingers. In a debate in which most of the candidates seemed at least as intent on attacking the media as the Democrats, he also managed to link together the G.O.P.’s two main demons.","3166","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Picking up on a comment from Donald Trump about super PACs, Rubio said, “The Democrats have the ultimate super PAC. It is called the mainstream media.” With that, he went into a little spiel about the favorable coverage that Hillary Clinton’s appearance before the Benghazi committee received, claiming, “It was the week she got exposed as a liar”—a reference to public statements Clinton made linking the attack on U.S. installations in Libya with an anti-Muslim video. “But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.” Given the well-known antagonism between the Clinton campaign and parts of the mainstream media, including the New York Times, this was an outrageous charge, but it was one that will play well on conservative talk shows.","3167","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Another candidate who got in some radio-ready sound bites was Ted Cruz. The forty-four-year-old Texas senator received the biggest cheer of the night for a rant about the (mostly perfectly reasonable and often commendably specific) questions that the CNBC moderators were asking. “The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate. That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks,” he said. Right now, Cruz is not a major threat to Rubio, but on the basis of this debate he could eventually become one.","3168","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"The two men who are currently leading in the polls—Donald Trump and Ben Carson—both had relatively quiet nights. In the case of Carson, who has dismissed the debates as boxing matches, that may not have been a bad thing. As always, he kept calm. He parried a couple of policy questions, denied that he is a homophobe, criticized political correctness, and delivered a couple of uplifting passages about American values. Luckily for him, nobody asked him to explain his statements connecting gun control with the Holocaust. Even if someone had, it might not have made much difference. Whatever is driving Carson’s rise, it isn’t dynamism on the debating stage.","3169","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Trump disappeared for long stretches, as he did in the second debate. At one point, after he was asked how he would cut taxes by ten trillion dollars without raising the deficit, he looked lost. But he has looked lost before, and it hasn’t done him much harm. Having apparently made a strategic decision not to criticize Carson, who has passed him in one national poll, he saved his venom for John Kasich, who had the temerity to question the practicality of Trump’s desire to deport eleven million undocumented immigrants. “This was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes,” Trump told the audience. (Actually, as Kasich pointed out, although he did work for Lehman, he wasn’t a partner.)","3170","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"When Kasich wasn’t being branded an evil and incompetent Wall Streeter, he had a few effective mini-moments, as did Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, and Rand Paul.

"Rubio, on the other hand, might just be ready to do so. Standing between Trump and Bush—both large, hefty men—he appeared small in stature when the cameras panned back.

"When Republicans, and a few dozen Democrats, in Congress rose up last week to vote to make it almost impossible for Syrian refugees to enter the United States, President Barack Obama defended his decision to make America a safe haven. He accused those in favor of erecting barriers of being un-American: “Slamming the door in the face of refugees would betray our deepest values. That’s not who we are.”","November 24, 2015","3173","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/two-american-answers-to-the-refugee-question"
"It’s tempting to believe in Obama’s picture of American history, but it puts something of a rosy gloss on the facts. At several key moments, slamming the door on vulnerable outsiders is precisely what the United States has done.

"The most notorious example of American hostility to vulnerable outsiders came on the eve of the Second World War, when the U.S. government refused to admit many Jewish refugees from Hitler. The voyage of the ship called the St. Louis, which left Hamburg on May 13, 1939, with nine hundred and thirty-seven mostly Jewish refugees on board, provides the most heartbreaking example of the consequences of American policy. After a stop in Cuba (which didn’t want the refugees, either), the ship was turned away from Florida when it was so close that passengers could see the lights of Miami. Back in Europe, two hundred and fifty-four of those passengers ultimately died in the Holocaust.","3175","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/two-american-answers-to-the-refugee-question"
"In cutting off the refugees, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s government was only doing what the American people wanted. A Fortune magazine poll at the time, recently highlighted on the Historical Opinion Twitter feed, indicated that eighty-five per cent of Americans opposed relaxing restrictions on Austrian, German, and other political refugees; sixty-seven per cent wanted to “try to keep them out” entirely.","3176","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/two-american-answers-to-the-refugee-question"
"During the war, the government, and the courts, turned on a different vulnerable minority. In Korematsu v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld, by a vote of six to three, the exclusion of Japanese-American citizens from much of the West Coast of the United States. As with a curfew imposed on Japanese-Americans, which the Court also upheld, the decision said that “exclusion of those of Japanese origin was deemed necessary because of the presence of an unascertained number of disloyal members of the group, most of whom we have no doubt were loyal to this country. It was because we could not reject the finding of the military authorities that it was impossible to bring about an immediate segregation of the disloyal from the loyal that we sustained the validity of the curfew order as applying to the whole group.”","3177","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/two-american-answers-to-the-refugee-question"
"Several facts stand out about the Korematsu decision. It was written by Hugo Black, a justice who otherwise had a sterling reputation as a civil libertarian. It was argued in October, 1944, and decided in December of that year—a time when America’s victory in the war in the Pacific, if not the date of Japan’s surrender, was already a foregone conclusion. There was no evidence presented that any specific Japanese-Americans presented a threat to the war effort; the Court said only that it could not evaluate any such claims if they had been made. Fear, not facts, justified the Court’s conclusion.","3178","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/two-american-answers-to-the-refugee-question"
"Nor can these examples be dismissed as ancient history. As Rick Perlstein pointed out in his 2014 book, “The Invisible Bridge,” the Vietnamese boat people, who were refugees from a war that the United States conducted, were widely despised and feared when they arrived in 1975. Perlstein quotes the famous Harvard sociologist David Riesman, who said at the time, “The national mood is poisonous and dangerous and this is one symptom—striking out at helpless refugees whose number is infinitesimal.” Sound familiar?

"This is not to say that American attitudes, and actions, have always run against refugees. In the 1975 Vietnamese crisis, for example, President Gerald Ford expressed himself in words nearly identical to those of President Obama last week. “We can afford to be generous to refugees,” Ford said, “as a matter of principle.” Many Americans (like me) can trace their ancestries to times in our history when we opened our doors to victims of famine in Ireland, pogroms in Russia, or other natural and man-made disasters. But it’s simply not the case that this kind of generosity defines “who we are.” Sometimes it does, and sometimes, like now, apparently, it doesn’t.

"Hillary Clinton’s crucial misstep in the second Democratic debate, in Des Moines on Saturday, may have come about ten minutes in. The subject was Paris, which had been attacked the night before, with more than a hundred and twenty people dead. John Dickerson, the moderator, asked Clinton if the Obama Administration, in which Clinton served, had underestimated the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack. She answered by talking generally about the various means available to defeat the group, and then said, “But it cannot be an American fight. And I think what the President has consistently said—which I agree with—is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.” Then she repeated what sounded, intentionally or not, like a renunciation: “But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.”","November 15, 2015","3181","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"“But Secretary Clinton, the question’s about what—was ISIS underestimated?” Dickerson said, trying again. This time, Clinton responded by saying, first, that “we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis, to leave”—which is true, but not really responsive—and then, after acknowledging that the situation had “developed,” added, “But I don’t think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility. I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.” There was a sensible point in there about not going in alone or pretending that America can solve everything. But Clinton had also laid out ammunition for her opponents, and the responses came from left, right, and center.","3182","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"“John, I would—I would disagree with—with Secretary Clinton, respectfully, on this score,” Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, said, jumping in. “This actually is America’s fight.” O’Malley is not exactly what Donald Trump would call “a killer” (“No dollar too small,” he said in his closing statement, after reminding the audience of his Web site), but he knew an easy hit when he saw it. A few commercial breaks later, CBS’s “back soon” promotion was an abridged video of the exchange. It was one of those moments that will likely be clipped, repeated, and distorted beyond what Clinton deserves. (If only she’d slipped an “only” in there.) And yet, in a way, the stronger response came from Bernie Sanders, from another angle entirely.","3183","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"“I think she said something like, ‘The bulk of the responsibility is not ours,’ ” Sanders said. “Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unravelled the region completely. And led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.” Clinton voted to authorize that war; he voted against it. Dickerson asked, “Are you making a direct link between her vote for that and what’s happening now for ISIS?”","3184","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"“Oh, I don’t think any—I don’t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,” Sanders said.","3185","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"In other words, Clinton had managed, in a couple of sentences, to simultaneously open herself up to the charge that she sees ISIS as someone else’s war and that she rushes into wars too readily. Those notions feel paradoxical, and yet they both feed into a critique of Clinton as someone who does not always embrace responsibility. It did not help that she replied to Sanders not by acknowledging the specific disaster of Iraq but by saying that there had been big terrorist attacks before Iraq, too—under Reagan and “when my husband was President.” Perhaps “cannot be America’s fight” was an attempt to reassure non-interventionist primary voters, but she has favored more direct military involvement in Syria, and needs to better explain that she knows what the consequences might be, rather than occluding them. In that sense, the exchange touched on a fear that Clinton is not only hawkish but hawkish in a politically opportunistic way.","3186","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"There is, and will be, quite enough politicking in this race related to the dilemmas laid bare by Paris. On Saturday, Donald Trump was at a rally in Texas, talking about how what Paris needed was more guns and fewer immigrants. He was sorry about the plight of Syrian refugees, he said, but America would be “crazy” to take more. Jeb Bush gave an interview to Hugh Hewitt, the conservative talk-show host, in which he combined a bouncing eagerness to get on a war footing (“This is not a law-enforcement operation”) with a garbled call to arms (“This is an organized effort to destroy Western civilization, and we need to lead in this regard”). Rand Paul used Paris as a way of attacking Marco Rubio for being soft on immigration. Rubio released a video in which he explained that this is a “civilizational” fight rather than a “geopolitical” one, while sitting in a leather armchair in a shadowy space, as though the place for counterterrorism is and always will be an English gentlemen’s club. It can’t be helped; there is something about a crisis of this scale that makes politicians dream of Churchill.","3187","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"That was the backdrop when the Democrats took the stage, at 9 P.M. They began with a moment of silence for the victims in Paris; all three were suitably solemn. Then came a request from Dickerson for each candidate to give a minute-long opening statement, “to share your thoughts about the attacks on Paris and lay out your vision for America.” Sanders went first and said that the attacks had left him “shocked and disgusted.” Paris got one more sentence in his opening—“Leading the world, this country will rid the planet of this barbarous group called ISIS.” Then he went straight to inequality and money in politics, ending on one of his signature phrases: “A handful of billionaires.” There were pre-debate reports that the Sanders campaign was not happy with CBS’s plans to reshape the opening around Paris; the sense among commentators beforehand was that it would play to all of Clinton’s strengths. It is puzzling that it did not.","3188","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"And, again, there was the contrast with Sanders’s theatricality: in a discussion about the limitations of the phrase “radical Islam,” Clinton got caught up in the fine print, in a way that will likely leave her open to out-of-context quoting. Sanders basically said that he wasn’t so interested in labels, and then immediately railed, with greater passion, against organizations like ISIS that think “we should go back several thousand years,” to a time when there wasn’t even a Brooklyn.","3189","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"Clinton’s answers on domestic policy were generally clearer, and more likely to serve her well in the general election—though here she was up against Sanders’s populism. (“It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids,” he said.) And yet it was in a discussion of a domestic issue that she gave what may have been her most discordant answer. Sanders had wondered why Wall Street figures and institutions would be among her biggest backers if they didn’t think they were getting something for their money—“I mean, you know, let’s not be naïve about it.” Clinton said that the answer was easy: “I represented New York on 9/11, when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan, where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.”","3190","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"Wall Street the street is, indeed, in Lower Manhattan. But Wall Street the industry is all over town, and in other towns, too. Some financial institutions were devastated, and lost many people. But the idea that the guys in the neighborhood, whom she, particularly, helped to their feet after the terrorists attacked, had just passed the hat out of gratitude was Giuliani-level 9/11 political exploitation. It felt disingenuous. And, after a night that Paris spent under siege, it felt wrong.","3191","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"On the evening of July 12, 2007, at the end of a Presidential candidates’ forum hosted by the N.A.A.C.P., in Detroit, John Edwards loped across the stage to Hillary Clinton and whispered in her ear. Her microphone, which apparently hadn’t been turned off, caught him saying something about the approaching fall, and then, more clearly, “We should try to have a more serious…smaller group.” Clinton, in a canary-yellow pantsuit, nodded, and added to the lament:","November 3, 2015","3192","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"

We’ve got to get back to it, because that’s all we’re going to do.” After a brief interruption occasioned by the passing of other candidates (“Thanks, Barack…Thanks, Dennis”), she ended with an emphatic, “Our guys should talk.”","3193","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"

"The idea that “our guys should talk” and do something—anything—to bring order to a chaotic field of candidates may hold some attraction for the Republican Party this time around. There has been amazement that the field still stands at fourteen (or sixteen, if you count broadly). When the exchange between Clinton and Edwards took place, the Democrats had eight candidates, and that seemed like a lot, even though it was four months earlier in the cycle than it is now. In thinking about why the Republicans’ numbers have somehow not been winnowed, and the possible risks in forcing that question, the Edwards-Clinton exchange is instructive, too.","3195","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"
"At the time of the forum, Clinton was in first place in the polls, with numbers in the high thirties, and Edwards was in third, polling in the teens. They were both “serious”: Clinton was a senator and a former First Lady; Edwards was a former senator and the 2004 Vice-Presidential candidate (he hadn’t yet lapsed into National Enquirer absurdity). In between them, in second place and polling in the twenties, was freshman Senator Barack Obama, followed by a single-digit panoply of Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson, Joe Biden, Chris Dodd, and, not quite registering statistically, Mike Gravel. When the hot-mic video came out, the “not serious” candidates, particularly Kucinich and Gravel, were understandably angry: there was talk among their supporters of an establishment conspiracy. Obama, though, with numbers that would put him at the top of the G.O.P. field now, wasn’t going to be brushed away.","3196","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"
"What would it mean if something like the Clinton and Edwards plan was enacted today, and the front-runners in the G.O.P. race got together and swept away the single-digit guys? Currently, only Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Marco Rubio would be in the race, with Ted Cruz almost in the running. Jeb Bush would be long gone. (Even through 2012’s odd moments, like the brief Herman Cain spike, Mitt Romney’s numbers never fell so implausibly low.) The establishment bid for seriousness seems to be to keep the field broad enough to encompass its credentialed but low-performing candidates. When several of the candidates’ guys talked this weekend about the structure of the debates, the idea was not to get a smaller group but to perpetuate a large one. (Ryan Lizza has more on those discussions, from which Trump, notably, withdrew, and which may be breaking down.) What is a “gotcha” question, after all, but an attempt to identify disqualifiers, and get the numbers down? Megyn Kelly, of Fox News, correctly characterized the candidates’ various requests for improving debates, which include giving them approval over onscreen graphics and room temperature, by asking if they also wanted “foot massages.” What they really seem to want is for someone to keep massaging the poll numbers. The idea seems to be for everyone to keep hanging on until, miraculously, the Trump-Carson dynamic fundamentally changes. But how?","3197","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"
"To say that Trump and Carson are not serious candidates is to say that the Republican electorate is not serious. And that judgment, despite the hollowness of the candidates’ ideas, is unfair in one important way. As George Packer writes in this week’s magazine, the Republican Party has failed to respond to the real concerns, fear, and even desperation on the part of many of its traditional voters. Trump’s support is the product not of frivolity but of pain. How profound that pain might be can be seen in another set of numbers, distinct from the political race, about the rising and unexpected mortality among white, middle-aged men without a college degree. They are dying more not because of obesity or heart disease but because of suicide and substance abuse—the physical manifestations of, among other things, disquiet and displacement. The numbers in the study, carried out by Princeton University economists, caught public-health professionals by surprise. If nothing else, the study shows that there are deep pools of unhappiness in this country that the experts don’t understand. Someone has to speak to that.","3198","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"
"At the 2007 forum, the Clinton and Edwards theory seemed to be that without the distractions of the fringe-candidate circus, Obama’s flimsiness would seem obvious, and voters would focus on which of the two of them they preferred. The limitations of their notion had become clear by the time it was effectively a three-person race, and they lost. (In the 2008 Iowa caucuses, Obama won thirty-eight per cent, Edwards thirty per cent, and Clinton twenty-nine.) Indeed, watching the open-mic video now, the most pertinent point is that neither Edwards nor Clinton was, ultimately, the Democratic Party’s nominee. Then and now, it can be hard to tell who is serious.","3199","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"

Children often walk unaccompanied to school, where main entrances are usually unlocked and unguarded, allowing anyone to enter.

Instead, he marched on until he found and killed a Somali-born fifteen-year-old and severely injured a recently arrived Syrian teenager, according to Swedish police.

"The attack cut right into what has been described as an identity crisis for social democratic Sweden, which has long been the top recipient of asylum seekers per capita in Europe, and has prided itself on a humanitarian approach to the current refugee crisis. Even as some of the most generous European countries, such as Germany, have taken steps to tighten asylum procedures and limit what migration experts call “the pull factor,” Sweden has left its southern border largely open and has stood by a broad interpretation of the United Nations refugee convention, accepting three out of every four asylum seekers. The lack of a coherent European system for handling asylum seekers, a breakdown of the continent’s internal and external border controls, and the recent deterioration of Afghanistan have contributed to the influx of migrants to Sweden in recent months, as has Sweden’s policy, unique in Europe, of extending permanent residency to Syrians applying for asylum.","3205","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-attack-and-an-identity-crisis-in-sweden"
"In a rather homogenous country of only nine and a half million people, fourteen per cent of the population is now foreign-born, and the number is expected to rise. The school killings occurred only hours after the government agency for migration announced that a hundred and ninety thousand asylum seekers could arrive in Sweden this year, almost triple the previous estimate and far surpassing the number of people who sought refuge in Sweden during the Balkan wars.","3206","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-attack-and-an-identity-crisis-in-sweden"
"The ongoing arrival of about fifteen hundred asylum seekers each day has already caused a domestic political crisis. More than a dozen asylum centers have been set on fire in recent months, and the Sweden Democrats, a populist anti-immigrant party, have been rapidly gaining popularity, according to recent polls. The weak green-left coalition government has been forced to reënter negotiations over immigration with the center-right opposition, agreeing to some compromises in order to retain control. On Thursday, when the school attack occurred, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven abruptly left those talks to speak to victims and their families in Trollhättan.","3207","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-attack-and-an-identity-crisis-in-sweden"
"The Swedish historian Lars Trägårdh perhaps best described the situation when he told Swedish Radio last week that the country is experiencing a clash of ideals. The traditional Swedish ideal and self-image have revolved around a pride in and recognition of the nation-state, where citizens work hard and pay taxes. But a more recently developed Swedish ideal, held by many, has more of a universal human-rights focus that sometimes places the instinct to help as many refugees as possible ahead of the traditional priorities of a nation-state, such as securing high employment levels, insuring housing and social welfare for existing citizens, and protecting its borders.","3208","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-attack-and-an-identity-crisis-in-sweden"
"With its large foreign-aid contributions, its stated feminist foreign policy, as well as the open door to migrants and refugees, the Swedish government likes to boast about being a “humanitarian superpower.” That self-image—and, understandably, the discomfort around having an openly anti-immigrant party in parliament—has unfortunately caused Swedish politicians across the spectrum to, until recently, largely avoid debate around the sensitive issue of immigration, and whether there may be limits to what Sweden can handle, out of fear of being accused of aligning themselves with the far right.","3209","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-attack-and-an-identity-crisis-in-sweden"
"Now the country will also have to process the trauma of what may ultimately be labelled an act of domestic terrorism. Certainly, there will be calls for increased openness and tolerance, to powerfully manifest against racism, xenophobia, and hatred, along the lines of Norway’s Jens Stoltenberg’s bold approach to the Breivik attacks. But there will also be those who say that the small, wealthy nation needs to take a more cautious approach to immigration, in order to preserve its citizens’ faith in the traditional social contract while maintaining a strong humanitarian ideal. What the U.N.H.C.R. calls the largest refugee crisis of all time may also be Sweden’s most painful and complicated political struggle in the next decade, and a very personal one for many Swedes.","3210","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-attack-and-an-identity-crisis-in-sweden"
"Political parties are rarely suicidal in Presidential campaigns. While it’s not uncommon for a party to nominate an unelectable candidate in a Senate or House election, the Presidential nominating systems used by both Democrats and Republicans only occasionally produce a fringe candidate. The last time that the Republican Party truly misfired was in 1964, when it nominated Barry Goldwater, who lost forty-four states in the general election. On the Democratic side, the last time the party produced a fringe candidate was in 1972, when George McGovern, who took advantage of new nominating rules that he had helped to write, lost forty-nine states.","October 28, 2015","3211","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"

"Ever since June, when Trump announced his candidacy, the conventional wisdom among G.O.P. and media élites has been that Trump was a soufflé candidate who would collapse just like fringe outsiders in previous contests, such as Herman Cain, in 2012.

"In August, Norm Ornstein, a longtime and well-regarded political observer, made the most comprehensive argument that Trump could prevail. Ornstein pointed to several factors: a conservative media that has fostered a deeper anti-establishment sentiment among G.O.P. voters, who are less likely to get news from outside an ideological bubble; a more extreme G.O.P. electorate, especially on the issue of immigration; the absence of a consensus establishment alternative to Trump; the emergence of Super PACs, which might encourage the traditional candidates to stay in the race longer and divide up the non-Trump vote; and the fact that Trump is “a far more savvy candidate” than Cain and the like.","3214","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"More recently, Alex Castellanos, who worked for Mitt Romney, echoed Ornstein’s arguments, and wrote, “Slow learner that I am, I’ve resisted the idea that Donald Trump could and would become the Republican nominee. Unhappily, I’ve changed my mind.” Steve Schmidt, a veteran of John McCain’s 2008 campaign, has repeatedly argued that Trump could win. Ron Fournier, the National Journal columnist, said in June that Trump “won’t win the G.O.P. nomination,” but this week he changed his mind and wrote, “I was wrong to rule out Trump winning the nomination or the presidency.”","3215","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"

"The overwhelming majority of Republican voters have repeatedly told pollsters this year that, whatever their choice in any given poll, they haven’t made up their minds yet. Most won’t think hard about their decision for at least another three months. At this point in 2008, Rudy Giuliani was the polling leader. In 2012, it was Cain.

"That’s why, despite Bush’s obvious troubles this year, it makes no sense for him to drop out of the race while he still has money in the bank and a very flush Super PAC financing an advertising blitz on his behalf. The most likely scenario remains that the G.O.P. will eventually coalesce around the most conservative candidate who is electable. Bush seems less and less likely to be that person, not because of Trump but because someone like Marco Rubio seems more conservative and more electable.","3220","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"While the G.O.P.’s rightward lurch is well-documented, the influence of the most conservative voters in Republican primaries is frequently overstated. Last year Henry Olsen, writing in the National Interest, dissected the Republican electorate and explained that it is divided into four groups: “moderate or liberal voters; somewhat conservative voters; very conservative, evangelical voters; and very conservative, secular voters.” His surprising argument was that, while most of the media coverage focusses on the latter two groups, which are louder and often more interesting to cover, it is the candidate who wins over the “somewhat conservative voters” who has the best shot at the nomination:","3221","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"While Trump often talks about the silent majority he is awakening, his actual supporters come from the G.O.P.’s noisy minority. The true silent majority in the Republican Party hasn’t picked its candidate yet. As Olsen makes clear, the G.O.P. Presidential electorate is little different from four years ago. Super PACs have not been able to save the candidacies of Rick Perry or Scott Walker, so the traditional process that winnows the field of unfunded candidates continues apace.

"It came when Bush fumblingly tried a maneuver that he and his advisers had obviously planned—and that Rubio and his had obviously anticipated. The plan was for Bush to slam his former Florida protégé as a shirker and a grifter, the proof being that he has been running around the country campaigning for President instead of dutifully staying in Washington to vote on bills and “do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.” Here’s Bush, delivering what was no doubt supposed to be the coup de grâce:","3225","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

Really, though—isn’t it time to retire this stupid talking point, which gets trotted out every time a member of the United States Senate has the temerity to run for President? It was used against Senator Barack Obama, whose floor-vote-missing tally was slightly worse than Rubio’s. It was used against—speaking of France!—Senator John Kerry, whose absenteeism in 2004 was worse still. More to the point, it was used against Senator John McCain, who missed three-fifths of the votes the Senate took while he was a candidate in the 2008 campaign. Rubio, for his part, has skipped about a third of this year’s roll-call votes, and almost half of those taken since April, when he announced his candidacy. Which raises two questions. So what?

Over the last few weeks, I’ve listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you’re modelling your campaign after John McCain, that you’re going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.

"“Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you”—that was the saber thrust that won Rubio both ears, the tail, and the debate.

Any given senator is only one per cent of the Senate, and the institution can function, or dysfunction, quite normally in his or her absence. Any given governor is a hundred per cent of his state’s supreme executive authority. Senators, like Presidents, deal mainly with national matters.

The Upshot concludes that “Mr. Cruz’s debate style is much more complicated than that of his fellow Republican candidates, close to works like Beowulf and Don Quixote.” Beelzebub and Don Knotts is closer to the mark, but the oleaginous Texan is inarguably erudite.","3237","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"There was a time—how often has this sentence been written?—when the Republican Party stood for certain ideas, even if they sometimes contradicted each other: for instance, antipathy toward high marginal tax rates and a belief in balanced budgets. On issues involving national security and economic emergencies, many were willing to entertain, and even seek, coöperation from Democrats, as happened after the financial collapse of 2008. It was the approach taken by our postwar (or post-New Deal) Republican Presidents, up to and including George W. Bush, even if the party went through occasional ideological swerves, as when it nominated the sometimes alarming conservative Arizona senator Barry Goldwater, in 1964.

"The emergence of the Republican Class of ’16 may be changing the shape of historic Republicanism once and for all. Part of it stems from the “outsiders”—Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina, who have never held elective office and probably never will. But no one better embodies this change than the freshman Texas senator Ted Cruz, who seems unable to stop talking, although the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, recently outsmarted him, as Politico’s Burgess Everett put it, by effectively putting him in party “quarantine.” (McConnell, like past Senate leaders such as Howard Baker and Bob Dole, has the job here of representing the sanity wing of the party.) Cruz, though, knows where to find receptive audiences, as when he recently spoke to the conservative religious Values Voter Summit, in Washington, and went on to win the group’s straw poll, for the third year in a row. (Cruz got thirty-five per cent, followed by Carson, at eighteen per cent, and Mike Huckabee, the perennial champion of his own values, at fourteen per cent.)","3249","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Cruz still surprises. Just when you think he can’t go any further, he goes further. Considering the venue, you can understand why he got an appreciative laugh at the “Values” meeting when he mentioned Xi Jinping’s meeting with President Obama and said, “Media all across the world are reporting on this historic meeting of the world’s most powerful Communist, and the President of China.” (Drum roll.) But his ear has difficulty recognizing the proper key. A few days after Vice-President Joe Biden’s son Beau died, of a brain tumor, Cruz was having his fun: “Joe Biden … You know what the nice thing is? You don’t even need a punch line. I promise you, it works. At the next party you’re at, just walk up to someone and say, ‘Vice-President Joe Biden,’ and just close your mouth. They will crack up laughing.” That wasn’t nearly as funny as the Obama-is-a-big-Communist gag, and perhaps that’s why Cruz offered an apology.","3250","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"On foreign policy, Cruz is even less funny, as when he dilated on the Iran nuclear deal: “If you vote for me, under no circumstances will a nation led by a theocratic Ayatollah, who chants ‘Death to America,’ under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.” So far, that is pretty much what Obama says. Cruz, though, added, “If the Ayatollah doesn’t understand that, we may have to introduce him to his seventy-two virgins,” which sounded very much like a threat to murder Iran’s Supreme Leader. Cruz did not approve of recent Supreme Court decisions that upheld the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage. His solution, as he told Steve Inskeep, of NPR’s “Morning Edition,” is a constitutional amendment—“one that would make members of the Supreme Court subject to periodic judicial retention elections … [so that] if judges overstep their bounds, violate the Constitution, then the people have a check to remove them from office.” This was an attack on a branch of government far more radical than Franklin D. Roosevelt’s infamous “court packing” scheme, in 1937, to add as many as six members when Justices reached age seventy and didn’t retire.","3251","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Sounding mean-spirited and over the top is nothing new in American politics. Senator Joseph McCarthy, to whom Cruz bears a slight physical resemblance (it’s the eyebrows), made use of the Red Scare to attack Democrats. McCarthy, like Louisiana’s Huey Long, belonged to a subcategory of demagogic, disruptive senators, a role that suits Cruz perfectly. McCarthy never ran for President.","3252","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Cruz’s thoughts and language bring to mind the 1993 American Scholar essay “Defining Deviancy Down,” by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (though not Moynihan himself). In it, Moynihan writes, “I proffer the thesis that, over the past generation … the amount of deviant behavior in American society has increased beyond the levels the community can ‘afford to recognize’ and that, accordingly, we have been re-defining deviancy so as to exempt much conduct previously stigmatized, and also quietly raising the ‘normal’ level in categories where behavior is now abnormal by any earlier standard.” Moynihan was writing about crime and antisocial behavior in general, but the change in standards might just as well apply to politics. That someone like Ted Cruz is running for President, and taken seriously—that nearly sixty per cent of Republicans now support, in aggregate, Trump, Fiorina, Carson, and Cruz—suggests that the modern Republican Party is close to “defining politics down.” With more than a year to go before the next Presidential election, Cruz may be posing the essential question: “How far down?”","3253","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"

The President added, “This comes at a time when we see the strength of American leadership across the world. We’ve taken out Al Qaeda leaders, and we’ve put them on the path to defeat.

Nevertheless, he went on to say, “I cannot help asking those who have caused this situation, Do you realize now what you’ve done?” He didn’t expect an answer, he said, but he made it plain that, in Syria, you have to take sides. “We think it is an enormous mistake to refuse to coöperate with the Syrian government and its armed forces, who are valiantly fighting terrorism face to face,” Putin said, and, with blunt contempt for the Obama Administration’s failed effort to muster an independent, democratic Syrian resistance force, he added, “We should finally acknowledge that no one but President Assad’s armed forces and Kurdish militias are truly fighting the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria.” On the contrary, Putin insinuated, the Americans were trying to work with some of those other terrorist groups, and he warned, “They are just as clever as you are, and you never know who is manipulating whom.”","3259","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-new-world-disorder-comment-philip-gourevitch"
"It is not surprising that the Obama-Putin contretemps was widely reported as a duel. The two Presidents do not suffer each other gladly, and it was impossible to parse all the overlapping and coded agendas in their speeches. And yet, for all their sparring, there was an undercurrent of common cause in their pronouncements on Syria. Putin was plainly seeking to reassert Russia’s position as a power broker in the Middle East, and Obama made no move to block him.","3260","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-new-world-disorder-comment-philip-gourevitch"
"The President has preferred to pay the price of doing too little in Syria, rather than too much. It would be easy to blame him for that, if one could forget about Libya and Iraq, to say nothing of the fact that, last week, the Taliban captured a major city in Afghanistan for the first time since the United States installed the current regime in Kabul, fourteen years ago. Obama did tell the U.N. that he was prepared to put the fight against isis ahead of the fight against Assad, and to work with Russia and Iran to that end, as long as those nations worked to help ease Assad out. That seemed a minor concession, and one couldn’t help wondering why more than two hundred thousand Syrians had died before it could be offered. Then, the next day, Russian planes began bombing an assortment of targets around Syria, and the death toll rose again. ♦","3261","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-new-world-disorder-comment-philip-gourevitch"
"The big post-debate story is about the media. CNBC is being pilloried by Republicans for the way it conducted last night’s event, in Boulder, Colorado. “CNBC should be ashamed of themselves,” Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, wrote in an e-mail to supporters. “Let’s put the mainstream media on notice. I want to send a message to moderators of upcoming debates that any bias won’t be tolerated.” Rand Paul, who was once the darling of the mainstream media and celebrated as a top-tier Republican candidate, but who has been a non-entity in the Presidential campaign, used the anti-CNBC backlash to raise money. He changed his Twitter avatar to a picture of the senator with a black rectangle over his mouth and the word CENSORED across it. “Fight back against the media bias” was superimposed on the new photo.","October 29, 2015","3262","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/yes-marco-rubios-finances-are-a-big-deal"
"Whining about tough questions and media bias is an old campaign tactic. On both the right and the left, there are now well-funded institutions that do nothing but scour the Internet, TV, and radio for perceived slights from the press. The CNBC journalists are public figures who surely know that getting beaten up by partisans comes with the job of covering American politics. And, of course, just because accusations of bias or unfairness come from the R.N.C. and the G.O.P.

The Times also reported that “Rubio billed the party for more than $100,000 during the two years he served as the state’s House speaker,” and that “charges included repairs to the family minivan, grocery bills, plane tickets for his wife, and purchases from retailers ranging from a wine store near his home to Apple’s online store.” (Rubio said that the expenses were all related to party business.)","3271","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/yes-marco-rubios-finances-are-a-big-deal"

And also on Friday, A.F.S.C.M.E., the largest public-sector union in the country, announced that it was endorsing Clinton for the Presidency—an important win in her tussle with Senator Bernie Sanders for the backing of organized labor.","October 25, 2015","3273","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Meanwhile, the campaign of the supposed Republican front-runner, Jeb Bush, was letting it be known that it was laying off people and slashing its payroll by forty per cent. It’s well known that the Bush campaign has been spending heavily, and there have been persistent rumors that, with the candidate trailing badly in the polls, its fund-raising efforts had stalled. Evidently, these rumors were accurate. Seeking to put a positive spin on things, the Bush campaign portrayed the cost-cutting as an effort to play the long game and direct resources toward the early primary states—Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. “This is about winning the race,” a Bush adviser told Bloomberg Politics. “We’re doing it now and making the shifts with confidence. We expect to win.”","3274","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Campaign advisers have to make such statements. But many people in the G.O.P. are losing confidence in Bush. A new poll from Iowa, which was released on Thursday, showed the former Florida governor garnering just five per cent of the votes among likely Republican voters. Perhaps the poll, from Quinnipiac University, was an outlier? No, it wasn’t. On Friday, another Iowa survey, this one carried out by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics, also showed Bush at just five per cent. “By any honest analysis, the first ten months of this year have been a political disaster,” a senior Republican told the Times, adding that it was “an unbelievable position to be twisted into, from ‘shock and awe’ to ‘aw, shucks.’ ”","3275","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Why is the Republican pre-race favorite doing so much worse than the Democratic favorite?","3276","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The obvious answer is that Bush has had Donald Trump to deal with, and Clinton hasn’t. In virtually monopolizing media coverage and subjecting Bush to months of public criticism, the New York billionaire has transformed the dynamics of the G.O.P. race in a way that almost nobody anticipated—a point the managers of the Bush campaign acknowledged in an internal memo announcing the cost cuts. “We would be less than forthcoming if we said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer health care and partial-birth abortion would be leading the G.O.P. primary,” the memo said.","3277","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"With Bush’s campaign having been outpaced in such outrageous fashion, it is hard not to feel a little sympathy for him. However, his problems can’t be entirely attributed to the Donald. According to the Real Clear Politics poll average, he’s also running behind Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz, and nationwide he has the support of just 7.2 per cent of likely Republican voters. For a candidate whose main selling point was supposed to be his electability, these are terrible numbers. On the Democratic side, Clinton, even at the height of concerns about her e-mail server, maintained a healthy lead in the national polls.","3278","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"In part, Bush’s weak numbers reflect the fact he has run a weak campaign—one dogged by his tendency to mangle the English language, or, at least, to use it carelessly. In his first big speech, back in February, he confused Iran with Iraq and got mixed up about how many fighters the Islamic State has. Since then, the list of phrases he has been forced to clarify or disavow is long and embarrassing: “People need to work longer hours”; “I’m not sure we need half a billion dollars on women’s health-care issues”; “anchor babies”; “stuff happens.” On the basis of what we’ve seen so far, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Bush simply isn’t a good communicator. Indeed, he often appears to be a terrible one. Asked on Saturday whether his campaign’s cost-cutting showed it was in crisis, he said, “Blah, blah, blah. That’s my answer: blah, blah, blah.”","3279","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"If Bush were wowing the world with innovative and substantive policy proposals, his verbal shortcomings could perhaps be overlooked. But he isn’t. His tax-cutting economic plan, which he claims will increase G.D.P. growth to four per cent a year, is largely based on wishful thinking. His foreign-policy speeches are so vague that they’re hard to evaluate. On social issues, such as guns and abortion, he has said little to distinguish himself from the G.O.P. pack. In 2000, his brother George ran on the platform of “compassionate Conservatism,” which was his way of distinguishing himself from Newt Gingrich and other Republican bomb throwers. Jeb’s only memorable slogan is “Jeb!”","3280","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Clinton, on the other hand, has made it clear that she is running as a progressive candidate; in the first Democratic debate, she defined herself as “a progressive who believes in getting things done.” To back up this talk, she has rolled out a series of proposals, including paid sick leave, expanded child care for preschoolers, a higher minimum wage, tax breaks for firms that promote employee share ownership, and a series of measures designed to make college more affordable. None of the things she has proposed is particularly radical, but taken together they amount to a concerted effort to tackle wage stagnation and boost the middle class.","3281","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Bush has nothing comparable to offer. And, even if he improved as a communicator and Trump dropped out of the race, there would be no assurance that he would win the nomination. Indeed, it now appears possible that his entire campaign is based on two false premises.","3282","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The first is that Republican voters want a shift to the center. The one area where Bush has issued a proposal that separates him from other Republican candidates is immigration. To his credit, he has stuck to the position that law-abiding undocumented immigrants should be given the opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship. About all that has done is win him the enmity of conservative pundits and talk-show hosts, who accuse him of promoting an “amnesty.” On this issue, most Republican voters agree with Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Polls consistently show that a majority favor the mass deportation of undocumented aliens—an issue Trump has built his candidacy on.","3283","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The second shaky premise is the notion that Republicans are keen on restoring the Bush dynasty. From the beginning, this seemed like a dubious proposition: never in its history has America had three Presidents from the same family. When Jeb entered the race, G.O.P. supporters were being asked to embrace the possibility of three Bush Presidents in thirty years.","3284","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"In its eagerness to promote someone it considered electable, the G.O.P. establishment sought to play down the dynastic aspect of Bush’s candidacy, portraying Jeb as very different from his elder brother: more thoughtful, more conservative, more articulate. Despite these efforts, no groundswell of support emerged for a Bush restoration. Indeed, it now appears that Barbara Bush, Jeb’s mother, spoke for many Republicans when she said, in April, 2013, “There are other people out there that are very qualified, and we’ve had enough Bushes.”","3285","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The Clinton campaign raises dynastic issues of its own, but there are important differences. As evidenced by the Adams, the Harrisons, and the Roosevelts, the idea of having two Presidents from the same family isn’t alien to the American tradition (even though the Roosevelts were only fifth cousins). And, in serving as a U.S. senator and as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has established credentials independent of her husband’s time in office. At the same time, it’s also important to note that Bill Clinton’s Presidency is far more popular among Democrats than George W. Bush’s Presidency is among Republicans. Some left-leaning Democrats may regard Bill Clinton’s Administration as a neo-liberal sellout, but most associate it with peace, prosperity, and the ability to outlast Republican attacks.","3286","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Even among Republicans, the last Bush Presidency inspires few fond feelings. It ended with the economy in recession, and with the U.S. military trapped in two costly and unwinnable-seeming wars. For a time, Jeb and his establishment backers pretended they could sustain a 2016 campaign that ignored this toxic legacy, but, once Trump entered the race, the strategy proved unsustainable. In portraying the Iraq war as a disaster and repeatedly tying Jeb to his elder brother, Trump forced Republicans to confront the question of why anybody would think that putting another Bush in the White House was a good idea.","3287","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"There are still more than three months to go before the G.O.P. Iowa caucus, but, if Bush is going to reëmerge as the front-runner, he’ll have to do a much better job of answering Trump’s charges. He’ll get his first opportunity this week, at the Republican debate in Boulder, Colorado. When the pressure was on these past two weeks, at the first Democratic debate and then at the Benghazi hearing, Clinton rose to the occasion and gave her campaign a huge boost. Now it’s Bush’s turn. “Jeb really needs a knockout performance—it needs to be all him, with nobody even close,” a New Hampshire Republican told Politico. “Otherwise those fumes he’s on are going to evaporate even quicker.”","3288","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"

The second of twelve children, he grew up in a modest two-bedroom house in Cincinnati. (He and his siblings took the bedrooms; his parents slept on a sofa bed.) From a young age, he helped out in the family’s bar, Andy’s Café, which his grandfather founded, in 1938, and his father ran for forty-five years. After being discharged from the United States Navy with a bad back, Boehner took seven years to work his way through Xavier University, getting a bachelor’s degree in business administration.

The partial shutdown, which began in October, lasted sixteen days, and, sure enough, Congress’s approval ratings fell into single digits. A couple of months later, when conservative groups started causing more trouble, once again over the budget, Boehner finally lashed out publicly, calling them “ridiculous” and saying, “They pushed us into this fight to defund Obamacare and to shut down the government. Most of you know, my members know, that wasn’t exactly the strategy that I had in mind.”","3315","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"Boehner soldiered on, easily winning reëlection as Speaker in January of this year. But, as his sixty-sixth birthday approached, he was facing yet another conservative push for a shutdown, this time over the funding of Planned Parenthood. Some Republican representatives were also agitating for another effort to overthrow him. This time, evidently, Boehner didn’t have the stomach for another fight.","3316","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"He waited to oversee the Pope’s address to a joint session of Congress, which had taken place at his invitation, and during which he wiped tears from his eyes. (That wasn’t the first time he had cried in public. Following his tearful “60 Minutes” appearance, he earned the nickname “Weeper of the House.”) On Friday morning, he told his colleagues that, on October 30th, he would resign as both Speaker and as congressman. According to the Times, he blamed the ultra-conservative members of his caucus, whom he accused of being unwilling to govern.","3317","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"Boehner’s resignation makes a shutdown less likely: freed of the obligation to pander to the right, he and his colleagues in the G.O.P. leadership will probably push through a funding bill with Democratic support next week. But the larger question of where the party is headed remains open. The early favorite to succeed Boehner is Kevin McCarthy, a Californian Republican who is currently the House majority leader. Although some conservatives regard McCarthy with suspicion, they also see him as someone who is more willing than Boehner to take account of their views.","3318","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"Whoever becomes the next Speaker will have no choice but to deal with the zealots, a task that often drove Boehner to seek assistance from a higher authority. “I pray from the moment I wake up. I may pray all day long,” he told NBC’s Brian Williams in 2011. At a press conference on Friday afternoon, he told reporters that he had said his prayers in the morning, as usual, “And I said, ‘Today I’m going to do this,’ and that was that.” Who could blame him?","3319","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"Late one night in January, 2005, Carly Fiorina sat in a hotel room in Davos, Switzerland, where she was attending the World Economic Forum, in a state of angry dismay. She was the C.E.O. of Hewlett-Packard, and she believed that, in an effort to undermine her, members of the board were leaking confidential information about the company to the press. She had instructed lawyers to question all the members, so that they could “come clean.” Now, on a conference call, they still denied the leaking. Two weeks later, the board fired her. As she writes in “Rising to the Challenge,” her latest memoir, “Fearing for their positions, they behaved in an unprincipled fashion and ousted me from mine.”","3320","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-heart-of-the-deal"
"Others have portrayed events differently, attributing Fiorina’s termination to unhappiness over H.P.’s merger with Compaq. She had sold the deal brilliantly, amid a bitter proxy fight, but the execution was badly managed, and the value of the stock fell. All this might have been of interest solely to business-school case writers had not Fiorina unexpectedly risen to the top tier of Republican Presidential contenders, joining the two other non-politicians in the race, Donald Trump and Ben Carson. In G.O.P. circles, she is being greeted as a savior of, if not the Party’s electoral prospects, its sanity—as someone who might allow the focus to return to candidates like Jeb Bush. It’s an awkward space, at the intersection of outsiderdom and fear of the Donald, but, for the moment, Fiorina has claimed it.","3321","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-heart-of-the-deal"
"“It’s only in this country that you can go from being a secretary to the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world,” she told Jimmy Fallon, on “The Tonight Show,” last week. “Wow,” Fallon said. “It’s unbelievable.” It’s also, as with much that Fiorina says, a little more complicated than that. In 1976, Cara Carleton Sneed graduated from Stanford, where her father had been a law professor. (He later served in the Nixon Administration and on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.) She enrolled in law school at U.C.L.A. but dropped out. She worked briefly in a real-estate firm as a receptionist, then got married, moved to Italy for a while, and returned to attend business school in Maryland, after which, Stanford degree and M.B.A. in hand, she was hired as a management trainee at A. T. & T. That was where she met her second husband, Frank Fiorina, a mid-level executive.","3322","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-heart-of-the-deal"
"She quickly became known as a sales prodigy, a reputation that grew when she became a division chief at Lucent, a company formed from A. T. & T.’s telecommunications-equipment business. Some of the deals she closed were, in fact, unbelievable. In 1999, Lucent said that a little-known firm called PathNet would buy as much as two billion dollars’ worth of its equipment. As Fortune noted later, PathNet’s annual revenues were only $1.6 million; Lucent would loan it money for the sale, which was unlikely to be repaid. But by the time such dubious accounting became public, leading to a collapse of Lucent’s stock, Fiorina, who was never accused of wrongdoing, had left for H.P., with a signing bonus worth sixty-eight million dollars and millions more in pay. When H.P. fired her, she got a twenty-million-dollar severance package, plus fifteen thousand dollars for career counselling. Only in this country, perhaps, could a C.E.O. receive compensation worth more than a hundred million dollars in six years, get fired, and use the money to enter politics.","3323","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-heart-of-the-deal"
"Fiorina’s first run for office, in the 2010 U.S. Senate race in California, is best remembered for an Internet ad, produced by her campaign, that portrayed her primary opponent as a demon sheep with glowing red eyes. She won the nomination, then, in the general election, produced a video showing the Democratic incumbent, Barbara Boxer, as a swollen disembodied head. In the current primary campaign, Fiorina has been the target of some misogyny, particularly from Trump, so it is instructive to contrast her dignified response to his comments about her face and her voice—“I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said”—to the use, in her anti-Boxer ad, of footage of fingernails scraping a chalkboard. (Boxer responded with an ad noting that Fiorina had fired thirty thousand employees at H.P., and she won by a million votes.) It is a contradiction that Fiorina seems to revel in; in her memoir, she decries sexism and, in the next paragraph, rejects the “feminist movement” as “politicized” and “captured by a left-wing agenda.”","3324","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-heart-of-the-deal"
"For Fiorina, the center of that agenda is reproductive rights, or, as she puts it, the “butchery” of abortion. In the most recent G.O.P. debate, she called for the defunding of Planned Parenthood and dared President Obama to look at an undercover video about the organization, made by an anti-abortion group: “Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, ‘We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.’ ” There are graphic segments in the video, but it does not show what Fiorina described. Yet, when Chris Wallace, of Fox News, asked her to acknowledge that “there is no actual footage of the incident,” Fiorina replied, “No, I don’t accept that.”","3325","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-heart-of-the-deal"
"As a campaigner, she is more adept than Trump at pivoting from blunt personal attacks to confident policy proposals that tend to be described as “crisp”—full of details, if not facts. Of the Affordable Care Act, she says, “What you see is emergency-room visits are up over fifty per cent.” (There is no apparent source for this number.) As an executive, she can “read the fine print” of the science on climate change, which, according to her, shows that there’s nothing the U.S. can do about it. California’s drought, she contends, is a “man-made disaster,” not because of climate change but because “liberal” politicians, worried about fish, prevented the state from building dams. “That’s pretty dumb,” she told Chuck Todd. (One of those conservation-minded politicians was Ronald Reagan.) Businesspeople, she says, are “accountable.” Politicians are not.","3326","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-heart-of-the-deal"
"And yet Fiorina defends her record at H.P. with numbers that are often muddled (pointing to revenues instead of profits) or opaque (“We tripled innovation”). If Trump’s success is a testament to brash celebrity, Fiorina’s signals the power of content-blind marketing, at least in the short term. In recent years, H.P. has gone through so many changes that it’s hard to tease out what her effect on its long-term prospects has been. (Meg Whitman, the current C.E.O., recently announced that the firm would split, cutting up to thirty thousand jobs.) In the unsettled period after Fiorina’s departure, Fortune reported, employees sometimes ignored managers’ instructions, a maneuver they called “flipping the bozo bit.” It sounds like a G.O.P. code name for a Trump-removal operation. If Fiorina closes that deal, what’s next? ♦","3327","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-heart-of-the-deal"
"The photographs in the series “Hundred Times the Difference,” by the photographer Moa Karlberg, capture, in closeup, the faces of women in the final stages of giving birth. Across the images, there is a range of expressions: grit and sensuality, trepidation and expectation, pain and elation. But in their intimate perspective the photographs emphasize the women’s shared experience—the inward focus and physical determination in their final, transformative moments of becoming mothers.","September 22, 2015","3328","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/giving-birth-in-different-worlds"
"If you look closely, though, you’ll see signs—the sterile white backgrounds in some photos and patterned fabric in others; a single acupuncture pin in the center of a forehead—that the women in Karlberg’s photographs are having drastically different experiences of giving birth. Half of the pictures were taken in Sweden and half in Tanzania. In the former country, almost all births take place in hospitals, where women have access to supportive midwives who are backed by sophisticated medical technology when needed. In Tanzania, by contrast, only half of births take place in medical facilities, and those that do often occur in places that lack even the most basic amenities.","3329","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/giving-birth-in-different-worlds"
"In a statement about the project, Karlberg, a native of Sweden who travelled to Tanzania in June, with support from the International Women’s Media Foundation, describes the disparity between the scenes she witnessed in the two places. In her home country, “The woman about to give birth is lying on the public hospital’s white sheets. . . . Next to her is her husband, stroking her back, talking to her supportively, helping her to focus on her breathing. Low music comes from the speakers. Water and juice is on the table next to the height-adjustable bed. The woman has her own room and her own bathroom with a tub. Painkillers are available upon request.” In Tanzania, “the woman about to give birth is lying on a bare, rusty bunk, covered in fabrics she brought with her. The water tap is not working, and even if it was, the water would not be drinkable. If she has to urinate there is a bucket on the floor. There is no family member by her side, but three other women, on similar bunks and in various stages of labor, share the room. As they moan, the nurses tell them to be quiet. Since there are no painkillers, the women need to save their strength for the pushing in the end.” As a result of these extreme disparities, and the corresponding difference in the ability to deal with medical complications, the risk of dying during childbirth in Tanzania is a hundred times higher than it is in Sweden.","3330","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/giving-birth-in-different-worlds"
"But despite this cross-national chasm in maternal health, simple explanations of the West-as-best and modernization-as-cure are insufficient. As Karlberg hints in the photo shown in the final slide above—a woman originally from Uganda, giving birth in Sweden—Sweden has experienced a wave of immigrants over the past four decades, many of them refugees from conflict-torn places like Iraq, Eritrea, Somalia, and now Syria. Though Sweden has proved more welcoming than other European nations in the current refugee crisis, the country’s government—influenced by the far-right Swedish Democrats, who received support from one out of every eight voters in the 2014 parliamentary elections—has grown more nativist and stingy about its welfare state. In Tanzania, meanwhile, maternal-mortality rates have improved slightly in recent years as the country has experienced impressive economic growth and extensive foreign aid, but the rates today are the same as they were sixty years ago. In both countries, birth attendants, who are almost all women, are underpaid and overworked.","3331","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/giving-birth-in-different-worlds"
"In Karlberg’s stark photographs, these many inequities seem simultaneously highlighted and erased. Her stunning, unembellished mothers-to-be seem to triumph in ways independent of their immediate surroundings, and notwithstanding the obstacles to empowerment that extend across racial, ethnic, and national lines. Yet the obstacles remain.","3332","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/giving-birth-in-different-worlds"
"The mainstream reaction to the forced resignation of John Boehner as the Speaker of the House has been a kind of weary admiration. He fought the good fight against the extremists in his Republican caucus, the narrative goes, but his solid Midwestern virtues (he’s from Ohio) were ultimately no contest for the extremism of the Tea Party. This interpretation is far too generous to Boehner, whose failures, political and substantive, were due mostly to cowardice. The tragedy of Boehner is that he could have been a great Speaker, even on his own terms, but instead his legacy is one of almost complete failure.","September 29, 2015","3333","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"Boehner long made it clear that he was a dedicated party man, who believed that what was good for the G.O.P. was good for the country as well. This is how the issue of comprehensive immigration reform came to be the true crucible of his speakership. Following President Obama’s reëlection, in 2012, it was clear that Republicans had to try to appeal to Hispanic voters. In March of 2013, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, released a report saying that the Party “must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.” In short order, many Republicans in the Senate, including such prominent figures as John McCain and Marco Rubio, did just that, and a bill which included a path to citizenship for a majority of undocumented immigrants passed by a vote of sixty-eight to thirty-two.","3334","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"Boehner also supported immigration reform, at least in its broad outlines—because he correctly saw that it was good for both his party and his country. And there was no doubt that the reform bill could pass the House, with the support of most Democrats and a substantial number of Republicans as well. But Boehner’s Tea Party colleagues in the House opposed immigration reform. So the choice for Boehner, who controlled the House floor, was clear: pass a historic bill that would be good for the Republicans and for the republic, or appease the extremist elements in his party in hopes of hanging on to his position as Speaker.","3335","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"Boehner caved, refusing to bring the bill to the floor for a vote, and he suffered the fate of all those who give in to bullies; he was bullied some more. This year, the fight was over the highway bill, another piece of popular legislation that Boehner himself and a majority of the House (as well as the Senate and the President) supported—as well they might, given that maintenance of roads and bridges represents some of the basic work of government. But again the Tea Party intimidated Boehner into keeping the bill off the floor, depriving the Speaker of another major accomplishment.","3336","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"Boehner adopted an extreme version of the so-called Hastert rule, named for his predecessor as Speaker, Dennis Hastert, who is now under indictment for alleged financial crimes connected to blackmail payments (he has pleaded not guilty). The Hastert rule holds that the Speaker should never allow a vote on a bill unless it’s supported by a majority of the Republican caucus. But Boehner’s approach was to keep bills off the floor that were opposed by a minority of Republicans—the Tea Party caucus, which only numbers about fifty—effectively giving them a veto over the work of the House. Nothing came to the floor without their say-so, so that meant that nothing much came to the floor except for symbolic exercises like votes to repeal Obamacare or to defund Planned Parenthood.","3337","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"When Boehner announced his impending departure, he expressed pride that he had kept the government open (after a sixteen-day shutdown in 2013) and raised the debt limit. This, to paraphrase a famous Republican, reflects the soft bigotry of low expectations. Keeping the government open and paying its debts are the minimal undertakings of an elected body, not legislative triumphs. But Boehner could point to almost nothing else that happened on his watch, because the Tea Party would tolerate nothing else.","3338","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"And what did Boehner’s cowardice in the face of the Tea Party stalwarts get him? They forced him out anyway. Boehner built his career around keeping his job, and he still failed. If Boehner had allowed the passage of immigration reform, it’s entirely possible that the Tea Party would have rebelled and evicted him—but at least he would have had a substantial accomplishment to his credit. Instead, Boehner tried nothing, accomplished nothing, and lost his job anyway. It’s the legacy he deserves.","3339","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"It was an unseasonably warm night in Chicago. On Tuesday, November 4, 2008, nearly a quarter of a million people—young and old, men and women of almost every racial and ethnic background—streamed into Grant Park. The crowd was peaceful and somewhat subdued, filled with a jittery anticipation about how the night would likely unfold. Shortly after 10 P.M. Central Standard Time, television networks announced that Barack Obama had been elected the forty-fourth President of the United States. For a few seconds, the crowd stood still, in a stunned silence. Then, the crowd let out a collective and euphoric scream. There was joy, relief, and disbelief. Tears flowed freely, strangers hugged for several minutes, others knelt and prayed. Senator John McCain’s concession speech put Obama’s election into its historic context by reminding Americans that just a century ago President Theodore Roosevelt had been vilified for inviting Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House. Obama’s victory speech took the high-spirited crowd even higher: “If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.” I called my cousin, who was too filled with emotion and too mystified to complete her thought: “This country . . .

"Probably not. But why not? Is the election of a black man more revolutionary than the election of a white woman? Of course, one cannot compare the moment of an election victory of one candidate to a moment during another candidate’s campaign, a year before the election. And much of the excitement about Obama derived from the dissatisfaction with the President he was replacing. But the question remains: what’s behind the shortfall of enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton?","3342","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"There are myriad reasons, and Clinton, of course, is not remotely as inspiring a speaker or campaigner as Obama. But another obvious explanation is the persistent problem of gender bias in American culture. Perhaps the sexism—in both overtly hostile and less visible but still insidious ways—has helped stoke the fires of animosity towards Clinton while, at the same time, creating an almost impossible standard for her. Unlike her male opponents, Clinton has to be far more careful and measured in what she says and does. To be free from a strict choreography of words and actions is a form of male privilege that Hillary Clinton cannot access.","3343","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"Authenticity has been a keyword during this election season. And our culture, suffused with sexism, plays the role of the arbiter of a candidate’s authenticity. Clinton must tread lightly: she cannot appear too strong without risking her likability ratings; she cannot appear too vulnerable without her credibility suffering. Herein lies Clinton’s dilemma. The Clinton campaign declared recently that Hillary would show more of what the New York Times called “humor and heart,” so she learned a popular dance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and appeared on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.” Clinton may “play the Granny card” to appear less ambitious and more friendly and family-focussed. It is hard to imagine that a man would have to do the same.","3344","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"On a more visceral level, some Americans still wince at the idea of a woman in the Oval Office. When it comes to sexism in American culture, very little has changed since the 2008 election. Indeed, things may have gotten worse. Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has continued to thrive after making unseemly comments about Fox News host Megyn Kelly and his opponent Carly Fiorina. The conservative political blog RedState maligned Clinton as proof that “even a homely woman can sleep her way into power.” Bill Maher’s suggestions for infusing some spirit into Clinton’s “joyless” campaign were not as vicious, but they were belittling nonetheless: “See if Taylor Swift has room in her girl gang for you. . . . Lick a donut with Ariana Grande. . . . Start a Twitter war with Katy Perry and then delete your tweets.” Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s opponent, summed it up: “I don’t know that a man would be treated the same way that Hillary is.” He added, “Some of it is sexist.”","3345","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"Clinton, who is regularly ribbed for her signature pants suits, has tried to defuse another issue that hounds her—her age. Recall that in 2007, when Hillary had just turned sixty, Matt Drudge printed an A.P. photo of Clinton looking fatigued, and Rush Limbaugh asked his audience, “Will this country want to actually watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis?” On Tuesday, RedState ran a piece titled simply, “Hillary: sick, elderly crook.” Degrading comments about Clinton’s age represent the most unadulterated form of sexism levelled against her. In a culture obsessed with youth, fresh-faced femininity is valued while “older” women (who may be as young as fifty) are made to feel invisible. Tira Harpaz, writing for the blog Feministing, quipped that women “have a sell by date and after that we’re pretty disposable.” In an attempt to get out ahead of the age issue, Hillary joked that she will not go gray in office as most male Presidents do, since she has been coloring her hair for years. Male candidates need not worry about coloring their hair or “growing old gracefully.”(Jeffrey Frank wrote about this today, in the context of Dwight Eisenhower’s reëlection.)","3346","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"Some of the concerns about Clinton are very personal, but even these have an element of sexism in them. Many Americans, for example, feel a pointed disaffection for her. She faces what pundits call a likability problem. Voters perceive her as competent and hardworking, but not warm. A recent series of psychology studies by Princeton professor Susan Fiske showed that women who present traditionally feminine traits (stay-at-home moms, for example) are viewed as warm, but not competent, and are treated dismissively. Women considered less traditionally feminine (including lesbians, athletes, feminists, and working women) are not thought of as warm, but are perceived to be competent, and face a more antagonistic form of sexism. Women, unlike men, are rarely perceived as warm and competent, which, as Fiske explains, puts them in a “catch-22 situation.”","3347","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"So what should Hillary do? This Sunday, on “Face the Nation,” she was asked to offer three words describing herself. She responded, “I mean, look, I am a real person with all the pluses and minuses that go along with being that. And I’ve been in the public eye for so long that I think, you know, it’s like the feature that you see in some magazines sometimes, ‘Real people actually go shopping,’ you know?” She was mocked, but maybe she shouldn’t have been. Perhaps the “real” Hillary Clinton is the woman who said, in a “60 Minutes” interview in 1992, when Gennifer Flowers alleged that she had had a romantic relationship with Bill Clinton, “I’m not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.” Perhaps the “authentic” Hillary Clinton is also the woman who famously snapped, “I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was fulfill my profession.” And maybe the “real” Hillary Clinton also tears up when she talks about her mother’s difficult childhood, her grief over her mother’s death, and her longing to have her mother by her side now. Why can’t she be all those things?","3348","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"And why can’t we be inspired by her? Clinton famously declared “human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights” when she spoke at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing, in 1995. In 1997, as First Lady, she worked with Republicans and Democrats to create the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides health care to more than eight million children and has reduced the number of uninsured children by half. After September 11th, as a New York senator, Clinton helped to secure funding to track the health of first responders, and she has worked to expand health benefits for members of the National Guard, the Reserves, and their families. As Secretary of State, she helped open the United States’ relations with Cuba and negotiate sanctions against Iran. She also oversaw the diplomatic response to the Arab Spring. Clinton has championed children’s causes since she was the First Lady of Arkansas, and she has a long history with the Children’s Defense Fund.","3349","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"Our culture is stubborn; it changes at a glacial pace. If we look at Hillary Clinton from another angle, the enthusiasm gap is less remarkable than we thought. Perhaps it is the expected response to a complex woman who has a long and tangled history in politics. Perhaps the ambivalence toward Hillary Clinton is evidence that we still have a long way to go before we openly accept a woman who spills over the strict parameters and rigid boundaries that our culture constructs.

"Yesterday the New York Times examined in some detail how a House inquiry to examine the tragic events of September 11, 2012, when extremists attacked two U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, and killed four Americans, evolved into an investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State.

"To be fair, Gowdy’s emphasis on the e-mail issue had some justification. As he documented in an interim report on the committee’s work, the State Department was slow to respond to requests for information and took months to acknowledge that Clinton used a private account. Not for the first time, Hillary’s reluctance to be fully transparent fed the more conspiratorial instincts of her opponents. And not for the first time, her fiercest opponents now look like partisan operatives who cared more about damaging her politically than they did about producing a trustworthy record of what happened in Benghazi.","3352","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-house-benghazi-committee-protected-obama"
"Given the polarization in American politics, it takes some serious effort for an investigative body to maintain credibility. It can be done, though, and the best example in recent years is the 9/11 Commission, whose chairman, Thomas Kean, a former governor of New Jersey and a Republican, made a point of forging consensus with his Democratic colleagues on nearly every controversial issue.

Podliska, a former Republican investigator on the committee, stepped forward to allege that he was terminated partly because he refused to focus narrowly on Clinton rather than the broader issues of the attack.","3354","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-house-benghazi-committee-protected-obama"

"It’s not often that a President makes an admission like this. The consequences of Obama—and Hillary’s mistake—have been serious, and not just because Libya is now a chaotic haven for terrorists. The NATO mission in Libya quickly transformed from an effort to protect a vulnerable population from Qaddafi’s imminent attack, to an effort to overthrow the Libyan leader. Obama’s decision to change the objectives of the Libya intervention has made it more difficult for him to gain international support to intervene elsewhere. In 2011, Obama miraculously managed to convince the Chinese to abstain during the Security Council vote authorizing the NATO attack on Libya. (Obama’s strategy in securing that vote is what gave birth to the phrase “leading from behind.”) But as Thomas J. Christensen recently noted in Foreign Affairs, when the Libya mission changed, “China felt betrayed by the UN process” and “subsequently joined Moscow in actively opposing U.S. and European efforts to move against the Assad regime in Syria.” The subsequent collapse of all institutions capable of bringing order to Libya has reminded a lot of people of something that happened a decade before. After it became clear that the Bush Administration had no post-attack strategy for Iraq, Democrats, including Obama and Clinton, rightfully argued that Bush’s lack of planning was scandalous and a prime reason that Republicans couldn’t be trusted on foreign policy.

Ambitious young members of Congress crossed the leadership at their peril. But with the rise of populist movements outside of Washington, the development of online media, and the gutting of campaign-finance laws, party leaders—particularly Republican Party leaders—have seen their leverage greatly reduced.

Unlike in European parliamentary parties, American congressional delegations have seldom, if ever, acted as unified and disciplined fighting forces. Usually, though, they did hang together.

But if anyone can cobble together enough support to get the Party through the next fourteen months without further ruptures, it may well be Ryan. As a personable and articulate former candidate for Vice-President, he has star power. As a longtime purveyor of ambitious (if wholly unrealistic) efforts to eliminate the deficit and downsize the federal government, he has conservative credentials to placate the right. And as a prophet, rather than a party manager and disciplinarian, he hasn’t made very many enemies.","3366","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-paul-ryan-save-the-republican-party"
"He also has another potential advantage. If the Republican Party were even barely functional, the actual demands on the next Speaker wouldn’t be onerous. With a general election in the offing, nobody expects Congress to do much legislating and reforming in the coming fourteen months. The Speaker’s primary task will be to keep the government operating.

Ryan, who chaired the House Budget Committee for four years, certainly knows his way around the issues.

Bush, as an insider, is supposed to know better than to be this candid, especially when he is confronted with the difficult task of persuading a very conservative Republican primary electorate to trust him, while in full view, via the press, of the much more liberal general electorate.

"In an announcement timed to coincide with today’s summit between Presidents Xi Jinping and Barack Obama, the Chinese government said that it would institute a national cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions, starting in 2017. Under the system, large emitters, such as power plants and steel manufacturers, will be assigned a certain number of tons of allowable emissions. If they emit fewer, they can sell the resulting credits; if they emit more, they’ll need to buy credits. The obvious point of such a program is to use financial incentives to spur emissions reductions and limit global warming.","3381","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"
"The announcement was generally hailed as a sign of progress before the global climate summit in Paris, which is set to start in late November. In an e-mail, Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, called the announcement “very welcome” and said it showed that reducing emissions “is being increasingly recognized as in the interest not only of the planet as a whole but of individual countries.”","3382","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"

(John Dales, a Canadian economist, who died in 2007, is also recognized for having come up with more or less the same idea at more or less the same time.) A Republican Administration was the first to put such a system in place. The Reagan Administration used a cap-and-trade approach to phase out lead in gasoline. Then, under President George H. W. Bush, the U.S. set up a cap-and-trade system to curb power-plant emissions of sulfur dioxide. Under President Bill Clinton, the U.S. remained committed to the concept, so much so that the administration insisted that a cap-and-trade provision be included in the Kyoto Protocol. (Although the U.S. subsequently rejected the Protocol, the Europeans, who had resisted the idea of cap-and-trade, ended up establishing an E.U.-wide trading system.)","3383","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"

During his first term, President Obama tried to get a cap-and-trade system implemented for carbon emissions. He’s often been criticized for not having tried hard enough, a criticism that’s probably fair. However, as the President pointed out in a recent interview with Rolling Stone, there weren’t enough votes in the Senate to get the bill through without some G.O.P. support, and none was forthcoming.

"In his second term, Obama has turned to regulations to limit carbon emissions. Most significantly, the Environmental Protection Agency has issued a series of new rules to cut power-plant emissions. From a political perspective, this turn is laudable; doing something about climate change is certainly better than doing nothing. However, from an economic standpoint, it’s regrettable that things have come to such a pass; it’s likely—many would say inevitable—that, on a ton-for-ton basis, the regulations will prove more costly than a cap-and-trade system would have.","3386","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"
"All of this is not to say that a cap-and-trade system is a panacea, or that the Chinese embrace of the idea is suddenly going to solve the world’s carbon-emissions problem, which is now on the order of ten billion metric tons a year. Carbon trading systems are tricky to design; early on, for example, the Europeans handed out too many credits, with the result that their system very nearly collapsed and even now is just barely functional. Few details have been provided on what China—which now accounts for more than a quarter of global emissions—is planning. One obvious question is how high the cap will be. Another is how the system will be enforced. Reliable data in China are hard to come by, and no one at this point even has very good information on who is emitting how much.","3387","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"

"The summit was organized and hosted by Michele Combs, who heads up the group Young Conservatives for Energy Reform (Y.C.E.R.), and her mother, Roberta Combs, the president and C.E.O. of the Christian Coalition of America. Whereas Roberta has been a major player in the anti-abortion movement and has lobbied for the appointment of conservative Supreme Court justices, Michele is staking her career on a notably different cause. “Clean energy is not a Democrat issue. It’s a family issue,” she told me. “It’s about freedom and health and jobs and conserving our environment. It brings everybody together. Al Gore and I go way back—he’s a good friend—but he’s polarizing. He can’t get this message to our constituency.” The summit was part of an ongoing effort to move the issues of climate change and clean energy from the margins of the Republican Party to its mainstream. Although the Combses scarcely spoke at the event, they chose others to make their case—the executive of a solar-power company, a three-star and a four-star general, two congressman, and six U.S. senators.","3391","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"Most of the summit’s audience appeared to range in age from eighteen to forty-five. Students and professionals had been flown and bussed in from around the country; there were representatives of the Christian Coalition, the Young Republican National Federation, and the thirty-one state chapters of Y.C.E.R. The stated goal of the event was simply to educate, but given how much collective political heat the speakers were packing it seemed clear that bigger questions were at play—questions about the future of a fractured G.O.P. “It is now time for the conservative cause to embrace energy reform and a clean environment,” Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said via video link from the Presidential campaign trail. “Let’s not turn this over to the most liberal people in the country.” Clean energy, he added, is “the cause of a lifetime.”","3392","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"There was an impressive amount of Republican self-critique among some of the speakers. Grassley, for instance, called out his colleagues for favoring fossil fuels over alternative energy. “You are going to find people in this town who say they are for ‘all of the above’ energy, but they’re really for none of the above and all of the below,” he said, underscoring his support for aboveground wind and solar resources. He and other speakers acknowledged that, from a consumer standpoint, belowground energy sources—oil and natural gas, in particular—are cheaper and more accessible now than they have been in years. Even more notable, however, are the trends in the renewable-energy marketplace: fossil-fuel prices fluctuate, but the costs associated with solar and wind power have been declining and will likely continue to fall. Indeed, nearly every speech was crammed with feel-good economic statistics: solar has become eighty per cent cheaper in the past five years; the U.S. clean-energy sector grew fourteen per cent in 2014, about five times as much as the rest of the economy. Senator Richard Burr, of North Carolina, cut to the chase. “Let me sum it up in one word: jobs,” he said.","3393","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"Many of the speakers dodged both the issue of climate change and the pervasive conservative argument that fighting it will destroy, not create, jobs. Some of the most visible Republicans on the national stage, including the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and several Presidential contenders—Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Marco Rubio—have made this argument before. (Trump, in a tweet, deemed climate science “bullshit.”) Rather than uttering the dreaded phrase, Senator John McCain, a former champion of climate legislation, spoke to the summit crowd about national security. Jeremy Symons, the director of climate and political affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund, advocated a big-tent approach. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re motivated by American energy independence, or by the promise of a clean-energy economy, or by breaking the power of monopolies over our home-energy choices, or by cleaner air, or by climate change,” he said. “What’s important is that you’re here.”","3394","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"The long-term goal of Y.C.E.R., Michele Combs told me, is to help get “a comprehensive energy-reform bill” passed in the Senate soon after the next administration takes office—a bill that could also, in effect, break the congressional climate-legislation stalemate. No major Republican-backed climate or energy legislation has been proposed in the Senate since a cap-and-trade bill that Graham supported failed, back in 2010. (The Combses helped persuade Graham to take a leadership role on that bill, and they threw the support of the Christian Coalition behind it.) “We’re building grassroots to provide cover—to keep senators politically safe when they support energy reform,” Combs said. “First, we’re establishing common ground and a new terminology. Terms like ‘energy reform’ will bring a lot more conservatives to the table than ‘climate change.’ ”","3395","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"If national polls are any indication, this is the time. A recent study from the University of Texas at Austin showed that fifty-nine per cent of Republican voters now accept climate science, up from forty-seven per cent just six months ago. A separate study from the University of Michigan showed similar results: fifty-six per cent of Republican respondents said that they believe global warming is a real and immediate concern, up from forty-seven per cent a year ago. The shift may have been driven, at least in part, by growing concerns about extreme weather phenomena—the withering drought in California, for example. “It’s getting harder to ignore nature,” Keith den Hollander, the thirty-eight-year-old chairman of the Christian Coalition of Michigan, told me. “Do I think that our climate’s changing? Yeah, I do. I mean, I’ve seen more severe winters than in the past, definitely some strange weather patterns.”","3396","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"It’s too early to know what measures a comprehensive, Republican-backed energy-reform bill might contain—and whether they would satisfy Democrats. Partisan conflict on this issue continues to smolder. Right now, twenty-six states are suing President Obama for his recent effort to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions under the Clean Air Act. But a growing number of conservative congressional leaders are trying to stake a claim on the climate issue. Yesterday, Graham and a group of his colleagues—Kelly Ayotte, of New Hampshire; Mark Kirk, of Illinois; and Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee—announced the formation of a Senate Energy and Environmental Working Group. Last month, eleven Republicans in the House introduced a resolution to address “the causes and effects of climate change.” It’s progress, albeit slow.","3397","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"But is there time to wait for Republican leaders to inch their way toward climate legislation? A critical environmentalist might argue that an event like the Conservative Clean Energy Summit can’t establish a framework for carbon-emission reductions that are big enough and fast enough to keep warming below two degrees Celsius and stave off the worst impacts of climate change. Roberta Combs counters that such impatience inevitably backfires. “The liberals want to do it all at once—they want to solve this issue in one fell swoop,” she said. “That’s why they can’t get anything done. In reality, it has to be bit by bit. You have to bite the elephant one piece at a time, because it’s too big to swallow whole.”","3398","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"

The forty-first President is being treated to a rolling tribute that is no doubt bittersweet, but certainly more sweet than bitter for a one-term President who left office being blamed for a recession, charged with indifference to the struggles of ordinary Americans, and vilified by the right for breaking his campaign pledge of “no new taxes.”","November 13, 2015","3399","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-george-h-w-bush-got-wrong"

There is even an argument to be made that Bush is, as Mark Updegrove, the director of the Lyndon B. Johnson Library, contends, “our most revered living president.” Some of that reverence, to be sure, stems from Bush’s near-total withdrawal from the political arena—even, or especially, during his son’s troubled tenure as President. (Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, by contrast, have been more publicly engaged as post-Presidents, and more willing than Bush to accept the risks in that.) During those difficult years, 41’s reputation rose as 43’s sank.

It was not empty flattery when, in 2013, President Obama praised him at a White House celebration of civic voluntarism, a cause long championed by Bush. “Given the humility that’s defined your life,” Obama told Bush at the East Room ceremony, “I suspect it’s harder for you to see something that’s clear to everybody else around you, and that’s how bright a light you shine.”","3401","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-george-h-w-bush-got-wrong"
"When we rank, reconsider, laud, or denounce past Presidents, living or dead, we are taking stock of our own times. In that sense, the vindication of George H. W. Bush is a reflection of what we know we’ve lost. Jon Meacham’s new biography of Bush, “Destiny and Power,” makes that plain from its very first pages. “Americans unhappy with the reflexively polarized politics of the first decades of the twenty-first century will find the presidency of George H.W. Bush refreshing, even quaint,” Meacham writes in his prologue. “He embraced compromise as a necessary element of public life, engaged his political foes in the passage of important legislation, and was willing to break with the base of his own party in order to do what he thought was right, whatever the price.” Meacham lists achievements that any Democratic President would be happy to claim: the Americans with Disabilities Act, the reauthorization of the Clean Air Act, an expansion of tax credits for families with children. But, on the domestic front, Bush’s reputation rests, principally, on his tax-pledge apostasy—his retreat, by the summer of 1990, from the showy supply-side absolutism of 1988, and his resulting agreement with congressional Democrats to cut spending and raise taxes. “Our people were running and screaming, and I can understand why,” Bush wrote in his diary after striking the deal. “I guess this is the biggest test of my Presidency.”","3402","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-george-h-w-bush-got-wrong"
"By “our people,” Bush meant the most religiously anti-tax, anti-government conservatives—the G.O.P.’s bitter-enders. Vice-President Dan Quayle and others urged Bush to make his case to them and the nation for raising taxes, but Bush refused; he told Quayle that the results of the budget deal would speak for themselves. Meacham attributes this reticence to Bush’s discomfort with speeches—Bush had been cowed, Meacham believes, by “the Reagan rhetorical legacy” and the slings of the news media. But there is more at work here than Meacham acknowledges, and it has to be weighed in any full accounting of Bush’s life and leadership. Bush shrank from defending the tax increase, in part, because he had always shrunk from challenging, in any principled, public way, his party’s right wing.","3403","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-george-h-w-bush-got-wrong"
"“Our people” were never really Bush’s people; he knew it, and so did they. Some conservatives never really forgave Bush for dismissing Reagan’s supply-side platform as “voodoo economics” during the 1980 primaries, and Bush, for his part, continued to see them as zealots. In 1987, as Vice-President, Bush turned down an invitation to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference. “Fuck ’em, I ain’t going,” Bush is said to have told his advisers. “You can’t satisfy those people.” In 1989, when one of those people—Newt Gingrich—became the House minority whip, President Bush invited him and one of his lieutenants, Representative Vin Weber, of Minnesota, to the White House for a beer. As Meacham recounts, the conversation was friendly, but as the two congressmen got up to leave, Weber asked the President “what your biggest fear is about us.” “Well,” Bush replied, “I’m worried that sometimes your idealism”—his polite way of describing their ideological fervency—“will get in the way of what I think is sound governance.”","3404","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-george-h-w-bush-got-wrong"
"Bush saw which way his party was sliding, as Meacham makes powerfully clear. One of the most startling passages in the book comes from Bush’s private account of a 1988 encounter with a woman who supported the televangelist Pat Robertson’s campaign for the Republican nomination. The woman refused to shake the Vice-President’s hand. Bush complained in his diary:","3405","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-george-h-w-bush-got-wrong"
"Bush deserves points for prescience—but not for courage. While Meacham insists that Bush “made no apologies for his preference for pragmatism over ideology,” this is too forgiving. Bush, true, was never an ideologue, but he did often strain to appear as one. As early as 1964, in his losing bid to displace Ralph Yarborough, the Democratic senator from Texas, Bush took “far-right positions to get elected,” as he himself recalled, and came to regret it. Not entirely. In 1988, he ran for President as a social conservative, painting the hapless Michael Dukakis—a technocrat if ever there was one—as a scheming, vaguely foreign collectivist who had it in for religion and the Pledge of Allegiance. It was an unconvincing and yet brutally effective performance. Four years later, in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, in Houston, Bush knocked America’s system of public education as schools “run by government,” and disowned his greatest domestic achievement—the 1990 budget deal. “It was a mistake to go along with the Democratic tax increase,” Bush told the delegates. “And I admit it.”","3406","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-george-h-w-bush-got-wrong"
"In electoral politics—as opposed to the appointed positions (C.I.A. director, U.N. Ambassador) that he clearly relished—Bush was forever on edge, on the defensive, dropping his “g”s, painting himself as an anti-intellectual oilman from “a little shotgun house” on the frontier, conceding ground to Gingrich, Robertson, Grover Norquist, and Pat Buchanan that he could never gain back. Bush deplored the rightward lurch of the G.O.P., but lacked the will or the fire to fight for its future. He did not, in the phrase of William F. Buckley, Jr., “stand athwart history, yelling Stop”; he tried, instead, to go with the flow. The fact that Bush disbelieved some of the dogma he espoused is not, in the end, exculpatory. We might celebrate 41, as Jon Meacham does, as the last great Republican moderate, but he could have been so much greater.","3407","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-george-h-w-bush-got-wrong"
"The keynote speaker at the annual National Prayer Breakfast, in Washington, D.C., is expected to be an agile performer: a preacher, but a nondenominational one; an orator, but a nonpartisan one. In 1997, the speaker was Benjamin Solomon Carson, who was both an accomplished pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins University and, unlike most pediatric neurosurgeons, something of a celebrity. Ten years before, he had separated twins who were joined at the head, and he used the attention that followed to establish himself as a writer and inspirational figure. He grew up poor and black in Detroit, the son of a single mother who, he likes to remind audiences, could barely read. And he has a knack, common to great motivators, for making his accomplishments seem both extraordinary and achievable.","3408","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"“I don’t feel that I really belong here,” Carson said, when he took the lectern, but his casual posture and gentle smile suggested that he knew he did. The anecdotes he dispensed had been polished smooth over the decades, and they helped him administer a carefully calibrated dose of political and spiritual incitement. He lamented the secularization of American society, asserting that religious faith was no longer acceptable in political discourse. “If it’s in our Constitution, it’s in our Pledge, it’s in our courts, and it’s on our money, but we’re not supposed to talk about it, what is that?” he asked. “That’s schizophrenia!” But he also delivered a black-history lesson, enumerating a long list of African-American inventors who were, he said, absent from school textbooks, thereby depriving young black men of role models. Midway through his talk, he issued a whimsical—and bipartisan—call to action. “What if everybody in this room, with all your influence, wrote a letter to Kellogg’s and General Mills and said, ‘Put on your cereal boxes Nobel Prize winners and people of intellect, instead of just people who use sports and entertainment,’ ” he said. “Those kinds of things, I think, will make a big difference.” When he was finished, Bill and Hillary Clinton stood up to applaud, and they pumped his hand as he returned to his seat.","3409","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Perhaps President Obama was expecting a similar performance when he settled in for Carson’s encore appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast, in February, 2013. But by then Carson’s political vision had come into sharper focus. The political pundit and entrepreneur Armstrong Williams, a longtime friend and adviser of Carson’s who is currently his business manager, remembers watching Carson “agonizing” in the greenroom, as he tried to decide whether, and how much, he should criticize the President. In the end, Carson decided not to single out Obama, but he offered a strongly divergent view of America’s problems and potential solutions: he sounded an alarm about the national debt; he called for a strictly proportional income tax, based on the Biblical principle of tithing; and he laid out a health-care reform plan, which he said would reduce “bureaucracy”—a veiled reference, perhaps, to Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The speech became an online sensation, partly thanks to its unnamed target, who stopped smiling about halfway through and skipped an opportunity for a post-speech handshake. Clips have amassed millions of views on YouTube: “Obama Destroyed by Dr. Benjamin Carson’s Amazing Speech”; “Dr. Benjamin Carson Wipes the Smile off Obama’s Face.” (Among Carson’s fans, his honorific often serves as a term of affection.) And the speech inspired the Wall Street Journal to issue the first major endorsement of the 2016 campaign cycle: “Ben Carson for President.”","3410","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The Journal editorial wasn’t actually intended as a Presidential endorsement; it was a jocular salute to a newly minted folk hero, and a mischievous suggestion that even this political layman was more sensible than Obama. But the cult of Carson grew, aided by the formation of the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee, and by tacit encouragement from Carson, who seemed to enjoy the speculation. Soon after the speech, he announced that he was retiring from neurosurgery and hinted that he was considering public office. This May, after two years of contemplation, he declared that he was running. He recalled praying for guidance. “Lord, I don’t want to do this,” he said. “But if you’re going to open the doors I will go through with it.”","3411","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"During a recent appearance at a retirement community in Exeter, New Hampshire, Carson, who is sixty-four, was interrupted by residents making a common complaint: he was speaking too softly. He adjusted the microphone and leaned into it. “I can’t get it any higher,” he said. “It would be in my mouth.” And then he returned to his subject, which was the dire prospect of a country in which citizens were afraid to criticize their government. “Back in Nazi Germany, a lot of those people did not believe in what Hitler was doing,” he said. “They kept their mouths shut and they kept their heads down. And look at what happened.” Carson has an ability—honed, no doubt, during his previous career—to deliver alarming statements in a soothing manner. “Some people say, ‘Oh, nothing like that could ever happen in America,’ ” he said. “I beg to differ.” When he speaks, Carson sometimes blinks slowly, or closes his eyes in thought, and he uttered this last phrase in the same tone of voice that you might use to recount a pleasant dream.","3412","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson announced his candidacy, he was overshadowed by Jeb Bush, who was viewed as the favorite, and then by Donald Trump, whose groundswell began a few weeks later. But Carson kept speaking, quietly. Ryan Rhodes, Carson’s Iowa state director, says that the candidate’s “soft touch” is particularly effective among women voters and Evangelicals. By this fall, national polls showed Carson catching Trump, and even overtaking him. In some ways, this is not a particularly meaningful achievement: national polls, conducted long before the primary season has begun, have little predictive power. (At this point four years ago, Newt Gingrich was the front-runner.) And Carson’s big numbers have had little effect on the skepticism of political experts, who continue to believe that the next President will be a professional politician; Marco Rubio emerged as the betting favorite for the nomination, despite polling about half as well as Carson. Even so, it’s hard to think about the crowded cluster of Republican candidates for President without considering the startling fact that, for months, none were able to command much more support than a former surgeon whose campaign platform is barely more granular than the speech that made him a conservative hero three years ago.","3413","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Like most popular political candidates, Carson promises to deliver his audiences from politics. At campaign rallies, he gets a warm ovation when he inveighs against the nameless forces of division. (“They want Democrats to believe that Republicans are evil,” he says. “Or Republicans to believe that Democrats are evil.”) But that doesn’t make him a moderate. In Exeter, he condemned Planned Parenthood, saying that he would rather direct federal funding to “organizations that don’t engage in killing babies.” A few hours later, at the Durham campus of the University of New Hampshire, he warned about the peril of “global jihadists” and said, “There are many of them, already, within our nation.” That evening, he travelled to a boathouse on Goat Island, off the Portsmouth coast, where a group of local doctors had gathered to slurp milky clam chowder and listen to a former colleague share his belief that physicians should use their “healing instinct” to revive the country. Carson was in his element, joking about the hassles of dunning insurance companies and mentioning, briefly, his interest in trigeminal neuralgia. But even there he stayed on message: when a man in the audience asked about the rising cost of medical school, Carson suggested making colleges pay the interest on student loans, to help keep down tuition, yet firmly rejected the idea of universal government-funded college education. “Anything that we do to add to the debt right now is almost like treason,” he said.","3414","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"During the Obama years, there has been no shortage of conservative leaders eager to squeeze the words “debt” and “treason” into the same sentence. And there are moments when Carson seems almost retro, thrilling audiences with an anti-deficit, anti-Obamacare message that had already started to lose its freshness when he delivered that famous speech. What distinguishes Carson from his Tea Party predecessors is his biography, which also distinguishes him from the rest of the Republican field: he has been telling and retelling his life story for nearly thirty years, hewing to a narrative that emphasizes the Biblical virtues of grace and humility. Other candidates in the race, with the notable exception of Trump, have been reluctant to criticize someone so well loved, perhaps because they don’t view Carson as a long-term threat. In the most recent Republican debate, the other candidates not only refrained from trying to hurt Carson but seemed eager to help him. After he gave a meandering soliloquy in response to a question about banks, Rubio took it upon himself to implement a Troubled Assertion Relief Program, exclaiming, “He’s right on point, there.”","3415","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Journalists haven’t been quite so supportive: BuzzFeed recently posted an old video of Carson suggesting, in defiance of archeological scholarship, that the Egyptian pyramids were actually grain-storage units, built by the Biblical patriarch Joseph. During an excruciating Fox News interview after the Paris attacks, Chris Wallace tried and failed to get Carson to tell him which countries he would recruit to help fight ISIS. (Carson promised to involve “all of the Arab states—and even the non-Arab states.”) Last week, on an Iowa television station, Carson called his foreign-policy education “an ongoing process.” Two days later, he talked about the importance of screening refugees, using an infelicitous analogy: “If there’s a rabid dog running around your neighborhood, you’re probably not going to assume something good about that dog.”","3416","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"At times, the scrutiny has led Carson to engage in atypically peevish exchanges with the media. Williams, his adviser, has been heartened by Carson’s willingness to fight back. “Somebody’s attacking your good name, your word,” he says. “He needs to get emotional. He needs to get fire in his belly.” It would make sense for any other politician to react this way, but Carson’s appeal is based largely on his seeming to be above the fray: a Baptist youth minister in Florida told me that he admired Carson because he was humble, and not “bombastic and adversarial”; a volunteer in Iowa cited his pledge to work for “all the people,” including the ones who wouldn’t vote for him. The most suspenseful thing about his surreal campaign is seeing how long he can stay in the fight without looking too much like a fighter.","3417","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson certainly seemed serene on a recent Tuesday afternoon in Florida, sitting in his temporary living room aboard a chartered bus emblazoned with his face; his head was framed by a backward “D” on the window behind him, the last letter of “BEN CARSON, M.D.” His wife, Candy, emerged from a private room in the back to show Carson a message on her mobile phone, and then disappeared. Carson pointed out that he is used to travelling a lot, and that he has been contending with big crowds for years. “When people would come to the clinic, they always would come with their cameras and their books to be autographed,” he told me. “The magnitude has just increased exponentially.” His campaign has followed an astonishing trajectory, but so has his life; he published his autobiography, “Gifted Hands,” in 1990, and it reads like an extended parable. He writes that his mother, Sonya, was a domestic worker, and sometimes left Ben and his older brother, Curtis, with neighbors while she sought clinical help for “confusion and depression”; his father, an autoworker and part-time preacher, left the family when Carson was eight.","3418","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson was raised in the Seventh-Day Adventist Church—he was baptized at eight and again, for good measure, at twelve—and he has remained a member. His surgical skill seems, in his telling, like a compensatory gift from God: afflicted with poor eyesight, he discovered that he had a knack for spatial visualization, making him well suited to navigate the delicate tangle of a child’s brain. Like many Adventists, Carson is a vegetarian, though he downplays any differences between Adventists and other Christians. Decades ago, in an interview in Vegetarian Times, he expressed certainty that meat eating would fade away by 2010, and that animals would “breathe a sigh of relief.” But, on the bus in Florida, he was eager to explain that his diet is merely a personal choice, and that he has nothing against meat eaters or hunters. He offered a brief explanation of his church’s best-known tenet. “There’s no place in the Bible that says the Sabbath was changed from Saturday to Sunday, so we worship on Saturday, that’s all,” he said. “Does that mean that people who worship on Sunday are evil? No! Of course not.”","3419","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” Carson recalls the two years that he and his brother spent in Boston, living with his mother’s sister: he remembered “winos and drunks,” as well as “squad cars racing up the street.” At the retirement community in Exeter, he added grislier details, saying, “I saw people lying on the street with bullet holes and stab wounds.” The Boston Globe talked to longtime residents of the neighborhoods where Carson lived, who remembered a less menacing atmosphere; one called the claim of bodies in the streets a “vast exaggeration.” Of course, Carson’s exaggeration, if that’s what it is, surely wouldn’t seem so vast if he were not a Presidential candidate; one suspects that few motivational speakers would emerge unscathed from an encounter with a pack of investigative reporters.","3420","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"A number of Carson’s favorite anecdotes seem impervious to research. When he tells his life story, he rarely omits the moment when, at the age of fourteen, he tried to stab another boy with a camping knife; he struck the boy’s belt buckle, the blade “snapped and dropped to the ground,” and Carson retreated to a bathroom, where he begged God to rid him of his violent temper. In Carson’s telling, the prayer worked. “Since that day,” he wrote, “I have never had a problem with my temper.” It says something about Carson’s reputation that reporters have grown suspicious not of his redemption but of his original sin: CNN talked to former friends and classmates and noted, solemnly, that “the violent, impulsive person Carson has described himself as is unrecognizable to them.” Similarly, Carson often talks about a moment of rage when he attacked his mother with a hammer, but, in 1988, the Detroit Free Press published an article in which Carson’s mother recalled the altercation differently. In her version, it was she who wielded the hammer, and might have used it, if Curtis had not intervened.","3421","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The most damaging potential debunking is also the least clear-cut. Carson was part of the R.O.T.C. program in high school, and in “Gifted Hands” he remembers being “offered a full scholarship to West Point.” But, earlier this month, Politico reported that Carson’s campaign had “admitted” that “a central point in his inspirational personal story was fabricated”: he had never applied to West Point, let alone been accepted, and the school does not charge tuition. But Carson had never mentioned applying, and so Politico, under pressure, softened its language, saying only that Carson “conceded that he never applied nor was granted admission.” Since then, the controversy has grown more obscure—it is now an argument over what “offered” means, and whether a West Point representative might have made some encouraging remarks that Carson misinterpreted. In a press conference, he called the reports a “witch hunt.” Raising his voice (possibly for the first time all year), he claimed that Obama had not faced similar scrutiny. “There is a desperation, on behalf of some, to try to find a way to tarnish me,” he said, dejectedly—unlike Trump, Carson takes no visible pleasure in tangling with the media. “It’s just ridiculous!”","3422","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"For Carson, being attacked is a relatively new experience. In the years after “Gifted Hands” was published, he turned his autobiography into an industry. He embarked upon a never-ending speaking tour and founded a charity, the Carson Scholars Fund, which has recognized more than six thousand students for their “academic achievement and humanitarian qualities.” His book spawned nine sequels, and also two documentaries, a cable-television feature film (starring Cuba Gooding, Jr.), and a long-running play in Baltimore, which was often performed for schoolchildren judged to be in need of supplementary edification. The legend of Dr. Carson was ubiquitous in the predominantly African-American schools of Baltimore. (The essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates, who grew up there, wrote, of Carson, “I saw him speak so many times that I began to have that ‘This guy again?’ feeling.”) It was ubiquitous, too, in many churches around the country, where Carson’s story served as proof that faith could conquer all. Many of the people who wait in line to hear his stump speech think of him primarily as a religious figure, which is part of the reason that the media skepticism hasn’t harmed him. Like his policy positions, which are often vague or confusing, the precise details of his biography matter less to voters than the opportunity he offers them to become characters in his uplifting story.","3423","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” politics rarely intrudes. Carson joined his high school R.O.T.C. program in 1967, a few months before the Detroit riots, but the book makes no mention of them, or of the uproar over the Vietnam War, or of Martin Luther King, Jr. (Carson recently told the Wall Street Journal that, during the riots inspired by King’s assassination, he sheltered some white students in the high-school biology lab, although the Journal could not find anyone to corroborate this story.) Carson says that he was brought up to be “a fairly partisan Democrat,” but he evidently wasn’t much interested in activism. He attended Yale during a tumultuous period: in 1970, near the end of his freshman year, the campus was overtaken by protests that accompanied the trials of members of the Black Panther Party, who were accused of murder. (Hillary Clinton, then studying at Yale Law School, served as a liaison to the group that planned the protests.) But his campus life seems to have revolved mainly around Candy, his wife, a fellow-student who was also from Detroit. She is the author of a forthcoming book about their marriage, the co-author of his last three books, the leader of the Carson family string quartet (they have three grown sons, who fill out the lineup), and, he often says, the only woman he has ever been with. One of the black student leaders in those days at Yale, Kurt Schmoke, says that Carson was not among the rabble-rousers. “The Ben Carson I knew in college was a very studious person—focussed like a laser beam on going to medical school,” he says.","3424","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson got his medical degree from the University of Michigan and, in 1977, arrived at Johns Hopkins, where he became known as a precise but imaginative surgeon. Readers who have heard about his life-saving feats might be surprised to learn, in “Gifted Hands,” how many of his best-known surgeries ended in disaster, or in a more equivocal result. Benjamin and Patrick Binder, the German twins who played such a large role in Carson’s career, were seven months old when the operation took place: Carson and his team had to temporarily induce hypothermic arrest so that they could disentangle the interlaced blood vessels before the babies bled out. Both survived the operation, but they suffered brain damage, and one has since died. One of the things Carson learned is how not to become paralyzed by self-doubt. He likes to say that he has performed fifteen thousand surgeries, which would mean an average of more than one a day, for more than three decades.","3425","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In Baltimore, Carson was a friend and ally of Schmoke, the former student leader, who transformed his activism into a career in elected politics: from 1987 until 1999, he served as the Democratic mayor of Baltimore, and he and Carson often talked about ways to support young people in the city. At one point, when a Democratic gubernatorial candidate sought Carson’s endorsement, Schmoke urged him to decline, so as not to damage his spotless reputation. “I guess I thought that his story was above partisan politics,” Schmoke says now, chuckling. Back then, Carson liked being politically uncategorizable. In his book “The Big Picture,” published in 1999, he noted with satisfaction that he had once heard hosts on a radio show arguing over whether or not he supported Louis Farrakhan’s Million Man March. Carson conspicuously declined to settle the question. Elsewhere in the book, he preëmptively defended himself against the suggestion that he was a conservative Republican. “I’m not,” he wrote, adding that he would accept no political label more restrictive than “independent.”","3426","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Schmoke remembers the day, some years ago, when Carson casually mentioned that he was skeptical of the scientific consensus on evolution. Schmoke thought he was joking, but Carson made clear that he wasn’t. “I said to myself, ‘Gosh, there must be a lot of things that Ben believes that I’ve never talked to him about,’ ” Schmoke recalls. Carson now says that his political outlook began to shift in the nineteen-eighties, when he found himself captivated by President Reagan’s message of “self-empowerment.” That became Carson’s message, too, although for many years he delivered it in nonpolitical terms. “Gifted Hands” begins with a letter from Carson’s mother, who reprises one of her favorite phrases: “If you don’t succeed, you have only yourself to blame.” In one passage, Carson declares that it is time for “minorities” to “stand on our own feet and refuse to look to anybody else to save us.” But later, in a discussion of “disadvantaged kids,” he suggests that there is “a system precluding these people from achieving.” Of course, self-help and systemic change need not be mutually exclusive. And, anyway, as a surgeon and motivational speaker Carson didn’t have to choose.","3427","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson registered as a Republican only a year ago, as he considered running for President. By all accounts, it was the battle over health care that pushed him to finally embrace a political party. In 2004, President George W. Bush appointed Carson to his Council on Bioethics, and Carson began thinking more seriously about how the federal government might rein in the insurance industry, which seemed to him to consume too much of the nation’s medical spending. At a town-hall meeting in 2005, organized by the Congressional Black Caucus, he suggested a health-care system modelled on “something that already works”: the food-stamp program. (He liked the idea that recipients could shop for medical care, just as food-stamp recipients shop for groceries.) Two years later, at a council meeting, Carson suggested that, if insurance could be made more affordable, universal coverage could be achieved by fiat. He said, “There is where the government perhaps comes in and makes it mandatory, just like it’s mandatory for you to have automobile insurance.”","3428","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"These ideas don’t seem radically at odds with the reform bill that President Obama eventually passed. But as the debate over the Affordable Care Act began, in 2009, Carson was dismayed to find himself shut out of the process: Obama disbanded Bush’s Council on Bioethics, and Carson tried in vain to secure a Presidential meeting. “It left him very disappointed, and devastated,” Williams says. The 2013 Prayer Breakfast speech was an expression of frustration, and also a final attempt to get through to a President who seemed intent on ignoring Carson’s expertise. On the campaign trail, Carson rarely fails to mention his idea for “health savings accounts,” which would be personal and shareable: family members could contribute to each other’s medical bills, and seniors might pass on leftover funds to their descendants. He hasn’t fully explained how these accounts would be set up, or what would happen to patients who depleted theirs. Even more than the competition, he is devout in his belief that systemic problems can be solved by topical applications of common sense.","3429","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"By the time Carson launched his campaign, he had completed his evolution from Democrat to independent to eager exponent of movement conservatism. He evinced a newfound passion for gun rights. And although the Adventist Church suggests that in some “exceptional circumstances” a woman might justifiably choose to terminate a pregnancy, Carson is now “unabashedly and entirely pro-life.” Like any successful speaker, Carson knows how to read a room, and he admits that his transformation has been aided by his recent immersion in politics, and by the receptive audience that he has found among conservatives. He has emerged, for instance, as an advocate of tightened immigration laws, arguing that children born in the U.S. to unauthorized immigrants shouldn’t be given citizenship. “In talking to a lot of Americans, I realized how strongly they feel about people who come here illegally, and I think that probably has influenced me,” he says. “Because if you want to be a representative of the people, in a republic-type government, then obviously you have to represent what they feel.”","3430","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson’s bus arrives at an event, his supporters often break into applause, although some find other ways to express themselves. In Waterloo, Iowa, a woman hopped in place, in anticipation of being in his presence; more than one fan, after shaking his hand, bent over and wept. In Florida, the crowds included eager teen-agers and shuffling seniors but only a small number of African-Americans. Carson occasionally acknowledges that his ideological journey has put him at odds with black voters, who play a vanishingly small role in the modern Republican Party. On the bus, which was trundling from his hotel, in Clearwater, to a Barnes & Noble in Tampa, Carson thought about how, exactly, Democrats manage to win so many African-American votes. “Don’t you think Lyndon Johnson had it right?” he said. “I’m sure you’ve heard his quote where he said, ‘Give those N-words a few goodies and we’ll have their vote for the next two hundred years.’ ” The quote comes, lightly paraphrased, from a book by Ronald Kessler, who attributes it to a former Air Force One steward, who said that he overheard a conversation between Johnson and “two governors.” The line is meant to illuminate the cynicism of Democratic politicians, although, by crediting it, Carson can’t help but belittle the intelligence of African-American voters, too. This tactic is common in politics, where leaders often devise patronizing explanations for the otherwise unaccountable fact that people sometimes vote for their opponents. (Think of Obama’s claim, during the 2008 campaign, that inhabitants of depressed towns “cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them.”) But the notion of black voters as dupes for white politicians has a particularly nettlesome history in the U.S., stretching back to Reconstruction; nowadays, some Republican politicians prefer to simply say, instead, that their party needs to get better at reaching out.","3431","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Because Carson is African-American, he need not be so circumspect—one of his advantages is his willingness to talk about race in language that his rivals would be wise to avoid. He has called Obamacare “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,” and has said, of abortion, “I think it’s a moral issue—just like slavery was a moral issue.” While blasting Planned Parenthood, he asserted that its founder, Margaret Sanger, “believed that people like me should be eliminated or kept under control.” (Sanger did suggest preventing “feeble-minded” people from having children, but there is no evidence that she supported sterilization on the basis of race.) Some of his gentler formulations, too, convey a coded racial appeal: Carson often excites largely white audiences by sketching a vision of racial harmony, just as Obama once did. When he tells crowds that “our unity is what provides our strength,” he could be echoing Obama’s famous claim, from the 2004 speech that made him a national figure, that “there’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America.”","3432","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Some of Carson’s biggest supporters see race as an important part of his appeal. Unlike Obama—and, for that matter, Herman Cain, the African-American businessman who briefly captivated Republican voters during the 2012 campaign—Carson entered this race as a figure well known and widely admired in African-American communities. John Philip Sousa IV, the leader of an unaffiliated pro-Carson political-action committee, is the author of “Ben Carson: Rx for America,” a slim paperback that is given out free at Carson events. (The front cover announces, “Over 1,000,000 in Print!”) Sousa, a great-grandson of the composer, argues that Carson could attract a significant minority of the African-American vote, enough to make a Democratic victory mathematically impossible; a Carson Presidency, he argues, would “forever destroy” the “false narrative that conservatives and Republicans are racists.”","3433","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"There is something paradoxical about Sousa’s argument, which urges Republican voters to agree that race matters in order to demonstrate that it really doesn’t. As Carson’s audience has changed, he has modified how he talks about race, in ways that make him more acceptable to the party he recently joined. Writing in 1999, he affirmed his belief that “our justice system metes out different treatment to blacks and whites,” and declared that police in a Detroit suburb had recently arrested his mother and impounded her car, because she matched the description of a suspect. Now he suggests that African-American frustration with the criminal justice system is misdirected. “I just don’t agree that that’s where the emphasis needs to be,” he says.","3434","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"At times, there are signs of tension between Carson’s old life, as a community-minded motivator, and his new life, as a Republican favorite. During one recent appearance, his customary reminiscences of boyhood gave way to a memorable digression about the joys of throwing rocks at cars. “Everybody did it, because it was so much fun,” he said, and he chuckled at the thought of police officers scrambling to catch him and his friends. “Of course, that was back in the days before they would shoot you,” he said. He stopped himself. “I’m just kidding,” he said, adding that he had “a tremendous amount of respect for the police.” He paused to accept the crowd’s applause, and, back on safe ground, added that the police were “the very last people that we should be targeting.”","3435","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson mentions racial uplift, he often adds a quick disclaimer, noting that his policies are meant “not only for African-Americans but for everybody.” Sitting on the bus, though, he advocated a kind of economic separatism. “If we would learn how to turn our dollars over in our own community, two or three times, before you send it out—that’s how you generate wealth,” he told me. “That’s how the Jews did it. That’s how the Koreans did it.” Half a century earlier, Malcolm X made a strikingly similar argument, saying, “If we try and establish some industry in our own community, then we’re developing to the position where we are creating employment for our own kind.” Of course, Malcolm X’s entreaty was accompanied by a caustic corollary that probably would not impress the Republican electorate. “Once you gain control of the economy of your own community,” he added, “then you don’t have to picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for a job in his business.”","3436","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"If Carson has a specific pitch to African-American voters, it is indistinguishable from his general economic pitch. He wants to lower taxes for everyone in order to spur economic activity and raise interest rates, so that poor and middle-class families can earn more interest in their savings accounts. And he wants to allow corporations to repatriate overseas money, tax free, if they use ten per cent of it to “create jobs for unemployed people and people on welfare.” His campaign’s outreach to African-Americans has consisted largely of a radio advertisement featuring a hip-hop track that not even Carson seemed to enjoy. (“I probably would have taken a little different approach,” he said after it was released.) Maybe it doesn’t much matter, given the racially polarized state of American politics. Florida, for instance, is about seventeen per cent African-American, but exit polls conducted there in 2012 suggest that only about one in a hundred Mitt Romney voters was African-American. Sometime in the future, black voters might help Republicans win the Presidency. But in this cycle it’s highly doubtful that they will help a Republican win the nomination.","3437","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Earlier this fall, Carson startled the press corps—and some of his own advisers—by cutting back on his campaign schedule so that he could promote his latest book, “A More Perfect Union,” in which his political platform takes the form of a constitutional exegesis. (Carson’s ten books all cover pretty much the same territory, and so some conceptual ingenuity is required to keep his bibliography growing.) The plan, which Carson explained by saying that he wanted to fulfill his obligations to his publisher, puzzled many observers; National Review posted a blog item under the headline “this isn’t normal.” And yet the book tour helped him—or, at any rate, didn’t hurt. During October, when he was mainly off the campaign trail, his popularity increased. National polls showed him in a virtual tie for first place, with Trump; in Iowa polls, for the first time, he was the front-runner. At book signings, hundreds and even thousands of fans lined up to buy a copy of “A More Perfect Union,” have it signed, and maybe get a quick handshake. Carson apparently hasn’t lost his surgical dexterity, because often he executed the handshake while holding an uncapped Sharpie in the same hand. At a Books-A-Million in Kissimmee, Florida, employees made sure that customers didn’t linger for more than a few seconds, but one man brought the line to a halt. Bob Santos, a fellow-Adventist who had first heard about Carson through his church, had spent more than five hundred dollars on a basketful of Carson books, which he planned to distribute to friends and relatives. Once Carson had worked his way through the basket, Santos seemed exhilarated, even though he hadn’t quite got everything he wanted. “I thought he was going to personalize one of them,” Santos said. “He said he can’t.”","3438","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Before Carson’s Presidential campaign was a campaign, it was a business—one largely independent of Carson himself. The Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision allows political-action committees to be more or less unregulated, so long as they don’t coördinate their activities with official campaigns. In December, 2013, Carson told potential supporters that none of the groups soliciting on his behalf had his blessing, but the pro-Carson groups didn’t need it. They kept making money and plowing it back into fund-raising, creating a virtuous and potentially lucrative cycle. The following year, as the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee—run by Sousa and Vernon Robinson, a political entrepreneur—was raising millions, Armstrong Williams suggested that the organization was dishonest. “People giving money think it’s going to Dr. Carson, and it’s not,” he said, adding, “I don’t like misleading people.”","3439","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Once Carson announced his candidacy—yielding, he said, to the people who had been “clamoring” for him to run—he had to make peace with the Carson industry. Williams now believes that the unaffiliated PACs are “not as exploitative” as he had thought, and concedes that they have played an important role in boosting Carson. Williams says that he is careful not to communicate with the Super PACs. (He suffered a scandal of his own, a decade ago: he was working as a syndicated columnist, and it was revealed that the Bush Administration had paid him to promote its No Child Left Behind Act.) This must require special vigilance, because his brother, Alvin Williams, runs Black America’s Political Action Committee, which solicits donations in order to “push Dr. Carson to victory.”","3440","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The official campaign has proved adept at fund-raising, too, using expensive telephone and direct-mail solicitations to reach small donors. Last month, the Federal Election Commission reported that Carson’s campaign had raised nearly twenty million dollars from donors who had given two hundred dollars or less—vastly more than any other Republican. Bush, Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Chris Christie have all attracted much more Super-PAC money than Carson, while Trump has attracted about as much as he seems to need, which is none. But, if individual donations were votes, Carson would be the people’s choice.","3441","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"This is partly a matter of strategy: Carson’s campaign devotes an unusually large portion of its spending—more than fifty per cent—to fund-raising. It is also a result of Carson’s status as a kind of conservative eminence, the kind of figure who makes people excited to put a check in the mail. At the Barnes & Noble in Tampa, Sousa’s Super pac was outside in the parking lot, selling T-shirts and giving away copies of his book. An independent vender was there, too, hawking buttons. One showed Carson with hands clasped in prayer; another said, “Vote Republican—we can’t ALL be on welfare!” An elderly man wandered through the store, gawking at the line of customers that snaked around the bookcases and outside into the muggy afternoon sun. “Is Ben Carson here?” he asked a store manager. “I’ll probably vote for him—but I hate those annoying phone calls.”","3442","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson’s determination to do right by his publisher, Penguin, has fuelled speculation that he is more interested in making money than in becoming President. Indeed, Carson seems as proud of his business acumen as of his surgical skill—he often reminds voters that he has served on the board of both Kellogg and Costco, and promises to reinvigorate government by bringing in people he knows from “the business world.” One of Carson’s connections has caused him some trouble during the campaign: Mannatech, a multilevel-marketing company that sells nutritional supplements it calls “glyconutrients.” In 2009, the company agreed to pay six million dollars to settle a suit, brought by the Texas attorney general, which accused it of claiming that its products “cured, treated, or mitigated” a list of ailments that included cancer, autism, asthma, toxic-shock syndrome, and attention-deficit disorder. Carson has given speeches at Mannatech events, and he appeared in a regional public-television program about brain health, sponsored by Mannatech distributors, in which he stressed the importance of glyconutrients. When I asked about Mannatech, he said the company had behaved in a way that was “a little bit dishonest,” by uploading a promotional video he appeared in that was supposed to be available only to sales associates. But even now, when discussing the company’s product, Carson can’t help but offer a sales pitch. “I use it every day,” he told me. “Since I’ve been taking it, the incidence of me getting sick has dramatically declined.”","3443","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Many of Carson’s supporters are true believers: they earnestly explain how he and no other candidate could pull the country together. It can be harder to detect what Carson himself wants. Throughout the campaign, he has shown relatively little interest in the specifics of policy. His tax plan is more like a statement of general principles—he wants everyone to pay the same rate, but he hasn’t specified what that rate would be. And his foreign policy can seem like one long improvisation. During a recent debate, he responded to a question about Syria and Afghanistan with a confusing claim that “the Chinese” were active in the region; in the days afterward, the campaign clarified that Carson hadn’t meant to suggest that Chinese troops were present in Syria. At times like this, Carson’s insistence that he is a reluctant candidate can seem all too convincing—a few months before he officially announced, he told a medical journal, possibly in jest, that he would be relieved if he didn’t win. Williams remembers Carson saying, of the people urging him to run, “Maybe they see something in me that I don’t see.”","3444","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Most Republican strategists maintain that voters will eventually settle on a more conventional choice, chastened by the prospect of President Carson or, more likely, of another President Clinton. But the rise of unaccountable PACs has weakened the party élites, which means that no one seems to have the credibility to tell the Republican base that nominating Carson might be a bad idea. The increasing messiness of the modern political primary has been, so far, a Republican story; this is in large part an accident of history. In Obama, the Democrats have had a leader who inspires loyalty. But in the next election cycle, or the one after it, the Democratic Party, too, may confront a base of voters eager for a candidate who has as little affection for politics as they do. Perhaps sober, élite-approved Presidential candidates, seasoned by decades of political experience, will come to seem as old-fashioned as network news anchors, and for some of the same reasons.","3445","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson is, even more than Trump, the ultimate 2016 outsider. In the years since the Prayer Breakfast, he has often played the role of soft-spoken firebrand, standing up for the core principles of conservatism. But one sometimes gets the sense that his ideological conversion is incomplete. The Club for Growth, a small-government think tank, often criticizes the timorousness of the Republican establishment, and it has been critical, too, of this year’s insurgents. The group’s Super PAC spent half a million dollars on a television ad to tell Iowa voters that Trump “supports higher taxes.” (The claim relied heavily on a Trump tax proposal from 1999; the Trump campaign responded with a cease-and-desist letter.) David McIntosh, the group’s president, says that he was alarmed by Carson’s suggestion, in a 2012 book, that it was possible to “extract socialism’s positive aspects and actually implement them within capitalism.” (Carson was referring to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps.) McIntosh is not reassured by Carson’s frequent paeans to liberty. “In the Republican primary, ‘free market’ and ‘less government’ are the buzzwords,” he says. “I think he may be using those, but they don’t really reflect a well-thought-out philosophy of the role of government.” The group says it is “unable to conclude that Ben Carson would be a pro-growth president,” but its Super pac has not spent money attacking him, because it does not view him as a serious threat. “As he gets closer to the election,” McIntosh says, “people will say, ‘I’m not sure he’s ready, yet, to be President.’ ”","3446","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson believes that readiness is overrated. “There’s no one person who knows everything,” he says, and he is confident in his ability to learn as he goes. But his struggles with difficult questions about governance have made that confidence harder to credit. There are signs that his popularity in Iowa is beginning to ebb—some polls suggest that Trump has regained a narrow lead there. Carson became a front-runner by deploying his motivational skills on his own behalf: he inspired Republican voters to believe that they could have any kind of President they wanted and that they did not need to settle for a mere politician. Now some of them may be realizing that there is no alternative to politics—no way for a retired neurosurgeon to become a Presidential candidate without becoming a politician, too.","3447","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” Carson admitted, “I don’t handle failure well,” although he added a humblebragging clarification: “I guess the Lord knows that, so He keeps it from happening to me often.” It’s not clear that he would regard an inability to win the Presidency as a failure. If the media interrogations grow too withering, or the polls too discouraging, Carson might happily return to a new version of his old life, talking and speaking a bit more about his journey out of Detroit, and a bit less about tax rates or military movements in Syria. In the meantime, he is enjoying the crowds and the adulation. At a recent book event in Lakeland, Florida, fans filled the parking lot, and a book-tour staffer climbed onto Carson’s tour bus to photograph the scene. A small media pen had been set up near the portable lectern where Carson was signing books, and he strolled over to take questions. One reporter wanted to know how he had been preparing for the next debate. “By listening to your questions,” Carson said.","3448","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"

"In 1978, after finishing a tour in the Army with the 82nd Airborne Division, Nelson Hernandez enrolled at Marshall University, in West Virginia, where he took an entry-level computer-science course. A year and a half later, having become proficient in the BASIC programming language, he read about Apple’s latest offering: the Apple II+. In August of 1980, he bought one of the clunky machines. “I remember it cost me eighteen hundred dollars,” Hernandez, who is fifty-nine years old and lives in Austin, Texas, told me recently. “A tremendous sum for a college student on an R.O.T.C. scholarship. But I found some neat things to do with it.” He and his computer became, as he put it, “pretty much inseparable.”","October 6, 2015","3451","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"A few months later, while watching television on Election Night, Hernandez was “enthralled” by the United States map turning different colors as Jimmy Carter and, far more often, Ronald Reagan seized state after state. He decided to try creating a graphic of a U.S. map on his computer. After much work, having succeeded, he then attempted to make each state turn red or blue. “Once that was working,” he said, “I began to build a game around the map, essentially starting with what we see at the conclusion of a general election and working my way backward in terms of game design. It was an amateur, slapdash, one-man affair, nothing like video games we see now,” which can involve dozens or hundreds of people and the resources of publicly traded companies. (In recent decades, the production of video games has become similar to the making of movies.)","3452","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"But this was only the beginning. Just twenty-four years old at the time, Hernandez had nonetheless been an avid follower of politics since the 1968 Presidential campaign—“Who could forget those televised images from Chicago?”—and had read Theodore White’s classic “The Making of the President 1960,” as well as the political writings of Garry Wills. That background, he said, “plus some number-crunching research in the Marshall campus library,” provided the framework of a computer game. After three months of “tinkering,” in early 1981, Hernandez presented a finished product to Joel Billings, the twenty-three year-old head of nascent war-game developer Strategic Simulations. (Nineteen years later, Strategic Simulations was acquired by the video-game giant Ubisoft.)","3453","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"“Although we were far from each other on the political spectrum, we found a way to enjoy working together,” Billings told me. “His game was pretty amazing when you consider the number crunching it was doing at a time when the floppy disk contained only about 180K” of formatted media. Using basic policy positions, the game calculated every candidate’s political leanings on a numerical scale: zero represented an absolute conservative while a hundred was a pure liberal. According to Billings, Hernandez was a “three per cent, or max conservative,” on the scale at the time, while Billings was a “sixty per cent,” or a moderate liberal.","3454","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"The game, President Elect, was released in July of 1981, just three months after Hernandez had finished it. It simulated the final nine weeks of a Presidential campaign, from Labor Day to Election Night. Any election from 1960 through 1984 could be played out again, with the user acting as campaign manager, essentially, for a pre-programmed candidate—Jesse Helms, Geraldine Ferraro, George Romney—or an imagined one. New candidates were created by answering twenty-one questions about economic, social, and foreign policy—How does your candidate feel about the Cold War?—and then assigning scores, from one to ten, reflecting his or her speaking ability, poise, and personal magnetism. If you wanted to alter the historical scenario, you could tweak six external variables: inflation, unemployment, G.D.P. growth, war or peace, the mood of the country, and incumbency status.","3455","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"Once a candidate was chosen, the player guided him or her through a series of decisions during the course of nine turns: Where should the candidate travel abroad after declaring? How many “political-action points” should be spent on advertising? How will the campaign deal with random events, such as economic reports and national disasters?","3456","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"“It was quite primitive,” Hernandez said, “but for the dawn of the computer age, the predictive results seemed miraculous.” In 1984, the game predicted a huge landslide for Ronald Reagan in almost every scenario short of a national disaster. Sure enough, Reagan won forty-nine states and came within a few thousand votes of winning Minnesota, which was the home state of his opponent, Walter Mondale.","3457","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"Some criticized the game for being biased toward conservative candidates like Reagan. “But in reality,” Hernandez told me, “you had one of the most magnetic Presidents of the century against a below-average politician, in an economy that was roaring in 1984. The country’s mood was much more optimistic. So that year’s outcome was extremely predictable.” Ray Charles sang at the Republican National Convention that year. “The game didn’t simulate the Ray Charles effect,” Hernandez joked. “So, if anything, it was biased toward the Democrats.”","3458","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"In 1982, Hernandez received a phone call from someone who said that he liked the game and wanted Hernandez to join his fledgling company. It consisted of just six other people at the time, but their aim was to become the biggest entertainment-software corporation in the world in five years. “I thought he was nuts,” Hernandez said. “Anyway, I was legally bound to the Army for another three years, so it was out of the question.” The guy on the phone was Trip Hawkins, the founder of Electronic Arts—also known as E.A.

"President Elect became something of a cult favorite, selling forty-five thousand copies through its final iteration, in 1987, before Strategic Simulations discontinued it. In President Elect ’88, players could pick from sixty-nine pre-programmed Presidential candidates, including Joseph Biden, Bill Clinton, and Oliver North. It was also made available for the Commodore 64, the Atari ST, and computers running DOS, as well as the old Apple II.

"Hernandez bemoans the current state of Presidential politics, which he called a “high-stakes reality-game show.” “I most lament the complete absence of intellectualism in campaigns,” he said. Still, he said that he believes, with some adjustments, that President Elect could simulate the 2016 election: “I never appreciated what a great franchise I had and all the things that could have been done to elaborate the game design with the help of a better programmer.” Hernandez told me that, at this point, he thinks he could only be a “spiritual leader” for someone like Nate Silver, who could improve the predictive aspects of the game, while others could update its design by incorporating the changing demographics of the electorate, campaign financing, and other facets of contemporary campaign management. “Probably you’d need to design the game so that you could toggle different complicating elements: easy enough for a child or deep enough for a political scientist.

"In Hernandez’s view, the two most important factors in an election—both of them too subjective to be easily quantified—are a candidate’s magnetism and the country’s mood. “This cycle, the Democrats have a dearth of magnetic candidates,” he said. “Senator Sanders and Vice-President Biden are roughly at par and, in my estimation, average at best. Senator Clinton, on the other hand, is above average in public speaking and less prone to gaffes.

He has high magnetism but is terribly gaffe-prone. His speaking ability—a proxy for his debating skill—is average, which is to say, polarizing. But ideologically he is a cipher. Where things break down for Trump is that there are so many people who intensely dislike him for his perceived lack of substance or his brash New York style.

"Last Tuesday, a group of refugees, many of them Syrians, walked quickly through a field outside the Hungarian village of Röszke. They had broken out of what amounted to a holding pen, where the authorities had kept them, in increasingly desperate conditions, for days. They were going to Budapest and then, they hoped, on to Austria, Germany, or Sweden. When the police tried to bring them back, they started to run. Reporters were there, too, and, as a man carrying a preschooler raced past a camerawoman, she tripped him, and he and the child tumbled to the ground. Her move was caught on video; another clip shows her kicking a small girl, wearing green pants, her hair in a ponytail, as she runs by. (The camerawoman has reportedly been fired.) What may be most remarkable about the scene is that the girl maintains her balance and doesn’t look back. She keeps going.","3467","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/unopen-doors"
"“Everything which is now taking place before our eyes threatens to have explosive consequences for the whole of Europe,” Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, wrote in an op-ed earlier this month, and that is true, even if Orbán—who warns of Europeans becoming a minority in their own continent, their countries “overrun” and no longer Christian—is far from a reliable framer of the principles at stake. Many of the refugees are from Eritrea, Libya, Iraq, and Afghanistan, but a growing proportion are Syrian, and the sense of hopelessness about the civil war there is a key reason that their numbers are rising. At transit points like the Greek island of Kos, people are sleeping in the open, but the tensions are not restricted to Europe’s less wealthy margins. The Danish government took out ads in Lebanese newspapers telling potential refugees that it planned to make life harder for them, and briefly cut off its rail connections to Germany, in order to curtail their movement.","3468","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/unopen-doors"
"For some refugees, the journey to Europe began four years ago, when war broke out in Syria. They have spent months or years in crowded camps in Turkey, Jordan, or Lebanon, countries that have, together, taken in almost four million Syrians, putting stress on their political systems as well as on basic utilities. And yet the refugees’ presence seemed to strike Europeans as a sudden apparition, a late-summer storm. Harrowing images of a truck filled with bodies and of a toddler drowned on a Turkish beach were followed by scenes at Budapest’s central Keleti station, where thousands of refugees were kept from boarding trains to Western Europe. After many of them tried to head to Austria on foot, they were allowed for a time to proceed on buses and trains. On September 5th, they began arriving at Munich’s main station, where they were met by local volunteers bearing food, water, and, for the children, stuffed animals.","3469","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/unopen-doors"
"Under what’s known as the Dublin System, the E.U. country responsible for a given refugee is generally the one in which he or she first arrives. But differences in geography and generosity have created imbalances. Germany and Sweden have said that they will effectively put aside the Dublin restrictions in the case of Syrian refugees, and many migrants try to avoid registering until they can reach one of those nations. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has surprised many with her emotional appeals to Europe’s conscience, has announced that Germany expects eight hundred thousand applicants for refugee status this year, and her government said that the country can absorb up to half a million applicants a year for a period after that. Last week, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, presented a plan for redistributing a hundred and sixty thousand refugees now in Italy, Greece, and Hungary according to a quota determined by members’ population and wealth. (France would take thirty-two thousand; Poland thirteen thousand.) But Hungarians say that if refugees had no prospect of going farther—if they knew that they would be stuck in Hungary—they wouldn’t come to Europe at all. In this cramped view, Germany has precipitated the crisis. Orbán called the E.U.’s policy “madness.”","3470","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/unopen-doors"
"Perhaps there is a sort of madness at work, if that is what one calls the belief that a certain idea of Europe—democratic and at peace, chastened by the last century’s disasters, and without internal-border controls—is realizable. If so, it is a madness worthy of respect. (As well as improvement; the plight of Africans drowning in the Mediterranean has not mobilized public opinion in the way that the Syrians’ situation has.) But what about the idea of America? The best solution to the Syrian refugee crisis is an end to the Syrian war, but the elusiveness of that goal seems to have paralyzed the United States. Since the war started, this country has accepted just fifteen hundred Syrian refugees, not much more than arrived on a single train in Munich last week. Last Thursday, Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said that President Obama had told his staff that he wanted to “make preparations to accept at least ten thousand” Syrian refugees in the next fiscal year, which would count as a modest start.","3471","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/unopen-doors"
"The International Rescue Committee has proposed that the U.S. take sixty-five thousand Syrians, and some Senate Democrats, led by Amy Klobuchar and Dick Durbin, have supported that figure. Hillary Clinton, without naming a number, has suggested “an emergency global gathering.” The discussion, predictably, has become entangled in election-season posturing and alarmism. Jeb Bush, while acknowledging America’s historic status as a refuge, said that the President’s real job was to “take out Assad” and “take out isis.” Ted Cruz said that the refugees were better off in places closer to Syria, and Marco Rubio worried about terrorist infiltrators who might “sneak in.” Yet refugees seeking admittance to this nation are subjected to background checks and interviews far more thorough than those for ordinary immigrants. (The process, which can take years, should be speeded up.) Donald Trump, after going back and forth, arrived at the considered view that America has its “own problems.”","3472","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/unopen-doors"
"And yet America’s triumphs have come, and we have been most ourselves, when we have opened our doors, and we have been most ashamed when we closed them.

There was room for Neil Cavuto and Maria Bartiromo, two of FBN’s hosts, and for Gerard Baker, the editor of the Wall Street Journal.

"Near the beginning, John Kasich and Jeb Bush challenged Donald Trump on whether it is practical to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Later, Rand Paul got into it with Marco Rubio, questioning whether the Florida senator’s promises to build up the military and provide costly tax credits for moderate-income families could be described as conservative. (Rubio, as smooth as ever, insisted that they could.) There was even a discussion of too-big-to-fail banks and how to prevent a repeat of the collapse of 2008. It wasn’t a particularly coherent discussion, to be sure, but, at least, they talked about it.","3476","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"Unlike in the CNBC debate, where Rubio was the clear winner and Jeb Bush performed poorly, there were no obvious winners and losers on this occasion. Rubio and Cruz, who are by far the most polished debaters in this crowd, both fared well again, although they didn’t have it all their own way. Indeed, Cruz almost had a Rick Perry moment when he seemed to forget one of the five federal agencies that he has promised to abolish. Unlike Perry, who got caught in a similar predicament during one of the G.O.P. debates in 2011, Cruz saved himself by naming the Department of Commerce twice. (Note to young debaters: if you get stuck, repeat something you’ve said before. It doesn’t look good, but it’s a lot better than seizing up and jabbering incoherently, as Perry did.)","3477","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"In addition to putting Rubio on the spot, Paul, the libertarian senator from Kentucky, who started his campaign with high hopes, got in a few shots at Trump and probably had his best debate yet. So did Bush, which, admittedly, isn’t saying much. “You’ll see a different Jeb Bush,” Al Cardenas, one of his Floridian pals, had promised, and so we did—up to a point. In his first answer, Bush promised to repeal virtually every regulatory rule that President Obama has introduced and took a swipe at Hillary Clinton, earning himself a sympathetic cheer from the crowd. Then, after Kasich had torn into Trump’s deportation plan, describing it as a “silly” proposal that “makes no sense,” Bush stepped in and backed the Ohio governor up.","3478","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"Sending back twelve million immigrants, Bush said, “is just not—not possible. And it’s not embracing American values. And it would tear communities apart. And it would send a signal that we’re not the kind of country that I know America is.” Maybe it was the influence of his new media coach, but, for once, Bush seemed exercised. “Even having this conversation sends a powerful signal,” he went on. “They’re doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this. That’s the problem with this. We have to win the Presidency. And the way you win the Presidency is to have practical plans. Lay them out there.” With that, he moved briefly on to his own immigration plan, which includes a so-called path to citizenship for undocumented workers who obey the law.","3479","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"By Bush’s previous standards, this was practically Lincoln-versus-Douglas material. It also drew in Cruz, who, on this issue, is broadly aligned with Trump. After brushing aside a question about government spending, Cruz turned Bush’s words back on him, commenting, “You know, what was said was right. The Democrats are laughing—because if Republicans join Democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose.” While the mainstream media doesn’t often cover immigration as an economic issue, Cruz continued, “I can tell you, for millions of Americans at home watching this, it is a very personal economic issue. And I will say the politics of it will be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande. Or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press. Then we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation. And I will say for those of us who believe people ought to come to this country legally, and we should enforce the law, we’re tired of being told it’s anti-immigrant. It’s offensive.”","3480","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"Cruz, as I said, is a good debater. There is a larger point here, too, though. This brief exchange exhibited the ideological and policy gulf that divides the Republican Party and will make it so difficult for a candidate like Bush, Kasich, or even Rubio, who has also endorsed a path to citizenship, to win the G.O.P. nomination. The would-be reformers may have reason and practicality on their side, but Trump, Cruz, and Carson are harnessing the passion, anger, and resentment that motivates much of the party’s base.","3481","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"It is for this reason, perhaps, that the actual content of the debates (as opposed to the surrounding theatre) hasn’t mattered very much so far—at least as far as determining the leaders in the opinion polls. By any objective measure, Trump has put up two or three poor performances. Once again, last night, he drifted out of the discussion for extended periods. Even when he was involved, he sometimes seemed to be struggling with policy details. Asked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he delivered a lengthy rant about Chinese currency manipulation, only for Paul to remind him that China isn’t a signatory to the agreement. At one point, he snapped at Kasich, saying, “I don’t have to hear from this man, believe me.” And he complained about Carly Fiorina interrupting him, which came across as ungracious, to put it kindly.","3482","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"

Although they tend to struggle under cross-examination on policy questions, both of these first-time politicians are perfectly capable of delivering miniature versions of their stump speeches and of sticking it to the media. Last night, it was Carson’s turn to holler “J’accuse!” Referring to a spate of recent stories about supposed inaccuracies in his life story as he has told it, he said, “I have no problem with being vetted. What I do have a problem with is being lied about and then putting that out there as truth.”","3483","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"

"Last month, Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, announced before the United Nations General Assembly that the twenty-year effort to establish a Palestinian state through the Oslo process had failed. This declaration was long overdue. The Oslo Accords, which were signed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization and brokered by the United States, have been a disaster for Palestinians and a boon to those who wish to maintain Israel’s nearly half-century-old occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza. Their bitter fruits can be seen in the current upsurge in violence against Palestinians and settlers in the occupied territories.","October 12, 2015","3487","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/beyond-abbas-and-oslo"
"Oslo was not designed to lead to Palestinian statehood or self-determination, in spite of what the P.L.O.’s leaders at the time appear to have believed. Rather, it was intended by Israel to streamline its occupation, with the Palestinian Authority acting as a subcontractor. In Oslo and subsequent accords, the Israelis were careful to exclude provisions that might lead to a Palestinian political entity with actual sovereignty. Palestinian statehood and self-determination are never mentioned in the text, nor were the Palestinians allowed jurisdiction over the entirety of the occupied territories. Israel’s intention is even more clearly visible in the expansion of illegal Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, which followed the start of the Oslo process. There were fewer than two hundred thousand Israeli colonists in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem when negotiations began. Now, according to the Times, there are about six hundred and fifty thousand of them.","3488","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/beyond-abbas-and-oslo"
"The P.L.O. leadership, for its part, played a weak hand poorly. It failed to capitalize on the expertise that its delegation had accrued in Madrid and Washington in the two years prior, sending to Oslo inexperienced negotiators with little knowledge of the situation in the occupied territories or international law. As a result, Oslo reinforced rather than evened out the political imbalance between Israel, an undeclared nuclear power supported by the world’s sole superpower, and the Palestinians, a stateless people living under occupation or in exile. With the weight of the United States tipping the scales heavily in its favor—diplomatically, militarily, and through pressure on the Arab states—Israel was able to impose its will, entrenching an apartheid system in which millions of Palestinians live under military rule, with no rights or security, while Israel appropriates their land, water, and other resources. The only part of Oslo that was faithfully implemented, in fact, is the protection that the P.A. provides to Israel by policing its own people.","3489","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/beyond-abbas-and-oslo"
"In his U.N. speech, Abbas, one of Oslo’s architects, declared that he would no longer abide by its terms unless Israel stopped running roughshod over them. This declaration won’t mean much unless it’s translated into concrete action, like dissolving the P.A. or halting coöperation between the P.A.’s paramilitary police and the Israeli army. There is no indication of either of these things happening anytime soon.","3490","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/beyond-abbas-and-oslo"
"It is long past time to end the farce of a never-ending peace process that only increases Palestinian suffering. What is needed instead is a totally new paradigm, one based on a respect for international law, human rights, and equality for both peoples. As the Obama Administration has demonstrated with Cuba and the Iranian nuclear deal, taking a new and more just approach to long-standing, seemingly intractable problems can yield results. The same should be done with U.S. policy toward Israel-Palestine, despite the political pressure that is sure to be exerted by the Israel lobby to prevent any change to the status quo.","3491","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/beyond-abbas-and-oslo"

A growing number of them—particularly young people, people of color, and progressives—oppose unconditional U.S. support for Israel. Last December, a poll conducted by Shibley Telhami, a professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, found that thirty-nine per cent of Americans support imposing sanctions or “more serious action” on Israel over its refusal to stop settlement construction. And according to a Gallup poll from February, although sixty-two per cent of all Americans would support Israel over Palestine if asked to choose sides, that figure has dropped ten points among Democrats since 2014. Senior officials in the party would do well to take heed.","3492","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/beyond-abbas-and-oslo"

This external support, without which Israel’s occupation and settlement regime could not continue, needs to end if a just and lasting peace is to be achieved. Instead of delivering increased military aid to Israel—the country already receives the astronomical sum of three billion dollars a year, and President Obama promised more as consolation for the passage of the Iranian nuclear deal, which Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vociferously opposed—the United States could begin by making the aid conditional on respect for domestic and international law.

"The Bush Administration faced a similar problem when it tried to create the Free Iraqi Forces before its 2003 invasion. Congress allocated ninety-five million dollars for a training program by U.S. troops at Camp Freedom, in Hungary. The Iraqi opposition, led by Ahmed Chalabi, pledged to recruit thousands of exiles. In the end, it mustered about ninety-five men. Some U.S. officials nicknamed it the “million-dollar-a-man army,” and acknowledged that it would probably be insignificant in the war against Saddam Hussein. In one class of twenty-one recruits, many had paunches and gray hairs in their mustaches; the average age was forty-two.","3509","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/our-high-priced-mercenaries-in-syria"

The United States was forced to hurriedly withdraw its forces from both countries.) “Much of our debate on the Middle East, about what tools will be effective, has failed,” Katulis said. “We have not produced sustainable solutions.”","3511","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/our-high-priced-mercenaries-in-syria"

"In early 2013, the R.N.C., under its current chairman, Reince Priebus, produced a searching report that tried to make sense of Mitt Romney’s 2012 defeat. When the report was released, the biggest news was its frank dissection of the G.O.P.’s weakness among groups that voted overwhelmingly for Obama. “Public perception of the Party is at record lows,” the document noted. “Young voters are increasingly rolling their eyes at what the Party represents, and many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country.”","November 2, 2015","3515","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"But, beyond the demographic warnings contained in the report, Priebus’s team also cautioned that the Republican Party was living in a cocoon. The report said that the G.O.P. was “increasingly marginalizing itself” at the federal level. “The Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself,” the report said. “We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people, but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue.”","3516","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"One of the report’s less-well-known recommendations had to do with primary debates. The number of G.O.P. Presidential primary debates had grown from six in 1980 to twenty in 2012. Republicans wanted to gain some control over the process in 2016. “The number of debates has become ridiculous, and they’re taking candidates away from other important campaign activities,” the report noted. The report recommended that the G.O.P. sanction no more than ten to twelve debates, a recommendation that Priebus later implemented.","3517","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"

"Ultimately, the R.N.C. decided against setting up its own organization to run its debates. Instead, it stuck with the model of partnering with media organizations to conduct them, partly because of the high costs of running its own debates and partly because the R.N.C. worried that setting up its own debates might make the events less credible.","3519","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"All of this was decided long before any of the candidates announced their campaigns for President. (The Republican debate schedule was released in January, 2014.)

"Last week, after the CNBC debate that most of the candidates complained was unfair and featured hostile moderators, the campaigns finally revolted against the Priebus-negotiated debates. Representatives from most of the Republican Presidential campaigns met near Washington on Sunday night to wrest control from Priebus and the R.N.C. Today, they released a draft letter with their demands—which essentially consist of having their cake and eating it, too. The campaigns that sign the letter want the media to host and televise the events, but they want a level of control that they would get from running them and paying for them themselves. (Donald Trump is reportedly going to negotiate on his own.) The section of the letter that immediately caught the attention of many in the media was the following:","3521","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Most people would agree that the Republican (and Democratic) Parties should have some say in how the debates are run and organized. These are, after all, not just news events or typical media interviews. They are partnerships between the media and a political party. It’s fair that the mechanics of the debate, such as the format, length of time, rules, and the moderators, should all be up for negotiation. For instance, the R.N.C. asked its mainstream-media partners to add a conservative media outlet to the events, to insure that the questioning would reflect some of the issues important to Republican primary voters.","3522","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"But surely the red line for any media organization has to be editorial content. After all, the R.N.C. rejected the option of running these debates on its own. It is the media that is paying for the events, and it is over the media’s airwaves that the events are broadcast.","3523","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Of course, if the candidates don’t get their way, they don’t have to attend the debates. They could, as they have threatened to do, boycott future R.N.C.-sanctioned events, just as Donald Trump threatened to boycott the CNBC debate. (There’s a precedent for this. In 2007, the Democrats cancelled a Fox News debate, though in that case Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton did not demand to control any elements of Fox News’s editorial content as a precondition for participating in the event.)","3524","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"What the candidates shouldn’t be allowed to do is tell reporters what questions to ask or what graphics to show on the screen, or have any role whatsoever in the editorial judgments of a news organization.

"There was a moment early on during Thursday’s long-awaited Benghazi hearing when Hillary Clinton looked a bit uncomfortable. It came when the Republican congressman Peter Roskam, of Illinois, was asking the former Secretary of State about the debates that took place inside the Obama Administration in early 2011 about intervening in Libya, where Muammar Qaddafi was struggling to fight off an uprising.","October 22, 2015","3526","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Referring to internal memos and communications that have emerged from the countless inquiries into the September, 2012, deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans at U.S. installations in Benghazi, Roskam pointed out that a number of senior officials in the State Department were skeptical about the U.S. getting involved in Libya, as were Vice-President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. “You persuaded President Obama to intervene militarily,” Roskam said to Clinton. “Isn’t that right?”","3527","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"In her response, Clinton conceded that “there were concerns,” and that the decision had sparked vigorous internal discussion. But, she said, “at the end of the day, this was the President’s decision.” Ultimately, she explained, she’d recommended, based largely on “unprecedented requests” from America’s European allies and the Arab League, that the U.S. assist the Libyan rebels, and President Obama had made the call to carry this out, in a limited way.","3528","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Politely but firmly, Roskam said, “I think you are underselling yourself.” In the course of another exchange, he twice repeated his claim that the Libyan intervention was very much Clinton’s creation, ultimately arguing that she was the one who had overcome opposition within the State Department, won over the President, helped get the support of the Arab League, and led the fight to obtain the backing of the United Nations. “You saw it, you drove it, you articulated it, and you persuaded people,” Roskam said. “Did I get that wrong?”","3529","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Clinton couldn’t easily tell the congressman that he was mistaken, given that members of her own staff have portrayed her as an architect of the Libyan policy. Instead, she sought, as she often has in the past, to defend the intervention, pointing to the savagery of Qaddafi’s regime and the limited but decisive role played by the U.S. military.","3530","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Roskam interrupted her, affecting the look of a man who had just been asked to recall a recent root canal. With his time for questioning winding down, he described the current situation in Libya as “a disaster.” Clinton, doing her best to maintain a smile, said, “That’s not a view I will ascribe to.”","3531","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"As the hearing went on (and on, and on), this exchange was lost amid the endless back and forth about security arrangements in Benghazi, the conduct of the committee’s investigation, and, most ludicrously of all, some e-mails sent to Clinton by Sidney Blumenthal, a former political journalist who once worked at this magazine. By the time the hearing broke for lunch, with the Republicans and Democrats on the committee squabbling about whether to release transcripts of a closed-door interview that the panel conducted with Blumenthal in June, it was clear that Clinton was going to emerge largely unscathed. Trey Gowdy and his colleagues on the Select Committee had turned up nothing new—nada—that linked the former Secretary of State to the lax consular-security arrangements identified in previous reports, including one issued in 2012 by the State Department’s own Accountability Review Board.","3532","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"That was confirmed during the afternoon session, as the Republican questioners went over the same ground repeatedly. At one of the many low points, Roskam undermined his earlier points with a blatantly political attack, accusing Clinton of trying to spin Qaddafi’s overthrow to her own advantage and accusing her—shock, horror—of taking a “victory lap” on the Sunday talk shows.","3533","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Of course, none of this had anything to do with what happened in Benghazi. But, in the earlier jousting between Roskam and Clinton about the wisdom of intervening in Libya in the first place, it was possible to glimpse an alternative path that congressional Republicans could have taken over the past three years—a path that might have saved them from being accused (including by members of their own party) of conducting a witch hunt, and might even have served a public purpose. For while the former Secretary of State was perfectly right in saying that the U.S. goal of overthrowing a cruel dictatorship and promoting democracy was a noble one, and that the Obama Administration, in sending U.S. warplanes, was answering international calls for help, the current reality in Libya calls into question U.S. policy decisions. The country is a divided, chaotic, and war-torn place, where rival militias are competing for power and jihadist groups, including the Islamic State, control substantial pieces of territory.","3534","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Did Clinton and those of her colleagues who supported the 2011 intervention foresee any of this happening? What steps did they take to try and insure that Libya wouldn’t disintegrate after Qaddafi was gone? (Just this week, former Secretary of Defense Gates, who was opposed to the intervention, told the Daily Beast, “We were playing it by ear.”) How seriously did U.S. policymakers take the precedent of Iraq, where the United States and its allies overthrew another secular dictator with disastrous results? What lessons should we take from what has happened in Libya?","3535","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"These are all legitimate questions, and an old-school Republican authority on foreign policy—someone like Richard Lugar—would surely have been keen to gather answers to them. Even an old-school G.O.P. isolationist like Jesse Helms would probably have held hearings and inveighed against U.S. interventionism. In this case, though, pursuing such a strategy would have involved concentrating on the larger issues, and conceding that some Republicans, including senators John McCain and Mitch McConnell, supported U.S. action to help the Libyan rebels. It would also have meant dropping the Benghazi investigation once it became clear that there wasn’t any evidence tying Clinton directly to security failures.","3536","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Gowdy and his colleagues in the House were too small to go in this direction. They preferred to pursue a conspiracy theory that tarred the likely Democratic candidate in 2016, riled up the G.O.P.’s base, and helped the Party to raise money. With the enthusiastic backing of the conservative media, the G.O.P. inquisitors stuck to their self-allotted task even when it was obvious that they didn’t have the goods.","3537","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"All of this is now so obvious that it barely needs repeating. As the Benghazi hearing finally began to wind down, on Thursday evening, some conservative Republicans were probably content to have seen their representatives slinging more mud at Clinton in the hope that some of it would stick. Most ordinary Americans, after following the hearings online or watching the coverage on the evening news, will have been wondering what all the fuss was about. Setting aside the basest form of partisan politics, the answer was not very much at all.","3538","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"The moment Hillary Clinton seemed to realize that her testimony Thursday before the House Select Committee on Benghazi was not going to be a big problem for her or for her campaign came about forty-five minutes in. When the hearing opened, she had regarded the chairman, Trey Gowdy, of South Carolina, with irritated skepticism. She looked as if she might say something rash, if not throw something, and perhaps she might have. Nearly three years ago, in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Benghazi, she lashed out after having been asked many times about U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice’s comments on the Sunday talk shows about what had instigated the attack, on September 11, 2012, in which four Americans, including Chris Stevens, the Ambassador to Libya, died. “What difference, at this point, does it make?” Clinton demanded. Out of context, she sounded unmoved by the men’s deaths. Now, in the House hearing, it seemed to dawn on her that the proper response to her Republican interrogators was not outrage but pity.","3539","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"Peter Roskam, of Illinois, was laying out a scenario in which Clinton’s assumption of a leadership role on Libyan policy “didn’t come easy,” when he stopped and said, in case he might be overwhelming her, “I can pause while you’re reading your notes from your staff.” Clinton replied, “I can do more than one thing at a time, Congressman—thanks.” A minute or two later, Roskam said, “Go ahead and read the note if you need to.” This time, Clinton laughed. “I’m not done with my question,” Roskam said; he was just doing her a “courtesy.” “That’s all right,” Clinton responded, with a friendly wave of her hand. From then on, she was in control. “I’m sorry that doesn’t fit your narrative, Congressman. I can only tell you what the facts are,” she told Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who is the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. As he spoke, she rested her chin on the palm of one hand, as if he were not much more than a loud boor at a party who, puzzlingly, doesn’t seem to know how he sounds. When Lynn Westmoreland, of Georgia, informed her that he spoke slowly, Clinton laughed again and said, “I lived in Arkansas a long time. I don’t need an interpreter.”","3540","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"But in one sense she did need interpreters, and she got them. There was plenty of combat in the course of the hearings, but on Clinton’s side it was waged, for the most part, by the Democrats on the panel, who served as her anger translators. Elijah Cummings, of Maryland, repeatedly called out his Republican counterparts on conspiracy theories mooted and on inaccurate statements made, such as the charge that Clinton had personally turned down requests from Ambassador Stevens for more security. (“Four Pinocchios!”) Cummings, in his opening statement, asked why the committee existed at all. The answer that he suggested—“to drive down Secretary Clinton’s poll numbers”—seems almost a truism by now; indeed, it has been confirmed by a number of prominent Republicans in less guarded moments.","3541","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"There have now been seven full investigations of the circumstances surrounding the Benghazi attack, five in the House and two in the Senate. The Tampa Bay Times’s PolitiFact Web site noted recently that it was largely accurate to say that all the investigations found things that could have been done better (such as intelligence sharing) but none found “overt wrongdoing.” (Meanwhile, the Obama Administration’s larger Libya policy and its real failures have hardly been discussed.) Gowdy, whose defensiveness was palpable, said that his committee was better than the others: he has found more e-mails and more witnesses, even though they have led farther away from the burning compound in Benghazi.","3542","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"One such witness was Sidney Blumenthal, the writer and longtime Clinton friend. (He has worked for the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation and, in the nineteen-nineties, for The New Yorker.) Blumenthal sent Clinton a number of e-mails about Libya, some of which she passed on to others in the State Department. As a result, he was questioned by the committee, in a closed hearing, for almost nine hours, despite having no real knowledge of what unfolded in Benghazi; his name has become one that Clinton’s opponents obsessively allude to. “I honestly don’t understand this fixation,” Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, said.","3543","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"Gowdy’s rationale was essentially that the people in the State Department might have been as distracted by Blumenthal as he apparently is, and in a way that harmed national security. “It’s relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal’s drivel,” he said. (Gowdy was also bothered by the fact that one of Clinton’s aides, Huma Abedin, had sent her an e-mail about milk.) There is plenty to debate in Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server and the potentially overlapping interests of the State Department and the Clinton Foundation without lapsing into that sort of illogic. Any Americans who are not yet tired of hearing about Clinton’s e-mails may finally have had their fill. (As Representative Schiff said, “I feel like channelling Bernie Sanders.”)","3544","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"During this hearing, Clinton did convey that she saw Ambassador Stevens and the other Americans who died—Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty—as human beings. She spoke about sleepless nights spent worrying about diplomats’ safety and “racking my brain about what more could have been done.” Gowdy, speaking next, used his time to rail against Schiff, who, several minutes earlier, had called the hearing a “prosecution.” At one point, the proceedings turned into a shouting match between Gowdy and Cummings. Clinton straightened the papers on the table in front of her, pausing occasionally to contemplate Gowdy or to smile at Cummings. There were several more rounds of questions, in which her interrogators manifested all of Washington’s pathologies—dysfunction, partisan squabbling, insularity—in such extreme form that Clinton came across not only as a grownup, as her supporters had hoped, but as the most normal person in the room.","3545","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"Clinton has been immersed in politics for decades, and yet the panel managed to make the contrast between her manner and the ways of Washington look stark. She appeared to be a sensible outsider. At 7:15 P.M., nine hours after the hearings began, Martha Roby, of Alabama, asked Clinton about her movements when she went home on the night of the attack. “Were you alone?” she asked. Yes, Clinton said. “The whole night?” Clinton started to laugh once more. “I don’t see why that’s funny,” Roby said. Not funny, perhaps, but, like the Benghazi committee itself, absurd. ♦","3546","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"

And so the Super PAC named CARLY for America might seem refreshingly direct and candid—no-nonsense, something that Carly Fiorina, the candidate whom it supports, presents herself as being—unless, that is, one is passingly conversant with campaign-finance laws.","October 1, 2015","3547","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/carly-fiorina-and-her-friend-carly"
"The reason that Super PACs choose odd names is not that they are run by manipulative or secretive people—or not just because of that—but because the Federal Election Commission’s rules say that they can’t take a candidate’s name. The Supreme Court, in its Citizens United ruling, which ushered in the new Super-PAC era, did not leave many restrictions on the ability of wealthy donors to sponsor campaigns, but Super PACs are not supposed to “coördinate” their activities with the official campaign organizations—the ones that have limits on the amount that they can accept from any one donor. “Coördination” has become a hazily defined term, and often seems to serve mostly to keep up the appearance of distance, rather than the fact.","3548","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/carly-fiorina-and-her-friend-carly"

"The full, spelled-out name of the group may be somewhere on its Web site, but, if so, it is pretty hard to find, unlike the names CARLY and Carly Fiorina. (A search this morning didn’t turn it up.) The first thing that you see on the CARLY site is a pop-up with the heading “CARLY CRUSHED THE DEBATE,” then footage of and a quote from Fiorina. There is also a tab leading to a section called “From Secretary to CEO.” All this is similar to the campaign’s official site, Carly for President, where the “Meet Carly” page begins, “Only in the United States of America can a young woman start as a secretary and work to become Chief Executive of one of the largest technology companies in the world.” (In this week’s New Yorker, I write about why that story also isn’t quite what it seems.)","3550","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/carly-fiorina-and-her-friend-carly"
"The confusion is not just virtual: earlier this month, NBC noted that, at a Fiorina town-hall event in New Hampshire, CARLY staffers set up the signs and the tables, and even helped to “take down the chairs and clean up.” CNN reported that, after a similar event in Iowa, Fiorina explained to reporters that the CARLY people were, in effect, just passing by. “We publicize every event on my schedule, and anyone can come,” she said. “What you see happening is a Super PAC is organizing people. We’re not coördinating with them. We’re not asking them to. I don’t know what they’re doing, they don’t tell us what they’re doing.” And yet, CNN found that the only people handing out literature were affiliated with the Super PAC, raising the question of who the campaign thought would be performing such basic tasks if the CARLY people hadn’t shown up. When asked about that, Fiorina referred the question to the Super PAC. A spokeswoman, quoted by CNN, said, “We’re just helping to build the buzz.”","3551","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/carly-fiorina-and-her-friend-carly"
"If Carly and CARLY have a message, it is that stretching the rules to an absurd degree shouldn’t embarrass anyone. Not that her fellow candidates need to be told that. Jeb Bush directly helped Right to Rise raise about a hundred million dollars well past the time when it was clear that he was running for President, even though he hadn’t officially announced it. Indeed, that is why it took him so long to make the decision—he had to decide when to stop soliciting donations with no upper limit. (The last time that the Super PACs had to file real numbers, in July, CARLY had raised about three and a half million dollars; Fiorina’s debate performances and rise in the polls have undoubtedly changed the scale of financial interest.)","3552","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/carly-fiorina-and-her-friend-carly"

I asked whether the lack of consequences had changed the way campaigns acted. “I think the effect on behavior is that—and I’ve been told this by lawyers who practice in this area—many of the lawyers and the candidates understand that there is little enforcement or little likelihood of enforcement, and are much more likely to push the envelope and do things that in past years would be considered risky,” she said. (Ravel wouldn’t comment on Fiorina or any other specific candidate.) She did tend to think that, as a matter of “strategy,” if not principle, her Republican colleagues opposed the entire regulatory system, even when it was applied to Democrats; they had, at one point, blocked an investigation into how e-mail lists were transferred between a Super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton and one of her official campaign organization. Lately, Ravel had reconceived her mission as speaking to students, civic groups, and whoever would listen, to let them know “that I can’t do my job—and that it’s significant to them that I can’t.”","3554","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/carly-fiorina-and-her-friend-carly"
"The honeymoon for Pope Francis is over—at least in Rome. The first two weeks of the Synod on the Family have been characterized by open rebellion, corridor intrigue, leaked documents, accusations of lack of transparency, and sharp divisions among the bishops and cardinals. In the first real crisis of his papacy, Francis finds himself in the position of enjoying a rare degree of popularity among the public but facing an unusual degree of dissent within an institution generally so respectful of hierarchy.","October 16, 2015","3555","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/conflict-at-the-vatican"
"There was some inkling of this during the Pope’s triumphant visit to the U.S. “If a conclave were to be held today, Francis would be lucky to get ten votes,” a Vatican source told me at the time. “He gets an A-plus on public relations, but an F on all the rest.” This statement was certainly an exaggeration, but it reflected genuine unease within the Roman curia. An obvious sign of trouble came when the papal nuncio in Washington arranged for the pope to meet Kim Davis, the Kentucky state employee who refused to grant (or to delegate others to grant) marriage licenses to gay couples. The move—by a monsignor who is no stranger to Vatican intrigue and power politics—embarrassed the Pope and scored a couple of points for Church conservatives on the eve of the synod.","3556","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/conflict-at-the-vatican"
"Traditionalists in the Church were alarmed by some of the developments at the first session of the Synod, held last fall. Progressive cardinals and bishops—drawing on the work of the German theologian Walter Kasper—pushed an agenda that included the possibility of allowing divorced Catholics who had remarried to take communion, and a more open attitude toward both homosexuals and couples who lived together without marrying. They reintroduced the concept of “graduality,” so that unmarried, previously divorced, and gay couples, by demonstrating love and fidelity toward one another, could be seen as moving toward the gospel rather than simply “living in sin.” As the German cardinal Reinhard Marx put it, “Take the case of two homosexuals who have been living together for thirty-five years and taking care of each other, even in the last phases of their lives… How can I say that this has no value?”","3557","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/conflict-at-the-vatican"
"Pope Francis, while careful not to take sides, seemed to give his blessing to this position when he said that communion was “not a reward for the perfect but medicine for the sick” and mentioned that he had been reading the work of Cardinal Kasper. A preliminary report from the first synod reflected these relatively radical positions, but that language was beaten back in a counterattack by conservative bishops. In the final report, a passage about needing to recognize that homosexuals bring “gifts and qualities” to the church was replaced by bland language about avoiding discrimination against gays. Many tradition-minded bishops and cardinals felt that they had been ambushed by the first draft of the report, as is made clear by a recently published book, “The Rigging of a Vatican Synod?” by Edward Pentin, a journalist for the National Catholic Register, a news agency owned and operated by a conservative Catholic organization based in Denver, Colorado.","3558","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/conflict-at-the-vatican"
"This year, the traditionalists, evidently determined to avoid a second ambush, were on the offensive from the beginning of the synod. The Hungarian cardinal Péter Erdő , the synod’s relator general, came out against the concept of graduality on the Synod’s first day. “Between truth and falsehood, between good and bad, there is no graduality,” he said. Erdő also dismissed the idea of recognizing the long-term commitments of gay couples, saying that “there is no basis for comparing or making analogies, even remotely, between homosexual unions and God’s plan for matrimony and the family.” He was equally categorical that the only way for divorced Catholics to receive communion was by practicing strict sexual abstinence, “continence through the strength of grace.”","3559","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/conflict-at-the-vatican"
"The French cardinal André Vingt-Trois, speaking at a press conference with Cardinal Erdő, also wanted to rule out the possibility of substantive change. “Anyone who came here expecting a major change in doctrine will go home disappointed,” he said, and added, with surprising sarcasm, “You should not imagine that the Church is going to suddenly adopt the theories that Cardinal Kasper has been elaborating on the banks of the Rhine for some twenty years.”","3560","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/conflict-at-the-vatican"
"Erdő and Vingt-Trois’s objections were only the beginning. A few days into the synod, a longtime Italian Vatican reporter, Sandro Magister, published a private letter to the Pope, signed by some thirteen cardinals, harshly criticizing Francis’s handling of the synod. The letter, which was signed by the New York archbishop, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, complained that the working document for the Synod—the Instrumentum Laboris, which was prepared by the Vatican and approved by Francis—could not “adequately serve as a guiding text or the foundation of a final document.” The cardinals objected to the fact that, unlike last year, the members of the synod would not get to vote on each paragraph of the document and would have no voice in choosing the members of the drafting committee who would prepare the final report. The letter saw the synod as “lacking openness and genuine collegiality,” noting that a “number of fathers feel the new process seems designed to facilitate predetermined results on important disputed questions.”","3561","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/conflict-at-the-vatican"
"That more than a dozen cardinals would register a protest to the Pope even before the synod began was bad enough, but that someone would leak it to the press suggests a more toxic atmosphere. After the letter was published, Francis openly entered into the conflict, warning against “the hermeneutic of conspiracy,” which he characterized as “sociologically weak and spiritually unhelpful.”","3562","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/conflict-at-the-vatican"
"Francis, who until now has seemed rather shrewd in his management of Vatican politics, may have brought this on himself by committing a couple of strategic blunders. He has tried to introduce more democratic governance in an autocratic system without being sure that he had a genuine majority. And he encouraged openness and frank disagreement at the opening of the synod but has tried to hide the growing dissent in the ranks. Synod interventions, or speeches, have been limited to three minutes, and the Vatican has issued only very partial summaries of the proceedings. At the same time, individual bishops and cardinals have been free to speak with the press, meaning that there has been something of a free-for-all to control the public perception of the proceedings. The official Vatican line is that there is fundamental unity among the bishops, with sincere differences animated only by a common love of the Church. The divisions among “conservatives” and “progressives” are, the Vatican claims, an invention of the secular press. This is patently untrue. “There are very strong disagreements within the Synod,” the American cardinal Raymond Burke said in a press interview. Burke, who was excluded from this year’s synod after criticizing the Pope quite openly last year, said that he had spoken with a number of bishops who were present. “Given the discussion—I would find it difficult to believe that there wouldn’t be strong disagreement.”","3563","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/conflict-at-the-vatican"
"So Francis has allowed Church conservatives, who worked hard to squelch any genuine debate in the past, to play the role of the real democrats of the Church. “Which is kind of ironic,” Thomas Reese, a Jesuit priest, said in an interview on National Public Radio. “They’re saying that it’s being manipulated and preprogrammed when, in point of fact, all of the synods since the Second Vatican Council were manipulated and programmed but by the conservatives.”","3564","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/conflict-at-the-vatican"
"The synod is a purely advisory body meant to provide useful input to the Pope. But it is hard to image the Pope issuing a concluding report at radical variance to the views of so many prominent cardinals and bishops. The risk of having held the synod at all is that, after raising the hopes of so many, Francis will be forced to issue a final statement with a lot of vague rhetoric about openness and inclusion but no substantive doctrinal change: an elephant giving birth to a mouse. The alternative would be a document that risks provoking open revolt.","3565","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/conflict-at-the-vatican"
"In his first months in power, Francis seemed to adopt a clever strategy of sidestepping thorny doctrinal questions while adopting a language of inclusion. He famously said, of gay Catholics, “Who am I to judge?” but did not endorse any change in doctrine. Still, on the parish level, many gay Catholics reported a more welcoming atmosphere. It is not clear why Francis then felt compelled to call a synod to seek doctrinal clarity on these same issues, inviting the confrontation he had adeptly avoided. Either this has been a big mistake on the Pope’s part or, as some might contend, this is what the Pope had in mind all along. There are those who would say that, when it comes to doctrinal matters, Francis is a closet conservative—and others who would claim that reigniting the cultural wars within the Church was what he meant when he urged his followers to “hacer lío,” make some noise.","3566","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/conflict-at-the-vatican"
"Last month, Maria Isabel Perales Serna, an undocumented Mexican immigrant who’s lived in Texas for the past fourteen years, risked deportation to give a signed and sworn statement as part of a lawsuit against the state. Perales’s daughter was born last year in McAllen, Texas, but when Perales went to the Department of State Health Services to obtain a birth certificate she was turned away. (In Texas, hospitals issue a provisional document, and Health Services provides the birth certificate.) No one disputed her daughter’s legal status. The problem was that Perales herself did not have proof of identity the state would accept. Now her child is an American citizen without the papers to prove it. Hundreds, possibly thousands, of other parents across Texas are in the same bind. “I worry that, one of these days, they might think my daughter isn’t mine, and that they could separate me from my baby,” Perales said. “If someone kidnaps my daughter, what am I going to do without papers to prove that I am her mother?”","September 18, 2015","3567","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rule-of-law-in-texas"
"The denial of a birth certificate can have serious consequences. One mother involved in the lawsuit testified that, without her child’s birth certificate, her family no longer qualified for public housing. “The rent is now almost triple what it was before,” she said. The same was true for Medicaid. “How will I take care of the baby then, if he gets sick?” she asked. Another mother had to fight to get her son enrolled in the public school system. “They said that if we did not present his birth certificate within thirty days they would expel him,” she reported. One American child is stuck in Reynosa, a violent Mexican border town. Without a birth certificate (and, in turn, a passport), he is unable to return.","3568","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rule-of-law-in-texas"
"Birthright citizenship has come under fire this year from Republican Presidential candidates, egged on by Donald Trump. (Amy Davidson wrote about the issue this week.) Texas hasn’t denied the citizenship of these children, but it has effectively stripped away the rights that would go along with it. “Because of Trump, this is turning into a birthright-citizenship case, but that’s not what it is or ever was; not even the state can question whether or not these children are American citizens,” Efrén Olivares, a lawyer representing the mothers, told me. Joaquín Castro, a Democrat who represents San Antonio in congress, and who spent a decade in the Texas Legislature, said that the denial of birth certificates reminded him of the voter-I.D. laws that have passed in Texas and other states in recent years. “It’s mostly about putting up obstacles and creating impediments,” he told me. According to the lawsuit, which was filed by Texas Rio Grande Legal Aid and the South Texas Civil Rights Project, the state has “acted with the intent to discriminate against the Texas-born children on the basis of their parent’s immigration status, depriving the children of the rights, benefits, and privileges granted to all other citizen children.”","3569","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rule-of-law-in-texas"
"The problem turns on the matrícula consular, an identity card issued by the Mexican Consulate which is overwhelmingly used by undocumented immigrants. In Texas, the parents of an American-born child have to produce identification in order to secure a birth certificate. The list of acceptable documents includes a foreign or American driver’s license, an electoral card, and a national identity card. For undocumented parents, who may have lost everything en route to the U.S., most of these papers have either been stolen, lost, or expired, or else are impossible to get, making the matrícula their only option. (They could, in theory, have a foreign passport, but it would need an up-to-date American visa to be valid.)","3570","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rule-of-law-in-texas"
"For years, local registrars accepted the matrícula without incident, according to country clerks and lawyers across the state. In 2008, Texas officials wrote a letter to the Mexican Consulate in Austin, saying that the matrícula would no longer be accepted as proof of identity. (The official reason was concern that the matrícula could be used in identity theft. The Mexican government has since taken measures to improve the document’s security, but they have not influenced state policy.) Even so, local offices continued to exercise their own discretion, accepting matrículas and dispensing birth certificates.","3571","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rule-of-law-in-texas"
"Then, in 2013, immigration lawyers in South Texas started hearing from undocumented immigrants that their matrículas were being rejected. “These parents were one-hundred-per-cent shut out,” Jennifer Harbury, a lawyer with Texas Rio Grande Legal Aid, said. Health Services had begun to enforce a wider crackdown on matrículas. A Health Services official later told lawyers that the policy “was changed to keep undocumented persons from gaining legal status in this country.” The reports of rejected matrículas had started in the Rio Grande Valley, in South Texas, but soon they were coming from as far west as El Paso.","3572","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rule-of-law-in-texas"
"The timing was suggestive. Tens of thousands of unaccompanied children were streaming across the U.S. border from Central America in what President Obama called a “humanitarian crisis.” By the end of last summer, the number of children crossing the border alone had surpassed fifty thousand. The resulting strain on the immigration system led to an infusion of federal money to help shelter and process the children. It also gave rise to nativist conspiracy theories. Rick Perry, the Governor of Texas at the time, suggested that Democrats had somehow helped the children over the border. “How do you move that many people from Central America across Mexico and into the United States without there being a fairly coördinated effort?” he told a news program in June, 2014.","3573","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rule-of-law-in-texas"
"This spring, Texas Rio Grande Legal Aid and the South Texas Civil Rights Project filed their lawsuit against the state, representing four families: six children and four parents. “We thought, O.K., they’re going to give us the birth certificates for these kids, then quietly dismiss the case,” Efrén Olivares said. Instead, Texas fought back. The Attorney General’s office, which is representing the Department of State Health Services, requested that the suit be dismissed, invoking the sovereign-immunity provision of the Eleventh Amendment. Over the summer, twenty-one more families joined the lawsuit, and last month the Mexican government filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs, who are requesting an emergency injunction to force the state to allow two forms of identity documents to be used in place of the matrículas. “Our argument isn’t: yes matrícula, no matrícula,” Harbury told the Texas Tribune. “The argument is: What will you take that people can actually get? They have to take something. [The children] were born here. They are American citizens.” A hearing before a federal judge is scheduled for October 2nd.","3574","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rule-of-law-in-texas"
"The state’s decision to opt for a protracted legal battle over the use of the matrícula has raised questions about its intentions in the case. “It’s been brought to the attention of everyone who could possibly resolve the situation—even if it was flying under the radar before—and yet it doesn’t get resolved,” Denise Gilman, a law professor at the University of Texas, said. “This should be a no-brainer of a case that’s resolved quickly. That it hasn’t says something about reactions at high levels.” (The state has maintained that some of these birth certificates exist on file but cannot be given out without the proper documentation from parents.)","3575","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rule-of-law-in-texas"

However, I am hard pressed to imagine how its use in this context poses any threat of identity theft, fraud, or other abuse.” Daniel’s office was audited by the Department of Health in June, and she and her colleagues have since had to follow the new protocol.","3576","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rule-of-law-in-texas"

For a parent to become eligible for relief under DAPA, she must be able to prove that her child is a citizen, and for that she needs a birth certificate. Even if DAPA is implemented, Texas may be able to prevent the program from having its full effect. Two weeks after the President released his executive order, the Solicitor General of Texas denounced DAPA and justified his state’s opposition.

"But neither Reagan, nor Clinton, nor Bush made the “no sanctuary” policy a centerpiece of their national-security strategy. The idea of invading Afghanistan, absent a serious attack on American soil, seemed unreasonable. The authors of the 9/11 Commission Report wrote, in 2004, “Since we believe that both President Clinton and President Bush were genuinely concerned about the danger posed by al Qaeda, approaches involving more direct intervention against the sanctuary in Afghanistan apparently must have seemed—if they were considered at all—to be disproportionate to the threat.” The report added, “Insight for the future is thus not easy to apply in practice. It is hardest to mount a major effort while a problem still seems minor. Once the danger has fully materialized, evident to all, mobilizing action is easier—but it then may be too late.”","3606","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/isis-terrorist-sanctuaries-and-the-lessons-of-911"
"“No sanctuaries” became one of the central recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, which repeatedly warned that Al Qaeda, and groups like it, should never again be allowed to operate in a safe haven where they have “the operational space to gather and sift recruits,” especially in failed states. “If, for example, Iraq becomes a failed state, it will go to the top of the list of places that are breeding grounds for attacks against Americans at home,” the report noted. This was the year after the Bush Administration invaded Iraq, and three years into the war in Afghanistan, about which the report’s authors added, “Similarly, if we are paying insufficient attention to Afghanistan, the rule of the Taliban or warlords and narcotraffickers may reemerge and its countryside could once again offer refuge to al Qaeda, or its successor.”","3607","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/isis-terrorist-sanctuaries-and-the-lessons-of-911"
"Eleven years after the Commission’s report, ISIS is safely operating in a sanctuary the size of Indiana and, with the notable exception of Lindsey Graham, neither President Obama nor any Presidential candidate, whether Republican or Democrat, has put forward a detailed plan that would uproot ISIS from the territory it controls across Iraq and Syria. Even Jeb Bush, who on Wednesday said more American ground troops were needed to fight ISIS, did not propose a massive ground invasion, or not forthrightly. Like all of the candidates, he was disappointingly vague about how the military could solve the problem.","3608","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/isis-terrorist-sanctuaries-and-the-lessons-of-911"
"Indeed, President Obama is about the only public official to have honestly explained, in the days since the Paris attacks, why a quick end to ISIS’s sanctuary is not immediately possible. He mentioned those who “suggested that we should put large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground,” and then said,","3609","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/isis-terrorist-sanctuaries-and-the-lessons-of-911"
"And let’s assume that we were to send fifty thousand troops into Syria. What happens when there’s a terrorist attack generated from Yemen? Do we then send more troops into there? Or Libya, perhaps? Or if there’s a terrorist network that’s operating anywhere else—in North Africa, or in Southeast Asia? So a strategy has to be one that can be sustained.","3610","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/isis-terrorist-sanctuaries-and-the-lessons-of-911"
"In some quarters, Obama’s realism about defeating ISIS has been taken as defeatism. He is, the argument goes, clinging stubbornly to a strategy meant to gradually reduce the group’s footprint, while simultaneously pursing broader diplomatic goals in Iraq (convincing the Shiite-dominated government to make disfranchised Sunnis feel that they have a voice) and Syria (ending Assad’s reign and moving toward a transitional government) that he insists are the real roots of ISIS’s growth. His willingness, especially in the wake of a horrific attack, to withstand the pressure to offer a swift military solution is impressive.","3611","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/isis-terrorist-sanctuaries-and-the-lessons-of-911"
"And Obama has some surprisingly good company. “Once you take ’em, you own ’em,” former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean, who was the chairman of the 9/11 Commission, told me on Wednesday, after Jeb Bush’s speech. “Then you get called ‘the Crusaders’ and all that. We’ve put too much reliance on the military to the exclusion of other things. We have a whole realm of other tools at our disposal.”","3612","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/isis-terrorist-sanctuaries-and-the-lessons-of-911"
"That kind of careful response can be emotionally unsatisfying. At the same time, anyone offering an easy plan to defeat ISIS fast and on the cheap should be met with extreme skepticism. But one lesson of Iraq (and Libya) is that wars are always more complicated than they sound and often create new sanctuaries—which then also, somehow, must be destroyed.","3613","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/isis-terrorist-sanctuaries-and-the-lessons-of-911"
"I experienced Pope Francis’s brief trip to New York from three vantage points: as part of the crowd of hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, waiting to catch a glimpse of the holy visitor; as a consumer of media, watching the papal visit on my TV, computer screen, and Twitter feed; and as a talking head on a couple of the television channels that have been reporting, day and night, on the Pope’s five-day American visit. All three may offer keys to understanding this carefully choreographed papal visit.","September 25, 2015","3614","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/free-the-pope"
"First, I was in the throng of believers, well-wishers, and celebrity-seekers crowded on Fifth Avenue between Fiftieth and Fifty-ninth Streets, waiting to greet Pope Francis on his way to Saint Patrick’s Cathedral, on Thursday. A friend who had procured tickets kindly invited me to accompany him to the Mass there, only to discover that the ticket was not actually to the Mass but to the greeting along Fifth Avenue. This seemed like an odd “event,” but I went just the same. (I often exhort my journalism students to get out and see things for themselves, rather than stay home at their computers.) The security was intense—almost like boarding an El Al flight to Israel—and there was an hour of waiting to pass through it. Seven thousand extra police officers were deployed for the papal visit, apparently the most intensive security arrangements ever for a single visitor to the city. Those with tickets to the greeting were encouraged to come at three or three-thirty, even though the evening service at Saint Patrick’s wouldn’t begin until 6:45.","3615","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/free-the-pope"
"Having achieved the feat of passing through security, what were we there for? Essentially, waiting on a New York sidewalk for nearly three hours to catch a passing glimpse of the Popemobile. For some, it may have been a genuinely spiritual experience. A group near me chanted the rosary and said the Lord’s Prayer for about ten minutes, but you can only keep that up for so long. People played games on their cell phones, took selfies, and cheered every time a police vehicle passed by, to relieve the boredom. Some acted like people at a tailgate party and tried to get a group chant going, with one side of Fifth Avenue chanting “Pope” and the other side responding “Francis!,” but that, too, died down. For the most part, people simply stood and waited, with all the apparent spiritual longing of stranded commuters on a Metro North platform during an unusually prolonged delay.","3616","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/free-the-pope"
"When I asked the man next to me why he had come, he explained that his company had been offered a certain number of tickets, and he had quickly signed up for one. “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” he said. “I saw two other popes, John Paul II and Benedict, when they came here. Now I will see Francis.” People followed the Pope’s movements on their cell phones: He’s landed at J.F.K.! He’s boarded the helicopter!","3617","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/free-the-pope"
"Finally, the Pope reached Manhattan, and the Popemobile began to make its way down Fifth Avenue. The crowd burst into cheers, and almost everyone (myself included) took out their cell phones to document the event. It took the Popemobile approximately three seconds to pass by our particular stretch of sidewalk, and as luck would have it Pope Francis turned to the crowd on the other side of Fifth Avenue. I took his picture from the back, along with thousands of others.","3618","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/free-the-pope"
"As we walked away, a bit sheepish about having spent so long for so little, it was hard not to think of the scene in Michelangelo Antonioni’s film “Blow-Up,” in which the photographer protagonist wanders into a London club where a rock band is playing. When the amplifier malfunctions, the lead guitarist smashes his guitar (à la Pete Townshend, of the Who), and the crowd fights madly for pieces of the broken instrument. For no particular reason, the protagonist joins the scrum and manages with considerable effort to wrest away a substantial piece of the guitar. He then walks out of the club and, after a few blocks, looks at the piece of broken plastic in his hand and tosses it away.","3619","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/free-the-pope"
"The corps of experienced Vatican reporters know better than to attend these events. One of the dirty secrets of their trade is that, even when travelling thousands of miles on a papal trip, they watch almost all of the events on TV, knowing that they will see and hear better, and that the events have been scripted in order to be seen this way.","3620","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/free-the-pope"
"We had, predictably, been used as props in a stage-managed “pseudo-event,” a term coined by the historian Daniel Boorstin in his classic 1961 book “The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America.” By pseudo-event, Boorstin meant events that are created largely in order to be televised. Those of us with tickets to the papal greeting were effectively extras in a crowd scene, meant to provide a lively background in images of the Pope arriving at Saint Patrick’s, and we obliged, whether out of genuine devotion, attraction to celebrity, or a desire to be “part of history.”","3621","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/free-the-pope"
"On television, Pope Francis often seemed to be making a great effort to perform his assigned role. Quite understandably, he looked tired, and despite all the smiles and waves didn’t appear to be having much fun. (Boorstin wrote that “more and more news events become dramatic performances in which ‘men in the news’ simply act out more or less well their prepared script.”) One of Francis’s most appealing qualities has been his ability to transmit a sense of joy in his mission that gives substance to his words. Here, he slowly and dutifully marched through his English-language speeches, which read reasonably well as texts but were about as exciting to listen to as an audiobook read at half speed. Between the tight schedule and the even tighter security, there were few moments of breathing room for the Pope to be himself, in the form of off-the-cuff remarks or gestures.","3622","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/free-the-pope"
"That said, Francis did manage to insert into the script a few characteristic moments that the press could weave into a dominant narrative of his visit. He had lunch with homeless women at a Catholic shelter in Washington, D.C. He touched on the themes of climate change, immigration, and the death penalty before the Republican-controlled Congress. His homily at Saint Patrick’s (a more interesting talk) opened with a fraternal gesture toward the Muslim community and an expression of compassion for the pilgrims who were crushed to death in the recent stampede at Mecca. Perhaps a high point was when he addressed the nuns in the audience, telling them, “Women of strength, fighters, with that spirit of courage which puts you in the front lines in the proclamation of the Gospel … to you, religious women, sisters and mothers of this people, I wish to … tell you that I love you very much.” The truth is that Francis has not really broached the thorny issue of the role of women in the Church, but, given that the previous Pope placed the nuns of America under investigation for possible theological heresy, this at least felt like change.","3623","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/free-the-pope"
"At the United Nations, Francis gave a fairly substantive speech and hit other notes on his agenda. He addressed, at much greater length, his commitment to combating climate change and the need for a financial system with a social conscience, and made a positive allusion to the nuclear treaty with Iran.","3624","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/free-the-pope"
"In the TV studio where I listened to the U.N. speech, Katie Couric wanted to draw a political scorecard of the visit, suggesting that, on balance, Pope Francis had given Barack Obama and the Democrats a lot to be happy with—the emphasis on climate change, the exhortation to treat immigrants from Latin America with compassion, the plea to eliminate the death penalty. The clergymen on the show, Bishop Christopher Coyne and Monsignor Rick Hilgartner, insisted that the Pope’s message was strictly spiritual and cut across all political lines.","3625","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/free-the-pope"
"Secular and religious commentators all seemed to agree, however, that the Pope’s visit has been “amazing,” “extraordinary,” “wildly popular,” “a huge success”—even if, to some, the Pope appeared to be wearily turning in a somewhat pro-forma performance. The real success, of course, has been his first two years as Pope, which have created an extremely positive media narrative of his papacy into which this visit could be neatly fit.","3626","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/free-the-pope"
"At about nine-thirty on Wednesday morning, President Obama and his wife, Michelle, were standing at the South Portico of the White House waiting for their guest to arrive.* A big, black Secret Service S.U.V. pulled up, one of the type favored by entertainment moguls and Manhattan limousine services, which weigh more than five thousand pounds and get about seven or eight miles to the gallon, on a good day.","September 23, 2015","3627","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-francis-and-his-little-fiat"
"Behind the huge gas guzzler, there was a little black Fiat 500L, the same car had ferried Pope Francis into town from Joint Base Andrews on Tuesday afternoon. Apart from the fact that it bore the license plate SCV 1, denoting it as the first vehicle of the Vatican City (“Status Civitatis Vaticanae”), it looked like any other 500L—a 1.4-liter, somewhat elongated version of the iconic Fiat 500, which gets about thirty-five miles to the gallon and costs around twenty thousand dollars. A Marine sentry held open the rear door on the passenger side, and the seventy-eight-year-old Pope climbed out to greet the President. He’d been in the United States, which accounts for about a fifth of the world’s total oil consumption, for only about eighteen hours, and up to that point hadn’t said a word in public. Already, however, he had delivered a message.","3628","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-francis-and-his-little-fiat"
"That’s how this Pope often operates—through symbolism and gestures that convey his intentions in ways that words never could. As the theological leader of the faithful, his primary job is to define and redefine Catholic teaching for the twenty-first century, which, like his predecessors, he does partly by issuing written exhortations and encyclicals. In November, 2013, just more than eight months after succeeding Pope Benedict XVI, he issued a two-hundred-and-twenty-page challenge to global capitalism, wherein he said, “Just as the commandment ‘Thou shalt not kill’ sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life, today we also have to say ‘thou shalt not’ to an economy of exclusion and inequality.” (Rush Limbaugh dismissed the document as “pure Marxism.”) In June of this year, the Pope released a lengthy encyclical on climate change, parts of which read as if they had been written by Al Gore and the editors of The Nation. “The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth,” the encyclical said. It criticized our throwaway consumer culture, called for the world to undergo an “ecological conversion,” and demanded binding steps to limit carbon emissions, as well as global efforts to save the oceans and other threatened natural environments.","3629","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-francis-and-his-little-fiat"
"For good reason, these tracts have drawn a great deal of attention from scholars, commentators, and politicians—some of it supportive, some of it critical. Indeed, Pope Francis’s visit to the United States is all the more fascinating because it is taking place during a Presidential campaign, and much of what he has said on the subject of economics and the environment runs directly counter to the doctrines of the modern Republican Party. On other subjects, however, such as abortion and gay marriage, he has retained teachings that many Democrats finds odious.","3630","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-francis-and-his-little-fiat"
"But that is mere partisan politics. What has lifted Pope Francis above the political fray and reinvigorated his office in a way that could barely have been imagined under Pope Benedict, is his peerless ability to convey to ordinary people of all religions and political views his version of Catholicism—a version based largely on the life and teachings of Saint Francis of Assisi, the founder of the Franciscan Order. From choosing to live in a modest guest house, rather than the Apostolic Palace, to washing the feet of a young Muslim prisoner, to inviting dozens of homeless people to tour the Sistine Chapel, Pope Francis has lifted up the papacy by puncturing its grandeur, infusing it with humanity, and, where necessary, cleverly exploiting the power of imagery.","3631","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-francis-and-his-little-fiat"
"That’s where the Fiat 500L comes in. Back in July, 2013, Francis instructed Catholic priests to drive modest vehicles. ”It hurts me when I see a priest or nun with the latest-model car,” he said. ”You can’t do this. A car is necessary to do a lot of work, but, please, choose a more humble one. If you like the fancy one, just think about how many children are dying of hunger in the world.” The same month, he was spotted arriving at a papal summer house in a five-year-old Ford Focus. On previous foreign trips, too, he has largely foregone limousines or specially constructed security vehicles. When he returned to Latin America for the first time since being elevated, he was driven around Rio de Janeiro in a silver Fiat Idea, a model that is popular with middle-class Brazilians. (It has become even more popular since his visit.)","3632","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-francis-and-his-little-fiat"

"Over the past few days, as family members of the nine people killed by a gunman at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, prepared to bury their loved ones, many of the G.O.P. candidates for President have been offering their thoughts on what to do—or, rather, what not to do—about gun violence.","October 7, 2015","3635","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Let’s start with Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who is currently running second, behind Donald Trump, in the G.O.P. polls. Participating in an exchange on Facebook on Monday night, Carson recalled removing bullets from gunshot victims, and added, “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” On Tuesday morning, Carson went on Fox News and said, “It’s the person behind the gun. Guns don’t kill people.” He didn’t stop there. Asked what he would do if a gunman walked up to him, put a gun to his head, and asked him what his religion was, Carson replied, “I’m glad you asked that question. Because not only would I probably not coöperate with them, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’ ”","3636","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"It’s hard to believe that anybody, let alone a politician running for national office, would insult the victims of a massacre by suggesting that their response had been inadequate. About the most that can be said for Carson is that he isn’t a professional politician: he’s a novice. So is Trump, who, on Tuesday, described himself as a “very big Second Amendment person,” and suggested that the problem in Umpqua was that no one on the scene, apart from the twenty-six-year-old shooter, was armed. (At least one student, an Army veteran, was carrying a gun, a few buildings away.) Trump also said that he opposed a ban on assault weapons—a proposal that he expressed support for in 2000.","3637","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"

"Bush’s “stuff happens” line, which he uttered in South Carolina on Friday, has already entered the political lexicon and provided a gift to the Democrats. Rather than rehashing the debate about whether the remark was taken out of context (it wasn’t), let’s examine what Bush has said since then. After all, he’s had five more days to clarify how he would tackle gun violence. On Monday, he released a new campaign video, which said nothing about what happened in Oregon. On Tuesday, he published an op-ed in the Des Moines Register, which also didn’t bring up the massacre or its aftermath. Then, on Tuesday night, Bush delivered a long speech at a Republican dinner in Iowa. Once again, he made no mention of Umpqua or guns.","3639","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Perhaps that is not surprising. The recipient of an “A+” rating from the National Rifle Association, Bush, during his time as governor of Florida, vigorously opposed efforts to expand gun control, and signed into law the notorious “Stand Your Ground” law. Marco Rubio, who is now leading Bush in most polls, is perhaps a more interesting case. Back in 2000, when he was running for a seat in Florida’s House of Representatives, Rubio said that he supported “reasonable restrictions” on gun sales. And after the Sandy Hook massacre, in December, 2012, Rubio’s spokesman said that Rubio would support measures to keep guns out of the hands of felons and the mentally ill.","3640","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Since then, though, Rubio has backtracked and cozied up to the N.R.A. While campaigning in Iowa on Friday, he said, “Criminals don’t follow gun laws. Only law-abiding people follow gun laws.” On Tuesday, appearing on NBC’s “Today” show, he said, “The laws that many are proposing would have done nothing to prevent these attacks.” Rather than focussing on measures like expanding background checks for gun purchases, “the country should examine mental illness.”","3641","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Many of the other G.O.P. candidates took a similar line. “The problem is mental illness and not necessarily gun registration or gun ownership,” Rand Paul said in a radio interview. Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” Chris Christie told George Stephanopoulos, “I’m very concerned about the mental-health side of this.” On CNN’s “At This Hour,” Mike Huckabee said, “Do we need to do a better job in mental health?

No. Fiorina, too, is a loyal supporter of the N.R.A., whose annual meeting she addressed earlier this year in a campaign-style video, boasting about her husband’s concealed-carry permits and saying, “When government takes away our guns, we are headed down a dangerous path.” On Friday, Fiorina criticized President Obama’s impassioned call for action, describing it as “premature, at best,” and “at worst, a really unfortunate politicization of this tragedy.”","3643","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"That was the pretty much the same thing Fiorina said in June, after Obama reacted to the mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. In fact, this is now the standard Republican/N.R.A. line. Each one of these massacres is regrettable and demands further study. But anybody who states the blatantly obvious—that countries with strict guns laws don’t have this problem—is politicizing the issue; they should either zip it, or confine themselves to expressing concern over mental illness.","3644","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Of course, as HBO’s John Oliver pointed out over the weekend, talking about mental illness is largely a diversion, which distorts the facts about gun violence and serves to preserve the status quo. In 2013, during the Obama Administration’s effort to get some relatively minor gun-control laws through Congress, the White House proposed increasing the funding for mental-health programs and other initiatives designed to identify and help people who are potentially dangerous. Republicans in the Senate blocked the gun-control measures anyway, and no doubt they’d do the same this year if Obama were to send over a similar bill. On this issue, elected G.O.P. officials aren’t interested in reason or compromise. They are interested, primarily, in avoiding a challenge in the next election from an N.R.A.-backed candidate.","3645","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"In a sense, there’s nothing new here. For decades now, the N.R.A. and the rest of the gun lobby have had a grip on the Republican Party. But as the number of gun massacres has increased the consequences of this political capture have become harder to ignore. Now, in the full glare of a Presidential election, they cannot be avoided. Rather than engaging in an honest effort to address gun violence and prevent more senseless carnage, practically every G.O.P. candidate has been reduced to repeating a mantra that many of them, surely, cannot fully believe.","3646","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"

"One day last fall, Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, appeared on “Meet the Press” to talk about the tense relationship between many African-American communities and the police departments charged with protecting them. In Ferguson, Missouri, the governor had declared a state of emergency as a grand jury considered whether to indict Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American. (In the end, Wilson was not indicted.) Chuck Todd, the host, asked about white officers patrolling African-American neighborhoods, but Giuliani wanted to talk about crime, not punishment. “I find it very disappointing that you’re not discussing the fact that ninety-three per cent of blacks in America are killed by other blacks,” he said, adding, “It is the reason for the heavy police presence in the black community.” The next day, on Fox News, Giuliani said that protesters who chanted “Black lives matter!” should be supporting police officers, not demonizing them. He suggested that the people who really valued black lives were people like him, who worked to reduce the African-American murder rate. “When I came into office, thousands of blacks were being killed every year,” he said. “By the time I left office, it was down to about two hundred.”","3648","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"These comments inspired a backlash, but they were not, in themselves, surprising. Giuliani has never evinced much sympathy for critics of the police; in 2007, when he launched his Presidential campaign, his law-and-order approach helped make him, for a time, the most popular candidate in either party. But the national mood has grown less punitive, and when Giuliani made his remarks last year few allies emerged to support him. Many Republicans, including John Boehner, the Speaker of the House, now say that they support criminal-justice reform; Jeb Bush has signed a reform pledge affirming that prison sentences are “not the solution for every type of offender.” And, among Democrats, fears of being labelled soft on crime seem to have subsided since the nineteen-nineties. As First Lady, Hillary Clinton called for “tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders” while campaigning for her husband’s 1994 crime bill; the law instituted “three strikes and you’re out” sentences, and the federal-prison population almost doubled over the next ten years. But in Clinton’s current Presidential campaign she calls for reforming the police and ending “mass incarceration.” In response to pressure from protesters, she has used the phrase that has come to signify outrage at police brutality: “Black lives matter.”","3649","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"

Coates, a writer for The Atlantic, has been chronicling recent police killings, and he has responded with a polemic, in the tradition of James Baldwin, that takes the form of a lyrical letter to his fourteen-year-old son. Coates lists Michael Brown alongside other recent victims: Eric Garner, John Crawford, Tamir Rice, Marlene Pinnock. He writes, “You know now, if you did not before, that the police departments of your country have been endowed with the authority to destroy your body.” And he reminds his son that this destruction is so often unpunished as to be tacitly sanctioned:","3650","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"

One of the most severe lines in the book is also one of the most frequently quoted: “In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body—it is heritage.”","3651","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Four decades ago, a number of black leaders were talking in similarly urgent terms about the threats to the black body. The threats were, in the words of one activist, “cruel, inhuman, and ungodly”: black people faced the prospect not just of physical assault and murder but of “genocide”—the horror of slavery, reborn in a new guise. The activist who said this was Oberia D. Dempsey, a Baptist pastor in Harlem, who carried a loaded revolver, the better to defend himself and his community. Dempsey’s main foe was not the police and the prisons; it was drugs, and the criminal havoc wreaked by dealers and addicts.","3652","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Dempsey is the most vivid character in “Black Silent Majority” (Harvard), a provocative new history by Michael Javen Fortner, a professor of urban studies who wants to complicate our understanding of crime and punishment in black America. He points out that while African-Americans have long been disproportionately arrested and incarcerated for committing crime, they have also, for just as long, been disproportionately victimized by it. His focus is New York in the nineteen-sixties and early seventies, when crime rates shot up, creating a demand in African-American communities for more police officers, more arrests, more convictions, and longer prison sentences. The book begins near the end, on a January day in 1973, when Dempsey joined Governor Nelson Rockefeller at a press conference in support of what became known as the Rockefeller drug laws—a passel of anti-drug statutes that helped make New York a mass-incarceration pioneer, increasing the number of “friskings, detainings, beatings, and humiliations” that Coates writes about.","3653","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Like many scholars and activists, Fortner is profoundly disturbed by our modern system of criminal justice, calling mass incarceration “a glaring and dreadful stain on the fabric of American history.” But he thinks this history is incomplete if it ignores what he calls “black agency”: he wants us to see African-Americans not merely as victims of politics but as active participants in it, too. At a moment of growing concern about how our criminal-justice system harms African-Americans, Fortner seeks to show that African-American leaders, urged on by members of the community, helped create that system in the first place.","3654","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Last year, Coates used his blog to host an online book club devoted to Michelle Alexander’s unsparing “The New Jim Crow,” which came out in 2010 and is still finding new readers. Alexander is a law professor at Ohio State who was radicalized by her time at the American Civil Liberties Union, where she battled racial profiling. She eventually concluded that bias was inherent in the criminal-justice system, and that the system relegated African-Americans to second-class citizenship. The book’s focus was the war on drugs, which helped produce this country’s enormous prison population. She noted that President Reagan made fighting drugs a priority even before anyone was talking about the crack-cocaine epidemic of the nineteen-eighties, and she showed that penalties were disproportionately applied to African-Americans, even though blacks and whites used and sold drugs at roughly equal rates. She argued, convincingly, that our punitive solution to the trade in illegal drugs was an overreaction, and one that would never have been tolerated if more of its victims had been white. She urged activists to fight back in explicitly racial terms, demanding that prison rolls be slashed and police departments remade, not merely in the name of pragmatic reform but in the name of black liberation. In many ways, the Black Lives Matter movement is an answer to her call.","3655","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Coates shares Alexander’s skepticism about law-and-order rhetoric, and he is especially critical of what he has called the “Gospel of Giuliani,” which parries complaints about police and prisons with scary statistics about black people killing black people. In Coates’s view, the term “black-on-black crime” ignores the fact that most violent crime is intraracial, and also obscures the government policies that gave rise to segregated African-American neighborhoods and their high crime rates. “To yell ‘black-on-black crime’ is to shoot a man and then shame him for bleeding,” he writes. The formulation, he believes, encourages us to imagine that something is wrong with black people, instead of seeing that something is wrong with America.","3656","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Coates writes with a preacher’s sensitivity to the rhythms and patterns of language, and of history, too, which means that he slips almost imperceptibly between piercing outrage and something close to fatalism. In his previous book, “The Beautiful Struggle,” Coates described how his boyhood was shaped by his father, Paul Coates, an independent scholar and publisher whose booklist is a bibliography of black liberation. Theirs was not a religious household, and Coates has kept faith with faithlessness, which helps explain his profound distaste for the notion that African-American stories must be redemption stories—what, exactly, makes us think that we shall overcome, some day? “Perhaps struggle is all we have because the god of history is an atheist, and nothing about his world is meant to be,” Coates tells his son in the new book, by way of explaining the importance of fighting a system that can scarcely be fought, let alone beaten.","3657","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Alexander has been accused, credibly, of underplaying the importance and the cost of crime. (Her book begins with the example of Jarvious Cotton, one of more than two million African-Americans who are ineligible to vote because of a felony conviction. She does not mention that Cotton was convicted of murder for the killing of a seventeen-year-old during a mugging.) Coates, though, writes eloquently about common crime, especially in “The Beautiful Struggle.” Readers who come to his first book by way of his second may be taken aback not only by its seriocomic tone and hip-hop-inflected language but also by its vivid evocation of Coates’s boyhood on the gruelling streets of Baltimore. In one memorable passage, he paid dark tribute to the guys from a West Baltimore housing project called Murphy Homes, summoning the fear he felt and the reverence, too:","3658","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"“The Beautiful Struggle” was, no less than its successor, a book about black bodies in peril, although the threats tended to come from within the community. In this world, the police were a menacing presence—after Coates got in trouble in school, his father gave him a beating, asking his mother, “Who would you rather do this: me or the police?”—but Coates seems to have been more concerned about the Murphy Homes boys and the others like them. At one point, he noted that in 1986 there were two hundred and fifty murder victims in Baltimore. “That year,” he wrote, “my man Craig was butchered on his way home from work.” It was a piercing moment, but readers expecting an elegy got, instead, a few terse biographical sentences, as if Coates were underscoring the ghastly banality of this loss.","3659","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Between the World and Me,” Coates shifts his focus from the neighborhood to the nation. The book is given shape and weight by the story of another friend who was killed: Prince Jones, a college acquaintance, shot by an African-American police officer while sitting, unarmed, in his jeep, which apparently matched the description of one driven by a suspect in the theft of a police gun. Coates emphasizes the violence done to the black body to help us see the physical abuse that undergirds broad structures of oppression. Of course, Craig had a body, too, and it was destroyed in a manner far more commonplace. In “Between the World and Me,” the “black body” refers, as well, to the black body politic. When a police officer shoots and kills an unarmed African-American—especially when the officer isn’t charged with a crime, as Michael Brown’s killer was not, and Prince Jones’s killer was not—he is, Coates wants us to understand, proving the continued existence of a system in which African-Americans are victimized by state power and are powerless to demand accountability. A black college student is a body, but he is also a citizen, and this explains why, even in violent neighborhoods, some kinds of violence seem, to Coates, particularly salient: because they threaten not just the body of the victim but his citizenship, too.","3660","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Michael Javen Fortner grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and his boyhood sounds even more chaotic than Coates’s. “I was only a couple of years old when one of my brothers was stabbed to death,” he writes. “I do not remember him, but the pain and sorrow of that day stayed in my home like accumulated dust.” He thinks that analysts like Alexander, in their eagerness to indict systemic injustice, sometimes downplay the “black agony” that characterizes many neighborhoods where brutal crime is ubiquitous. Black political activists present history in ways that emphasize racial solidarity, but Fortner says that the Brownsville he remembers was “a community at war with itself”:","3661","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"It was Richard Nixon who popularized the phrase “silent majority,” as a way of insisting that the countercultural masses protesting the Vietnam War constituted nothing more than an outspoken minority. In positing the existence of a “black silent majority,” Fortner draws on the work of Charles V. Hamilton, an African-American political scientist and the author, with Stokely Carmichael, of “Black Power.” In 1970, Hamilton published an article in the Times Magazine about the mass of black Americans who were concerned about crime. “They want police protection, not police persecution,” he wrote, “and because they believe that the incidence of the latter is greater than the former, they believe the present law-enforcement systems must be viewed suspiciously, rather than optimistically.” In an essay about Harlem, James Baldwin wrote, “The only way to police a ghetto is to be oppressive.” He portrayed the officers as an occupying force: “Their very presence is an insult, and it would be, even if they spent their entire day feeding gumdrops to children.”","3662","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Plenty of citizens and politicians made a different calculation, concluding that the risks of persecution were outweighed by the urgent need for protection. In nineteen-sixties Harlem, heroin addiction was increasing steeply, and street crime had become so common that some churches cancelled evening services, to protect parishioners from being set upon as they returned home. Drug crime strained the relationship between black leaders and white liberal allies, who wanted to combat the drug trade with medical treatment, not criminal penalties. In 1962, Oberia Dempsey led a coalition of civic leaders who asked President Kennedy to “mobilize all law-enforcement agencies to unleash their collective fangs on dope pushers and smugglers.” A group convened by the civil-rights leader A. Philip Randolph urged that “a life time sentence without parole be made the punishment to meet the crime of pushing narcotics.” Testifying at a state hearing in 1969, Hulan Jack—a black state assemblyman representing Harlem, and the former Manhattan borough president—called for life imprisonment for the crime of mugging, and argued that the system of incarceration was not nearly mass enough. (The prison population had been declining despite a sharp increase in arrests.) A 1973 Times poll found that “about three-quarters of New York’s blacks and Puerto Ricans” thought that life without parole was the proper sentence for convicted drug dealers.","3663","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Rockefeller’s drug laws sharply increased the penalties for various drug crimes; possession of four ounces of heroin, for instance, would result in a minimum sentence of fifteen years to life. (In the two decades that followed, the prison rolls in New York quintupled; other states followed, creating a nationwide prison boom.) But Reverend Dempsey, the militant Baptist standing behind Rockefeller on that January day, was not representing the black political establishment. Many of the leaders and groups in Fortner’s book were careful to pair calls for more police with calls for police reform, mindful of the possibility that the “fangs” of law enforcement might sink into the wrong necks. The Rockefeller drug laws passed with hardly any help from black legislators, all but one of whom voted against them. When it counted most, black political support melted away. Fortner hastens to explain that many Democratic legislators had partisan concerns (the bill’s passage was viewed as a Republican victory) and distinct cultural identities—black political élites, he writes, tended to be more optimistic about Harlem than their working- and middle-class constituents were. He points out that a number of community leaders stood with Dempsey to support the bill. And he establishes that black politicians and clergymen helped raise the alarm about drug crime in the first place. Even so, the vote makes it hard to conclude that black political support was decisive in the passage of the Rockefeller drug laws.","3664","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Fortner’s narrative mainly reveals the bleakness of the choices facing black voters and their representatives in those tempestuous years. Statewide rehabilitation efforts had failed, owing in part to lack of funding, and so many civic leaders viewed a new punitive regime as an improvement: it wouldn’t help reform the addicts or dealers, but it might help protect everyone else. A decade later, during the crack years, African-Americans in Congress faced a similarly difficult choice in considering the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. The law established a minimum sentence of five years for trafficking five hundred grams of cocaine or five grams of crack cocaine. Years later, activists criticized this hundred-to-one disparity as unfair to African-Americans, who were more likely to be convicted of selling crack cocaine. But the bill passed with support from two-thirds of the African-Americans then in Congress, including Charles Rangel, from Harlem, whom President Reagan singled out for praise during the signing ceremony.","3665","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"None of this directly refutes Alexander’s argument that the modern carceral state is a new version of Jim Crow. Indeed, Fortner thinks that black leaders, though right to be concerned about crime, were wrong to think that exorbitant mandatory sentences—rather than better-funded rehabilitation programs and structural anti-poverty efforts—were the answer. (Rangel later worked to end the crack-versus-cocaine disparity.) When Alexander calls our criminal-justice system “the new Jim Crow,” she is drawing an imperfect parallel that tells us more about what this system does than about why it exists. It is possible, as Fortner shows, to be skeptical of the drug war while also noting that no small number of its supporters believed, as fervently as any activist today, that black lives matter.","3666","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"On April 12th, in Coates’s native Baltimore, police officers on bicycles noticed an African-American man named Freddie Gray, who saw them watching him and fled. They caught him, found a small knife, arrested him, and put him in a police van to take him to the station. By the time the van arrived there, Gray was unconscious, with his spine nearly severed, and after a week he died from his injuries. The legal reaction came quickly: on May 1st, prosecutors brought charges against six officers, one of whom was charged with second-degree murder. But the first protest began even before Gray died. The uproar seemed to inspire police officers to work more cautiously and, perhaps, to disengage; arrests dropped, and the number of homicides rose. There were forty-two murders in Baltimore in May, compared with twenty-three the previous May; in June, there were twenty-nine, compared with eighteen the year before; in July, forty-five, compared with twenty-two; in August, thirty-three, compared with twenty-six. In four months, sixty more lives were lost than in the previous year, most of them black.","3667","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Near the beginning of “Between the World and Me,” Coates recalls the night the grand jury announced that it would not return an indictment against Darren Wilson for killing Michael Brown. His son retreated to his room to cry, and Coates tried to figure out what to tell him. This book is his response, but it is not until the end that Coates allows, “Michael Brown did not die as so many of his defenders supposed.” A Justice Department report looked at the Ferguson Police Department and found a wide range of abusive practices, as well as “intentional discrimination on the basis of race.” But another Justice Department inquiry debunked the widely reported story that Brown was coöperating, with his hands up—saying, “Don’t shoot!”—when he was killed. And forensic details corroborate the claim that Brown was initially shot while trying to grab the officer’s gun.","3668","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"The ubiquity of video footage has increased the scrutiny of police killings, making it easier for citizens to contest official explanations that would otherwise go unchallenged. Until recently, however, no one kept a complete count of who was being shot by police officers, and why. The Washington Post examined reports of police shootings in 2015 and found that this year blacks were about three times as likely as whites to be killed by police. (Because of the difference in population sizes, non-Hispanic whites still form a plurality—about fifty per cent—of all people killed by police.) A Web site called killedbypolice.net has been tracking media reports of police killings since 2013; it finds that over the past three years blacks were about three and a half times as likely as whites to be killed by police.","3669","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"These findings should disturb us, but so, too, should the fact that the racial disparity is actually wider for civilian violence. Overall, blacks are about eight times as likely as whites to be murdered. As far as we can tell, someone killed by police is less likely to be black than someone killed by a civilian. In “Ghettoside” (Spiegel & Grau), an absorbing new book about murder in an African-American community in Los Angeles, the reporter Jill Leovy writes about what she calls “the black homicide problem.” She doesn’t use this term to defend police departments; on the contrary, she uses it to indict them, writing about all the cruelty and misery that flourishes in a place where there is no “state monopoly on violence.” If anything, the outrage over relatively rare police killings should remind us just how much everyday violence—and just how much everyday inequality—we have learned to ignore.","3670","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Coates’s two books show how twinned fears of crime and punishment can be mutually reinforcing: how the historic failure of the police to keep African-Americans safe from violence can make police excesses all the more appalling. The police killing of Prince Jones was, surely, that much more disturbing to a man who remembered that when he was a boy the police had failed to protect his friend Craig. For some reformers, the key is retraining police officers to minimize violence. But Coates and Alexander warn against this kind of meliorist thinking. “A reform that begins with the officer on the beat is not reform at all,” Coates has written. To many Black Lives Matter activists, the phrase “state monopoly on violence” probably sounds more like a threat than like a reassurance.","3671","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Crime statistics in Baltimore are complicated: in the decades since Coates was a boy, murders declined, but so did the city’s population. In general, though, American crime rates have fallen since the early nineteen-nineties, and the nation’s imprisoned population—while extraordinarily high, by global standards—seems to have stopped increasing. As for police killings, each one is tragic, and each unjustified one is outrageous; police departments in Europe, for instance, are vastly less likely to kill. But there is no evidence that we are living through a modern epidemic. Although there is little reliable national data, the New York Police Department keeps records. In 1973, the year Rockefeller signed his drug laws, the department shot and killed fifty-eight people; in 2013, the most recent year in the department database, the number was eight. The Black Lives Matter protests draw their urgency from the damage that violence has done to African-American communities. But they resonate so widely because, after decades of chaos, that violence seems to have subsided.","3672","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Experts disagree about how much of this change can be attributed to policing or to mass incarceration; in many ways, crime rates are mysterious. But the decades-long decrease in crime has made it much easier for politicians to heed the activists demanding that we reform our criminal-justice system. There is some indication that this year many cities besides Baltimore are suffering from an uptick in homicides; if this trend were to continue, talk of ending mass incarceration might become politically toxic, even for African-American politicians. As Fortner’s book makes clear, no political movement can afford to ignore the kind of cruel disorder that we euphemistically call common crime. A police force that kills black citizens is adding to America’s history of racial violence; so is a police force that fails to keep them safe. Alexander may be right that our criminal-justice regime is a new incarnation of the monstrous old Jim Crow system. But this should tell us something about the desperation of the many African-Americans who supported it anyway—convinced, not wholly unreasonably, that the alternative was even worse. ♦","3673","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"A teaser for the new “Daily Show”—“The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” which made its début last night—ran immediately before the broadcast began. It featured, over a shot of Noah opening his eyes and looking up at the camera almost sleepily, a snippet of Kanye West’s “Power”: “No one man should have all that power.” That song, one of the sly anthems at the beginning of “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” feels like something you’d play when a new leader takes the stage. But the single line they used felt like a subliminal message, or an overt one. “Daily Show” fans love and need what Jon Stewart made “The Daily Show”; since he announced his departure and Noah was chosen to succeed him, we’ve lived in a state of game apprehension, at best.","September 29, 2015","3674","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"

His three appearances on “The Daily Show” were awkward, but so are many guest appearances on “The Daily Show.” Then, after several of his dumb, awful, not-that-old tweets were discovered and publicized, our game apprehension turned to something like hopeful dread. It was hard to imagine someone who made lame jokes about Jews and “fat chicks” becoming what Stewart had been. Stewart, who loved to be silly and vulgar as much as anybody, was also deeply respectful, humble, kind—he mocked the powerful and the malevolent and instinctively defended everybody else. But had we made too big a deal about Stewart? Probably. You could sense that Stewart had perhaps had enough of our worship.

Welcome to ‘The Daily Show’!” He flapped his hands, already Jon Stewart-level annoyed-humble. “I’m Trevor Noah!

And I’m quite comfortable with one of them.”","3677","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"Ha! It was reassuring to start off with a toilet joke, somehow. But I was wondering: Is he mocking himself and South African poverty, or are the other writers doing it? And when we laugh, what are we laughing at? “Now I’m in the chair and I can only assume it is as strange for you as it is for me. Jon Stewart was more than just a late-night host. He was often our voice, our refuge. And in many ways, our political dad. And it’s weird. Because Dad has left.” He looked grave. This was excellent—the studio audience laughed its head off. “And now it feels like the family has a new stepdad. And he’s black.” We were back in topnotch “Daily Show” territory here, and it felt good. He was teasing us, acknowledging the truth of our love and expectations and his newness and difference.

"Noah went on to explain, warmly enough, that “Comedy Central did ask women to host, and the women they asked turned the job down, because they all had better things to do, and clearly knew something I didn’t.” American hosts had also turned the job down. “So, once more, a job Americans rejected is now being done by an immigrant,” he said. He thanked Jon Stewart: “I’m not quite sure what you saw in me, but I’ll work hard every day to find it, and I’ll make you not look like the crazy old dude who left his inheritance to some random kid from Africa.” He thanked us, the viewers, and pledged to “continue the war on bullshit.” This was a great start, and we were with him, all in this together.","3679","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"

Just kidding—it’s the Pope! YEAGHHHHHHHH!” he yelled. He put his arms in the air. There was a fine bit about Pope-themed emojis: Popemojis. “For when you want to inject just the right amount of confusion into your late-night sexting. Sup, girl! You up? Because eggplant winky face cartoon Pope likes cheesesteaks! Good luck figuring that one out.” It was great to have “The Daily Show” back, and the jokes about the Pope’s tiny Fiat (“Somebody’s undercompensating!”) and the Boehner resignation (“No! Why leave now? I have a fancy suit and a new set and I learned how to pronounce your name! Boehner!”—wink) were fun. But there’s a bad-feeling flip side of some of this. Some of the jokes were mean or weird: a good joke about Club Congress was undermined by “and everyone has aides.” Any joke about people having AIDS feels like the eighties, in the worst way. The crowd audibly recoiled. A joke about crack and meth and Whitney Houston, delivered hammily, was upsetting. The crowd recoiled again. “Too soon?” Noah said.","3680","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"

But our mood was given a boost by Larry Wilmore, at 11:30. “New ‘Daily Show’ viewers, don’t be confused!” Wilmore said. “I’m a different light-skinned brother late-night host. That’s right! It’s the first time late night’s gone black to black!” This was a thrilling moment. And Wilmore, who has our trust—he’s had it from the beginning, when he was so good on “The Daily Show”—launched right in. “Also: Ben Carson continues talking shit about Muslims! And I continue not giving a shit about Ben Carson!” Then he cited a recent Jeb Bush remark about Democrats luring black voters with “free stuff.” “Hey Jeb! Here’s something for free!” He reached into his pocket and gave Jeb! the finger. This felt deeply satisfying, and he later followed it up with a smart, sobering analysis of a passage from Jeb’s 1996 book “Profiles in Character.” O.K., Comedy Central: I like where this is going.

"In his influential 2004 book, “Globalized Islam: The Search for a New Ummah,” the French political scientist Olivier Roy pointed out that what he termed Islamic “neofundamentalism,” despite its frequent references to the past and to the Koran, represents a very modern, even a postmodern, phenomenon. Emphasizing the role of the Internet in recruiting and sustaining jihadis, Roy said that this apocalyptic new ideology “valorizes the uprootedness of uprooted people” and provides them with a sense of belonging and meaning. The true believer, wherever he is, “remains in touch with the virtual community by sharing the same portable kit of norms, adaptable to any social context,” Roy wrote, adding that the Internet was “a perfect paradigm and tool of this virtual community.”","November 23, 2015","3688","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"Nothing that has happened since 2004 invalidates Roy’s thesis. With the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham, the neofundamentalists, or some of them, have gained a territorial foothold in eastern Syria and northwestern Iraq. But ISIS and other radical groups still rely heavily on information technology. In addition to using the Internet to recruit and to plan attacks, they know they can rely on it to amplify the immediate impact of their atrocities, especially “spectaculars” like the one carried out in Paris. That’s because the virtual community of jihadis and sympathizers that Roy identified isn’t the only one the Internet has created. As the past week and a half has made clear, there is also a global community of virtual witnesses to terrorism—a group of which we are nearly all members.","3689","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"Sitting at home, in Brooklyn, on the evening of Friday, November 13th, I felt, at times, like I was on Boulevard Voltaire. France 24’s English-language news channel, which I was watching online, had a reporter and a camera stationed on Haussmann’s grand thoroughfare, about four hundred yards from the Bataclan concert hall. “This is a very twenty-first-century scene,” the reporter said at one point. He was referring not just to the police and police vehicles, which had formed a roadblock, but also to the other journalists stationed around him, and to the crowds of ordinary Parisians who had gathered to capture what was happening, or part of it, on their cellphones.","3690","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"On Twitter, there was so much information and disinformation that I tried to distill some of it for my followers, picking out bits that looked reliable and supplementing them with information from the Web sites of Le Monde and Libération. I stepped away for a while, and by the time I got back online someone had created a #JeSuisParis hashtag. The Eiffel Tower peace sign, which the French artist Jean Jullien posted on Twitter shortly after midnight, Paris time, was going viral.","3691","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"Many, many people were following the attack on their Facebook feeds. On his own page, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s founder, announced that it was activating its Safety Check feature, which allows users to notify their friends and family that they are unharmed. (The feature had previously been reserved for natural disasters.) Hours later, the company also activated a filter allowing people to overlay their profile pictures with the French flag. Zuckerberg was one of the first to use it. Millions followed his lead.","3692","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"Perhaps all of this shouldn’t be over-interpreted. Even without the Internet, the spectacle of a gang of fanatics killing scores of people in a major Western city would of course have had enormous emotional resonance. If such an attack had taken place in 1989, say, during the bicentennial celebrations of the French Revolution, it would have been just as shocking, even though people wouldn’t have had an electronic outlet on which to gather and express their feelings. And the outpourings online didn’t prevent people from paying tributes to the victims in more old-fashioned ways. In fact, social media helped to facilitate these reactions. While the hostage situation at the Bataclan theatre was still going on, a vigil began in Manhattan’s Union Square, where French students and others sang “La Marseillaise.” The Empire State Building went dark, and One World Trade Center was lit in red, white, and blue. Over the weekend, buildings from London to Sydney adopted the same colors. On the streets of Paris, and at French embassies all around the world, flowers and handwritten condolence cards piled up in huge numbers.","3693","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"The English novelist Ian McEwan argued that, in a post-religious world—he was writing about secularized Europe—the proliferation of shrines reflects “a profound need for community.” For some of the people who leave flowers and handwritten notes, it may also reflect a desire to get off the computer, or off the couch in front of the television, and do something more tangible. And that last point can, perhaps, be generalized. Today’s information technology mediates our awareness of dreadful events, such as terrorist attacks, in a manner that makes them feel closer and more pressing. Unless we are dreadfully unlucky, the actual bombs and bullets don’t affect us directly; thanks to social media, though, we are all a part of the aftermath.","3694","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"One danger is that this distorts the way we perceive such happenings and the scale of the threat that they represent to us. Obviously, ISIS and other radical Islamist groups now represent a real security issue. But how large is it compared to other causes of death and injury? According to numbers from Oxfam, which Max Roser, a data scientist at Oxford University, highlighted a few days ago on Twitter, terrorism of all kinds killed just over thirteen thousand people in 2010. In the United States alone, the annual death toll from firearms, including homicides and suicides, is more than thirty thousand. My aim here isn’t to criticize the gun lobby (I do that pretty often), and of course these deaths are all serious concerns. But I mean to point out that humans aren’t very good at dealing with probabilities, and that attacks of this nature, when viewed through the lens that modern technology provides, can exaggerate a number of well-known psychological biases.","3695","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"One of these biases, which the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky pointed out decades ago, is sometimes referred to as the “law of small numbers.” Confronted with very limited amounts of data, people tend to generalize. A quarter comes up heads four times in a row, and we suspect that it is not a real coin. Islamic terrorists strike in Sinai and Paris, and we assume that we are moving into new reality in which such horrific events are everyday occurrences. Last weekend, I ran into an acquaintance who was terrified of a follow-up attack in New York. I pointed out that France is more than three thousand and four hundred miles away, and that there is a vast ocean separating it from the United States. I gently suggested that she take a break from the Internet. It didn’t do any good. Having spent two days monitoring the news obsessively, she couldn’t put it out of her mind: she felt like the threat was here and now.","3696","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"Such a reaction is understandable, especially when members of ISIS are posting videos in which they threaten to strike Washington or Rome next, and when Brussels is in a security lockdown, as police search for suspects amid fears of an attack. The fact remains, though, that large-scale strikes on civilian targets outside the Middle East are a rarity. Since 9/11, Islamist terrorists have carried out spectacular attacks in London, Madrid, Mumbai, and Paris (twice). That’s a success rate of about once every three and a half years. Countless plots have been disrupted. In the case of the two attacks in Paris, most of the perpetrators were known to authorities, but they slipped through the net. That’s worrying, but it also confirms that Western countries aren’t defenseless. If they maintain their vigilance and insure that their police and intelligence agencies have adequate resources, they can do a great deal to protect civilian populations. Particularly at times like this, though, many people don’t find that very reassuring. They want absolute assurances, which no government can provide.","3697","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"In other parts of the world, such as the Middle East and North Africa, terrorists do sometimes appear to be able to strike with impunity. Normally, though, these attacks don’t receive much attention in Western countries. The global community of terrorism witnesses didn’t convene such a vast online assembly two weeks ago, when suicide bombers, widely believed to be members of ISIS, killed as many as forty-three people and wounded more than a hundred in Beirut. Nor did it do so last month, when bombs killed at least ninety-five people in Ankara, the capital of Turkey—another attack that some analysts have attributed to ISIS. Friday’s murderous attack on a hotel in Mali has received more attention in Western countries, but that may have been because it came so soon after the attacks in Paris.","3698","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"Selectivity isn’t a new phenomenon of course. Neither is the “representativeness heuristic,” which is a fancy phrase for allowing salient details, such as the sight of bloodied bodies on a Paris sidewalk, to overload our brains and prevent a calm, probabilistic assessment of the dangers we face. But in today’s world, there is real danger that both of these biases, and many others, can be amplified. Cowering in front of our computers, or crouched over our cellphones, we don’t see a single attack. We see something much larger and more threatening.","3699","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"That is the mindset that the jihadis are trying to create, of course. In an essay in the Guardian earlier this year, the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari, wrote, “People turn to terrorism because they know they cannot wage war, so they opt instead to produce a theatrical spectacle. Terrorists don’t think like army generals; they think like theatre producers.” From its early online shorts that showed young jihadis bearing black flags training in the desert to its ghoulish execution videos, ISIS has demonstrated an adroitness at producing online propaganda. But nothing engages the jihadis’ target audience like Westerners being killed where they live. When the terrorists succeed in carrying out these types of attacks, they don’t need to film the action, or distribute the footage. They know they can rely on us to magnify their actions. Moreover, short of shuttering the media and censoring the entire Internet, there appears to be nothing that Western governments can do about it.","3700","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"Ultimately, we can only hope that the negative aspects of modern technology are outweighed by the positive ones, of which there certainly are some. The weekend after the Paris attacks, according to Facebook, more than four million people used Safety Check to reassure their friends and relations. That represented a small victory for social media. Another was the fact that so many of the messages posted online contained comments critical of ISIS. Researchers at N.Y.U.’s Social Media and Political Participation Lab analyzed more than four million tweets sent in the twenty-four hours after the attack. In the sample they looked at, tweets using explicitly anti-ISIS phrases appeared more than eight thousand times; pro-ISIS terms occurred fewer than four hundred times. “Twitter may act as an echo chamber to amplify extremist voices in the tightly clustered communities,” Alexandra Siegel, a researcher at N.Y.U., wrote at the Washington Post’s Monkey Cage blog. “But it can also help bridge the divide and expose online users with different sentiments to one another’s information sources and viewpoints.”","3701","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"That may be an overly hopeful way to look at things. Just as Democrats don’t generally look around Twitter for tweets and articles critical of President Obama, it is doubtful that many jihadis or their supporters were reading anti-ISIS messages. What cannot be contradicted, however, is the fact that social media, for all its possible drawbacks, can also provide a uniquely powerful platform for ordinary people to register their abhorrence at terrorism.","3702","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"Early last week, Antoine Leiris, a Parisian whose wife, Hélène Muyal-Leiris, was shot dead at the Bataclan theatre, posted a letter on his Facebook page, in which he addressed the killers directly. “I do not know who you are, and I don’t want to know, you are dead souls,” he wrote. “I will not give you the gift of hating you.” In the grand scheme of things, Leiris’s moving letter was just another simple online gesture. (He also read it in English for the B.B.C., which posted an audio version online.) It won’t bring back his wife, or any of the other victims. And given the grim determination with which many members of ISIS and other extremist Islamist groups pursue their ends, it is unlikely to dissuade any potential terrorists. But at a time when the most basic precepts of human decency are subject to violent assault, it was a welcome effort to confront the killers on their chosen medium, and to remind them that theirs is not the only virtual community.","3703","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/terrorism-in-the-age-of-twitter"
"Mike Hauke opened a pizza and sub shop in Atlantic City in 2009, but only after he had failed in nine tries to rent the space to somebody else. He had bought the building three years earlier on the advice of his father, an accountant who considered distressed real estate a smart long-term bet. This piece of real estate seemed to test the proposition. It was a bedraggled three-story clapboard house that years of neighborhood demolition and neglect had stranded at the edge of several mostly vacant blocks, which together formed an urban badlands reaching all the way to the dunes. This was the South Inlet, a once thriving part of town and now more or less a desolate slum at the northeastern end of Absecon Island, the landmass that is home to Atlantic City and three other municipalities. People from “offshore,” as locals like to call the mainland, tend to think of the island’s Inlet end as north, because it’s upcoast, but locals call it east. Atlantic City has a Bermuda Triangle effect; it can confound a compass.","3704","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Three blocks west of Hauke’s place, an immense slab of steel and glass was rising over the badlands: a hotel and casino to be called Revel, destined to be bigger and more opulent than anything Atlantic City had ever seen—two towers, reaching almost fifty stories, nearly four thousand rooms, and parking for more than seven thousand cars. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, had bought the land in 2006, for seventy million dollars, and sunk about $1.2 billion into the project. (Revel, as some have noted, is “lever” spelled backward.) By the end, the cost of building Revel reached more than $2.4 billion, making it the most expensive private construction project in the history of New Jersey.","3705","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Hauke went after the crumbs. Unable to find a commercial tenant for his house’s ground floor (the apartments upstairs were designated Section 8, for low-income tenants), he started selling rudimentary takeout to Revel’s construction crews. Their rush-hour bulk orders overwhelmed his staff, but off hours the place was dead: a trickle of casino workers and, in Hauke’s words, “shitbags, crackheads, hustlers, and pimps.”","3706","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Hauke, a recent graduate of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, had spent a couple of years in Hoboken and Manhattan working in marketing, but he had no restaurant experience. One of his first customers was a neighborhood junkie known as V8 Man (“All the white kids are junkies,” Hauke said. “The Inlet does it to everybody”), who, on opening night, picked a fight at the counter with a male prostitute and another customer; Hauke smashed a pizza paddle on the counter and used the sharp end to scare him off. More than once, a guy came in trying to unload stolen merchandise as the victimized storekeeper came running up the street in pursuit. One morning, a neighborhood kid rode by on a bicycle and threw a crude pipe bomb through the window; Hauke chased him in his car and, after cornering him briefly in an abandoned house, hounded him on foot across a vacant tract called Pauline’s Prairie, named after Pauline Hill, a city planner in the sixties who’d had this stretch of the neighborhood bulldozed for urban renewal, which never came. The kid, looking over his shoulder, ran into the side of a parked box truck. The police appeared and put him in cuffs. His grievance was that cops had been patronizing Hauke’s shop and that sheriffs had evicted his cousins, Hauke’s Section 8 tenants, from one of the apartments upstairs. The tenants, according to Hauke, had been running a welfare scam. They’d also been throwing dirty diapers on his customers and fishing for pigeons from the roof.","3707","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Hauke hoped that, in spite of such annoyances, Revel would either provide him with an income stream or else buy him out. A few neighborhood property owners said that it would never happen. They’d been holding on for years themselves, in the hope of selling to a big casino, and in the interim they’d been gutted by rising property taxes and ongoing decay. The problem was that the area was zoned for big casino-hotels. You couldn’t build a house, and the few houses left in the neighborhood—most had been demolished or had burned down, accidentally or not—were old and badly battered by the salt air. One of them, down near the beach, across the street from a run-down low-income housing complex called the Waterside, belonged to a teacher Hauke had got to know named Tony Zarych, who’d moved to Atlantic City as a teen-ager forty years earlier, when his family was buying up property around town. He’d worked as a baccarat dealer at the Sands, until it closed (it was demolished in 2007), and now taught English as a second language at an elementary school. He liked to hunt wild turkey offshore and sometimes had carcasses hanging outside. His property taxes had risen sharply, as the city contended with a steep drop in tax revenues from the casinos. “Get out while you can,” Zarych told Hauke.","3708","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Sure enough, in 2009, amid the financial meltdown, Revel, only half built, ran out of money. In April, 2010, Morgan Stanley quit the project, booking a loss of almost a billion dollars. Construction stopped. Hauke’s business withered. “There were no more tourists or construction workers,” he recalled. “Mostly just cops. And crackheads wanting free shit.” But something about the city, and about the Inlet’s seaside squalor, made him want to stay on. Maybe it was the fact that his great-grandmother had attended shul in the Inlet. Or that he’d simply got sand in his shoes, as the locals say about those who take to the place.","3709","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"After grinding along for another year, Hauke shut down the shop, spiffed it up, and rechristened it Tony Boloney’s. He bought a food truck, which he named the Mustache Mobile, and developed a line of pizzas and novelty subs that he marketed as “indigenous Atlantic City grub,” as though he’d revived an obscure provincial cuisine. Soon, Tony Boloney’s began winning foodie awards and luring in not just gamblers, night-clubbers, food-truck connoisseurs, politicians, and cops but also a procession of casino magnates and real-estate speculators who were visiting the neighborhood, often on the sly, to size up the distressed property next door.","3710","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"At the beginning of 2011, Governor Chris Christie pledged tax incentives to Revel worth more than a quarter of a billion dollars. (The incentives were tied to certain revenue targets, which, in the end, Revel failed to meet.) Christie had evidently decided that Revel’s success was essential to the survival of Atlantic City, and therefore his gubernatorial track record. His pledge helped Revel secure new financing from an array of hedge funds, including Chatham Asset Management and Canyon Capital, which manage hundreds of millions of dollars in New Jersey state pension funds.","3711","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Construction resumed, and Christie came to town. After a photo op at a famous sub shop called the White House and a visit to the Revel site, he dropped in at Tony Boloney’s and urged Hauke to keep the place going. “Listen, you gotta stick around,” Christie told him. The Revel executives were emphatic as well: “It’ll look bad if you close. Please don’t go anywhere.” The head of Chatham Asset Management hired Hauke to cater his annual Halloween party, up in Essex County.","3712","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Revel opened in the spring of 2012, with Beyoncé performing a series of concerts in its auditorium. (She also took over the Presidential Suite, relegating Michelle Obama and her daughters to another suite.) The plan had been scaled back—just fourteen hundred rooms, and one tower instead of two. The tower’s midsection had a half-dozen stories not yet built out; you could see clear through it. Still, it was an impressive building, with sleek, airy marbled atriums and lobbies that had little in common with the smoky, windowless, carpeted caverns of the older mega-casinos down the boardwalk. Unlike all the rest, it directed one’s attention to the ocean and had ample outdoor space, a two-acre terrace with firepits and cabanas. Even from the outside, Revel had an ethereal appeal. The reflective glass took on the sky’s hue and became almost invisible at dusk, a stealth casino guarding the edge of town.","3713","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"If only. During construction, a tower crane collapsed. Lightning struck a worker’s cement bucket and killed him. Three top Revel executives died in a plane crash. A guest plunged from one of several escalators that climbed vertiginously through the heart of the lobby. A couple were found dead of an apparent drug overdose in a suite. The N.F.L. player Ray Rice punched out his fiancée in an elevator, and the surveillance video went viral.","3714","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The casino wasn’t making nearly as much money as the developers had anticipated. Some observers blamed the layout—the hotel-room elevators didn’t access the casino floor, and a long, tortuous trip from the entrance to the check-in desk didn’t take you through it, either—or the fact that Revel prohibited smoking, or that its slot machines didn’t seem to pay out, or that it was stingy with the comps. Even though occupancy was decent and the night clubs and restaurants were busy, the tables and slots weren’t taking in enough to offset the cost of operating the place—the burden of debt service, high property taxes, bad leases with the tenants, and an expensive arrangement for power and light. Within a year of opening, Revel filed for bankruptcy. It restructured and emerged from Chapter 11 a few months later, but the economics still didn’t make sense, and so, in the spring of 2014, it went bankrupt once again. Finally, last September, unable to find a buyer, it closed.","3715","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"From the time Morgan Stanley began searching in vain for equity partners, Revel had been in play, and all along Tony Boloney’s had served as an informal commissary for would-be investors and buyers. Among those whom Hauke and his staff said they’d seen were Steve Wynn, who had sold the Golden Nugget in 1987 and vowed never to come back; various hedge-funders from New York; and a group of Chinese men—the Export-Import Bank of China was at one point in talks to buy a piece—who took over Hauke’s tables and held meetings for hours, without ordering anything.","3716","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"A mysterious character in tattered clothing and a handlebar mustache had been showing up a few times a year, engaging the staff in conversation about space travel and Elon Musk. He claimed to represent someone who was going to buy Revel. Hauke and his team were skeptical, but one day last summer, just before the casino closed, the man rolled up in a baby-blue Bentley convertible. Maybe he was for real. “My guy’s going to offer ninety million,” he said. His guy, he went on, was from Florida and intended to erect a “Tower of Geniuses” on the Revel site, a high-rise think tank, which would draw on NASA and the federal government’s aviation-research facility at Atlantic City Airport, just offshore.","3717","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"If not for zany schemes, Atlantic City would still be a sand dune. Within weeks, news broke that a little-known Florida developer named Glenn Straub, the owner of Palm Beach Polo Golf and Country Club, had offered ninety million dollars to buy Revel. Straub wanted to put up the aborted second tower and fill it with academics and scientists charged with solving the world’s problems: your Tower of Geniuses. Few in town took this seriously, but, as far as the bankruptcy was concerned, he’d established a baseline. Everything has a clearing price. The bad news was that Straub’s offer was less than four cents on the dollar—a chilling signal of how far Atlantic City had fallen and may yet fall. The good news was that the building—and you might even say the town—was worth anything at all.","3718","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Most cities exist as a consequence of commercial or strategic utility. Atlantic City is more of a proposition and a ploy. The town fathers of Cape May, the first American seaside resort, weren’t interested in a railway, or perhaps the class of people who’d ride in on one—the well-to-do arrived from Philadelphia by boat—so a group of investors built, in 1854, what became known as a “railroad to nowhere,” to a spot a little way up the coast that was more or less the shortest possible distance from Philadelphia to the sea. Over the decades, and with the industrial-era advent of leisure time and disposable income, this forsaken wedge of salt marsh and sand became “the world’s playground”—a crucible of conspicuous consumption and a stage for the aspirations and masquerades of visitors and entrepreneurs. In some respects, Atlantic City was where America learned how to turn idle entertainment into big business. For a while, it was home to some of the world’s grandest hotels (the Marlborough-Blenheim was the largest reinforced-concrete building in the world, and was later imploded in the music video for Bruce Springsteen’s “Atlantic City”), as well as some of its more ardent iniquities and diversions. The night clubs were as often as not fronts for backroom gambling halls, intermittently tolerated by the authorities.","3719","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The city, like so many, has its racial demons. At the turn of the twentieth century, Atlantic City had one of the highest African-American populations of any city north of the Mason-Dixon Line, owing to the abundance of jobs in the hotels. The archetypal amusement was that of white working-class visitors kicking back in the boardwalk’s famous wicker rolling chairs while black people did the pushing—a “public performance of racial dominance,” notes the historian Bryant Simon, in “Boardwalk of Dreams.” Though the Northside, traditionally a black neighborhood, had been a thriving district, the decline in tourism to the city, after the Second World War, hit it hard. With the rise of affordable air travel, people started going to Florida and the Caribbean instead. The city desegregated. Disneyland opened.","3720","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Legalized gambling was supposed to rescue the city from its obsolescence as a resort and convention town, a condition that came to national attention during the 1964 Democratic Convention there and grew more conspicuous as the decade wore on. A dozen years later, the state passed the Casino Control Act, which was, at least ostensibly, an attempt to reverse the decline. But, perhaps predictably, a lot of the money that flowed in flowed right back out—to the casino operators and their financing schemes (“I made a lot of money in Atlantic City,” Donald Trump said at the recent Republican debate. “And I’m very proud of it”) and to their subsequent efforts to lobby for the approval of casino gambling in other states. New Jersey, which taxes the casinos to fund a seniors’ prescription-drug program, among other things, always got its piece.","3721","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Neglect of the city has been attributed to a bloated municipal payroll—a budget nearly double what it was ten years ago—and the years of corruption and mismanagement in city government. Some blame the suffocating effect of the casinos, which are boxed off from the city and are designed to keep patrons inside losing money rather than outside spending it. Others point to the thorny old problem of race or the dreary question of the structure of municipal government statewide.","3722","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The dividing line between south and north, and between white and black, used to be Atlantic Avenue, the main commercial street, which runs parallel to the sea. It was where South Jersey shopped for wedding dresses and jewelry; now it’s a gantlet of shabby storefronts and fast-food joints, running toward and away from the New Jersey Transit bus terminal. In the streets that run from the boardwalk, dilapidation and squalor are not hard to find. Wood’s Loan Office, a pawnshop established in 1927, is owned and operated by Martin Wood, a seventy-nine-year-old Atlantic City native. Wood, who is white (his grandfather, a metallurgist, came to town from Lithuania at the end of the nineteenth century and used to scavenge for junk on the beach with a horse-drawn wagon), has noticed an uptick in the number of shopping bags from the outlet mall, a few blocks away. In his opinion, the sixties were worse. “It’s not that bad here. Yet.” Twenty years ago, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority moved the pawnshop a few blocks, in an effort to remedy the city’s oft-lamented lack of a supermarket. “But they opened a discount liquor store next door to the new supermarket,” Wood said. “That was not a good move. They wound up with winos hanging around. People were scared to go to the supermarket. So it closed up.”","3723","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"“Atlantic City turned its back on the boardwalk,” Paul Steelman, a prominent casino architect who grew up nearby, said. “It’s the most prominent pedestrian walkway in the world. It’s got everything going for it except the buildings that are on it.” His solution: “Cut holes in the casinos and let out all those people, all that capital.”","3724","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"In order to prevent monopolies, the Casino Control Act stipulated that no one could own more than three casinos. In the eighties, Donald Trump became the first to hit that limit. Eventually, the provision was scrapped, and by 2014 Caesars owned four. Carl Icahn now effectively controls a quarter of the market with just two casinos, the Tropicana and the Taj Mahal.","3725","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Does Atlantic City need more gambling, or less? There are proponents on both sides. Some favor alternative entertainments (concerts, water parks, polo, legalized marijuana) or the panacean potential of higher education (Stockton University, a state college headquartered offshore, has long wanted an Atlantic City campus). A few push for smaller boutique casinos, and others swear by the existing big-box regimen, just done better. In Las Vegas the ratio of revenue is two-thirds non-gaming to one-third gaming. In Atlantic City the situation is reversed. Since 2006, gaming revenue has dropped by half, from a peak of $5.2 billion to $2.7 billion. As that stream dries up, logic suggests tapping others. And yet the casinos remain lucrative. Divided among eight casinos—that’s how many are left—$2.7 billion isn’t bad. This may be the locals’ most commonly stated reassurance. The city has a higher concentration of casinos than anywhere outside Nevada. It gets twenty-five million visitors a year.","3726","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

"When word gets out that a city is on the skids, people seem eager to imagine post-apocalyptic desolation, a rusting ruin at Ozymandian remove from the glory days.

"Two weeks after the shuttering of Revel, Trump Plaza closed—the fourth casino to do so in 2014. The first was the Atlantic Club, né the Golden Nugget, built in 1980 by Steve Wynn, with financing by Michael Milken and one of the earliest iterations of the junk bond, and then owned (and rechristened), in succession, by Bally’s, Hilton, and Resorts International. Two competitors, Tropicana (owned by Icahn) and Caesars (controlled by the private-equity firms Apollo Management and TPG Capital), bought out the bankrupt Atlantic Club, closed it, and divvied up the scraps. Next came the Showboat. It was profitable, but its owner, Caesars, hobbled by debt, needed to consolidate. (The amputation failed: in January, Caesars declared bankruptcy; another of its holdings, the Bally’s casino, has been rumored to be the next to go.) Meanwhile, Trump Entertainment Resorts declared bankruptcy (its fourth), and Icahn, who’d bought up Trump’s debt, played a game of chicken with the casino workers’ union and the state. (Donald Trump himself no longer runs the company or the casinos, and he has sued to have his name removed.) In December, the Trump Taj Mahal was about to close; Icahn, having squeezed the state and the union for concessions on taxes and benefits, found twenty million dollars to keep it open, and since then it has limped along, a zombie casbah.","3729","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"It’s not all the big shots’ fault. There’s just been less money to go around. Atlantic City has lost its monopoly on legalized gambling on the East Coast. First came the casinos on Indian reservations in Connecticut, in the nineties, and then, in recent years, the advance of gaming across state lines, in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and upstate New York. (Some industry experts will tell you that Manhattan is destined to have tables, too.) Now there’s talk of casinos in North Jersey, which, along with video-slot parlors at the racetracks (“racinos”), would cannibalize the action in Atlantic City.","3730","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Neighboring states approved legalized gambling in the hope that it would do for their economies and state treasuries what it once did for New Jersey’s. Perhaps they should hope instead that it does not. The casino closures in Atlantic City have contributed to the loss of nearly ten thousand jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and who knows how many associated income streams, reputable or not. The city has fewer than forty thousand permanent residents; the majority of Atlantic City’s workers live offshore, in the townships of Atlantic County, which, in the first quarter of this year, led the nation in foreclosures. Property taxes in the city have doubled since 2008 and were up twenty-nine per cent in 2014, to make up for the drop in tax revenue from the casinos and in the taxable value of the property. The city is around four hundred million dollars in debt. Earlier this year, its credit rating was downgraded to junk-bond status.","3731","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"After convening a few summits on the predicament in Atlantic City, which resulted in a dire report, Governor Christie, in January, appointed two emergency managers, Kevin Lavin and Kevyn Orr, to oversee the city’s finances, wresting control from the mayor and the city council. The fact that Orr had previously served as Detroit’s emergency manager, steering Detroit into and out of bankruptcy, led observers to predict that he’d been hired to do the same for Atlantic City. Perhaps mercifully, the mayor, Don Guardian, was relieved of some of the hardest decisions, about who and how many to fire and what services to deprive the citizens of. “A good manager welcomes a good auditor,” he told me. The mess was now Christie’s. Presiding over the first bankruptcy for a New Jersey municipality since the Great Depression would not help his Presidential ambitions, and, perhaps more important, it would raise the already high costs of borrowing across a state whose finances are very grim. Christie staked a lot on his rescue of Atlantic City, and so far the bet’s not looking so good.","3732","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"In May, the city submitted a plan to lay off two hundred city workers, about a fifth of the municipal workforce. Orr returned to private practice, having been paid seventy thousand dollars for three months of part-time work.

"Abandonment, and the spectre of bankruptcy, intensified the bleakness of the winter in Atlantic City. At one end of the boardwalk, Revel loomed dark. At night, the blare of piped-in pop warped in the wind, and floodlight spilled out over the dunes, which, post-Sandy, were just a layer of sand atop an armature of giant sandbags. The obituarists who came to gawk didn’t have to bother going so far. On the façade of the first casino that one saw after pulling off the expressway there was the ghost lettering of the immense sign that once spelled out “Trump Plaza” and, beneath it, a billboard that read “The Center of It All.” (The small print read “Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-Gambler”—advice, maybe, for the city itself.) Visitors regularly stopped to photograph this, to add to their portfolio of what some locals, resenting the attention, considered ruin porn.","3734","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The greatest ruin was to the lives of the thousands who’d lost their jobs. One morning, I met Dawn Inglin, who had gone to work as a cocktail waitress at the Plaza when it first opened, in 1984. She’d come to town three years before, when a friend got her a role in a dinner-theatre company down shore, in Ocean City, and then she found herself auditioning at Harrah’s, which, in those days, used cocktail waitresses as dancers in its TV commercials. “The choreography was difficult,” she recalled.","3735","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"When she applied for a job at the Plaza, she auditioned for Donald Trump at Trump Tower, in Manhattan. She remembers a weigh-in, and an interview in a bathing suit, and she and the others were required to wear two-and-a-half-inch heels. (When I met her, she had her hair up and was wearing a smart lavender suit.) “I very much enjoyed working for Donald Trump,” Inglin said. “When he was there, it was tip-top. You’d’ve thought he was the Messiah.”","3736","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Inglin’s generation of casino workers, whose professional primes track the birth and decline of the industry in Atlantic City, speak wistfully of the abundance and camaraderie of the halcyon days. “Back in the eighties and nineties, the money flowed. It was glamorous,” Inglin said. “Then the attention and the business was diverted from the Plaza to the Taj. Things started closing. Restaurants, room service. For four or five years, there were constant rumors that this or that person was going to buy us. I don’t have enough fingers and toes to count the number of people who were going to save us. The last few years were so stressful. You watched people lose their jobs. They were taking away severance, the machines disappearing, equipment rolling past you.”","3737","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"After thirty years, she was fourth in seniority among cocktail waitresses at the Plaza and was making $8.99 an hour, plus benefits. It ended last September. “When we found out we were closing, we were standing at the bar—the last bar in the casino. We saw it on the six-o’clock news. We were frantic.”","3738","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Despite coming up empty in a search for another job, Inglin felt that she was going to be all right. Since the Plaza closed, she has been attending classes at the community college in pursuit of a degree in human services—a growth field in these parts. “We have an addiction problem here,” she said.","3739","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

"Atlantic City has had three great bosses, political or otherwise. In the decades prior to the First World War, Louis Kuehnle, a transplanted New Yorker and powerful Republican known to all as the Commodore, turned the resort into a bustling metropolis and the state party into a patron and beneficiary of the evolving local aptitude for vice. Enoch (Nucky) Johnson, his successor and the basis for the Steve Buscemi character in “Boardwalk Empire,” continued this work and presided over Atlantic City’s glory years, during Prohibition, which, largely thanks to his efforts, never really pertained. The third was Hap Farley, a Republican legislator and master puller of wires, whose political swan song was his support, behind the scenes, for the second (and successful) attempt, in 1976, to pass the state bill to legalize gambling in Atlantic City.","3743","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Since then, there have been party bosses, governors, and mayors with varying degrees of power and venality, but no kingfish of the stature of the Commodore, Nucky, or Hap. “I’ll give you Atlantic City,” the mayor of Camden said, to F.B.I. agents disguised as Arabs during the Abscam sting. “Without me, you do nothing.” But by then such an offer was beyond the reach of any one man. In city politics, the Democrats held sway. (The electorate is now thirty per cent Hispanic and forty per cent black; Democrats outnumber Republicans nine to one.) The only Republican elected to* City Hall in the casino era was James Usry, the city’s first black mayor, who got caught up in a corruption investigation that cost him the 1990 election—until 2013, when, to the great surprise of the city’s political establishment, Don Guardian, a gay white Republican, beat Lorenzo (Rennie) Langford, an African-American, by fewer than four hundred votes.","3744","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

We talked in his “man lair,” a furnished subfloor with jazz paraphernalia and a wall of fame: his wife, Nynell, with him and Jay Z and Beyoncé; Stevie Wonder; Janet Jackson; Michael Vick; and Lionel Richie. He had on a Champion sweatshirt, jeans, and Nikes. His grandfather had come to town in the twenties, bought some trucks, and won trash-removal contracts at the big hotels. Langford’s father dropped out of high school and worked in a factory. Langford went to college, then dealer school at the Casino Career Institute, on the Black Horse Pike, one of the old Atlantic City arteries, and started at Caesars when it opened, in 1979.

He was a keen advocate and errand man for the tourist precincts, the guy out on the boardwalk on his bicycle at dawn, picking up the plastic cups. He was not a part of any machine, but he worked tirelessly to round up votes, and Langford, having survived a bruising, expensive primary and confident of the black vote, apparently got complacent. Guardian also picked up the support of the state’s Republican establishment and of the unions, in light of his promises to put “cranes in the sky.”","3748","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

When I visited, Filiciello looked on coolly from his desk, dipping into a tub of animal crackers, while Guardian enumerated some of the intractable financial problems the city faces. “If I can take eighty million out of the budget, that’s sustainable, but that’s not feasible right now, not if we want to provide public safety and public works.

Eventually, the casinos figured out the night-club business, so Schultz and Hill got out, and started giving their money away. Twenty years ago, they bought an old building near the clubs, next door to a porn shop, and converted the top three floors into a triplex they called Casa Del Cielo, where they live together and preside as ambassadors, of a kind, over various gaudy but charitable entertainments.

But none was more conspicuous, and of greater likely consequence to the city in the long run, than Revel. Last September, with Glenn Straub’s ninety-million-dollar offer as the stalking horse, the bankruptcy court held an auction to sell it. The winner, at a hundred and ten million dollars, was Brookfield Property Partners, based in Toronto. Brookfield owned the Atlantis in Nassau and the Hard Rock in Las Vegas, and so saw some synergy here, but it couldn’t make a deal with the owners of Revel’s adjacent power plant, which had been built solely for Revel and was charging Revel three million dollars a month for utilities. (The power plant was a separate, independently owned entity, called ACR Energy Partners—an arrangement that has proved poisonous.) In November, Brookfield decided to forfeit its deposit, of eleven million dollars, and walk away.

The first time he picked up, at his club, he told me, through bites of an apple, that he had just finished playing a polo match, that he lived and worked on a yacht, that he was debt-free, and that he had two brilliant adult daughters with whom he had failed to spend enough time. Once, he answered his phone as he was getting fingerprinted by the Casino Control Commission, for his gambling-license application. Another time, he announced that he was at a urinal.

Straub also talked of buying the racetrack, Trump Plaza, the Showboat, and several large tracts of undeveloped land in various parts of the city.

"Straub’s way of talking in a stream-of-consciousness rush, in the manner of an Appalachian Don King, often made his big plans seem scattershot and his tactical explanations disjointed, at least to someone not adept in vulture finance. “He has a learning disability,” his daughter Kim, a branding consultant in New York, told me. “When he was a kid, when it was time to read aloud in class, he’d count the people who were supposed to read before him and then, just before his turn, go to the rest room.

In time, they owned a network of sand and gravel quarries and concrete and asphalt plants; highway- and airport-construction contracts made them rich. (In recent years, those long-moribund quarries, in the upper Ohio River Valley, have been found to sit atop vast reserves of oil and gas, extractable by horizontal drill, making Straub even richer.)","3765","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub retired at forty, moving his family (his wife, from whom he divorced in 2007, and two daughters) to Florida. “I lasted six months,” he said. He started investing in distressed and bankrupt properties. It was a good time to have cash on hand. In the wake of the savings-and-loan crisis, at a Resolution Trust Corporation auction, he bought a twenty-two-hundred-acre golf and polo club in Wellington, for $27.1 million. It was called Palm Beach Polo. “All of a sudden, people were giving me a half a million dollars for an acre,” he said. “I sold two or three hundred million dollars’ worth, and we still have another thousand acres down there.” A big driver was the equestrian center: “Never once thought it would turn out to be a gold mine, but it did turn out to be a gold mine, because then the Bloombergs of the world and their daughters, and all the movie stars’ daughters, they would go down there, and they would have the big Olympic stars do the show jumping, and there was this thing called polo. I didn’t know what a polo game looked like. They put you on a horse. And I thought, This isn’t that hard. I was good in sports, amateur sports. I can hit things. I can pick a fly out of the air.”","3766","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub has been called “the dictator of Palm Beach polo.” His reign has been contentious. In numerous lawsuits, he has been accused of neglecting his residents, as well as the grounds, and charging undue fees. In 2010, he was tried, and ultimately acquitted, on criminal charges of polluting protected wetlands. He was once convicted of contempt, after interfering with a federal marshal who’d come to seize a yacht at a marina Straub owned. He tried to appeal the verdict all the way to the Supreme Court, without success. Through the years, he has been proudly litigious. “If you check me out, I’m pretty good at protecting our rights in the court system,” Straub told me.","3767","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"In the conference room, he told me about his idea for an ocean liner. “An old ocean liner, like the QE2. I’m gonna buy it,” he said. He squeezed mayonnaise from a packet. “Bring this ocean liner in, and I don’t know if you’ve been around Ripley’s down in Orlando, the whole building shaking and everything else. I’m gonna teach my kids, or my kids’ kids, what World War II was all about, and the Holocaust, and Zeros coming in from Japan, and so when you go inside this thing, this ship, it’s gonna make you feel like you’re being bombed, like Pearl Harbor when the damned Zeros came in, took out our whole fleet in the Pacific. The ship’s suites where the crew used to be will be for my construction workers, because if we’re gonna spend this kind of money up here I need to get cheap housing for them, so instead of shipping them back to Philadelphia and bringing them here every day I’ll let them store themselves in the bottom of the ship. It’ll be like the back lots at M-G-M.”","3768","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Throughout the winter, Straub made regular trips to Atlantic City and to the federal bankruptcy court in Camden, where he pressed his attempt to have his bid approved. Amid innumerable motions, hearings, and rulings, attorneys representing bank lenders, unsecured creditors, jilted tenants, other prospective buyers, the power company, and the gutted estate argued for and against his offer, sometimes changing sides as the circumstances evolved. Other bidders waded in and wandered off. The power company remained a sticking point. The lawyers racked up their fees and did their pressers on the courthouse steps.","3769","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"One cold morning in February, Straub arrived at the courthouse in a gray suit, with a trenchcoat slung over his shoulders. He said he’d left his cell phone in a bathroom at the airport, and someone had retrieved it and was sending it back. He looked at the pairs of lawyers filing in through the door. “A few more guys and we’ll get a soccer game going here,” he said. “I wish I was getting paid a thousand bucks an hour.” Straub’s lawyer, Stuart Moskovitz, of Freehold, not normally a bankruptcy attorney, called them the “bankruptcy cabal.” It was essentially the deadline on Straub’s bid, now at ninety-five million dollars, but he had failed to close, owing to some unresolved questions about his obligation to old leaseholders and to the power plant.","3770","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"“We need to know what we’re buying,” Moskovitz said.","3771","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Revel’s lawyer told the judge, “We’re ready to move on to another buyer.”","3772","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Problem was there didn’t seem to be one. With this in mind, Straub and Moskovitz had been threatening to put in a much lower bid if their offer fell through. At one point, Straub stood and handed his lawyer a piece of paper. Moskovitz read aloud, “Sometimes the judge has to protect the debtor from himself.”","3773","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"In the back of the courtroom, a lanky man in a yellow sweater, his graying hair perfectly in place and his eyes darting around, fidgeted with his fingers as though he were handling invisible chopsticks. His name was Vincent Crandon. He was a low-profile Jersey dealmaker from Mahwah, and he had been circling various properties in Atlantic City for years, to no avail. He’d failed in attempts to buy Trump Plaza and the Atlantic Club. Early on, he’d been after a bricks-and-mortar property to go with an Internet-gaming company. But his quest had morphed into something else, and so now he just lurked, waiting for the court, or perhaps the entropy of Atlantic City, to scuttle Straub’s bid. Quietly casting himself as the new white knight, he’d submitted an offer, but so far it had gone unacknowledged.","3774","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"“Straub is done,” Crandon told me later. “We’ve put in a better offer. We’re sitting back, taking our time.” He added, “Straub thinks he’s the only guy in town.”","3775","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The town, and the sellers, seemed to think so, too. After the ninety-five-million-dollar offer fell apart, Straub put in a lower bid, for eighty-two million, and lawyers for Revel and the lenders, increasingly desperate, supported it in court. At the beginning of April, the presiding judge, Gloria Burns, who said she would not let the case delay her impending retirement, abruptly ruled in favor of Straub. The questions of the tenants and power plant remained unresolved. For a few days, anyway, the town experienced something like hope.","3776","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Atlantic City, formerly a breeding ground for big ideas, was now a tar pit—trapping financial mastodons and big-eyed dreamers, whether or not their intentions were pure, as the capricious gods of commerce looked on. Revel kept luring in new ones. In April, the day after Straub took ownership of Revel, he called Crandon and—according to Crandon, anyway; Straub denies it—offered to flip the property to him for a hundred million dollars. A couple of days later, Crandon drove down to Atlantic City. With Revel blacked out (owing to the inevitable dispute between Straub and ACR, the power company), the only people allowed inside were security officers from the Casino Control Commission. They stood in darkness guarding acres of idled slot machines, which Straub wasn’t technically authorized to own, since he had no gaming license. So, according to Crandon, the two men who would decide Revel’s fate met in one of its parking garages. Crandon had along one of his partners, Don Marrandino, an Atlantic City native known as Rockin’ Don, for his music-industry connections. He had been the president of Hard Rock in Las Vegas and of Caesars East Coast operations. Straub was accompanied by Tara Lordi, his adviser and “toxic-asset manager,” a horsewoman and former banker. Crandon says Straub told them he wanted much more than a hundred million for Revel, but at least he now had a possible out, and Crandon had an in. (Straub says the meeting never happened.)","3777","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Crandon had been eying Revel for a year. Crandon, who is fifty-three, grew up in Delaware, but his parents were from New Jersey, and as a kid he worked at a service station his grandfather owned on the Black Horse Pike. His surname used to be Ceccola; Crandon is an adaptation of Cranendonk. His father-in-law is Theodor Cranendonk, a wealthy Dutch oil trader who was once imprisoned in Italy on charges of delivering thirty bazookas to the Mafia. (“It was all made up,” Crandon says. According to Crandon, Dutch commandoes sprung Cranendonk from a prison hospital and brought him back to the Netherlands.) One of Crandon’s investment vehicles is called MidOil, but Cranendonk was not involved in the Revel bid. “He doesn’t do gambling,” Crandon said.","3778","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Crandon said his group—“We’re Jersey guys”—planned to spend hundreds of millions reconfiguring the space. The new name would be Rebel. Crandon said they were planning a forty-night Bon Jovi residency. Rockin’ Don had the pull.","3779","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The money wasn’t from Jersey guys. Crandon says he spent a marathon weekend in town and in New York wooing representatives from a Chinese real-estate firm that had been buying up properties around the United States. Crandon’s group and the Chinese were betting that Macau, the Asian gambling mecca, was tapped out, amid a Chinese government crackdown on corruption and gambling, and that travellers from mainland China would soon be including South Jersey on their U.S. itineraries. The Atlantic City airport would be the hub for jumbo-jet charters from Asia. The margins are better if you can lure a plane from Hong Kong than a bus from Port Authority. Atlantic City, born in proximity to the population and early industrial wealth of Philadelphia, would now reach halfway around the world for money and the guests from whom to separate it.","3780","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Crandon believed that Straub was planning to demolish Revel. A consultant had told him you could net a hundred million dollars if you sold it off as spare parts. There was a precedent: In 2004, Straub bought Miami Arena for twenty-eight million dollars, half what the city had paid to build it. He promised to turn it into a venue for horse shows, conventions, and minor-league sports, to help revive downtown Miami. “Tearing it down serves nobody’s purpose,” Straub said at the time. Four years later, he tore it down.","3781","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Events on the ground in Atlantic City seemed to be pushing Straub in that direction. As soon as he bought Revel, he found himself, not unexpectedly, in a war with ACR, the power plant, and thus, in short order, with the city. The maneuverings often seemed frivolous and petty, except that a city was at stake. Straub refused to pay ACR the three million a month for power, and ACR refused to provide it for free. And so Revel remained dark: no light, heat, air, or water, no sprinklers or alarms. The city’s fire marshal deemed the building unsafe, and the city rescinded Straub’s certificate of occupancy and began fining him five thousand dollars a day. Observers wondered about catastrophic fire and debilitating mold.","3782","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub dug in. He told reporters, as he unsuccessfully challenged the plant’s owners in court, “We’ll erase them off the map.” He brought in a fleet of diesel generators and parked them outside the casino. But he had no permits, and ACR owned much of the connecting infrastructure. Back to court they went. Straub, the loser again, sent the generators away. He told me, referring to city and state officials, “If they won’t work with me, I’ll just go back to Miami.” Publicly, he made the threat explicit: “I’ll tear the building down.”","3783","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"To circumvent ACR, Straub had set about trying to buy the empty casino next door, the Showboat, and tap into its power plant instead. The Showboat’s owner, at the moment, was Stockton University, the state college, which, a few months earlier, had bought it to establish a long-desired Atlantic City campus. The university had paid just ten dollars a square foot. “You can’t even buy tile at Home Depot for ten dollars a square foot!” Herman Saatkamp, Stockton’s president, told me.","3784","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"But the campus plan had suddenly fallen apart, when Trump Entertainment, owners of the Taj Mahal, next door, unexpectedly opted to enforce an old covenant mandating that the Showboat be a casino-hotel, and nothing else. Icahn, who controls Trump, didn’t want a college campus next door. “Who is this guy?” Bob McDevitt, the president of Local 54, the casino workers’ union, said of Icahn, with whom he has been feuding for a year. “How does he get to decide everything? He’s disembowelling the city.”","3785","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Icahn blames the unions. “I saved the Tropicana, which was bankrupt, and made it into one of the only vibrant and surviving casinos in Atlantic City,” he told me. “I have also saved the Taj Mahal and have saved six thousand jobs. Bob McDevitt has caused three casinos to close and the loss of thousands of jobs. Ask yourself: Who is the villain of this story?” Capital or labor? Germany or Greece? Depends on whom you talk to. In July, Taj workers, having lost many of their benefits, voted to authorize a strike.","3786","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"At any rate, now Stockton was stuck with a vacated casino on its balance sheet and monthly maintenance costs of four hundred thousand dollars. That’ll buy you a lot of tile. And so Saatkamp, the university’s president, who is also a leading scholar of George Santayana (“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”), rushed into a provisional agreement to flip the Showboat to Straub. At the end of April, Saatkamp, out of his depth in these sharky waters, resigned as Stockton’s president, his tenure scuttled by the Showboat and Revel mess. Santayana: “Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and it is shameful to surrender it too soon.”","3787","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Throughout the spring, Crandon pressed for a deal while Straub held out for more. Straub told me, “Everyone says, ‘Oh, you’re so fucking smart, Mr. Straub.’ And I’m saying, ‘I’m not smart. I can just outlast everybody.’ ” Tara Lordi e-mailed Crandon one afternoon in early April:","3788","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"In early May, according to Crandon, the two men met aboard Straub’s yacht, the Triumphant Lady, which he’d brought north to Atlantic City and docked at the Golden Nugget. Crandon says they actually shook on a deal, for a hundred and thirty-two million dollars. (Straub denies this meeting took place and in general was dismissive when I asked him about Crandon, referring to him as “Kramden.”)","3789","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"But they continued to haggle over terms and timing as Crandon worked out his arrangement with the Chinese. There were stories of Straub stiffing a local law firm, and of his filling a truck with Revel fixtures and tools, bound for Florida. (He denies wrongdoing in both cases.) His deal to buy the Showboat foundered, and a court gave Stockton the go-ahead to seek another buyer. As weeks passed, Crandon made promises that he’d soon hold the keys to Revel, and then the deal would recede again: Zeno’s paradox down the shore.","3790","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"At the end of June, Crandon texted me to say that his deal with Straub was off. “Greed and evil have destroyed A.C.” He explained, “What happened is we got circumvented.” Straub, apparently, had cut him out of the loop and gone directly to the Chinese. He had come to see the potential of junkets from overseas. Crandon sent photos of Tara Lordi in Shanghai with a Chinese man, whom he still, vestigially, called “my partner”: “2 days after that photo, Chinese canceled our deal.” Crandon vowed revenge: “We will keep it in litigation for years. No one will get Revel.”","3791","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"If Straub was really planning to sell to the Chinese, he wasn’t saying. Lordi says she went to Shanghai to play polo. Straub said he was looking for groups to help manage the hotel and the casino. All the while, Revel remained closed. Still no light shows or clean windows, to say nothing of the four thousand new jobs the city so desperately needed. Revel’s remaining employees were let go. There was no one left, really, except for the security guards overlooking the slots, in the sweltering heat of an un-air-conditioned glass box in high summer.","3792","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"“No word on Revel, Showboat, or any of these things,” Mike Hauke said, down at Tony Boloney’s. “It’s frustrating.” Weekends were busy, weekdays were soft. It was hard to make decisions or plans. “Sometimes, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, you drive around town and see four or five cars.” The talk at the shop was mostly about water parks, or the recent news about the mysterious disappearance of three million dollars, which the Langford administration had given to a Bronx businessman in 2013, for a community-loan program that seems to have never made a loan. ♦","3793","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

[In one video Ghaith sent me, he and his family members are picnicking in the back yard, under a balcony displaying a rainbow flag.] When I saw that—you know, I’m married—but I wanted to accept that, so recently, during Pride Week, I told my brother, “I want to go and march with them, to show that I accept that.” That’s what we can do.","3826","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"But ISIS is just one side: the Syrian regime is the other side of this terror. And there is no right side.","3827","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"What role can refugees play in the fight against ISIS?","3828","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"The best thing we can do is to fully integrate into our societies. If I really want to be part of this culture, I have to accept it.","3829","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"Late last month, a man armed with a sword attacked a school near where you live, in Gothenburg. He’d apparently left a suicide note, saying that he intended to attack foreigners and believed that Sweden shouldn’t take as many foreigners.","3830","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"I read about that, but I haven’t seen anything like that myself. My experience? Whenever people see me—someone who is educated, looking for work—they react very positively to that, they feel very happy that these recent immigrants are working and trying to integrate.","3831","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"You’ve gotten a job since we last spoke, right?","3832","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"Yes, at a garage, I’m doing car repair.","3833","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"Had you done that back in Syria?","3834","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"No, I’m learning on the job. It’s totally new to me. There are a couple of Arab Swedes there, and another Swedish guy who’s been teaching me. I’ve been his understudy.","3835","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"What did you do today?","3836","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"We fixed two cars, an Audi and a Volvo.","3837","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"Doing what?","3838","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"Changing their tires, from summer tires to winter tires.","3839","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"Earlier in the fall, the Swedish government seemed full of support and goodwill for refugees. But, to some extent, their idealism seems to have run up against the reality of the situation. They have since closed the borders. Does that affect your plans to bring your wife to Sweden?","3840","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"Your information is not completely correct. Sweden did not close their borders, they just regulated them. For my wife, it’s different anyway, because she would enter Sweden under a different program, one that is not affected by these new regulations.","3841","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"What’s the latest with her plan to join you?","3842","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"I had my interview with an asylum officer last week, on November 6th. The result of that interview will determine my residency, and whether I can get political or humanitarian asylum. The lady said it looks good, and that they will update me soon. Then I can submit an application, and my wife will join me.","3843","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"And have you started a language program?","3844","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"Not yet. I’m only eligible for the nonofficial charities programs, but there are so many refugees trying to integrate and learn Swedish that there aren’t enough open slots! Once I get my residency permit, I’m guaranteed a slot.","3845","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"You seemed to have landed on your feet. What advice would you give to another Syrian, still in Syria, who is considering making the journey to Europe?","3846","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
"Do it. Prepare to fully integrate, learn the language, adapt to the social structure, and embrace the culture. And he should love this new country from the bottom of his heart, because this new country accepted him.","3847","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/refugee-life-after-paris-an-interview-with-ghaith"
