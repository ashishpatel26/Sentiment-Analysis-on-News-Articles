"Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, announced Thursday that he was running for president as a Democrat, injecting a progressive voice into the contest and providing Hillary Rodham Clinton with her first official rival for the party’s nomination.","APRIL 29, 2015","1","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-for-president.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=76B53E5C95B32DB0134402339C2434C8&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"
"Avoiding the fanfare that several Republicans have chosen so far when announcing their candidacies, Mr. Sanders issued a statement to supporters that laid out his goals for reducing income inequality, addressing climate change and scaling back the influence of money in politics.","2","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-for-president.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=76B53E5C95B32DB0134402339C2434C8&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"

"Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a registered independent and self-described socialist who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, has made a name for himself in Congress attacking the financial industry and “the billionaire class.” Though he is considered unlikely to mount a serious challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton, his positions on major issues could help push her to address the concerns of more left-leaning voters. Here is a look at some of those positions.","APRIL 30, 2015","4","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/politics/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"FOREIGN POLICY Mr. Sanders opposed the war in Iraq and warned against the United States getting bogged down in Afghanistan, calling it a costly quagmire like Vietnam. He says the fight against the Islamic State should be undertaken by countries like Saudi Arabia, which borders Iraq and, he argues, has the financial and military resources to fight the extremist group.","5","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/politics/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Sanders has supported President Obama’s use of sanctions to punish Russia for its policies toward Ukraine, and he similarly backs Mr. Obama’s efforts to strike a deal with Iran over its nuclear program.","6","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/politics/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"ENVIRONMENT Mr. Sanders has warned about what he calls the severe impact of human-caused climate change. He supports stringent measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including tough standards for new vehicles, as well as some more politically unorthodox ideas, like providing money to study carbon sequestration, or storing carbon dioxide, to delay global warming.","7","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/politics/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"SAME-SEX MARRIAGE Mr. Sanders strongly supports same-sex marriage. “It’s time for the Supreme Court to catch up to the American people and legalize gay marriage,” he said this week.","8","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/politics/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"IMMIGRATION Mr. Sanders supported Mr. Obama’s 2014 executive action shielding millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. But he has also called for reining in the guest-worker program that provides many businesses with low-wage immigrant labor, saying it fuels youth unemployment.","9","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/politics/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"HEALTH CARE Mr. Sanders supports a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care system.","10","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/politics/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"ECONOMY Mr. Sanders supports increased government spending to generate jobs and rebuild the nation’s infrastructure. And he would raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from $7.25, although in early April he called a $15 minimum wage “reasonable.”","11","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/politics/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"He has proposed breaking up the nation’s largest banks, saying the six biggest ones wield too much control over the economy. He has also proposed barring banks’ chief executives from serving on the Federal Reserve’s 12 regional boards of directors, saying their membership on those boards poses a conflict of interest and undermines regulation of the financial services industry.","12","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/politics/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"He vehemently opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership with Asian nations, a trade deal Mr. Obama has championed. “Are you on the side of working people who would suffer as a result of this disastrous trade agreement, and seeing their jobs go to China or Mexico?” Mr. Sanders said recently. “Or are you on the side of corporate America and pharmaceuticals?”","13","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/politics/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"The presidential candidacy of Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont and self-described socialist who will most likely champion the liberal cause, won’t change that fact that Hillary Rodham Clinton is poised to win the Democratic nomination without a serious contest.","APRIL 30, 2015","14","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/upshot/the-problem-for-bernie-sanders-the-narrow-lane-to-hillary-clintons-left.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=3E21D9EE06095D9F8328F777DC0C8B1A&gwt=pay"
"That’s true even though the Democratic Party’s liberal activist base, which strongly opposed her bid in 2008, has considerable reservations about her ties to Wall Street, her foreign policy, the recent allegations about foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation and the revelations about the private email account and server she used when she was the secretary of state.","15","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/upshot/the-problem-for-bernie-sanders-the-narrow-lane-to-hillary-clintons-left.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=3E21D9EE06095D9F8328F777DC0C8B1A&gwt=pay"

"Some of these self-described moderates hold fairly liberal views. But the “mostly liberal” Democrats barely outnumber Democrats with “mixed” or conservative policy views, according to the Pew data, which classified respondents based on how consistently they agreed with Democratic policy positions. Only about a quarter of Democratic-leaners hold the consistently liberal views that would potentially put them to the left of Mrs. Clinton.","17","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/upshot/the-problem-for-bernie-sanders-the-narrow-lane-to-hillary-clintons-left.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=3E21D9EE06095D9F8328F777DC0C8B1A&gwt=pay"
"These moderate and conservative Democrats allowed Bill Clinton to easily win the nomination in 1992 as a moderate Southern Democrat. They helped give Hillary Clinton a wide lead in the polls in 2008, until Barack Obama won Iowa and built an enormous lead among black voters — who represent about 20 percent of Democratic voters. Many black voters are moderate or conservative, allowing Mr. Obama to overcome the disadvantage faced by left-liberal Democratic candidates.","18","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/upshot/the-problem-for-bernie-sanders-the-narrow-lane-to-hillary-clintons-left.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=3E21D9EE06095D9F8328F777DC0C8B1A&gwt=pay"
"If the front-runner for the Democratic nomination were a fairly moderate Democrat, it would be easier to imagine a liberal Democratic candidate who could consolidate the liberal wing of the party and have a real chance of wining the nomination.","19","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/upshot/the-problem-for-bernie-sanders-the-narrow-lane-to-hillary-clintons-left.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=3E21D9EE06095D9F8328F777DC0C8B1A&gwt=pay"
"But by any measure — Senate voting record, public statements or campaign contributions — Mrs. Clinton is a liberal. She fares better among liberal Democrats than moderate ones in public opinion polls. She struggled to win over very liberal voters when running against Mr. Obama in 2008. But she did not lose them by a wide margin — and in some places, she won them. It was also at a time when the war in Iraq was more salient, and her weakness on Iraq then was far clearer than her weakness on economic issues now.","20","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/upshot/the-problem-for-bernie-sanders-the-narrow-lane-to-hillary-clintons-left.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=3E21D9EE06095D9F8328F777DC0C8B1A&gwt=pay"
"A strong challenger on Mrs. Clinton’s left would probably stand a good chance of faring well among very liberal voters again, but would struggle to build a broad enough coalition to have a plausible chance of winning the nomination.","21","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/upshot/the-problem-for-bernie-sanders-the-narrow-lane-to-hillary-clintons-left.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=3E21D9EE06095D9F8328F777DC0C8B1A&gwt=pay"

"“If I see somebody that is just so hateful, then of course I’m going to unfollow them,” said Ms. Payne, whose “friend” count on Facebook has dwindled since Mrs. Clinton’s announcement. “I’ve lost touch with many great childhood friends of mine due to social media providing a platform for political discussion.”","87","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/us/politics/on-facebook-muting-friends-political-views-is-as-simple-as-clicking-unfollow.html?_r=0"
"With the presidential race heating up, a torrent of politically charged commentary has flooded Facebook, the world’s largest social networking site, with some users deploying their “unfollow” buttons like a television remote to silence distasteful political views. Coupled with the algorithm now powering Facebook’s news feed, the unfollowing is creating a more homogenized political experience of like-minded users, resulting in the kind of polarization more often associated with MSNBC or Fox News. And it may ultimately deflate a central promise of the Internet: Instead of offering people a diverse marketplace of challenging ideas, the web is becoming just another self-perpetuating echo chamber.","88","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/us/politics/on-facebook-muting-friends-political-views-is-as-simple-as-clicking-unfollow.html?_r=0"

"In theory, Facebook’s algorithm provides for an overall better experience on the site, ranking the number of posts likely to be ignored by the user lower in the news feed.

"For example, users who “like” Mrs. Clinton’s page will be presented with more posts about the candidate, probably generating more “likes” on posts and photographs and the chance to comment on new campaign memes.

"Zac Moffatt, a founder of Targeted Victory, a digital strategy firm, said that Facebook’s organic reach, like candidate pages, was starting to be limited for campaigns, in part as more users self-selected an experience, and that could affect their news feed and the ads they saw during primary season.","99","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/us/politics/on-facebook-muting-friends-political-views-is-as-simple-as-clicking-unfollow.html?_r=0"
"“If you’re a known Democrat, if you publicly post that you’re a Democrat, you probably aren’t going to see” Republican ads as well, Mr. Moffatt said. “You could conceivably, in the primary, have that process where you’re completely bifurcated where liberals see things that are liberal and Republicans see things that are Republican.”","100","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/us/politics/on-facebook-muting-friends-political-views-is-as-simple-as-clicking-unfollow.html?_r=0"

"But at the same time, more partisan political videos may trickle into news feeds as campaigns deploy Facebook’s new video advertising platform to reach specific groups. A video by the Clinton campaign, for instance, would probably not be targeted toward those using Mr. Cruz’s campaign logo as their avatar.

Vincent Harris, the chief digital strategist for Senator Rand Paul’s campaign, equipped the candidate’s many followers with avatars, photographs, videos, memes and links to post on their Facebook walls on the day Mr. Paul announced that he was running for president.

"Among seven potential Democratic presidential contenders, Hillary Clinton is the overwhelming favorite — and the third-most liberal candidate. How the other candidates are arrayed on an ideological spectrum could make her run for the White House easier than the last time out.","FEB. 17, 2015","112","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/upshot/hillary-clinton-and-the-2016-democrats-mostly-liberal-together.html?_r=0"
"In some ways, the cast of candidates for 2016 resembles the group from the 2008 race, with a field of stalwartly liberal politicians. Mrs. Clinton was slightly more liberal in 2008 than now, according to Crowdpac, which scores politicians on a left-right scale of -10 to 10. (Crowdpac bases this mainly on campaign contributions, but also on votes and speeches.) Her problem was that Barack Obama, who was further to the left of her — at -7.8 to her -6.9 — also had the donors who were to the left of her. He ran a better campaign, particularly in Iowa, and benefited from a surge in money from small-dollar donors.","113","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/upshot/hillary-clinton-and-the-2016-democrats-mostly-liberal-together.html?_r=0"
"This time, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (-8.2) and Bernie Sanders (-8.3), Vermont’s independent senator, are to her left. Ms. Warren has the higher fund-raising profile of the two, with a leadership PAC that raised more than $2 million during the 2014 election cycle. But she and Mrs. Clinton (and to a lesser extent Mr. Sanders) would be competing for a similar pool of donors. During her 2012 Senate race, Ms. Warren raised more than $3.4 million from individuals who also gave to Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign, Federal Election Commission data shows.","114","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/upshot/hillary-clinton-and-the-2016-democrats-mostly-liberal-together.html?_r=0"

"There are few issues where the gap between those two is significant. Gun control policy and immigration are possible points of contention, according to Crowdpac, which also generates scores for issues. On both issues, Ms. Warren is scored as much more liberal than Mrs. Clinton.","117","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/upshot/hillary-clinton-and-the-2016-democrats-mostly-liberal-together.html?_r=0"

"There is more room to the right of Mrs. Clinton. Most of the other potential candidates fit there, including Vice President Joe Biden, who has a -4.4 score, and Jim Webb, the former Virginia senator, who is at -5.3. Those two resemble the more centrist Democratic candidates that won the nomination in previous elections. Al Gore, for instance, had a Crowdpac score of -5.1 in 2000.

"But it also spotlighted the scale of the political obstacles standing in the way of one of his cherished goals. Mr. Obama’s administration has been working for months to lay the groundwork to win “fast track” authority that would give the president the power to submit trade agreements to Congress and have them considered on an expedited basis, without amendments and subject only to a yes-or-no vote. The authority is widely regarded as essential to completing the ambitious trade deal, called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would lower trade barriers between the United States, Japan and 10 other nations.","130","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/politics/obama-pledges-to-defend-democrats-on-trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal.html?_r=0"

Those concerns are likely to draw greater attention with the entry into the 2016 presidential race of Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, a vocal opponent of trade deals. And skepticism has yet to wear down in the ranks of the historically pro-trade Republican Party, where some lawmakers are loath to grant the president any additional power, and others are loyal to a Tea Party base that routinely criticizes what it calls the evils of crony capitalism.","131","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/politics/obama-pledges-to-defend-democrats-on-trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal.html?_r=0"

Paul Dano, Ms. Kazan’s real-life partner, is Calvin, a literary whiz kid turned blocked writer who breathes life into this figment of his imagination, and then directs her every move. “ ‘Ruby Sparks,’ directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the team behind ‘Little Miss Sunshine,’ has the same zany and sweet tone laced with just enough hardheaded wisdom to keep it grounded in psychological truth,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “The screenplay, by Ms. Kazan, is so polished and witty that it immediately puts her in the same league as Diablo Cody. And Ms. Kazan’s lovely, tart performance is the equal of Ellen Page’s portrayal of the title character in ‘Juno.’ Both are impetuous screwball heroines who could have been created only by women.”","APRIL 19, 2015","148","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/arts/whats-on-sunday.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=2D1292BF576242CD693BEE80713344D9&gwt=pay"

"We’re on record here at The Upshot as believing that Hillary Clinton is in an extremely strong position to win the Democratic nomination. And as Brendan Nyhan has explained, the furor over her private email account is likely to affect far fewer voters than may now appear to be the case.","MARCH 12, 2015","151","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"

"Mrs. Clinton’s dominance has kept other top Democrats from taking the kind of steps that serious presidential candidates have typically taken by now. Additionally, the Democrats’ poor performance in statewide races during the Obama years has left the party with a relatively shallow bench. All of this helps explain the absence of Democratic infighting about the email account.","154","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Without Mrs. Clinton, there would be no Democratic front-runner. Initially, there would not even be a top tier of candidates on par with the Republicans’ top tier of Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and possibly Marco Rubio.

As a general rule, you should trust him over me on political analysis.)","155","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Eventually, the Democrats would produce a nominee, even if it were not Mrs. Clinton. As a thought experiment, we decided to imagine a Democratic race without her. To be clear, we’re not predicting such a race. But we generally don’t believe in putting 100 percent odds on political matters. So here goes:","156","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"The first candidate. Vice President Joe Biden wants to run for president. He wants to run as a populist defender of the middle class — a native son of Scranton, Pa. — and the heir to President Obama.","157","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"He has some obvious strengths. Many Democrats feel genuine affection for him. Mr. Obama seems to be among them and could feel some pressure to support his No. 2. If the economy continues to gather steam, Mr. Biden could also promise more of the same on policy grounds. And Mr. Biden could easily run a campaign that emphasized his stylistic differences with his boss, including his long experience in Washington and his decidedly un-egghead-like persona. Americans tend to prefer their presidents to be different from their immediate predecessors.","158","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"But he would hardly clear the field. Many Democratic operatives have a hard time seeing him as the nominee even without Mrs. Clinton. Remember that he’s run for president twice before, with miserable results. In 1987, he withdrew months before the first primary. In 2008, he received less than 1 percent of vote in the Iowa caucuses — less than half as much as Bill Richardson.","159","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"This time, he would have the chance to become the oldest president to be inaugurated for the first time by more than four years. He will be 74 in January 2017.

"The former nominees. In today’s media-saturated environment, losing nominees have a hard time running again. Voters have spent months learning about them — and tend to remember them, fairly or not, as presidential losers. Nearly a half-century has passed since a defeated general-election candidate (Richard Nixon, who lost in 1960) recovered to win his party’s nomination again (Mr. Nixon, in 1968).","161","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"

"The Democrats happen to have two former nominees who have remained very active in public life. John Kerry, the current secretary of state, went so far as to consider running again in 2008, just four years after losing to President George W. Bush. Al Gore, meanwhile, has won a Nobel Prize and an Emmy Award and also starred in an Oscar-winning movie since leaving the vice presidency — all for his climate activism, which would play well with Democratic primary voters.","163","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Both men have their strengths. They’re seen as broad-minded policy thinkers who Democrats wistfully wish had beaten Mr. Bush. On the other hand, they’re also seen as relatively stiff candidates whose lack of an everyman’s touch helped them lose to Mr. Bush.","164","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Kerry would be 73 on inauguration day in 2017, nearly as old as Mr. Biden. Mr. Gore would be only 68 — but also seems less interested in presidential politics these days.","165","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"The liberal hero. Without Mrs. Clinton in the race, Elizabeth Warren would seem much more likely to run. She would have a chance to consolidate the liberal part of the party while other candidates were fighting over the more centrist establishment.","166","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Historically, liberal candidates have failed to win the nomination, partly because of the overlooked role that conservative states play in selecting a nominee. Ms. Warren would have to hope that she could prevail for one of two reasons: Either the more moderate primary voters would remain splintered long enough for her to establish a large delegate lead; or the rise in inequality and public dissatisfaction in recent years would move the Democratic primary electorate to the left, allowing a liberal candidate to win. (Of course, liberals have long been predicting such a development, to no avail.)","167","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Before anyone assumes she would be the favorite, it’s worth keeping in mind that her electoral record is still thin — and leaves room for questions. She ran seven percentage points behind Mr. Obama in Massachusetts when she won her Senate seat in 2012. But she would immediately become the most-watched Democrat in the absence of Mrs. Clinton.","168","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"The governors. Four of the last six presidents have been former governors. They are able to run campaigns emphasizing their executive accomplishments and promising to change Washington, even if they don’t actually do so.","169","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"But the Democrats have a distinct weakness in trying to find a governor to be their nominee in 2016: The party currently holds only 18 of the nation’s 50 governorships. None of those 18 seem in a good position to win the nomination.","170","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Andrew Cuomo, of New York, inspires little excitement among most Democrats and is to the right of many of them. John Hickenlooper, of Colorado, would never have been a typical candidate — and he won re-election last year with just 49 percent of the vote. Jerry Brown, of California, makes Mr. Biden and Mr. Kerry look young and inexperienced. Jack Markell, of Delaware, has a solid policy record but little name recognition or political base.","171","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Then there are the former governors, who may be stronger. Martin O’Malley, of Maryland, is making noises about taking on Mrs. Clinton and also has a serious policy record. But he has to contend with the fact that his handpicked successor lost in one of the nation’s bluest states. Deval Patrick, of Massachusetts, is another two-term governor of a blue state who failed to persuade voters to elect a Democrat to succeed him. Brian Schweitzer, of Montana, would need to emphasize his populist economic policies over his conservative stance on some other issues to have a chance.","172","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"The senators (who aren’t named Elizabeth Warren). The Senate has the deepest bench of younger Democrats — those who could plausibly hope to be the next nominee, after Mrs. Clinton. Without her in the race, several would be tempted to join it, in hopes of winning or merely strengthening their position for the future.","173","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York, both occupy ground near the center of the party. Either could make history as the first female nominee — and many Democratic voters seem eager to co-educate the presidency.","174","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Michael Bennet, of Colorado; Cory Booker, of New Jersey; and Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, could run as fresh faces. Mark Warner (who explored a run in 2008) and Tim Kaine, both of Virginia, could point to their experience as governors and their success at winning in a purple state. Dick Meyer, the chief Washington correspondent for Scripps, recently called Mr. Kaine the most likely non-Clinton nominee.","175","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"If Ms. Warren did not run, Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, could try to claim the populist mantle. And might Al Franken, of Minnesota, be tempted to make a run? He wouldn’t be the first former entertainer.","176","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Two candidates who would still have virtually no chance are Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, and Jim Webb, the former Virginia senator. They both may run, even with Mrs. Clinton in the race.","177","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Everyone else. Every Democrat nominee since John W. Davis in 1924 (who received 29 percent of the vote) had been a senator or governor. But history isn’t destiny, and several other Democrats could be tempted to get into the race.","178","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago, would first need to win his re-election and then come up with a strategy to win over some of the liberals who view him skeptically. Julian Castro, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who is seen as a rising star, remains very young (40).","179","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"You could also imagine a Democrat running mostly to raise the profile of a single issue. Could Tom Steyer bring more attention to climate change by running himself rather than by backing other candidates? What about a candidate who tries to give voice to the growing number of Latinos, as Jesse Jackson did for African-Americans in the 1980s?","180","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Ultimately, the relative strength of these potential candidates will probably matter more in the years beyond 2016. If Mrs. Clinton wins the nomination, as expected, the party will need another nominee in either 2020 (if she loses the general election) or 2024 (if she wins).","181","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"

"All of which underscores the importance of Mrs. Clinton’s choices for her vice-presidential nominee. After her, the party is lacking obvious heirs apparent.

"The efforts to coalesce behind an alternative candidate — in frequent calls, teleconferences and meetings involving a range of organizations, many of them with overlapping memberships — are premised on two articles of conservative faith: Republicans did not win the White House in the past two elections because their nominees were too moderate and failed to excite the party’s base.

"IF you want to support Senator Bernie Sanders for president but worry that he doesn’t have a shot against Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination, take heart from the Broadway show “Fun Home,” which won the Tony Award for best musical last week.","JUNE 13, 2015","940","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-can-take-heart-from-a-broadway-champ.html?_r=0"
"“Fun Home” was the decided underdog: a nominee with little money, bold themes, no frills and a small team on the payroll. (Sound familiar, Sanders-ites?) The story of a lesbian cartoonist and her relationship with her closeted gay father, “Fun Home” is about facing difficult truths and the tragic consequences when we don’t — the very message, as it happens, that the Sanders campaign is offering to America about income inequality and climate change. Compared with the flashy big-budget musical “An American in Paris,” which was the safe bet to win the Tony, “Fun Home” looked like a fringe contender, too dark and offbeat to have wide appeal, not unlike certain politicians who are easily dismissed as quixotic nonfactors.","941","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-can-take-heart-from-a-broadway-champ.html?_r=0"
"In other words, “Fun Home” isn’t the sort of musical you imagine on Broadway — just as Mr. Sanders isn’t the sort of politician you imagine in the White House. (He would be the first socialist president, after all.)","942","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-can-take-heart-from-a-broadway-champ.html?_r=0"
"What does it take for an underdog to succeed? In politics and on Broadway, two worlds I’ve covered as a reporter, some of the factors are similar. Message and perseverance are crucial. Money — not a fortune, but at least enough — is essential. And authenticity matters most of all.","943","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-can-take-heart-from-a-broadway-champ.html?_r=0"
"Underdog candidates like Harry S. Truman in 1948 and Barack Obama in the 2008 primary contest struck many voters as authentic leaders who were willing to speak truth to power (Truman railing against a “do-nothing Congress,” Mr. Obama opposing the American invasion of Iraq) and who did not try to be all things to all voters. Truman was quintessentially Midwestern and didn’t shy away from his roots, no matter what coastal elites thought of him. Mr. Obama was the first black presidential nominee and didn’t shy away from his race, giving an eloquent speech in the face of controversy over his Chicago pastor. Many Americans came to see both men as the real deal.","944","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-can-take-heart-from-a-broadway-champ.html?_r=0"
"“Underdogs succeed when the voters are in a certain zone — I call it ‘the voter zone’ — where they are looking for something, and the underdog candidate taps into that something,” said Tad Devine, a veteran Democratic consultant who is advising Mr. Sanders. “It can be a set of issues, attitudes or beliefs that voters feel are being overlooked by the front-running candidates. If the underdog can get into the voter zone with the voters by themselves, and if they are credible, they can win despite the odds.”","945","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-can-take-heart-from-a-broadway-champ.html?_r=0"
"Both “Fun Home” and “An American in Paris” had plenty of credibility in the run-up to the Tony Awards: They were winning over critics and filling seats with paying customers, two meaningful measures in the eyes of the 844 Tony voters eligible to cast ballots for best musical. But “Fun Home” had a freshness that appealed to many liberals among the Tony electorate: Shows about lesbians are rare on Broadway. Its producers, meanwhile, had shown perseverance by developing the musical for years and raising enough money ($5.2 million) to transfer it from the Public Theater, Off Broadway, to Broadway.","946","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-can-take-heart-from-a-broadway-champ.html?_r=0"
"And unlike the beautiful people and plot contrivances of “An American in Paris,” the relationships and emotions in “Fun Home” felt deeply authentic: a family of normal-looking people where love and loyalty mixed with resentments and rancor. (Come to think of it, the father’s bad haircut brings to mind Mr. Sanders’s messy mop.)","947","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-can-take-heart-from-a-broadway-champ.html?_r=0"
"“A lot of people loved ‘Fun Home,’ but they also believed in what it was about and wanted to see it win,” said Scott Sanders, a veteran Broadway producer (who is not related to the senator).","948","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-can-take-heart-from-a-broadway-champ.html?_r=0"
"Underdog victories can be fleeting, of course. The musical “Nine” beat “Dreamgirls” for the Tony in 1982, but “Dreamgirls” has become the more cherished title. Another upset win came in 2004 when “Avenue Q” triumphed over “Wicked” — yet “Wicked” is the one about to hit $4 billion in global ticket sales. In politics, former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont — also Mr. Sanders’s home state — had the antiwar message and political authenticity (“I’m here to represent the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party”) that pleased many party members in the 2004 presidential primaries, but came up short to the establishment candidate, Senator John Kerry. And Senator Sanders may be attracting attention to his message by drawing large crowds, like the thousand people who turned out for him this month in Keene, N.H., but Mrs. Clinton is sure to attract a sea of fans to her rallies on Roosevelt Island on Saturday and in Des Moines on Sunday.","949","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-can-take-heart-from-a-broadway-champ.html?_r=0"
"“Like Eugene McCarthy in 1968, Sanders will offer a way to cast a protest vote in a primary against Hillary Clinton, but I don’t expect him to register much support beyond that,” said Douglas E.

"Dare to dream, the underdogs reply.

"“It’s the underdogs who dare to push the envelope, who dare to take risks, and who dare to be different,” said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group. “In doing so, it’s the underdogs who prove the pessimists wrong and push the world forward.”","952","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-can-take-heart-from-a-broadway-champ.html?_r=0"

"“People kept saying that we were too small and challenging to beat something big and comforting like ‘American in Paris,’ ’’ Ms. Bechdel said. “This is where the analogy between ‘Fun Home’ and presidential politics is interesting.

"Mr. Sanders, the Vermont independent senator running for the Democratic presidential nomination, has raised at least $8.3 million online through June 17, according to Federal Election Commission records. His campaign won’t file its initial report until July 15, but filings by ActBlue, the online fund-raising committee that serves as a conduit for Democratic campaigns, show that Mr. Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, has brought in more money in May and the first half of June than any other Democratic candidate using ActBlue.","956","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/upshot/bernie-sanderss-early-online-haul-8-3-million.html?_r=0"

"His total is greater than that of Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor who also uses ActBlue and has collected more than $331,000 in his first month of online fund-raising. But Mr. Sanders’s online success is likely to be eclipsed in the first set of filings by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has a larger network of donors and more time to raise money.

"Without the support of a “super PAC,” Mr. Sanders’s total may seem small compared with some of the other 2016 candidates, but anywhere close to $10 million would be a very respectable total for a candidate who raised a total of $6.2 million for his 2012 Senate race. One question is whether this initial flood of donations represents the high-water mark or can be sustained.","960","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/upshot/bernie-sanderss-early-online-haul-8-3-million.html?_r=0"
"Unlike candidate filings, ActBlue’s F.E.C. reports don’t make for easy browsing, because they often include tens of thousands of rows on a spreadsheet detailing millions of dollars of contributions.

"But if Mrs. Clinton was seeking to unify Democrats behind her, two of her rivals for the nomination — Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont — were hardly willing to go along, as they used their speeches at the Democratic National Committee’s summer meeting to aim unusual broadsides at the party overtly and Mrs. Clinton implicitly.","963","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html?_r=0"
"In the fiercest speech of his candidacy so far, Mr. O’Malley condemned his party’s leadership for curtailing the number of primary debates to six and scheduling them at times when few people would see them. (He went even further in a news conference afterward when asked if the party had “rigged” the debate calendar to benefit Mrs. Clinton and lower the visibility of her rivals. “Yes, I think so,” he replied. “Don’t you?”)","964","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html?_r=0"
"Mr. O’Malley’s repeated demand for more debates drew standing ovations from the audience and scowls from the party chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, seated a few feet away. And if the cheering Democrats were a sign that party members were not ready to coalesce around Mrs. Clinton, the energetic reception for Mr. Sanders — and bursts of applause for his own criticisms of the party — confirmed that unity would have to wait.","965","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Sanders challenged party regulars to embrace his candidacy, warning that the tens of thousands of followers he has attracted may not vote for Democratic candidates in 2016 unless he is at the top of the ticket. He said the party’s midterm losses in 2014, when Republicans won control of the Senate, had resulted from “abysmally, embarrassingly low” turnout among Democrats.","966","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html?_r=0"
"“In my view, Democrats will not retain the White House, will not regain the Senate or the U.S. House, will not be successful in dozens of governor races across the country, unless we generate excitement and momentum and produce a huge voter turnout,” he said. “With all due respect — and I do not mean to insult anyone here — that turnout, that enthusiasm, will not happen with politics as usual.”","967","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html?_r=0"
"The three candidates — as well as a fourth, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island — barely differed on policy, and all of them were withering in their remarks about Mr. Trump and the other Republican candidates. Where they differed was in their efforts to rally the Democratic faithful: Mrs. Clinton sought to keep the focus on berating and beating the Republicans, while Mr. O’Malley and Mr. Sanders tried to dissuade undecided Democrats from closing ranks behind her.","968","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html?_r=0"

"Mixing humor with displays of disgust, Mrs. Clinton gave a red-meat speech that drew enthusiastic reactions. For the moment, the controversy over her email server, and the possibility that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could join the race, receded as the crowd reveled in her attacks on Republicans.","970","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html?_r=0"
"“Their flamboyant front-runner has grabbed a lot of attention lately, but if you look at everyone else’s policies, they’re pretty much the same,” Mrs. Clinton said. “They’re Trump without the pizazz or the hair.”","971","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html?_r=0"
"“You know, a lot of people have said a lot of things about my hair over the years, so I do kind of know what Donald is going through,” she went on. Then, mocking Mr. Trump’s invitation to a voter on Thursday in South Carolina to pull his hair to prove its authenticity, she said, “If anyone wonders if mine is real, here’s the answer: The hair is real, the color isn’t.” Letting the laughter die down, she added, “And come to think of it, I wonder if that’s true for Donald, too.”","972","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html?_r=0"
"Turning from smiling to stern, she continued: “You hear Mr. Trump say hateful things about immigrants, even about their babies.

"Mrs. Clinton also presented herself as the candidate whose coattails other Democrats could ride into office in 2016. Some Democrats have criticized President Obama for allowing the party to grow weaker and less well financed; Mrs. Clinton tacitly alluded to that when she pledged to help elect more Democrats to state legislatures so that they could reshape congressional districts to keep Democrats from being “routed” in the future as they were in 2010.","974","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html?_r=0"

"Accusing the party of trying to keep its own ideas hidden as the Republican candidates spew “racist hate” from their debate lecterns, Mr. O’Malley questioned Democrats’ decision to hold “four debates and four debates only” before the first four states finish voting.","976","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html?_r=0"
"“This is totally unprecedented in our party’s history,” he said. “This sort of rigged process has never been attempted before. Whose decree is it exactly? Where did it come from? To what end?

"Mr. Sanders, a longtime independent who was attending his first Democratic National Committee meeting, was warmly complimentary at first, crediting party leaders for fighting on behalf of working people and low-income Americans. But he soon turned, suggesting that the Democrats’ 2014 losses could be repeated if the party nominated a traditional politician.","978","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html?_r=0"
"“My friends, the Republican Party did not win the midterm election in November: We lost that election,” Mr. Sanders said. “We lost because voter turnout was abysmally, embarrassingly low, and millions of working people, young people and people of color gave up on politics as usual, and they stayed home.”","979","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html?_r=0"

"As a measure of democracy, one of the more encouraging statistics of the 2016 presidential race is the fact that the average contribution to the long-shot campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders is $31.30. It would be hard to buy any politician for $31.30. That is exactly the message Mr. Sanders intends, in renouncing fat-cat, super PAC campaigning that is turning American politics into an exercise in plutocracy.","AUG. 28, 2015","982","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/opinion/bernie-sanderss-small-beer-donors-in-the-big-money-casino.html?_r=0"
"Americans of ordinary means have made 400,000 donations — about 80 percent of them were $200 or less — to Mr. Sanders. Contrast that with the appalling fact that fewer than 400 of the nation’s most affluent families, writing six- and seven-figure checks, account for almost half the money raised so far by both parties in the campaign, according to an analysis by The Times.","983","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/opinion/bernie-sanderss-small-beer-donors-in-the-big-money-casino.html?_r=0"
"The Sanders campaign, whatever its fate, has at least established that small-beer donors are alive and well and enthusiastic in America. What they and democracy need as a quid pro quo is a revival of the public financing system that protected politics after the corruption of the Watergate scandals.","984","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/opinion/bernie-sanderss-small-beer-donors-in-the-big-money-casino.html?_r=0"
"As things stand now, the Supreme Court’s disastrous Citizens United decision has grossly boosted the buying power of corporate and special interest donors and made a casino frenzy of the race. The Koch brothers have proudly organized more than 400 of their wealthy allies to create a super war chest of $889 million for Republican candidates. The Jeb Bush campaign, pretending to remain at arm’s length from its supposedly independent super PACs, raised over $100 million so far in big-check donations. Hillary Rodham Clinton, aiming to stay competitive, has raised more than $20 million in super PAC money, much of it from millionaires, even as she pursues small-dollar donations and vows to do something about campaign reform.","985","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/opinion/bernie-sanderss-small-beer-donors-in-the-big-money-casino.html?_r=0"
"The small donors carrying the Sanders campaign are a refreshing break from the egregious money bundlers. Gone missing, however, is the post-Watergate system of matching funds that leveled the playing field for less affluent candidates and worked well until Congress failed to update it, even though it was embraced for two decades by the major presidential candidates. George W. Bush broke with the system for more deep-pocket support in his 2000 primary victory, while President Obama was the first to turn away from it in a general election in 2008.","986","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/opinion/bernie-sanderss-small-beer-donors-in-the-big-money-casino.html?_r=0"

"As a result, many have framed Mr. Sanders’s challenge in racial terms. But his challenge in getting the support of nonwhite voters is not simply a problem of race. It’s primarily a problem with moderate and less educated Democrats, regardless of race, which disproportionately affects his support among nonwhite voters. His challenge among black voters may be no greater than his challenge among ideologically and demographically similar white voters.","1033","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/upshot/what-the-hispanic-vote-says-about-bernie-sanderss-chances.html?_r=0"
"It’s not very fair to Mr. Sanders, or any liberal Democrat, to judge his support among black voters by comparing him with Mr. Obama. In 2008, there was a strong relationship between the proportion of a demographic group that self-identified as liberal and Mr. Obama’s strength against Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Obama lost all of the least liberal groups of the Democratic Party, except black voters.","1034","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/upshot/what-the-hispanic-vote-says-about-bernie-sanderss-chances.html?_r=0"
"Without Mr. Obama’s unusual strength among black voters, another challenge to Mrs. Clinton on her left would struggle to keep Mrs. Clinton from doing well enough on moderates to deny her the nomination. The easiest way to think about Mr. Sanders’s challenge is to remember Mr. Obama’s weakness among Hispanic voters in 2008. Over all, Mr. Obama lost Hispanic voters by 26 points against Mrs. Clinton — worse than his margin among white voters.","1035","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/upshot/what-the-hispanic-vote-says-about-bernie-sanderss-chances.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Obama’s weakness among Hispanic voters didn’t fit neatly into the conventional explanation of Mr. Obama’s challenges in 2008. Commentators often presumed that Mr. Obama was weak among less liberal and less educated white voters because of racism, so they undertook tortured efforts to fit Hispanic voters into the same frame, arguing that Hispanic voters wouldn’t vote for a black candidate, perhaps because of urban rivalries between blacks and Hispanics.","1036","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/upshot/what-the-hispanic-vote-says-about-bernie-sanderss-chances.html?_r=0"
"Maybe Mr. Obama was held back by antiblack sentiment among Hispanic voters. But there was never much evidence to support the theory. It seemed more like a case of building a narrative to fit the result: If Mr. Obama had done well among Hispanic voters, does anyone doubt that commentators would have argued he was helped by being nonwhite? And Mr. Obama was weak among Hispanic voters everywhere, even in communities hundreds of miles from a sizable black population. His strength in general elections among Hispanic voters makes it still harder to argue that he was held back by racial animus.","1037","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/upshot/what-the-hispanic-vote-says-about-bernie-sanderss-chances.html?_r=0"
"A better explanation is that he simply did not have great appeal to traditionally Democratic voters in working-class, less liberal communities, regardless of race. It’s likely that Mr. Obama did especially poorly among white Southerners and Appalachians. His weak showing among Hispanics, however, suggests that much of Mr. Obama’s weakness among white Southerners and Appalachians was attributable to non-racial demographic characteristics, like the low level of educational attainment and Democratic voting tradition common to both groups.","1038","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/upshot/what-the-hispanic-vote-says-about-bernie-sanderss-chances.html?_r=0"
"In Texas, for instance, Mr. Obama’s worst counties weren’t white, conservative, Southern counties, but heavily Hispanic counties along the Mexican border. His worst was Starr County, where Mrs. Clinton won by a margin of 83 to 16 in a place where Hispanics represent 96 percent of the population.","1039","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/upshot/what-the-hispanic-vote-says-about-bernie-sanderss-chances.html?_r=0"
"Appalachian and Hispanic voters might seem very different, but they’re similar in crucial respects for a Democratic primary. The combination of low educational attainment and a strong Democratic tradition was a perfect combination for Mrs. Clinton. In well-educated areas, liberalism prevails and Democrats are liberal; in less educated areas where Republicans do well, conservatives prevail but most conservatives vote Republican; in the less educated but Democratic areas, whether along the Rio Grande or in the Appalachian region, there are many conservative Democrats.","1040","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/upshot/what-the-hispanic-vote-says-about-bernie-sanderss-chances.html?_r=0"
"To become a serious challenger to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders will need to do a lot better among less liberal and less educated Democratic voting blocs, whether white, black or Hispanic.

"Mrs. Clinton may be a primary juggernaut, but she could surely lose to a Republican in November 2016. President Obama’s approval ratings are in the mid-40s, so Mrs. Clinton may not benefit from the party’s incumbency. On paper, the race is more or less a tossup. In such a close contest, it might seem reasonable to argue that Mrs. Clinton’s unfavorable ratings are hugely important.","1064","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"

"Many political scientists go a step further. Whether people have a favorable opinion of presidential candidates is as much about rationalizing a latent partisan preference — shaped by the underlying political and economic fundamentals — as it is about the candidates themselves.

"A good example of this is Mitt Romney, whose ratings fell even lower than Mrs. Clinton’s during the Republican primary. He then faced a variety of attacks about his time at Bain Capital. He damaged himself with his “47 percent” comments. Yet despite it all, his ratings recovered by the 2012 general election. Republican-leaning voters, sure to vote against Mr. Obama, gradually figured out a way to like Mr. Romney. We saw the same thing with another Clinton, William Jefferson, who had even worse favorable ratings than Mrs. Clinton before quickly turning around his image once the 1992 general election began.","1067","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"It’s useful to imagine a counterfactual: What if the economy had been stronger, and George H.W. Bush had had a 60 percent approval rating, on Election Day in 1992? Mr. Clinton wouldn’t have had a chance against those numbers, of course, but Mr. Bush wouldn’t have been running just on his record. He would have attacked Mr. Clinton’s character and he would have maintained a lead in the polls as a media narrative coalesced around a simple explanation: Mr. Clinton, with his weak numbers, was a smooth-talking womanizer who couldn’t be trusted. After his defeat, Mr. Clinton would have been remembered as yet another weak Democratic candidate in the footsteps of Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, fatally damaged before the campaign had even begun, rather than as one of the more talented politicians of our time.","1068","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"For some, this line of thinking offers an uncomfortably deterministic theory about American presidential politics. But it helps explain a lot, such as why favorability ratings can move so much, even when there is relatively little new information about a candidate. It helps explain why, on the other hand, supposed game-changers often seem to have no effect. And it helps explain why, in the end, the polls move toward the fundamentals as the campaign evolves.","1069","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"This doesn’t necessarily mean that Mrs. Clinton is in the clear. The fundamentals are strongest when an incumbent president is on the ballot because the feelings about the president are so strong and firm on either side. Mr. Romney, for instance, might have had a harder time improving his ratings and winning back G.O.P. voters — who disapproved of Mr. Obama — if his opponent had not been Mr. Obama.","1070","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"For this cycle, the fitting analogy might be Al Gore, who started with far weaker favorability ratings than George W. Bush, with the backdrop of Mr. Clinton’s scandals. The economic fundamentals, though, seemed to suggest that Mr. Gore was in line to score a decisive victory. Indeed, the gap between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore’s ratings closed as the race went on in 2000. But Mr. Gore, who like Mrs. Clinton was seeking to make it a third presidential victory in a row for Democrats, fell short.","1071","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"More generally, there have been so few presidential elections in the era of modern polling that it would be a mistake to be too sure that Mrs. Clinton’s image won’t be a factor. In a century, political scientists could easily look back and say, with the help of new data, that favorability ratings can be decisive. For now, it would be unwise to rule it out. We already know that scandals can hurt incumbents in House elections, but it doesn’t come close to dooming them, studies have shown.","1072","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"

Al vencer a Hillary Rodham Clinton en New Hampshire en algunas encuestas y atraer a decenas de miles de personas a sus eventos en Iowa y Nevada, Sanders, de 73 años, ha recapturado el entusiasmo que encendió la campaña de Obama de 2008, con camisetas que dicen “Feel the Bern” y una imagen de cabellos blancos alborotados y lentes que reemplazan a la célebre imagen del poster de “Hope” que diseñara Shepard Fairey para Obama.","1095","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/21/universal/es/bernie-sanders-el-candidato-socialista-que-promete-una-revolucion-politica-en-estados-unidos.html?_r=0"

While Mr. Sanders has 92 paid workers and 24 offices across the early battlegrounds of Iowa and New Hampshire, his operation is still at heart that of a man with a message, lacking the network of political allies across the country and in Congress who can help him build get-out-the-vote organizations that win elections.","1213","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-election-campaign.html?_r=0"
"“Bernie has done very, very well without having to spend much money at all, relative to Hillary,” said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist who was a top adviser on Mr. Obama’s campaigns. “His campaign recognizes, rightly, that you have to navigate through the early contests and then, to win on Super Tuesday, you have to spend a boatload.

"Mrs. Clinton still holds important advantages over Mr. Sanders: She is better positioned financially thanks to her super PAC — though she only narrowly outraised him since July 1, taking in $28 million; she has far more support among Democratic Party leaders whose superdelegate votes can help secure the nomination; and she has backing among minorities, who can be decisive in some states.","1215","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-election-campaign.html?_r=0"

"Mr. Sanders, who has drawn support by electrifying crowds with his demands for single-payer health care, free tuition at public colleges and higher taxes on the rich, has tested the idea that a modern presidential candidate cannot win without relying on attack ads or internal polling.

"At Mr. Sanders’s headquarters here on Wednesday, his top advisers met with their lieutenants from Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina — three of the four states with the earliest nominating contests, all in February — to plan the redeployment of dozens of paid staff members thereafter. The workers will go to Super Tuesday states that Mr. Sanders views as winnable — including Colorado, Massachusetts and Minnesota — as well as to Southern states where Mrs. Clinton is expected to perform well, but where close contests could also yield delegates for Mr. Sanders.","1218","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-election-campaign.html?_r=0"

"“With our latest fund-raising numbers, we now know we’ll have the resources to compete everywhere, including all the Super Tuesday states and throughout the South, even Arkansas,” said Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager. “We’ve heard for months, ‘Bernie will flame out after Iowa and New Hampshire.’ But the truth is that we have the resources, and can raise the resources, to go all the way to the convention.”","1220","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-election-campaign.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Weaver, who spent part of Wednesday interviewing potential staff members in Georgia and Texas, is also working with the campaign’s senior adviser, Tad Devine, on a first round of television commercials to run before Thanksgiving. The Sanders camp is weighing biographical ads to run in Iowa, where Mr. Sanders is less well known than Mrs. Clinton. In New Hampshire, where Mr. Sanders is a familiar presence from his three decades in Vermont politics, a thematic or policy-driven ad may be used first.","1221","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-election-campaign.html?_r=0"

"For Mr. Sanders to win the nomination, he would need to add large numbers of black and Hispanic voters to his predominantly white coalition of older voters like Ms. Lynch and young people, liberals and working-class families. Yet his campaign has no polling data to know which parts of his message might help him with minority voters. Mr. Devine, who has been pushing the campaign to conduct its own surveys for some time, said the results would not be used to shape Mr. Sanders’s message, but rather to gauge the parts of his message that might have the greatest appeal in particular states or with certain groups of voters that he wants to target.","1226","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-election-campaign.html?_r=0"
"“I don’t see us having a problem with African-Americans and Latinos — I would call it a challenge — but polling will help us introduce Bernie to more of these voters in the best possible way,” Mr. Devine said. “He is committed to a $15 minimum wage. He has been committed to civil rights and equal justice for his entire career. He fights against income inequality. Polling will help us determine which of these themes will resonate the most in different states.”","1227","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-election-campaign.html?_r=0"

"“Now that they have the money to compete, the Sanders team needs to figure out how to exploit his momentum and win over voters who are up for grabs on Super Tuesday and in other states,” Mr. Maslin said. “And polling will also tell them if the damage done to your opponent is supreme enough that she becomes Humpty Dumpty.”","1230","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-election-campaign.html?_r=0"
"Inside the campaign offices here, though, Wednesday’s fund-raising results had workers positively giddy at the possibility that, true to Mr. Sanders’s ideals, his campaign could thrive on a powerful message spread through social media and by word of mouth, rather than depending on advertising and polls.","1231","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-election-campaign.html?_r=0"

Social democracy, Mr. Konczal noted, “implies a very active role for capitalism in the framework.”","1353","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/upshot/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-capitalist.html?_r=0"
"Social democracy, Mr. Sanders will have you remember, is not what they were up to in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It’s the little-of-this, little-of-that philosophy of parties like Labour in Britain or the Social Democrats in Germany. Such parties have abandoned their past support for the nationalization of industry and have presided for long periods over economies that certainly appeared capitalist to visiting American tourists, albeit with higher taxes than we have in the United States.","1354","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/upshot/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-capitalist.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Sanders himself emphasizes the “democratic” part of democratic socialism, and promised in last week’s debate that “we’re gonna explain what democratic socialism is.” He cited Denmark, which has very high taxes, very generous social programs and a robust economy driven by private capital investment, as an example of a place that does social democracy really well. (Though, as Matt Yglesias at Vox noted, Denmark’s Social Democrats have been out of power for 11 of the last 15 years while the country’s policies have continued to look pretty social democratic, further highlighting the difficulty of figuring out who’s really a socialist or not, or what.)","1355","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/upshot/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-capitalist.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Konczal laid out four hallmarks. You might be a social democrat if you support: a mixed economy, that is, a combination of private enterprise and government spending; social insurance programs that support the old and the poor; a Keynesian economic policy of government borrowing and spending to offset economic recessions; and democratic participation in government and the workplace.","1356","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/upshot/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-capitalist.html?_r=0"
"If that’s what social democracy is, it’s not obvious what the term would add to the American political lexicon. Most Democrats would tell you they support all four of those things. So would quite a few Republicans.","1357","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/upshot/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-capitalist.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Sanders said on the campaign trail this week that police and fire departments are “socialist institutions,” as are public libraries. He noted that Social Security and Medicare, which are very popular with Americans, are “socialist programs.” This, again, is more confusing than clarifying. If supporting Social Security and public firefighting makes you a social democrat, the term does nothing to distinguish Mr. Sanders from his opponents.","1358","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/upshot/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-capitalist.html?_r=0"
"“When you look at the policies, there’s a way to see it as Bernie has cranked up Hillary’s agenda to 11,” Mr. Konczal said. To wit: Mrs. Clinton favors preserving Social Security with some enhancements for the poorest beneficiaries, while he wants to raise taxes on the rich to expand it in ways that could add $65 per month to the average benefit. This, like most political debates, is a disagreement about how far to turn the knobs when adjusting policy; it does not seem to call for a separate ideological label.","1359","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/upshot/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-capitalist.html?_r=0"
"That said, Mr. Konczal did offer one difference between Mr. Sanders’s and Mrs. Clinton’s worldviews that is of kind rather than degree. This is decommodification: the idea that some goods and services are so important that they ought to be removed from the market economy altogether.","1360","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/upshot/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-capitalist.html?_r=0"
"The idea behind the Affordable Care Act, and behind Mrs. Clinton’s approach to tinkering with Obamacare, is that quality health insurance should be affordable to everyone, and that people who can’t afford it should be given subsidies to buy it. For a democratic socialist, that’s not good enough; instead, health care should simply be provided to everyone without charge, removing the profit motive from health care.","1361","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/upshot/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-capitalist.html?_r=0"
"But even this is a matter of degrees. Mr. Sanders favors Medicare for all: a single-payer health care system, with the federal government as the sole insurer. This would remove the profit motive from health insurance but not from health care, which could continue to be provided by private doctors and hospitals, often working on a for-profit basis. Mr. Sanders is not proposing to go further, like Britain, and have doctors work directly for the government. Nor does he appear inclined to decommodify broad swathes of the economy; in other countries, even conservatives often endorse special, less-marketized rules for health care than for other sectors.","1362","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/upshot/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-capitalist.html?_r=0"
"This distinction is real, but it’s not clear to me that it merits Mr. Sanders his own ideological label. So when Mr. Kenworthy, the California professor, proposed the “democratic socialist capitalist” label to me, I responded by asking how that’s different from being a very liberal Democrat.","1363","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/upshot/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-capitalist.html?_r=0"

He raised the money with only a small number of fund-raising events and appears to be relying overwhelmingly on donors’ making small contributions.","1415","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-narrows-fund-raising-gap-with-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Sanders has even outpaced Mr. Obama’s record-breaking campaign from 2008, reaching more than a million online contributions — a mark Mr. Obama did not pass until the Democratic primaries were underway in the winter of 2008, according to Obama fund-raising solicitations at the time. Mr. Sanders has also amassed 650,000 contributors, well more than Mr. Obama had at the comparable point in that campaign cycle.","1416","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-narrows-fund-raising-gap-with-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"“Sanders is proving, at least for now, that presidential candidates can compete financially in the primary solely with contributions from everyday Americans,” said David Donnelly, the president of Every Voice, which advocates programs to encourage small-donor political giving. “That he’s doing it with a critique of the big-money system at the core of his message is an important part of his success.”","1417","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-narrows-fund-raising-gap-with-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton has relied on the full force and reach of one of the most prominent Democratic politicians in the world, rousing small donors but also investing far more time and energy than Mr. Sanders in courting those who can give the maximum $2,700 for her primary campaign.","1418","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-narrows-fund-raising-gap-with-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"

"The question for the Democratic hopefuls is which candidate can sustain his or her pace. Mr. Sanders’s haul represents about 10 percent more a month in the third quarter than in the second, when he first entered the race, a relatively small increase. His aides said he had about $25 million on hand after spending about $15 million through the campaign, mostly on online fund-raising efforts and a growing staff in New Hampshire, Iowa and elsewhere.","1420","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-narrows-fund-raising-gap-with-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"

"CHAFEE: Thank you, Anderson. Thank you, CNN, and thank you Facebook for organizing this debate. Not only will Americans be electing a new president next year, we also will be electing a world leader. Voters should assess the candidate’s experience, character and vision for the future as they make this important decision. I’m the only one running for president that has been a mayor, a United States senator, and a governor. As mayor, I brought labor peace to my city and kept taxes down. I was reelected three times. As a senator, I earned a reputation for courageous votes against the Bush-Cheney tax cuts the favored the wealthy, against the tragedy of the Iraq war, for environmental stewardship, for protection of our civil liberties. I served on the Foreign Relations Committee and I chaired the Middle East Subcommittee for four years. As governor, I came in at the depths of the recession and we turned my state around. Rhode Island had the biggest drop of the unemployment rate over my four budgets of all but one state. It happens to be Nevada, where we’re having this debate. I’m very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I’ve always been honest. I have the courage to take the long-term view, and I’ve shown good judgment. I have high ethical standards. As we look to the future, I want to address the income inequality, close the gap between the haves and the have-nots. I want to address climate change, a real threat to our planet. And I believe in prosperity through peace. I want to end these wars. I look forward to the discussion ahead.

"WEBB: They’re looking for a leader who understands how the system works, who has not been coopted by it, and also has a proven record of accomplishing different things. I have a record of working across the political aisle. I’ve also spent more than half of my professional life away from politics in the independent world of being an author, a journalist, and a sole proprietor. In government service, I’ve fought and bled for our country in Vietnam as a Marine. I spent years as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy — in the Reagan administration. In the senate, I spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one. I also wrote and passed the best piece of veterans education legislation in history, the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill. I brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion. I led what later became called the Strategic Pivot to Asia two years before President Obama was elected. I know where my loyalties are. My mother grew up in the poverty of east Arkansas chopping cotton, picking strawberries. Three of her seven siblings died in childhood. My wife, Hong, came to this country as a refugee from war torn Vietnam — learned English, a language that was not spoken at home, and earned her way into Cornell Law School. I have five daughters. Amy works with disabled veterans, Sarah is an emergency room nurse, Julia is a massage therapist, Emily and Georgia are still in school. My son Jim fought as an infantry Marine on the bloody streets of Ramadi. You may be sure that in a Webb administration, the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home, and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common sense foreign policy.","1447","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"O’MALLEY: My name is Martin O’Malley, former Mayor of Baltimore, former governor of Maryland, a life long democrat, and most importantly, a husband, and a father. My wife Katie and I have four great kids, Grace, and Tara, and William and Jack. And, like you, there is nothing we wouldn’t do to give them healthier and better lives. There are some things that I have learned to do better in life than others. And, after 15 years of executive experience, I have learned how to be an effective leader. Whether it was raising the minimum wage, making our public schools the best in America, passing marriage equality, the DREAM Act, and comprehensive gun safety legislation, I have learned how to get things done because I am very clear about my principals. Thanks to President Obama, our country has come a long way since the Wall Street crash of 2008. Our country’s doing better, we are creating jobs again. But we elected a president, not a magician, and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now. For there is a — deep injustice, an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart, and it will not solve itself. Injustice does not solve itself. What I’m talking about is this, our middle class is shrinking. Our poor families are becoming poorer, and 70 percent of us are earning the same, or less than we were 12 years ago. We need new leadership, and we need action. The sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all American families. Our economy isn’t money, it’s people. It’s all of our people, and so we must invest in our country, and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families, instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt. And, we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity. The future is what we make of it. We are all in this together. And, the question in this election is whether you and I still have the ability to give our kids a better future. I believe we do, that is why I am running for president, and I need your help.

"SANDERS: Anderson, thank you very much. I think most Americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises. The middle class of this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing. Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, and yet almost all of the new income and wealth being created is going to the top one percent. As a result of this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, our campaign finance system is corrupt and is undermining American democracy. Millionaires and billionaires are pouring unbelievable sums of money into the political process in order to fund super PACs and to elect candidates who represent their interests, not the interests of working people. Today, the scientific community is virtually unanimous: climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and we have a moral responsibility to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and leave this planet a habitable planet for our children and our grandchildren. Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent. It seems to me that instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration, maybe — just maybe — we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids.","1453","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"CLINTON: Well, thank you, and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the Democratic debates. I’m Hillary Clinton. I have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady, as a senator from New York, and as secretary of state. I’m the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child. And every day, I think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her, but for all of our children. I have spent a very long time — my entire adult life — looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her God-given potential. I’ve traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and I’ve put forward specific plans about how we’re going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. At the center of my campaign is how we’re going to raise wages. Yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them. And then we have to figure out how we’re going to make the tax system a fairer one. Right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. So I have specific recommendations about how we’re going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families. And I want to do more to help us balance family and work. I believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but I also believe it’s about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world. (APPLAUSE) During the course of the evening tonight, I’ll have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that I’ve done behind them. But for me, this is about bringing our country together again. And I will do everything I can to heal the divides — the divides economically, because there’s too much inequality; the racial divides; the continuing discrimination against the LGBT community — so that we work together and, yes, finally, fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you, too, can grow up to be president.","1457","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"COOPER: Are you all ready? (APPLAUSE) All right. Let’s begin. We’re going to be discussing a lot of the issues, many of the issues, important issues that you have brought up. But I want to begin with concerns that voters have about each of the candidates here on this stage that they have about each of you. Secretary Clinton, I want to start with you. Plenty of politicians evolve on issues, but even some Democrats believe you change your positions based on political expediency. You were against same-sex marriage. Now you’re for it. You defended President Obama’s immigration policies. Now you say they’re too harsh. You supported his trade deal dozen of times. You even called it the “gold standard”. Now, suddenly, last week, you’re against it. Will you say anything to get elected?","1460","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"CLINTON: Well, actually, I have been very consistent. Over the course of my entire life, I have always fought for the same values and principles, but, like most human beings — including those of us who run for office — I do absorb new information. I do look at what’s happening in the world. You know, taker the trade deal. I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard. It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn’t meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, “this will help raise your wages.” And I concluded I could not.","1461","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"COOPER: Secretary Clinton, though, with all due respect, the question is really about political expediency. Just in July, New Hampshire, you told the crowd you’d, quote, “take a back seat to no one when it comes to progressive values.” Last month in Ohio, you said you plead guilty to, quote, “being kind of moderate and center.” Do you change your political identity based on who you’re talking to? CLINTON: No. I think that, like most people that I know, I have a range of views, but they are rooted in my values and my experience. And I don’t take a back seat to anyone when it comes to progressive experience and progressive commitment. You know, when I left law school, my first job was with the Children’s Defense Fund, and for all the years since, I have been focused on how we’re going to un-stack the deck, and how we’re gonna make it possible for more people to have the experience I had. You know, to be able to come from a grandfather who was a factory worker, a father who was a small business person, and now asking the people of America to elect me president.","1462","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"SANDERS: Well, we’re gonna win because first, we’re gonna explain what democratic socialism is. And what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent — almost — own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That it is wrong, today, in a rigged economy, that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. That when you look around the world, you see every other major country providing health care to all people as a right, except the United States. You see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we’re not gonna separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have — we are gonna have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth. Those are some of the principles that I believe in, and I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people.","1474","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"COOPER: Denmark is a country that has a population — Denmark is a country that has a population of 5.6 million people. The question is really about electability here, and that’s what I’m trying to get at. You — the — the Republican attack ad against you in a general election — it writes itself. You supported the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. You honeymooned in the Soviet Union. And just this weekend, you said you’re not a capitalist. Doesn’t — doesn’t that ad write itself?","1476","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"SANDERS: Well, first of all, let’s look at the facts. The facts that are very simple. Republicans win when there is a low voter turnout, and that is what happened last November. Sixty-three percent of the American people didn’t vote, Anderson. Eighty percent of young people didn’t vote. We are bringing out huge turnouts, and creating excitement all over this country. Democrats at the White House on down will win, when there is excitement and a large voter turnout, and that is what this campaign is doing.","1477","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"COOPER: You don’t consider yourself a capitalist, though?","1478","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"SANDERS: Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street’s greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don’t. I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires.","1479","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"CLINTON: Well, let me just follow-up on that, Anderson, because when I think about capitalism, I think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families. And I don’t think we should confuse what we have to do every so often in America, which is save capitalism from itself. And I think what Senator Sanders is saying certainly makes sense in the terms of the inequality that we have. But we are not Denmark. I love Denmark. We are the United States of America. And it’s our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so that it doesn’t run amok and doesn’t cause the kind of inequities we’re seeing in our economic system.

Whether it’s on the environment, a woman’s right to choose, gay marriage, fiscal responsibility, aversion to foreign entanglements, using the tools of government to help the less fortunate.

"COOPER: Governor O’Malley, the concern of voters about you is that you tout our record as Baltimore’s mayor. As we all know, we all saw it. That city exploded in riots and violence in April. The current top prosecutor in Baltimore, also a Democrat, blames your zero tolerance policies for sowing the seeds of unrest. Why should Americans trust you with the country when they see what’s going on in the city that you ran for more than seven years?","1495","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"COOPER: She actually — just for the record, when she was asked which policies, to name two, she said zero tolerance. I mean, there’s a number of old policies that we’re seeing the results of. That distress of communities, where communities don’t want to step forward and say who killed a 3-year-old, it’s a direct result of these failed policies.","1497","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"O’MALLEY: Well, let’s talk about this a little bit. One of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in Baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38-year low in the year prior to the Freddie Gray’s tragic death. Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore back in 1999, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we allowed ourselves to become the most violent, addicted, and abandoned city in America. And I ran and promised people that together we could turn that around. And we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime, or part one (ph) crime by more than any other major city in America over the next 10 years. I did not make our city immune to setbacks. But I attended a lot of funerals, including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor African-American neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner. We’ve saved over a thousand lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together. And the vast majority of them were young and poor and black. It wasn’t easy on any day. But we saved lives and we gave our city a better future, improving police and community relations every single day that I was in office.","1498","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"COOPER: In one year alone, though, 100,000 arrests were made in your city, a city of 640,000 people. The ACLU, the NAACP sued you, sued the city, and the city actually settled, saying a lot of those arrests were without probable cause.","1499","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"O’MALLEY: Well, I think the key word in your followup there was the word “settle.” That’s true. It was settled. Arrests peaked in 2003, Anderson, but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime. Look, none of this is easy. None of us has all the answers. But together as a city, we saved a lot of lives. It was about leadership. It was about principle. And it was about bringing people together.","1500","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"O’MALLEY: Thank you. COOPER: Senator Webb, in 2006, you called affirmative action “state-sponsored racism.” In 2010, you wrote an op/ed saying it discriminates against whites. Given that nearly half the Democratic Party is non-white, aren’t you out of step with where the Democratic Party is now?","1502","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"WEBB: No, actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been. The Democratic Party, and the reason I’ve decided to run as a Democrat, has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice. And that is not determined by race. And as a clarification, I have always supported affirmative action for African Americans. That’s the way the program was originally designed because of their unique history in this country, with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed. What I have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone, quote, “of color,” other than whites, struggling whites like the families in the Appalachian mountains, we’re not being true to the Democratic Party principle of elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have — by culture, by the way.","1503","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"COOPER: Senator Webb, thank you very much. Let’s move on to some of the most pressing issues facing our country right now, some of the biggest issues right now in the headlines today. We’re going to start with guns. The shooting in Oregon earlier this month, once again it brought the issue of guns into the national conversation. Over the last week, guns have been the most discussed political topic on Facebook by two to one. Senator Sanders, you voted against the Brady bill that mandated background checks and a waiting period. You also supported allowing riders to bring guns in checked bags on Amtrak trains. For a decade, you said that holding gun manufacturers legally responsible for mass shootings is a bad idea. Now, you say you’re reconsidering that. Which is it: shield the gun companies from lawsuits or not?","1504","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"SANDERS: Let’s begin, Anderson, by understanding that Bernie Sanders has a D-minus voting rating (ph) from the NRA. Let’s also understand that back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States Congress, way back then, I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont and I told the people of the state of Vermont, a state which has virtually no gun control, that I supported a ban on assault weapons. And over the years, I have strongly avoided instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole. And I think we’ve got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers. Also I believe, and I’ve fought for, to understand that there are thousands of people in this country today who are suicidal, who are homicidal, but can’t get the healthcare that they need, the mental healthcare, because they don’t have insurance or they’re too poor. I believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis has got to get mental health counseling immediately. COOPER: Do you want to shield gun companies from lawsuits?","1505","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"SANDERS: Of course not. This was a large and complicated bill. There were provisions in it that I think made sense. For example, do I think that a gun shop in the state of Vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody, and that somebody goes out and does something crazy, that that gun shop owner should be held responsible? I don’t. On the other hand, where you have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to criminals or aiding and abetting that, of course we should take action.","1506","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"CLINTON: No, not at all. I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence. This has gone on too long and it’s time the entire country stood up against the NRA. The majority of our country...","1508","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"(APPLAUSE) ... supports background checks, and even the majority of gun owners do. Senator Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill. Since it was passed, more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented. He also did vote, as he said, for this immunity provision. I voted against it. I was in the Senate at the same time. It wasn’t that complicated to me. It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in America. Everybody else has to be accountable, but not the gun manufacturers. And we need to stand up and say: Enough of that. We’re not going to let it continue.","1509","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"SANDERS: As a senator from a rural state, what I can tell Secretary Clinton, that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want, and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing. I believe that there is a consensus in this country. A consensus has said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks, do away with this gun show loophole, that we have to address the issue of mental health, that we have to deal with the strawman purchasing issue, and that when we develop that consensus, we can finally, finally do something to address this issue.","1512","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"COOPER: Governor O’Malley, you passed gun legislation as governor of Maryland, but you had a Democratic-controlled legislature. President Obama couldn’t convince Congress to pass gun legislation after the massacres in Aurora, in Newtown, and Charleston. How can you?","1513","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"O’MALLEY: And, Anderson, I also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own party to get this done. Look, it’s fine to talk about all of these things — and I’m glad we’re talking about these things — but I’ve actually done them. We passed comprehensive gun safety legislation, not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said. We actually did it. And, Anderson, here tonight in our audience are two people that make this issue very, very real. Sandy and Lonnie Phillips are here from Colorado. And their daughter, Jessie, was one of those who lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in Aurora. Now, to try to transform their grief, they went to court, where sometimes progress does happen when you file in court, but in this case, you want to talk about a — a rigged game, Senator? The game was rigged. A man had sold 4,000 rounds of military ammunition to this — this person that killed their daughter, riddled her body with five bullets, and he didn’t even ask where it was going. And not only did their case get thrown out of court, they were slapped with $200,000 in court fees because of the way that the NRA gets its way in our Congress and we take a backseat. It’s time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation.","1514","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

We can raise our voices, but I come from a rural state, and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states, whether we like it or not. Our job is to bring people together around strong, commonsense gun legislation. I think there is a vast majority in this country who want to do the right thing, and I intend to lead the country in bringing our people together.","1517","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"WEBB: Look, there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion. We need to pay respect to both of them. The first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms. And we have done not a good job on that. A lot of them are criminals. And a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas. And a lot of them are mentally incapacitated. And the shooting in Virginia Tech in ’07, this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information.","1530","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"CHAFEE: Yes, I have a good record of voting for gun commonsense safety legislation, but the reality is, despite these tragedies that happen time and time again, when legislators step up to pass commonsense gun safety legislation, the gun lobby moves in and tells the people they’re coming to take away your guns. And, they’re successful at it, in Colorado and others states, the legislators that vote for commonsense gun safety measures then get defeated. I even saw in Rhode Island. So, I would bring the gun lobby in and say we’ve got to change this. Where can we find common ground? Wayne Lapierre from the NRA, whoever it is, the leaders. Come one, we’ve go to change this.

"CLINTON: Well, first of all, we got a lot of business done with the Russians when Medvedev was the president, and not Putin. We got a nuclear arms deal, we got the Iranian sanctions, we got an ability to bring important material and equipment to our soldiers in Afghanistan. There’s no doubt that when Putin came back in and said he was going to be President, that did change the relationship. We have to stand up to his bullying, and specifically in Syria, it is important — and I applaud the administration because they are engaged in talks right now with the Russians to make it clear that they’ve got to be part of the solution to try to end that bloody conflict. And, to — provide safe zones so that people are not going to have to be flooding out of Syria at the rate they are. And, I think it’s important too that the United States make it very clear to Putin that it’s not acceptable for him to be in Syria creating more chaos, bombing people on behalf of Assad, and we can’t do that if we don’t take more of a leadership position, which is what I’m advocating.","1543","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

So I think while you’re talking about the tough decision that President Obama had to make about Osama bin Laden, where I was one of his few advisers, or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on Iran — I think I have a lot of evidence...","1553","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

And I remember being at a dinner shortly before that invasion. People were talking at — and saying, “it’ll take us just a couple years to rebuild democracy,” and I thought, “has this world gone mad?” Whenever we go — and contrary to John Quincy Adams’ advice — “searching the world for monsters to destroy,” and when we use political might to take a — at the expense of democratic principle, we hurt ourselves, and we hurt our (inaudible).","1568","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

The president has made a very tough decision. What I believe and why I have advocated that the no-fly zone — which of course would be in a coalition — be put on the table is because I’m trying to figure out what leverage we have to get Russia to the table.

"WEBB: Look, let’s start — I’ve been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes — let’s start with why Russia is in Syria right now. There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. The first was the invasion of Iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran. The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world. Now, I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq, whose son fought in Iraq, I’ve fought in Vietnam. But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China. And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people.","1587","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

And we had the Arabs standing by our side saying, “We want you to help us deal with Gadhafi.” Our response, which I think was smart power at its best, is that the United States will not lead this. We will provide essential, unique capabilities that we have, but the Europeans and the Arabs had to be first over the line. We did not put one single American soldier on the ground in Libya.

And the Libyan people had a free election the first time since 1951. And you know what, they voted for moderates, they voted with the hope of democracy. Because of the Arab Spring, because of a lot of other things, there was turmoil to be followed. But unless you believe the United States should not send diplomats to any place that is dangerous, which I do not, then when we send them forth, there is always the potential for danger and risk.","1602","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

And I believe that’s what Chris Stevens was trying to do. But he did not have the tools.

I am still standing. I am happy to be part of this debate. (APPLAUSE) And I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people. You know, I believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about, like how are we going to make college affordable?

This committee has spent $4.5 million of taxpayer money, and they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like Benghazi wouldn’t happen again.

There is an agenda there that we need to be following up on. Similarly, we need to tackle mass incarceration, and this may be the only bi-partisan issue in the congress this year. We actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion, that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world. But, I believe that the debate, and the discussion has to go further, Anderson, because we’ve got to do more about the lives of these children.

At the same time, I believe I can say to you, I have had a long history of working with the situation of African Americans. We’re talking about criminal justice reform, I risked my political life raising the issue of criminal justice reform when I ran for the Senate in Virginia in 2006. I had democratic party political consultants telling me I was committing political suicide. We led that issue in the congress. We started a national debate on it. And it wasn’t until then that the Republican Party started joining in. I also represented a so-called war criminal, an African American Marine who was wounded — who was convicted of murder in Vietnam, for six years. He took his life three years into this.

"SANDERS: Well, first of all, let’s remember where we were when Bush left office. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month. And I know my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue, but the world’s financial crisis was on — the world’s financial markets system was on the verge of collapse. That’s where we were. Are we better off today than we were then? Absolutely. But the truth is that for the 40 years, the great middle class of this country has been disappearing. And in my view what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; pay equity for women workers; and our disastrous trade policies, which have cost us millions of jobs; and make every public college and university in this country tuition free.","1705","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"CLINTON: Well, you know, both Bill and I have been very blessed. Neither of us came from wealthy families and we’ve worked really hard our entire lives. And I want to make sure every single person in this country has the same opportunities that he and I have had, to make the most of their God-given potential and to have the chances that they should have in America for a good education, good job training, and then good jobs. I have a five point economic plan, because this inequality challenge we face, we have faced it at other points. It’s absolutely right. It hasn’t been this bad since the 1920s. But if you look at the Republicans versus the Democrats when it comes to economic policy, there is no comparison. The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House and that’s why we need to have a Democrat in the White House in January 2017.","1709","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"O’MALLEY: Yes. Anderson, I want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from Vermont mentioned, and I actually did them in our state. We raised the minimum wage, passed the living wage, invested more in infrastructure, went four years in a row without a penny’s increase in college tuition. But there’s another piece that Senator Sanders left out tonight, but he’s been excellent about underscoring that. And that is that we need to separate the casino, speculative, mega-bank gambling that we have to insure with our money, from the commercial banking — namely, reinstating Glass-Steagall. Secretary Clinton mentioned my support eight years ago. And Secretary, I was proud to support you eight years ago, but something happened in between, and that is, Anderson, a Wall Street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families. And we are still just as vulnerable Paul Volcker says today. We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall and that’s a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates.","1711","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"COOPER: Just for viewers at home who may not be reading up on this, Glass-Steagall is the Depression-era banking law repealed in 1999 that prevented commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and insurance activities. Secretary Clinton, he raises a fundamental difference on this stage. Senator Sanders wants to break up the big Wall Street banks. You don’t. You say charge the banks more, continue to monitor them. Why is your plan better?","1712","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"CLINTON: Well, my plan is more comprehensive. And frankly, it’s tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail. We can never let the American taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw. But we also have to worry about some of the other players — AIG, a big insurance company; Lehman Brothers, an investment bank. There’s this whole area called “shadow banking.” That’s where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from.","1713","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"CLINTON: So I’m with both Senator Sanders and Governor O’Malley in putting a lot of attention onto the banks. And the plan that I have put forward would actually empower regulators to break up big banks if we thought they posed a risk. But I want to make sure we’re going to cover everybody, not what caused the problem last time, but what could cause it next time.","1714","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors.” I took on the Bush administration for the same thing. So I have thought deeply and long about what we’re gonna do to do exactly what I think both the senator and the governor want, which is to rein in and stop this risk.

That means the Wall Street money managers are not risking themselves as the same way the American people are when they’re going to get their compensation. They’re managing money from all over the world.

We’ve had a lot of talk over the last few minutes, hours, or tens of minutes, but no one is saying how we’re going to fix it. And it all started with the Bush tax cuts that favored the wealthy. So let’s go back to the tax code. And 0.6 percent of Americans are at the top echelon, over 464,000, 0.6 Americans. That’s less than 1 percent. But they generate 30 percent of the revenue.

And what we said 50 years ago and a hundred years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family. I think we have to say that is true for everybody going to college. I think we don’t need a complicated system, which the secretary is talking about, the income goes down, the income goes down, if you’re poor you have to work, and so forth and so on. I pay for my program, by the way, through a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt, a major crisis in this country.","1783","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

"CLINTON: Well, let me address college affordability, because I have a plan that I think will really zero in on what the problems are. First, all the 40 million Americans who currently have student debt will be able to refinance their debt to a low interest rate. That will save thousands of dollars for people who are now struggling under this cumbersome, burdensome college debt. As a young student in Nevada said to me, the hardest thing about going to college should not be paying for it. So then we have to make it more affordable. How do we make it more affordable? My plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free. You would not have to borrow money for tuition. But I do believe — and maybe it’s because I worked when I went through college; I worked when I went through law school — I think it’s important for everybody to have some part of getting this accomplished. That’s why I call it a compact.","1786","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

And I will focus — I will focus on helping those people who need it the most. And of course I’m going to defend Social Security. I’m going to look for ways to try to make sure it’s solvent into the future. And we also need to talk about health care at some time, because we agree on the goals, we just disagree on the means.","1794","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"
"SANDERS: When the Republicans — when the Republicans in the Congress and some Democrats were talking about cutting Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans, for the so-called chained CPI, I founded a caucus called the Defending Social Security Caucus. My view is that when you have millions of seniors in this country trying to get by — and I don’t know how they do on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year — you don’t cut Social Security, you expand it. And the way you expand it is by lifting the cap on taxable incomes so that you do away with the absurdity of a millionaire paying the same amount into the system as somebody making $118,000. You do that, Social Security is solvent until 2061 and you can expand benefits.","1795","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

What we did is pass a $15 billion dollar piece of legislation which brought in many, many new doctors, and nurses into the V.A. so that veterans in this country could get the health care when they needed it, and not be on long waiting lines. And, the other part of that legislation said that if a veteran is living more than 40 miles away from a V.A. facility, that veteran could get health care from the community health center, or the private sector. As a result of that legislation, we went further in than any time in recent history in improving health care for the men and women of this country who put their lives on the line to defend them.","1836","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

We’re here in Las Vegas, one of the most sustainable cities in America, doing important things in terms of green building, architecture and design.

"WEBB: Well, the — the question really is how are we going to solve energy problems here and in the global environment if you really want to address climate change? And when I was in the Senate, I was an all-of-the-above energy voter. We introduced legislation to bring in alternate energy as well as nuclear power. I’m a strong proponent of nuclear power. It is safe, it is clean. And really, we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here. We’ve done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India, they’re the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It’s a global problem and I have been very strong on — on doing that. The — the agreements — the so-called agreements that we have had with China are illusory in terms of the immediate requirements of the — of the Chinese government itself. So let’s solve this problem in an international way, and then we really will have a — a way to address climate change.","1919","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html?_r=0"

I am proud that, along with Senator Barbara Boxer, a few years ago, we introduced the first piece of climate change legislation which called for a tax on carbon.

When we met in Copenhagen in 2009 and, literally, President Obama and I were hunting for the Chinese, going throughout this huge convention center, because we knew we had to get them to agree to something. Because there will be no effective efforts against climate change unless China and India join with the rest of the world. They told us they’d left for the airport; we found out they were having a secret meeting. We marched up, we broke in, we said, “We’ve been looking all over for you. Let’s sit down and talk about what we need to do.” And we did come up with the first international agreement that China has signed.

I remember as a young mother, you know, having a baby wake up who was sick and I’m supposed to be in court, because I was practicing law. I know what it’s like. And I think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents face, particularly working moms. I see my good friend, Senator Gillibrand, in the front row.

So, I think we’re just at the beginning, but I agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana.

We have many challenges. Who is best able to confront these challenges? I’ve served in government at many levels. I know what it’s like to solve problems at the local level because I did it as mayor. I know how to get legislation passed through Congress because I did it as a senator. I know how to turn around a state because I did as governor of Rhode Island. But what I’m most proud of is that in 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I have high ethical standards. And what I’m most proud of is my judgment, particularly in the Iraq war vote.

One of the things I can promise you, if you look at my record, in and out of government, is that I’ve always been willing to take on a complicated, something unpopular issues, and work them through, the complex issues, and work them through in order to have the solution. We did it with criminal justice reform. We’ve had a lot of discussion here about criminal justice reform. We did it in other ways. We need a national political strategy for our economy, for our social policy, for social justice, and, by the way, for how you run and manage the most complex bureaucracy in the world, which is the federal government.

I truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of American progress.

"SANDERS: This is a great country, but we have many, many serious problems. We should not be the country that has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country and more wealth and income inequality than any other country. We should not be the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all of our people as a right of citizenship and we should not be the only major country that does not provide medical and — and parental leave — family and parental leave to all of our families. Now, at the end of our day, here is the truth that very few candidates will say, is that nobody up here, certainly no Republican, can address the major crises facing our country unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class that has so much power over our economy and our political life. Jim Webb is right: Money is pouring in to this campaign through super PACs. We are doing it the old-fashioned way: 650,000 individual contributions.

I think what you did see is that, in this debate, we tried to deal with some of the very tough issues facing our country. That’s in stark contrast to the Republicans who are currently running for president. What you have to ask yourself is: Who amongst us has the vision for actually making the changes that are going to improve the lives of the American people? Who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done? Now, I revere my late mother, and she gave me a lot of good advice. But one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was, you know, the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down. It’s whether you get back up. America’s been knocked down. That Great Recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth disappeared. And although we’ve made progress, we’re standing but not running the way America needs to. My mission as president will be to raise incomes for hard-working middle-class families and to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain I was raised with: If you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. Please join me in this campaign. Please come and make it clear that America’s best days are still ahead.

"Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking to halt the momentum of her insurgent challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, aggressively questioned his values, positions and voting history Tuesday night in the first Democratic presidential debate, turning a showdown that had been expected to scrutinize her character into a forceful critique of his record.","OCT. 13, 2015","2000","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"
"In a series of sometimes biting exchanges, Mrs. Clinton declared that Mr. Sanders was mistaken in his handling of crucial votes on gun control and misguided in his grasp of the essentialness of capitalism to the American identity. Mocking Mr. Sanders’s admiration for the health care system of Denmark, she interrupted a moderator to offer a stinging assessment of his logic, suggesting he was unprepared to grapple with the realities of governing a superpower.","2001","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"

"A few moments later, Mrs. Clinton took aim at what may be Mr. Sanders’s greatest vulnerability with the Democratic left, asking why he had voted to shield gun makers and dealers from liability lawsuits. Mr. Sanders, who linked his record on gun control to his representation of a rural state, called the bill “large and complicated.”","2004","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"

"It was a dominant performance that showcased Mrs. Clinton’s political arsenal: a long record of appearances in presidential debates, intense and diligent preparation, and a nimbleness and humor largely lacking in her male counterparts. She let no opportunity pass her by. When Mr. Sanders described the conflict in Syria as “a quagmire within a quagmire” but said he did not support sending American ground troops there, Mrs. Clinton interjected energetically: “Nobody does. Nobody does, Senator Sanders.”","2008","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"
"For Mr. Sanders, the gathering in Las Vegas provided an evening of unexpectedly forceful challenges, both from Mrs. Clinton and from the moderator, Anderson Cooper of CNN. At times, he seemed somewhat exasperated and unsure about how to match Mrs. Clinton’s agility. Perhaps his most memorable moment occurred when he zestfully defended Mrs. Clinton from criticism of her email practices.","2009","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"

"And there were reminders of the tendencies that have made the left wing of the Democratic party suspicious of Mrs. Clinton. Prodded about her history of changing positions on major issues, she inelegantly explained why it took her so long to come out against the proposed Canadian American oil pipeline that so many of her rivals already oppose. “I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone.”","2016","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton benefited for much of the night from the tentativeness of her rivals, who appeared wary of directly attacking the figure who represents their party’s best chance at electing a woman president. Instead, they offered oblique criticisms and diplomatic dismissals. In his opening statement, Lincoln Chafee, the former senator and governor of Rhode Island, told the audience: “What I’m most proud of is that, in 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I have high ethical standards.”","2017","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"
"Jim Webb, the former senator from Virginia, seemed to take a swipe at Mrs. Clinton’s decades in public life and her closeness to Democratic Party insiders, saying the country was looking for somebody “who understands how the system works, who has not been co-opted by it.”","2018","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"
"There were exceptions, of course. Former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, when asked whether Mrs. Clinton would be too quick to use American military force, scolded her for her 2002 Senate vote to authorize military action in Iraq, saying the vote had been carried out “under false pretenses” and calling the war “one of the worst blunders in modern American history.”","2019","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"

"For Mrs. Clinton, the forum was a highly anticipated return to the debate stage after a seven-year hiatus and a season of remarkable political convulsions: the revelation that she relied exclusively on a private email server as secretary of state; the emergence of Mr. Sanders, a once-obscure senator from Vermont, as a potent rival in Iowa and New Hampshire; the threat of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s entering the race; and the restless liberal tide within the Democratic electorate that she is struggling to command.","2024","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"
"Her assertiveness was striking, given that on the campaign trail, she has seemed unsure of how to neutralize Mr. Sanders’s crowd-luring popularity. Her campaign has feared that attacking a candidate beloved by supporters for his quirky style, raw frustration and unvarnished liberalism could alienate precisely the segment of the Democratic electorate she would need to win the general election.","2025","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"
"She seemed highly attuned to what may be her biggest vulnerabilities in 2016: her authenticity and questions about whether she cares about the problems of ordinary people.

"The debate captured what has emerged as a consensus in the Democratic Party: that urgent action is needed to address the subject of income inequality. Mr. Sanders assailed the power of the nation’s wealthiest and called for Americans to “take back our government from a handful of billionaires.”","2028","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"
"But in an incongruous touch, the debate was held at the Wynn hotel, a slender golden curve of Las Vegas excess, conceived by the billionaire Steve Wynn. In a strange tableau for a political party preoccupied with the gap between rich and poor, a mix of around 1,300 prominent officials and wealthy donors filed into a ballroom down the hall from rows of luxury fashion stores and poker tables. (Before the debate started, one Clinton donor bragged of winning $25,000 at the tables.)","2029","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"
"The debate, hosted by CNN, was billed as a prizefight with a network of promotion showing silhouettes of Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton on giant screens overlooking the city’s famed Strip. But it was thick with foreign and domestic policy concerns, rather than the personal insults and colorful exchanges that have characterized the Republican forums.","2030","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/hillary-clinton-turns-up-heat-on-bernie-sanders-in-a-sharp-debate.html?_r=0"

"Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is preparing new lines of attack against Hillary Rodham Clinton on trade, gun control, and even the controversy over her State Department email to use on Saturday at their next televised presidential debate, which the Sanders team regards as — if not a do-or-die moment — perhaps his best chance to slow her political momentum this fall.","NOV. 13, 2015","2041","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/us/politics/bernie-sanderss-debate-strategy-attack-hillary-clinton-if-asked.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Sanders prepped into the night on Thursday with a Senate aide playing Mrs. Clinton at mock sessions in Burlington, Vt. Yet Democrats inside and outside his campaign said that Mr. Sanders may be limited — by his own moves and by hers — in stopping a resurgent Mrs. Clinton, who has built double-digit leads over him in many opinion polls. They noted that Mr. Sanders still does not want to go on the attack first against Mrs. Clinton at the debate, potentially depriving him of chances to raise doubts about her judgment or character.","2042","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/us/politics/bernie-sanderss-debate-strategy-attack-hillary-clinton-if-asked.html?_r=0"

Estimates show that nearly 70 percent of capital gains benefits go to the top 1 percent. A recent study by Adam Looney at Brookings and Kevin B.
