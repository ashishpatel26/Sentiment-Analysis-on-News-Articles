"Last September, on the afternoon of Rosh Hashana, the beginning of the Jewish High Holy Days, Elliott Abrams sat cross-legged on a basement carpet in Virginia playing marbles with his grandson. The former George W. Bush administration official, who supervised U.S. policy in the Middle East, is the father-in-law of a young rabbi at a reform synagogue in Washington that had been torn between its love of Israel and its loathing of Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government.","MARCH 20, 2015","1","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"Abrams, a staunch supporter of Netanyahu, told me that he wasn’t particularly worried about fading Jewish support for Israel, like that on display in his son-in-law’s congregation, even among the more skeptical younger generation. “Fifty-year-olds are always more supportive than 18-year-olds,” he said. “And so give them 30 years, and they will be more supportive. I don’t see any long-term erosion of support.”","2","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"What really concerned him, he said, were the non-Jewish voters who make up the rank and file of the Democratic base. “Look, I’m Republican,” Abrams told me. “But the problem that no one wants to talk about is the erosion of support in the Democratic Party.”","3","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"I thought of Abrams’s remarks this week, during the final chaotic days before Israel’s national elections, in which Netanyahu — trying to rally conservative support in a tight race against the Labor Party challenger, Isaac Herzog — disavowed the two-state solution, warned about the threat posed by “droves” of Arab voters and acknowledged the tactical appeal of expanding Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories. Although he has since tried to walk back his comments about the two-state solution, at least, the Obama administration and Democrats in general remain enraged. The party was already furious with Netanyahu for his slights of the Democratic president, and many now consider him the de facto president of the Israeli chapter of Republicans Abroad.","4","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"While a deepening polarization among American Jews about Netanyahu puts Obama’s potential successor, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a politically uncomfortable position, it is the transformation of Israel into a partisan issue that fills Democratic Jewish officials with dread. Clinton’s advisers can always take solace knowing that the Democratic base will vote for a Democratic candidate no matter what. But Jewish Democrats worry about the prospect of keeping liberal support for Israel a viable long-term position for a party base that is overwhelmingly non-Jewish and increasingly critical of the country.","5","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"After all, many younger Americans know Israel only as a nuclear-armed force that is the dominant power in its region. On college campuses, pro-Palestinian groups like Students for Justice in Palestine have long framed the Israeli occupation as the civil rights issue of our time. A Pew Research Center poll over the summer showed that 29 percent of voters under the age of 30 blamed Israel more than Hamas for the war in Gaza, while only 21 percent blamed Hamas more. African-Americans and Hispanics were also more likely to blame Israel.","6","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"This trend has clearly frightened the Jewish establishment. The powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee has sought to improve its engagement with progressives and college students, calling on, among others, Ann Lewis, a confidante of Clinton, to assist in progressive outreach. And Malcolm Hoenlein, the head of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, told me he was reaching out to Hispanics and Hollywood. “We have now taken several trips of movie stars to Israel,” he said. “We have had the stars of ‘Avatar,’ ‘Twilight,’ ‘Baxter’” — he presumably meant “Dexter” — “‘House M.D.’, ‘Hollywood 202101 whatever.’”","7","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"And support for Israel has also declined within American government in general. A recent focus group of congressional staffers — tomorrow’s policy makers — revealed ebbing support for Israel. “If national politics and the presidency continues to be in the hands of the Democrats,” said Hebrew Union College professor Steven Cohen, a leading tracker of Jewish demographic shifts, “then most of the mid-and-low-level policy analysts and foreign-service people will essentially be sympathetic to the Palestinians.”","8","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"But as far as Netanyahu’s right-wing government is concerned, the future is now. They see Obama and his potential nuclear deal with Iran as a threat to their security. They see American support for a two-state solution and a freeze on settlement growth as a naïve recipe for more missiles landing on Israeli homes.","9","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"And so Netanyahu has essentially thrown his lot in with the Republicans. His open hostility to Obama has infuriated Democrats. When he spoke to Congress this month — an invitation he accepted from the speaker of the House, John Boehner, without informing the White House — several Democratic members refused to attend. Significantly, the boycotting congressmen included members of the Congressional Black Caucus, an indication about the feelings of the party’s base.","10","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"This realignment by Netanyahu is a drastic shift. Even as U.S. foreign policy has grown increasingly partisan, support for Israel has generally been a rare point of agreement between Republicans and Democrats, and successive Israeli governments and their allies in Aipac have generally made a priority of keeping it that way. For instance, before returning to Israel in 2013 and entering politics there, the former Israeli ambassador to the United States Michael Oren reached out to progressive synagogues and think tanks for their help in improving the relationship between Israel and the Democratic Party’s ascendant base.","11","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"But Oren was replaced by Ron Dermer, a Miami Beach native and Netanyahu’s closest confidant, who, before becoming an Israeli citizen, worked for the Republican takeover of the House in 1994. Widely credited with organizing Mitt Romney’s election-season trip to Israel in 2012, Dermer is viewed by Democrats and the White House as part of the Republican opposition.","12","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"I met with Dermer last year, during a visit to Israel’s heavily guarded embassy in Washington. In a compound decorated with reproductions of ancient mosaics, Dermer waved his bodyguard out of his office and called for a cappuccino. He spoke so incessantly over the next two hours that the foam sank before he could take a sip. “The challenge now is that people see a strong Israel,” Dermer told me. “But people don’t understand something the prime minister often says — that Israel can go from great strength to great vulnerability very fast.”","13","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"Like Abrams, Dermer wasn’t worried about liberal Jews. He argued that “a lot of the fissures” in the American Jewish community would seal up the moment Israel came under attack. But when I asked him about the broader liberal antipathy toward Israel on college campuses and among Democratic voters, he said: “Israel is a symptom of a problem, but it’s not actually the problem that’s on campuses. It’s not an anti-Israel thing. It’s a problem of moral relativism. And we are low hanging fruit.”","14","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"“I think the progressive case for Israel is an easy case to make,” he went on. “We’re the only country that’s had a chief justice of the Supreme Court, a speaker of the Knesset and a prime minister who were women. You have gay rights in Israel. You have a gay-pride parade in Tel Aviv, and gays all around the region are strung up in public squares. And then you have respect for minority rights in Israel.”","15","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"To make that case, Dermer said: “I’m going to go into every arena. You have to correct the misperceptions. When I see someone who is on the progressive side of the aisle and they are concerned and say, Well Israel is doing A, and Israel is doing B, I want to engage them, and I want to explain, and I want to put it in context for them. I’m not willing to give up.”","16","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"A few months ago, Dermer did attend a private meeting at the Center for American Progress, Washington’s leading liberal think tank, to meet with leaders from the black and Latino communities who had concerns about what they considered the Israeli occupation of Palestine. But unlike his predecessor Oren, Dermer’s outreach was less than diplomatic. According to one person at the meeting, he was defensive and aggressive, browbeating attendees with familiar Israeli talking points.","17","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"It is clear that both he and Netanyahu prefer a Republican audience. Dermer was the keynote speaker of the Christians United For Israel meeting at the Washington Convention Center last July. Netanyahu sent in a grateful video message. CUFI, as the organization is known, was founded by John Hagee, a Texas megachurch pastor who has preached against Catholicism, Islam and homosexuality and has written books including “Four Blood Moons: Something Is About to Change,” which argues that four big, red moons in 2014 and 2015 will harken a major shift for Israel.","18","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"Last year’s conference featured some of the Republican Party’s staunchest Israel supporters, including Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. A ballroom of 4,000, including a tattoo-covered man with a Star of David on his cheek, applauded uproariously as speakers bashed the Obama administration. “John Kerry,” Hagee bellowed, “you can park your State Department jet in the hangar. Your effort to win your Nobel Prize at the expense of Israel is over!”","19","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"In the halls, organizers had erected an installation dedicated to “The Battle for the Future: Israel on Campus,” featuring a replica of a campus Apartheid Wall, which organizers said was used on college campuses to “to turn the student body against Israel.” Resembling a piece of set design from a Michael Keaton-era Batman movie, the colorful graffiti on the wall referred to Hamas as “Freedom Fighters” and depicted an Israeli flag bearing the words “Fascist State” next to the equation “End of Zionism = Peace.” Next to the wall stood a banner featuring a healthy-looking college student smiling under the advisory, “Remember: These materials DO NOT represent the views of CUFI.”","20","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"During the evening’s gala held in a grand hall, a group of singers — including Pastor Hagee’s children — sang Hebrew anthems on stage. Evangelicals jumped out of their seats, joining conga lines and raucous hora circles. Sheldon G. Adelson, the Republican superdonor and the object of much wooing from potential 2016 Republican candidates, was given the Defender of Israel Award. Dermer’s speech at the end of the evening was interrupted by shouts of “War criminal!” from protesters who infiltrated the event. Dermer seemed less than eager to engage them, or to explain or to offer context. Instead, to the rapturous applause of the people in the room, he called them “moral idiots.”","21","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"The protesters might have represented the left-wing fringe, but their criticism, and hostility to Israel, is gaining steam in the mainstream of the Democratic Party — in large part because Dermer and his boss seem to have aligned themselves with Obama’s Republican enemies.","22","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"
"It is hard to believe that, come election time, Israel will be the primary voting issue for black, Latino and young voters. But Jewish Democratic supporters of Israel nevertheless don’t like advocating a minority position within, or against, their party. And Republicans like Abrams worry that the increased Democratic pressure could result in a weakening of American support for Israel in the United Nations. It may already be happening. This week, White House officials suggested that Obama might now support a Security Council resolution calling for the establishment of a sovereign Palestine.","23","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/do-the-democrats-and-israel-have-a-future-together.html?_r=0"

The policies under discussion — paid family leave; universal preschool; an expanded earned-income tax credit and child tax credit; free community college and perhaps free four-year college in time — are intended both to alleviate the burdens on middle-class families and to expand educational opportunity for children. The result is a thematic platform addressing some of the biggest sources of anxiety about the future of the middle class.","203","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/upshot/the-parent-agenda-the-emerging-democratic-focus.html?_r=0"
"It’s far too early to know how these themes will resonate with voters, or even the extent to which Mrs. Clinton will emphasize this agenda, but it does have the potential to give the Democrats a more coherent message for the middle class than the party had in 2014 or even 2012.","204","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/upshot/the-parent-agenda-the-emerging-democratic-focus.html?_r=0"
"It could give them a better chance of reclaiming their support among traditionally Democratic white working-class voters who supported Mr. Obama in 2012 but now disapprove of his performance. Yet it would still appeal to many affluent families who feel burdened by the costs of college, child care and the challenge of raising children with two parents working outside the home.","205","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/upshot/the-parent-agenda-the-emerging-democratic-focus.html?_r=0"
"The most obvious places to see the new focus have been in Mr. Obama's State of the Union address and his budget. The central characters in his speech to Congress were Rebekah and Ben Erler, the struggling parents of two young children in Minneapolis. “Affordable, high-quality child care,” Mr. Obama said, is “not a nice-to-have — it’s a must-have.” He added, “It’s time we stop treating child care as a side issue, or a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.”","206","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/upshot/the-parent-agenda-the-emerging-democratic-focus.html?_r=0"
"His budget — more of a wish list than a policy document, given Republican control of Congress — includes $200 billion over the next decade for child care and early education, along with $60 billion for free community college. He has already proposed expanding the earned-income tax credit and the child tax credit.","207","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/upshot/the-parent-agenda-the-emerging-democratic-focus.html?_r=0"

"And Mrs. Clinton has signaled that many and perhaps all of these proposals will be part of her likely campaign for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2016.

"If embraced by Mrs. Clinton, the agenda could pose real challenges for the Republicans in 2016. It would adjust the focus from income redistribution — through higher taxes on the rich, although such taxes may be needed to fund the new proposals — toward expanded opportunity. It also has the potential to move the Democrats from seeming to focus on the poor, through the Affordable Care Act and the minimum wage, and toward the middle class. Yet its ambition would probably be enough to appease an increasingly liberal Democratic coalition.","211","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/upshot/the-parent-agenda-the-emerging-democratic-focus.html?_r=0"
"In Washington and on the campaign trail, Democrats have struggled to formulate a policy agenda focused on the middle class.

"The parental agenda has the potential to resonate among the large group of voters with children under 18 at home, 36 percent of the electorate in 2012. It might also resonate among the already Democratic-leaning young voters of the Obama era, 18 to 29 years old in 2008, who are now entering prime childbearing years. The birthrate among millennials has dropped to near-record or record lows, depending on the age cohort, probably in part because of economic insecurity. Weekly earnings for full-time workers aged 25 to 34 are down 3.8 percent since 2000.","214","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/upshot/the-parent-agenda-the-emerging-democratic-focus.html?_r=0"

"The policies seem less vulnerable to the critiques that have endangered support for past Democratic initiatives. Far more families seem poised to benefit from these initiatives in the short term than from the Affordable Care Act, which offered its biggest immediate benefits to the poor. The parental agenda also has far fewer potential losers — like people who might fear losing their doctors or coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act. The proposals are not especially complex, either.","216","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/upshot/the-parent-agenda-the-emerging-democratic-focus.html?_r=0"
"This emerging Democratic agenda has already co-opted the message of so-called reform conservatives, who argue that the G.O.P. needs to come up with policies to help families. Democrats have the ideological flexibility to embrace just about any proposal from reform conservatives that might seem politically threatening, as they already have on the earned income and college tax credits. In other words, they are willing to use conservative means to accomplish liberal ends.","217","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/upshot/the-parent-agenda-the-emerging-democratic-focus.html?_r=0"
"Partly as a result, the Republican response has been muddled. Some Republicans have come out against the parent-focused proposals as more big government. Others have focused on the costs of Mr. Obama’s program, even though public concern about the deficit has waned in recent years, or have said they support the goals but believe states, rather than Washington, should lead the way.","218","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/upshot/the-parent-agenda-the-emerging-democratic-focus.html?_r=0"
"Control of Congress has allowed the Republican Party to defer its public campaign against Mr. Obama’s initiatives, since they are dead on arrival.

"In some ways, the cast of candidates for 2016 resembles the group from the 2008 race, with a field of stalwartly liberal politicians. Mrs. Clinton was slightly more liberal in 2008 than now, according to Crowdpac, which scores politicians on a left-right scale of -10 to 10. (Crowdpac bases this mainly on campaign contributions, but also on votes and speeches.) Her problem was that Barack Obama, who was further to the left of her — at -7.8 to her -6.9 — also had the donors who were to the left of her. He ran a better campaign, particularly in Iowa, and benefited from a surge in money from small-dollar donors.","285","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/upshot/hillary-clinton-and-the-2016-democrats-mostly-liberal-together.html?_r=0"

Ms. Warren has the higher fund-raising profile of the two, with a leadership PAC that raised more than $2 million during the 2014 election cycle. But she and Mrs. Clinton (and to a lesser extent Mr. Sanders) would be competing for a similar pool of donors.

"WASHINGTON — Ten Senate Democrats who have advocated putting more sanctions on Iran gave the White House a two-month reprieve on Tuesday, saying they would wait until after the late-March deadline for completing the outlines of a deal to restrain Tehran’s nuclear program before voting for a bill that President Obama has said would undermine any chance of reaching an agreement.","JAN. 27, 2015","552","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/world/middleeast/house-hearing-iran-nuclear-talks-sanctions.html?_r=0"
"The concession came in a letter to Mr. Obama from Senator Robert Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, who has been increasingly at odds with the White House for his strong advocacy of a bill intended to squeeze Iran’s oil revenues even harder if the nuclear negotiations do not result in an agreement. But Mr. Menendez’s letter made clear that he and the other Democrats would join Senate Republicans if a meaningful accord was not reached by March 24.","553","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/world/middleeast/house-hearing-iran-nuclear-talks-sanctions.html?_r=0"
"While Secretary of State John Kerry has expressed optimism that an extension agreed upon in November would lead to a speedy agreement, talks have been largely stalemated since then, and few of Mr. Kerry’s aides now believe that deadline can be met.

"The offer to Mr. Obama is double-edged, because it greatly reduces the chances that he can win another extension of the negotiations while keeping many of the current restrictions on Iran’s program in place. Until now, some of Mr. Obama’s current and former advisers on the Iran issue, perhaps the biggest single potential foreign policy breakthrough of his last two years in office, have argued privately that “managed irresolution” of the problem would be preferable to a breakdown in talks that could lead to a military standoff.","558","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/world/middleeast/house-hearing-iran-nuclear-talks-sanctions.html?_r=0"

"In recent days, conservatives in the Iranian Parliament have said they are working on a resolution of their own to counter American pressure by binding the hands of Iran’s negotiating team and stopping them from agreeing to production limits on nuclear fuel.

"Like a lot of people who pay attention to such things, I had assumed that Democrats had a huge advantage going into next year’s presidential race.

"We first began to notice these counterforces in the high-immigrant red states that were supposed to start turning purple by now — places like Texas, Arizona and Georgia. New types of voters have, indeed, flooded into these places, but as Ronald Brownstein points out in The National Journal, since 1992 Democratic presidential nominees have averaged only 44.5 percent of the vote in Georgia, 43.7 percent of the vote in Arizona and a pathetic 40.4 percent of the vote in Texas.","595","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/opinion/david-brooks-the-field-is-flat.html?_r=0"

"Nationally, three big things are happening to at least temporarily hold off the Democratic realignment. First, the aging of the electorate is partially canceling out the diversifying of the electorate. People tend to get more Republican as they get older, and they vote at higher rates. And older people are moving to crucial states. In Arizona, Obama won 63 percent of the young adults but only 29 percent of the oldsters.","597","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/opinion/david-brooks-the-field-is-flat.html?_r=0"
"This aging effect could have a big impact in the swing states of the Midwest, like Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, Michigan and Pennsylvania. These states have generally gone Democratic in presidential years, but it’s hard to miss the growing Republican strength at every other level. As Brownstein notes, Republicans have a 42-to-18 advantage in House seats in these states. They control the governorships in all but Pennsylvania. They control both statehouses in all these states save the Iowa Senate.","598","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/opinion/david-brooks-the-field-is-flat.html?_r=0"
"Second, Democrats continue to lose support among the white working class. In 2008, Barack Obama carried 40 percent of white voters with a high school degree. By 2012, that was down to 36 percent. As John B. Judis points out in a National Journal piece called “The Emerging Republican Advantage,” the tilt of the white working class to the G.O.P. has been even more pronounced in other races.

"That template does not include a big role for government. Polls show that faith in government is near all-time lows. In a Gallup survey, voters listed dysfunctional government as the nation’s No. 1 problem. In fact, American voters’ traditional distrust has morphed and hardened.

"Mrs. Clinton’s dominance has kept other top Democrats from taking the kind of steps that serious presidential candidates have typically taken by now.

"Eventually, the Democrats would produce a nominee, even if it were not Mrs. Clinton. As a thought experiment, we decided to imagine a Democratic race without her. To be clear, we’re not predicting such a race. But we generally don’t believe in putting 100 percent odds on political matters. So here goes:","612","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"

"He has some obvious strengths. Many Democrats feel genuine affection for him. Mr. Obama seems to be among them and could feel some pressure to support his No. 2. If the economy continues to gather steam, Mr. Biden could also promise more of the same on policy grounds. And Mr. Biden could easily run a campaign that emphasized his stylistic differences with his boss, including his long experience in Washington and his decidedly un-egghead-like persona. Americans tend to prefer their presidents to be different from their immediate predecessors.","614","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"
"But he would hardly clear the field. Many Democratic operatives have a hard time seeing him as the nominee even without Mrs. Clinton. Remember that he’s run for president twice before, with miserable results. In 1987, he withdrew months before the first primary. In 2008, he received less than 1 percent of vote in the Iowa caucuses — less than half as much as Bill Richardson.","615","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/imagining-2016-without-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0"

"Historically, liberal candidates have failed to win the nomination, partly because of the overlooked role that conservative states play in selecting a nominee. Ms. Warren would have to hope that she could prevail for one of two reasons: Either the more moderate primary voters would remain splintered long enough for her to establish a large delegate lead; or the rise in inequality and public dissatisfaction in recent years would move the Democratic primary electorate to the left, allowing a liberal candidate to win.

"Before anyone assumes she would be the favorite, it’s worth keeping in mind that her electoral record is still thin — and leaves room for questions.

"According to a report by the former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers and Ed Balls, a top British Labor Party politician, unless there is serious government intervention, inequality and a lack of financial resources among those in the bottom half of the income distribution will result in “insufficient aggregate demand – too little spending by consumers and businesses to keep gross domestic product at its capacity.” Developed nations “need new social and political institutions to make 21st century capitalism work for the many and not the few,” Summers and Balls wrote.","867","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"

"Mark Carney, the Canadian governor of the Bank of England, articulated a fundamental premise of inclusive capitalism in a speech delivered in Britain last May: “Just as any revolution eats its children,” Carney said, “unchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself.” Among the attendees at the conference in London in May were such Democratic and liberal luminaries as Bill Clinton; Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google; and Summers, who served President Obama as a top economic adviser.","869","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"Two of the earliest advocates of inclusive capitalism were the late C.K. Prahalad, professor of business at the University of Michigan, and Stuart L. Hart, professor emeritus of strategic management at Cornell. In a widely cited 2002 article, “The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid,” Prahalad and Hart argued that powerful corporations could — must — improve the conditions of the world’s poor by promoting commercial activity, employment opportunities, access to credit, and wealth creation among those at the bottom of income distribution – a group they refer to as the fourth tier, the world’s poorest four billion people.","870","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"

"The concept of inclusive capitalism has expanded over the past 13 years to apply to those at the bottom and middle of the ladder in developed nations, including the United States. The fundamental “inclusive capitalism” argument is that business enterprises lose profit-making opportunities when consumers have little money to spend. Inadequate purchasing power among the many threatens corporations and poses a direct danger to the top 1 percent, and, indeed, to capitalism itself.","872","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"As testimony to the power of the concept of “inclusive capitalism,” President Obama in his State of the Union address called for the enactment of tax policies designed to provide a larger share of market-driven economic growth to the working and middle classes. In a May 7, 2014, speech in Dublin, “Global Lessons for Inclusive Growth,” Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, outlined central elements of the White House agenda. Administration policies, Furman argued, would result in “higher median incomes, lower poverty rates, and broader, more inclusive growth.”","873","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"

"If policies grounded in “inclusive capitalism” become central to the party platform, it will mark the party’s strongest commitment to the economic interests of working- and middle-class Americans since Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal.

"Not only would Obama raise capital gains tax rates from 23.8 to 28 percent for couples making more than $500,000 in taxable income, but he would eliminate a provision in tax law that allows the very rich to avoid taxation on much of the wealth passed on to their children and he would end a current exemption from taxation on the increase in the value of stocks, bonds and other assets when passed on through inheritance.","883","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"This exemption, technically called the “stepped up basis,” is crucial to the unrestricted intergenerational transfer of wealth, a practice that many liberals, and even some conservatives, contend conflicts with equality of opportunity. The Obama plan additionally calls for a .07 percent fee on financial institutions with more than $50 billion in assets that would produce $110 billion in revenue over 10 years.","884","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"Van Hollen, in turn, would raise revenues by imposing a transaction tax on stock trades. He would use the money to finance a $1,000 tax credit for workers making less than $100,000 annually, a $20,000 deduction for two-earner families, an annual $250 payment to those who put at least $500 into an approved retirement pension plan, and to substantially increase child care tax credits.","885","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"

"Their report addresses four major economic developments broadly undermining wages and working conditions:","888","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"First, that “increasing global economic integration has also meant increased competition for many workers who produce tradable goods and services.”","889","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"Second, that “advances in robotics and artificial intelligence have put intermediate-skill jobs at risk in what economists call a hollowing out of the labor market.”","890","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"Third, that “Major corporations have opted to use subcontracting to perform basic functions, and many workers are now classified as independent contractors, eroding basic labor law protections.”","891","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"And fourth, “corporations have come to function much less effectively as providers of large-scale opportunity. Increasingly, their dominant focus has been on maximization of share prices and the compensation of their top employees.”","892","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"In addition, Summers and Balls argue that competition in the banking sector has broken down and “will need interventions to support the reasonable functioning of the free market.”","893","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"What do these points actually signify in practice? In a section titled “U.S. Policy Response,” Summers and Balls call for making parent companies responsible for the working conditions of employees of subcontractors; adopting government policies favoring employee stock ownership so that workers benefit from the growing share of national income flowing to capital as opposed to wages; and imposing tough and costly sanctions on employers who use illegal tactics to fight unionization.","894","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"Not stopping there, Summers and Balls call for a substantial boost in the $24,000 pay ceiling under which employees must get time and a half for overtime work beyond 40 hours a week; increased infrastructure spending of $100 billion a year, or $1 trillion over 10 years; and strengthened provisions in trade agreements guaranteeing collective bargaining rights and basic environmental protections to reduce the movement of American companies to countries with the lowest labor standards.","895","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"Among their other proposed policy initiatives are creation of an income tax credit for those with moderate pay levels. It would start at $23,260 for joint filers with children, just where the current earned-income tax credit phases out. At $85,000, the credit would diminish, reaching zero at $95,000. They would also change the mortgage interest and property tax deductions into tax credits. Deductions inherently provide larger benefits to those in higher tax brackets. Credits provide equal benefits to all who qualify.","896","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"

"In response to Obama’s plan to tax the wealthy to boost breaks for the working class, Michael Steed, spokesman for the speaker of the House, John A. Boehner, said in a statement, “More Washington tax hikes and spending is the same old top-down approach we’ve come to expect from President Obama that hasn’t worked.”","898","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"

"Taken together, the Obama, Van Hollen, and Summers interpretations of “inclusive capitalism” are a victory for the left of the Democratic Party.

"Josh Bivens, the research director at E.P.I., said in an email that the proposals did indeed “look like a shift in the Democratic Party on economic policy.” He said his hope was that “the next two years becomes a competition about who is willing to be the most aggressive in trying to boost low/middle-class incomes.”","901","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, called the Obama plan “a pretty big deal.

"Inclusive capitalism has its critics on the left, nicely summed up by the Guardian columnist Nafeez Ahmed.

"Andrew Grove, founder of Intel, put the push toward “inclusive capitalism” in a more positive light. “Our generation has seen the decisive victory of free-market principles over planned economies,” he told the Economist in 2012. “So we stick with this belief largely oblivious to emerging evidence that while free markets beat planned economies, there may be room for a modification that is even better.”","906","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"
"While the new agenda has no chance of passage in the Republican-controlled Congress, Democrats plan to use the tenets of inclusive capitalism in the 2016 elections. One Democratic goal in putting specific policies forward is to use them as wedge issues to force Republicans to choose between their affluent backers and their supporters in the white working class. This will be no easy task because a decisive majority of whites without college degrees has been voting against Democratic candidates for two decades, making it very difficult for the party to break what has been a Republican hammerlock since 1994.","907","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/can-capitalists-save-capitalism.html?_r=0"

"The court fights began last month with lawsuits filed in Ohio and Wisconsin, presidential battleground states whose governors are likely to run for the Republican nomination.

"Maryland might seem a peculiar venue for a blood feud over the future of the Democratic Party. It is the second-bluest state in the United States, after Massachusetts, according to Gallup; its registered Democrats, more than 30 percent of whom are black, outnumber registered Republicans two to one. Maryland is home to an immense federal work force and is one of the states most economically dependent on the federal government. Its gun-control laws are among the strictest in the nation. In 2012, Maryland, Maine and Washington became the first states to ratify same-sex marriage by popular vote. Barack Obama’s statewide margin of victory was roughly 26 points in 2008 and 2012, the fifth highest in the United States. The last time the G.O.P. won control of the Maryland State Legislature was in 1897. So reliable is its party affiliation that, as a Democratic senator’s chief of staff puts it, “If Maryland ever becomes a jeopardy state, then the whole thing is gone.”","MAY 12, 2015","948","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"This past March, when Barbara Mikulski, the longest-serving woman in United States Senate history, unexpectedly announced that she would not be seeking a sixth term in 2016, national progressive groups quickly threw their weight behind their dream candidate: Donna Edwards. A pugnacious former community organizer, Edwards is a four-term African-American congresswoman from Prince George’s County, one of the most affluent majority-black counties in the United States. But she wasn’t the favorite of establishment Democrats. For them, the obvious choice to replace Mikulski was the seven-term congressman Chris Van Hollen, who is considered a progressive like Edwards, but has a reputation for coolheaded practicality and for working well with Republicans. Of the bills sponsored by Van Hollen in the previous session of Congress, 37 percent included at least one Republican co-sponsor. For Edwards, the corresponding figure was 0 percent. Where she is viewed as a warrior for liberal causes, he is seen as a conciliator, one whose let’s-sit-down-and-talk-this-over geniality led to his tenure as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from 2007 to 2011 and, thereafter, to his designation as the House Democrats’ point man on bipartisan budget discussions. As their lead negotiator, Van Hollen has immersed himself in the sort of legislative sausage-making that typically entails compromise, like his expressed willingness, in 2012, to consider restructuring Social Security as part of an overall deficit-reduction agreement. To progressives, this was nothing less than apostasy.","949","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"Though the Senate Democratic primary was a year away, the national groups supporting Edwards knew that Van Hollen would be viewed as the prohibitive front-runner if they didn’t define the stakes of the contest immediately. Three of these groups — the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Democracy for America and Blue America — sent out a blizzard of fund-raising solicitations, petitions and emails to members and to the media, one of which hailed Edwards as “a true Elizabeth Warren Democrat,” referring to the U.S. senator from Massachusetts whose confrontational stances on economic issues have galvanized the left. Van Hollen received an altogether different reception. Within hours after he made his candidacy official on March 4, three other voices from the liberal wing of the party — MoveOn, Credo Action and Daily Kos, the website run by the activist Markos Moulitsas — openly questioned his progressive bona fides and implied that he was one of a breed of “corporate ‘New Democrats.’ ” Moulitsas’s website declared that Van Hollen’s flexibility on Social Security amounted to “a major red flag,” making him “a candidate that may bargain away retirement security.” Edwards, meanwhile, entered the race pointedly pledging never to tamper with Social Security, “no ifs, ands, buts or willing-to-considers.”","950","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"Whichever Democratic candidate wins the primary next spring, he or she will be heavily favored to become the state’s next U.S. senator. Because of this, the Maryland contest is unlikely to hinge on which candidate can appeal to the broadest spectrum of voters on Election Day. Rather, it will be a fight over what a true Democrat should, and should not, be. This identity struggle was born out of devastating losses at the polls last November, but it is rooted in intraparty disagreements that have been decades in the making. And it is by no means limited to Maryland. In Illinois, Florida, California and elsewhere, progressive groups have asserted their energies to promote what they hope will be populist warriors in the Elizabeth Warren mold while weeding out those judged to be ideologically tepid. The recently announced presidential candidacy of Bernie Sanders, the self-described socialist senator from Vermont, will no doubt increase the party’s gravitational pull leftward. Still, given Van Hollen’s history as a highly effective liberal legislator, the effort to push him aside in favor of Edwards is a striking development for a party that has largely kept its internal skirmishes under wraps. As Neil Sroka, the communications strategist for the liberal group Democracy for America, puts it, “We view primaries like this one as a fight over the future of the Democratic Party.”","951","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"For all the much-discussed ailments of the Republican Party — its failure to win the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections; the corrosive bickering between its mainstream and its Tea Party stalwarts; and the plummeting number of Americans who identify themselves as Republicans — the inescapable reality is that the Democrats have fallen into a ditch arguably as deep and dismal as the one Republicans have dug for themselves. “It isn’t that the Democratic Party is struggling,” says Jonathan Cowan, the president of the centrist policy center Third Way. “It’s that at the subpresidential level, it’s in a free fall.” The Democrats lost their majority in the Senate last November; to regain it, they will need to pick up five additional seats (or four if there’s a Democratic vice president who can cast the tiebreaking vote), and nonpartisan analysts do not rate their chances as good. The party’s situation in the House is far more dire. Only 188 of the lower chamber’s 435 seats are held by Democrats. Owing in part to the aggressiveness of Republican-controlled State Legislatures that redrew numerous congressional districts following the 2010 census, few believe that the Democratic Party is likely to retake power until after the next census in 2020, and even then, the respected political analyst Charles Cook rates the chances of the Democrats’ winning the House majority by 2022 as a long shot at best.","952","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"Things get even worse for the Democrats further down the political totem pole. Only 18 of the country’s 50 governors are Democrats. The party controls both houses in only 11 State Legislatures. Not since the Hoover Administration has the Democratic Party’s overall power been so low. A rousing victory by Hillary Rodham Clinton might boost other Democratic aspirants in 2016; then again, in 2012 Obama won 62 percent of Electoral College votes yet carried 48 percent of Congressional districts and a mere 22 percent of the nation’s 3,114 counties. Through a billion dollars of campaign wizardry, the president did not lift up but only managed to escape a party brand that has come to be viewed in much of America with abiding disfavor.","953","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"For a giddy moment seven years ago, Democrats dared to believe that Barack Obama’s election would significantly reconfigure partisan alliances. Instead, his presidency has only calcified them. “When Obama swept the 2008 primary and general elections, Democrats’ image suddenly came to be defined by a city-dwelling law-school professor whose life experiences had been far different from those of most working-class whites,” said David Wasserman, a congressional analyst for The Cook Political Report. “It was the culminating moment of a half-century of realignment. Democrats had already ceded Southern whites, but in the last few years they have lost droves of Midwestern, small-town and working-class whites who feel like they have little in common with the party anymore.”","954","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"As to how Democrats should be responding to their poor showing below the executive branch, there are two competing schools of thought, each of which began to emerge in the middle of the last decade, when the Republicans controlled all branches of government and Karl Rove, the G.O.P. strategist, was crowing about a party majority that would endure for many decades to come. Moderates believe the only remedy is for Democrats to refashion themselves as pragmatists who care more about achieving results than ideological purity. When I asked Cowan about what he hoped for in a Hillary Clinton presidency, he said: “Senator Clinton has been in politics long enough to realize you’re governing in a divided country. You use the mandate you have to get stuff done.”","955","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"Progressives, on the other hand, believe that the Democrats lost their way by obsessing over what President Bill Clinton once termed “the vital center.” That fixation, they say, has rendered the party brand incomprehensible and raised the question as to what exactly Democrats stand for. To them, it is the sharp-tongued populist rhetoric of Warren, whose signature line is that “the game is rigged” against working-class Americans, that represents the party’s only viable future. Moulitsas of Daily Kos says: “The Democrats’ branding problem isn’t that people don’t agree with the Democratic agenda. It’s that voters don’t trust them to actually carry it out. That, in huge part, is why Democratic-base turnout is so low across the board and especially so in midterms. So that’s where the Warrens and Edwardses of the party come in: Democrats who aren’t just saying the right thing and believing the right thing but doing the right thing and forcefully fighting for it.”","956","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"The problem is that neither wing can muster an entirely airtight case that theirs is the road map to electoral success. Sroka, of Democracy for America, says that last November’s election “was a good night for progressives,” pointing to the successful re-election campaigns waged by Senator Al Franken of Minnesota and Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who each employed anti-Wall Street rhetoric. But in purple states, House Democrats like Alan Grayson of Florida, Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire and Tom Perriello of Virginia all ran on Obama’s progressive achievements in 2010 and lost, as did Shea-Porter again in 2014.","957","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"Moderate Democrats cite the Senate victories of Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and Joe Donnelly in Indiana in 2012 as models for how Democrats can expand the map in their favor by proffering candidates who are not to the left of their electorate. On the other hand, Mark Warner, the Virginia senator and popular centrist, was nearly defeated in 2014 by failing to motivate the Democratic base. And the moderate Senate Democrats Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana did all they could to distance themselves from Obama’s Affordable Care Act and were still routed. The election results are a jumble of counterindicators, from which anything and nothing can be concluded, allowing each side to blame the other after a loss.","958","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"The long-simmering family quarrel has now spilled out into the open in Maryland, where, Sroka says, “going forward the question is: ‘Will the party embrace that sort of populist progressive image? Or is it going to follow the Wall Street wing that’s led the party astray for the past 15 years?’ ” Cowan, unsurprisingly, sees the Maryland contest differently: not as the voiceless versus the elite, but rather as reasonable folks versus extremists.

"It has never been Donna Edwards’s impulse to accommodate others. “You don’t get things by just rolling over,” she said one morning as we sat in a hotel lobby less than a mile away from her residence at Maryland’s National Harbor. “You get a deal by fighting hard.”","960","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"Edwards has the lithe, intense build of a long-distance runner. Her mother grew up in the segregated South among farmers who also worked in the coal mines whenever the crops failed. Her father joined the Air Force just after President Truman integrated the military and eventually rose to master sergeant. After she earned a law degree and spent two decades working for various liberal advocacy groups, she ran in 2006 for the Maryland congressional seat occupied by an African-American centrist, Albert Wynn. That she nearly defeated Wynn with very little financial support drew the admiration of national progressive groups, which invested heavily in a 2008 rematch. When a robo call released by the Wynn campaign condemned Edwards for fiscal irresponsibility, citing the fact that tax liens had been placed on her Maryland house, she deftly reframed this bit of personal history as the struggle of a single mother in an economy rigged to benefit “corporate Democrats” like Wynn. Edwards clobbered him by 22 points, prompting MoveOn to send out an exultant fund-raising email with the subject heading, “Donna Edwards Beats Al Wynn: Who’s Next?” Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, told me that this 2008 race, largely undiscussed by the national media at the time, was in fact seminal. “Donna Edwards,” he said, “was the original victorious primary winner of the modern-day progressive era.”","961","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"Like her ideological opposite, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, another lawyer who ascended to office by defeating a well-funded, heavily favored politician, Edwards has made few friends since arriving in Washington. Even some of her natural allies, including a few fellow Maryland Democrats and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, describe her privately as teamwork-averse and as opportunist. Progressives, of course, love that Edwards is not a backslapping insider. She has vigorously advocated for many of their pet causes — minimum-wage increases, college-tuition debt relief, overturning the Supreme Court’s Citizen’s United verdict so as to regulate corporate expenditures on political activity — that they maintain are popular with the public despite having failed to pass in Congress.","962","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"They also see her as a model progressive in another sense: Edwards is not a white male. As she pointedly informed me: “The base of the Democratic Party is African-American women. They’re the party’s most reliable voters.” Her statement is both true and not true. Black women in 2012 had the highest turnout rate, 70 percent, of any voting group in America, and 96 percent of them voted for Obama. But it has been estimated that nearly a third of women of color who voted in 2012 stayed home in 2014, with the highest drop off occurring among black women. No one, including Edwards and the groups backing her, has suggested that the Democratic Party can stake its future on minority turnout and abandon working-class white voters in the suburbs altogether. Still, the corollary to Edwards’s point is that Democrats might do better among their most faithful constituents nationwide if they offered more relatable candidates, including more black Elizabeth Warrens.","963","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"This theory saw its limits last November in Maryland. The state’s Democratic candidate for governor, Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, an African-American war hero and champion of progressive causes like expanded health care and preschool education, continually bashed his Republican opponent as pro-gun and anti-abortion. The Republican, Larry Hogan, said that Brown would be a tax-happy liberal just like the previous Democratic governor, Martin O’Malley. In one of the election cycle’s most stunning defeats, Brown ended up losing by nearly five points. Most explanations for what went wrong have focused on Brown’s lackluster campaign. But the fact remains that even in one of America’s bluest states, a progressive candidate of considerable accomplishment, even one who looks like his constituents, is by no means assured of victory.","964","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"One reason for this may be that liberal African-Americans still need convincing that a progressive agenda benefits their pocketbook. “What you have to consider about Maryland,” says Albert Wynn, the man Donna Edwards defeated in 2008, “is that two out of the last four governors have been Republican. Maryland may be blue, but it’s not California. It’s very progressive on social issues, but there’s also uneasiness over the foreclosure situation, which has been devastating to the African-American community in particular. And there’s real concern over job creation. Raising the minimum wage is not an economic message. It’s an element of an economic message. No one’s saying, ‘I want my kids to have a minimum wage job.’ They want Maryland to attract businesses that are now going to other states. I think people are oversimplifying Maryland politics.”","965","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"By “people,” the former congressman was referring to the outside progressive groups that helped unseat him and were now setting their sights on Chris Van Hollen by insinuating that he was a “Wall Street Democrat.” When I asked Van Hollen what he thought of the term, his placid expression curdled somewhat. “Look, I’m not sure what the definition of that is,” he said, his boyish face projecting the earnestness of a student-body president. “All I know is what I believe.” Of the outside groups that saw him as inferior to Edwards, he said dismissively, “I’ve got the support of people who’ve led the fight for progressive change in Maryland.”","966","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"Numerous local Democratic officials and progressive groups have in fact voiced their support for Van Hollen, who was a key figure in the passage of anti-tobacco and gun-control legislation as a state senator during the 1990s and who later led House Democratic efforts to reform campaign-finance laws in the wake of the Citizens United verdict. Cowan, of Third Way, says: “Van Hollen is basically a thoughtful, pragmatic liberal. He’s neither firmly in the centrist camp nor in the far-left camp. And the bizarreness of the litmus test they’re now applying to him is that it’s not really about whether he’s a progressive at heart.”","967","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"The outside groups aligned against him admit that Van Hollen is not a true foe. They do not see him as an egregious pragmatist like the Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, whom progressives fought in vain to unseat in this spring’s Democratic runoff. Nor do they view him as akin to Patrick Murphy, a Florida congressman and Senate candidate whom the groups are currently blasting as “Republican Lite” while promoting his opponent, Alan Grayson, a congressman and progressive bulldog who has likened the Tea Party to the Ku Klux Klan. But the mild-mannered Van Hollen will never inspire a chorus of hell-yeahs in the manner of the pugilistic Grayson. For that matter, as a diplomat’s son born in Pakistan and educated at Harvard, he lacks the populist connective tissue that Donna Edwards has. Shortly after Freddie Gray died after being injured while in police custody in Baltimore, Edwards told me: “I reacted to what happened from my perspective raising a young black son in an environment that’s complicated. And one of the voices that’s so important but that’s been missing are black moms who are raising their children and worrying about what’s happened to our communities.”","968","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"Van Hollen nonetheless enters the race as the front-runner, owing to his legislative accomplishments and to his extensive fund-raising connections as the former chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But Thomas Schaller, a University of Maryland, Baltimore County, political-science professor, says: “Any financial advantage by him will probably be evened out by the sweat equity of progressive grass-roots volunteers. So resourcewise, this is a draw. The differentiator will be policy stuff. Her people are probably going to be poring over every committee vote and every statement to see where he was siding with Wall Street. The Van Hollen people will be doing the same thing. And sure, race is always a factor” — a factor, Schaller said, that would help Edwards in black-dominated counties but hurt her in the rural stretches of western Maryland and along the Chesapeake Bay, with emerging neighborhoods of Asian and Latino voters potentially proving decisive.","969","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"As the national progressive groups backing Edwards funnel funds and campaign infrastructure into Maryland, their efforts will also serve as the opening volley in a more far-reaching strategy, which is to stock Congress and the White House with true-blue warriors rather than bland accommodationists. The outcome, as they imagine it, would be a Democratic front line committed to income equality, an expanded social safety net and climate change doing battle with a G.O.P. that will continue to fight against tax increases, entitlement programs and environmental regulation. “It is the liberal wing of the Democratic Party that has suffused it with new energy and purpose,” Moulitsas said. “Our job is to finish getting rid of the dinosaurs so that we as a party can move forward with a cohesive, positive and popular message.” Moulitsas rattled off a list of liberals who, in his view, were already reshaping the Senate: Warren, Merkley, Franken, Sanders, Tammy Baldwin and Sherrod Brown.

"It’s an open question how an American public already disgusted with government dysfunction would react to a Democratic Party filled with far-left alley-fighters to stalemate the Tea Party on the other side of the aisle. But as has been the case with Republicans, in which the presidential candidate Ted Cruz and his fellow hard-liners in Congress have effectively defined the terms of the party’s policy-making, agitators on the left have already succeeded in tugging the party further away from the center. That is true on the presidential level, where Hillary Clinton has very recently taken pains to embrace Elizabeth Warren as one who “never hesitates to hold powerful people’s feet to the fire,” while casting her own candidacy as a populist quest to “reshuffle the cards” of a deck stacked in favor of the rich and powerful. And it is true in Maryland, where Van Hollen, after entering the race and encountering criticism from the progressive groups, has now vowed that he will never cut Social Security benefits and in fact supports expanding them, just as Edwards does.","971","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"“I’m always quoting the Bible to my caucus,” Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat, told me one afternoon in the House minority leader’s conference room. “And in it, Christ said, ‘Love thy neighbor.’ Of course, that’s the easy part. The neighbor’s somewhere over there. Now,” she said, pivoting from the Republican neighbors across the aisle to her squabbling fellow Democrats, “ ‘Love one another?’ That’s the day-to-day challenge we have.”","972","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"Pelosi has possibly been in a better position to comprehend her party’s divisions than any other Democrat in America. For the past 12 years, she has presided over — and, many would say, iron-fistedly held together — a Democratic caucus that, at its peak membership of 257 in 2009, was in a constant state of intramural rancor. Three election cycles later, most of its so-called Blue Dog moderates have been drubbed out of office by Tea Party Republicans. Her caucus of House Democrats, now reduced to 188 members, is dominated by urban liberals, with fewer moderates left to argue with. Pelosi’s challenge these days appears to be persuading her more talented members to stick around, enduring the dreary torpor of entrenched minority status in a legislative chamber that has become a marvel of do-nothingness. Pelosi, a native of Baltimore, has watched with a certain sorrow as two of her protégés, Van Hollen and Edwards — and potentially a third member of her caucus, Elijah Cummings, who is also a Baltimore native — have willingly forfeited their House seats and the various leadership posts bestowed by her to run against each other. As Pelosi told me with a wistful laugh, “I feel like I’m trying to give everybody an opportunity, and they’re walking out the door!”","973","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"Like many Democratic officeholders I interviewed, Pelosi prefers to believe that her party is pretty much where most Americans are, notwithstanding last year’s election results. Voters, she said, “know that the Republicans are awful. Our people didn’t just turn out.” Motivating them to do so, particularly in midterm cycles when there isn’t a presidential candidate to excite the base, has been the party’s greatest challenge, one that can’t be overcome with a heavier investment in field organization and attack ads. The underlying problem, says Wasserman, the congressional analyst, is that even a well-liked Democratic candidate with a distinct message has trouble overcoming the perception that the party he or she belongs to is completely out of touch with the average American voter. “With few exceptions,” he said, “the Democratic Party’s increasingly urban, cosmopolitan image has slowly devastated its prospects in precincts more than a half-hour’s drive from a Lululemon Athletica.”","974","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"Pelosi does not entirely disagree with this assessment. While maintaining that the Democrats single-handedly staved off a depression with no assistance from the G.O.P., she readily conceded to me that “Americans think that Republicans are just as good as or better than we are on the economy.” In the past three years, Pelosi has sought to convey to voters that it is her Democrats who are in fact on the side of the middle class. The bumper-sticker slogans Pelosi has offered up, one after the next — “Reigniting the American Dream,” “Middle-Class Jumpstart,” “When Women Succeed, America Succeeds” — have not moved the needle in the House Democrats’ favor. She said her party now needed to focus on boosting the fortunes of hard-working Americans and not just Wall Street titans: a Clinton/Warren hybrid that, as she described, came out to something like “It’s the paycheck, genius. Or stupid. Or whatever you want to call the person.”","975","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"It remains to be seen whether the middle class will be sold on such a message when one of its leading messengers, a San Francisco Democrat, has been caricatured by the Republicans as the very personification of urban elitism. The paradox, and arguably the symbolic plight of the party writ large, is that for all her liberal appearances, Pelosi is convinced that her party must not mimic the torch-and-pitchfork absolutism of the Tea Party Republicans.","976","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"“I’m a progressive and proud of it,” she told me. “But when it comes to getting the job done, I mean,” she laughed, “people say I rammed through the health care bill. If I’d rammed it through, I would’ve rammed through single payer! Look, I know what it’s like to be an advocate for progressive causes. It’s their nature to be persistent and to always want more. That’s their role. Our role in Congress is sharing those values while understanding the art of the possible. You have to govern from the middle.”","977","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"By way of illustrating this predilection, Pelosi recalled discussions she frequently had with her point man on bipartisan budget negotiations, Chris Van Hollen. “I always said to Chris when he went to budget meetings: ‘Share the values of our caucus. But be entrepreneurial. If an idea comes up from the right that’s a good idea, well then, it’s a good idea.’ ”","978","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-great-democratic-crack-up-of-2016.html?_r=0"
"Van Hollen had in fact followed her advice. He had negotiated with Republicans.

They’re competitive on the economy, and a good deal more competitive than in the past on traditional liberal issues like immigration and health care.

"One can also plausibly argue that the Republican Party is the governing party in America. After two enormous losses by Democrats in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, Republicans control the Senate and the House of Representatives. There are currently 31 Republican governors compared with 18 for Democrats. Republicans control 68 of 98 state legislative chambers and the most state legislative seats since the 1920s. Nearly half of Americans now live in states under total Republican control. The Obama years have been politically good for Mr. Obama; they have been disastrous for his party.

"The sting of defeat may be temporary. The White House adamantly insisted on Friday that it made important progress by passing part of the trade package and still has a chance to turn around the vote on the other part.

"But for the moment, at least, the defeat laid bare a fundamental schism within the party over economics and, according to some analysts and officials, exposed a stark divide between Democratic lawmakers and a Democratic president late in his tenure.

"The fracture is reminiscent of President George W. Bush’s troubles with his own party over immigration at the same point in his administration.

"The White House and Republican leaders hope to reverse the vote on trade assistance, although aides to Mr. Obama acknowledged the path was not clear. They can try to convince Democrats that they do not want trade assistance to expire at the expense of their constituents or they can dangle incentives to win more Republican votes, or some combination.

"Mr. Obama’s struggle reflected his longstanding distance from Capitol Hill, irritating members of both parties.

"The two Democratic camps generally agree on this much: Most Americans have seen their incomes stagnate in recent decades.

"Trade has always created winners and losers. But in recent years the growth of imports from developing nations like China has had a particularly devastating effect on certain American workers, said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As the labor-intensive production of goods like clothes, furniture and electronics has moved to cheaper factories overseas, the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States has declined by five million, or 28 percent, between 1995 and 2015.","1248","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/opinion/the-democrats-fractured-views-on-trade.html?_r=0"
"A 2013 paper by Mr. Autor and two other scholars concluded that a quarter of the decline in manufacturing employment between 1990 and 2007 could be explained by a surge of imports from China. And Josh Bivens, the research and policy director at the Economic Policy Institute, estimated that increased trade with developing nations lowered wages by 5.5 percent for workers without college degrees.","1249","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/opinion/the-democrats-fractured-views-on-trade.html?_r=0"
"Where Mr. Obama and many of his fellow Democrats part ways is on how big an effect trade agreements (as opposed to trade in general) have had.

The deal could be concluded as early as the end of this year.","1250","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/opinion/the-democrats-fractured-views-on-trade.html?_r=0"

"For instance, the economic gains from the agreement will most likely be modest. The most frequently cited study on the impact of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, by the economists Peter Petri, Michael Plummer and Fan Zhai, says it will boost gross domestic product in the United States by 0.4 percent by 2025 — hardly a significant economic stimulus.

"At the same time, it is hard to figure out how much deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement actually hurt jobs and wages. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that the United States lost 700,000 jobs because of Nafta. Another study found that the impact of trade with Mexico and with Central American countries that also have a trade deal with the United States on jobs and wages was small. Most scholars do agree, however, that imports from China, a country with which the United States has not signed a trade agreement, have had a far greater impact on American workers.","1256","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/opinion/the-democrats-fractured-views-on-trade.html?_r=0"
"Even if Congress ultimately rejected a Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, that would not shield American workers from an increasingly competitive world. The way to shore up the economy and expand job creation is to make investments in public goods, like transportation systems, better housing, stronger schools and skills training, especially for the most disadvantaged Americans. In the meantime, lawmakers could certainly help millions of workers by raising the minimum wage, regardless of what trade agreement is approved.","1257","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/opinion/the-democrats-fractured-views-on-trade.html?_r=0"

"Equal population districts have been taken for granted; every state draws its districts in this way, and it was surprising to see the court even consider the question.

"It’s useful to think about bias in Congress in terms of “wasted votes.” Votes are said to be wasted when a party uses more votes than the other party to win its safe districts. When a party wins a district by 90 percent to 10 percent, its strength seems impressive. But in reality, it is increasing its popular vote margin without getting any additional members of Congress. All those extra votes are, effectively, wasted. The party that wastes fewer votes in its safe districts is generally well positioned to do better in more competitive areas than one would expect from the statewide popular vote.","1321","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/upshot/court-case-can-put-house-further-out-of-reach-for-democrats.html?_r=0"
"Take the best-known “wasted vote” case: Democrats in cities. Democrats tend to have large majorities in cities, and so it is common for them to do better (that is, win by a wider margin) in places like Philadelphia, Chicago and Detroit than Republicans do in equally populated stretches of suburbs and countryside. It is a big part of the Republican advantage in the House.","1322","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/upshot/court-case-can-put-house-further-out-of-reach-for-democrats.html?_r=0"
"Suppose there’s a state that is, over all, evenly split between Republicans or Democrats. Let’s give it three congressional districts, with one district for a hypothetical city that voted, 80-20, for Obama, and another district for a Republican stretch of countryside that voted, 70-30, for Romney. This is a bad deal for Democratic House candidates. The party wasted more votes in its heavily Democratic district. The remaining district leans Republican, 60-40, giving the Republicans a safe 2-to-1 seat edge in a 50-50 state.","1323","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/upshot/court-case-can-put-house-further-out-of-reach-for-democrats.html?_r=0"

"But the Republicans have a wasted vote problem, too, although of a different kind, and it’s the basis of the lawsuit. In the Southwest, it has to do with higher turnout in the areas that Republicans tend to win. A big part of the reason turnout is higher in those areas is simply that there are more eligible voters.","1325","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/upshot/court-case-can-put-house-further-out-of-reach-for-democrats.html?_r=0"
"Democrats, on the other hand, tend to do well in Hispanic areas with large numbers of ineligible voters, like those with immigrants who have not yet become citizens. A result is that Democrats can win their districts with fewer voters than the Republicans can in non-Hispanic areas with higher numbers of eligible voters.","1326","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/upshot/court-case-can-put-house-further-out-of-reach-for-democrats.html?_r=0"
"Imagine, again, a 50-50 state of 700,000 voters with three districts. First, a majority Hispanic district votes 70-30 Democratic, and a majority white district votes 70-30 Republican. Each district has an equal population, but unequal numbers of voters. In our admittedly extreme example, the Hispanic district has just 150,000 voters, versus 300,000 in the non-Hispanic district. So the third district, with 250,000 votes, winds up leaning Democratic, 62 to 38 percent, and the Democrats hold two of the state’s three seats.","1327","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/upshot/court-case-can-put-house-further-out-of-reach-for-democrats.html?_r=0"

"The easiest way to detect this type of bias is to look at the average congressional district. In the low-turnout state example, the average district was 54 percent Democratic (70 + 30 + 62 ÷ 3), and the Democrats won 50 percent of the vote in our hypothetical state. Nationally, the average congressional district voted for Obama by 4.6 points in the two-party-vote, even though he won by only 4 points. This reflects that the Democrats tended to have slightly lower turnout in their districts than the Republicans (because of Hispanic districts that brought down the average).","1329","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/upshot/court-case-can-put-house-further-out-of-reach-for-democrats.html?_r=0"
"Take Arizona, where Mitt Romney won by nine percentage points in 2012. The Democrats have a pretty solid congressional map there. Arizona’s heaviest Democratic district — Phoenix’s Seventh Congressional District — had just 141,357 voters. No Republican district had fewer than 259,113 voters. The average congressional district in Arizona favored Mr. Romney by just 4.5 points.","1330","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/upshot/court-case-can-put-house-further-out-of-reach-for-democrats.html?_r=0"
"Not all of the turnout bias is a result of ineligible voters. The turnout rate among adult citizen Hispanics in these same areas is quite low. Even if the court required equal numbers of eligible voters, the Democrats would still retain an edge because of lower turnout among those voters who are eligible.","1331","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/upshot/court-case-can-put-house-further-out-of-reach-for-democrats.html?_r=0"

"Here’s one way to think about it: If districts are redrawn with equal numbers of eligible voters, today’s heavily Republican, white, non-Hispanic districts will have to give up excess voters to less Republican districts, reducing their wasted vote problem and making other districts more conservative.","1333","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/upshot/court-case-can-put-house-further-out-of-reach-for-democrats.html?_r=0"
"The idea that equal population districts are “biased” is sure to rankle those who argue that the current system reflects democratic values, particularly the notion that members of Congress represent all of the people of their district, not just eligible voters.

"As the cornerstone of its campaign to increase job growth, the central bank has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008.

"Since her official entrance into the race, however, Hillary has moved aggressively to shrink the space for that kind of battle.

"Whatever the motivation, this new positioning has made it even harder for the not-Hillarys to run against her.

"So what remains for our brave few, our band of brothers? Well, they can attack her as a latecomer, a flip-flopper, a fair-weather progressive. But such charges are rarely politically effective; if they were, Mitt Romney would never have been the 2012 G.O.P. nominee. At some level, voters know that they’re voting for the platform more than for the candidate.

"Alternatively, our anti-Hillarys can focus on foreign policy, where her Iraq War vote helped doom her seven years ago.

"But Clinton can find shelter by associating herself with the current president: She’ll just say (as she’s already saying) that she’s exactly as hawkish as Obama, no less and no more. If he escalates against ISIS, she’ll support it; if not, she won’t. Ditto Putin, Assad, you name it. This won’t protect her left flank fully, but so long as she’s hugging the president she’ll lose more left-wing intellectuals than actual progressive voters.","1556","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-running-against-hillary.html?_r=0"
"So all that really remains for her would-be challengers is to attack her ethics. There, at last, the anti-Hillary argument becomes an easy one: From the Nixonian style of her State Department operation to the way her family fattened itself on global tribute during her recent public service, her rivals can point to sins and misdemeanors that would have already disqualified a lesser candidate.","1557","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-running-against-hillary.html?_r=0"
"But will many Democrats really want to hear that argument? The advantage of making an ideological case against Hillary is that progressives can accept it – yes, she’s not as liberal as we would like, we’re glad somebody’s pressing her, and maybe we’ll cast a protest vote for them – and still feel O.K. about her inevitability and about voting for her in the general election.","1558","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-running-against-hillary.html?_r=0"
"The ethical case, on the other hand, is more personal, discomfiting, and easily repurposed by Republicans. So any time Hillary’s rivals offer those kinds of critiques, their audience will hear intimations of G.O.P. attacks to come.

"The districts in question, drawn after the 2010 census, were used in the 2012 House elections. In those elections, the Republicans drew 51 percent of the vote yet won 63 percent of Florida’s House seats. In a perfectly unbiased electoral system, a party winning 50 percent of the statewide votes would earn 50 percent of the congressional seats.","1688","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/upshot/you-cant-draw-unbiased-districts-in-florida-even-if-you-try.html?_r=0"
"But the legislature that drew the districts might not be completely at fault. In 2013, Jowei Chen, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Michigan, and Jonathan Rodden, a professor of political science at Stanford, published a study and an expert report to a Florida circuit court that came to that conclusion. It found that because of the population geography of Florida — where Democrats and Republicans happen to live — it is natural to draw districts that have a Republican bias.","1689","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/upshot/you-cant-draw-unbiased-districts-in-florida-even-if-you-try.html?_r=0"
"In Florida, as is common around the country, Democrats are highly concentrated in urban centers like Miami; Republicans are more spread out around the state. This means residents of Democratic-leaning precincts are far more likely to have similarly voting neighbors than red-leaning precincts are. And since Florida’s congressional districts must by law be contiguous and compact, Democrats are more likely to be packed into districts that are overwhelmingly Democratic than Republicans are. Nate Cohn, my colleague at The Upshot, has written about the phenomenon of “wasted votes” and how it hurts Democrats in states like Pennsylvania.","1690","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/upshot/you-cant-draw-unbiased-districts-in-florida-even-if-you-try.html?_r=0"
"In Florida, unlike in most other states, this Democratic concentration is so extreme that even in partisan-blind districts drawn by a computer, the Republican bias remains. In Mr. Chen and Mr. Rodden’s simulations, they found that when the Florida vote was slightly tilted toward Democrats, as it was in the 2008 presidential election data they used, Republicans would still win 52 to 56 percent of the House seats, on average. These simulations notably held Florida’s three majority-black districts, one of which was struck down as a partisan gerrymander, constant, forming the other 24 districts out of the remaining precincts.","1691","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/upshot/you-cant-draw-unbiased-districts-in-florida-even-if-you-try.html?_r=0"

"Even the districting plans proposed by Democratic state legislators for the 2002 redistricting, which were presumably drawn favorably for Democrats, carried a Republican bias. The most Democratically favorable of these plans gave Republicans 56 percent of House seats when the statewide vote was split evenly between the parties. The most biased plans proposed by Democrats gave Republicans 68 percent of the seats.","1693","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/upshot/you-cant-draw-unbiased-districts-in-florida-even-if-you-try.html?_r=0"
"In other words, a partisan-blind, or even a Democrat-drawn, districting plan has similar levels of Republican bias to the plan struck down by the court. So while the districts in Florida have substantially more bias than is created in a partisan-blind simulation, the legislature is not completely to blame.","1694","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/upshot/you-cant-draw-unbiased-districts-in-florida-even-if-you-try.html?_r=0"

"Mrs. Clinton may be a primary juggernaut, but she could surely lose to a Republican in November 2016. President Obama’s approval ratings are in the mid-40s, so Mrs. Clinton may not benefit from the party’s incumbency. On paper, the race is more or less a tossup. In such a close contest, it might seem reasonable to argue that Mrs. Clinton’s unfavorable ratings are hugely important.","1882","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"

"Many political scientists go a step further. Whether people have a favorable opinion of presidential candidates is as much about rationalizing a latent partisan preference — shaped by the underlying political and economic fundamentals — as it is about the candidates themselves.

"A good example of this is Mitt Romney, whose ratings fell even lower than Mrs. Clinton’s during the Republican primary. He then faced a variety of attacks about his time at Bain Capital. He damaged himself with his “47 percent” comments. Yet despite it all, his ratings recovered by the 2012 general election. Republican-leaning voters, sure to vote against Mr. Obama, gradually figured out a way to like Mr. Romney. We saw the same thing with another Clinton, William Jefferson, who had even worse favorable ratings than Mrs. Clinton before quickly turning around his image once the 1992 general election began.","1885","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"It’s useful to imagine a counterfactual: What if the economy had been stronger, and George H.W. Bush had had a 60 percent approval rating, on Election Day in 1992? Mr. Clinton wouldn’t have had a chance against those numbers, of course, but Mr. Bush wouldn’t have been running just on his record. He would have attacked Mr. Clinton’s character and he would have maintained a lead in the polls as a media narrative coalesced around a simple explanation: Mr. Clinton, with his weak numbers, was a smooth-talking womanizer who couldn’t be trusted. After his defeat, Mr. Clinton would have been remembered as yet another weak Democratic candidate in the footsteps of Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, fatally damaged before the campaign had even begun, rather than as one of the more talented politicians of our time.","1886","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"For some, this line of thinking offers an uncomfortably deterministic theory about American presidential politics. But it helps explain a lot, such as why favorability ratings can move so much, even when there is relatively little new information about a candidate. It helps explain why, on the other hand, supposed game-changers often seem to have no effect. And it helps explain why, in the end, the polls move toward the fundamentals as the campaign evolves.","1887","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"This doesn’t necessarily mean that Mrs. Clinton is in the clear. The fundamentals are strongest when an incumbent president is on the ballot because the feelings about the president are so strong and firm on either side. Mr. Romney, for instance, might have had a harder time improving his ratings and winning back G.O.P. voters — who disapproved of Mr. Obama — if his opponent had not been Mr. Obama.","1888","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"For this cycle, the fitting analogy might be Al Gore, who started with far weaker favorability ratings than George W. Bush, with the backdrop of Mr. Clinton’s scandals. The economic fundamentals, though, seemed to suggest that Mr. Gore was in line to score a decisive victory. Indeed, the gap between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore’s ratings closed as the race went on in 2000. But Mr. Gore, who like Mrs. Clinton was seeking to make it a third presidential victory in a row for Democrats, fell short.","1889","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"More generally, there have been so few presidential elections in the era of modern polling that it would be a mistake to be too sure that Mrs. Clinton’s image won’t be a factor. In a century, political scientists could easily look back and say, with the help of new data, that favorability ratings can be decisive. For now, it would be unwise to rule it out. We already know that scandals can hurt incumbents in House elections, but it doesn’t come close to dooming them, studies have shown.","1890","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"

"“To be called a sellout in Zimbabwe is to be condemned to death.” This observation delivered with a dry, matter-of-fact tone comes late in the director Camilla Nielsson’s outstanding, unsettling documentary “Democrats,” a film that chronicles recent efforts to put a constitution into place in that country.","NOV. 17, 2015","2132","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/movies/review-democrats-chronicling-politics-in-zimbabwe.html?_r=0"
"Shot over three years, the movie begins with archival footage and on-screen text that do a good job of acclimating viewers who may not be familiar with the political situation in Zimbabwe. Here’s the short version: Since the country gained independence in 1980, it’s been ruled by the autocrat Robert Mugabe. In 2008, compelled by international scrutiny over what many saw as a sham election, Mr. Mugabe was forced to share power with his rival, Morgan Tsvangirai. That situation led to the formation of a committee to draft a constitution that would push the country’s government closer to a Western-style democracy.","2133","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/movies/review-democrats-chronicling-politics-in-zimbabwe.html?_r=0"
"Ms. Nielsson and her crew had exceptional access to the two men steering the constitutional process: Paul Mangwana, representing ZANU-PF, Mr. Mugabe’s party; and Douglas Mwonzora, a representative of the Movement for Democratic Change (M.D.C.). Both men are lawyers, and they each make a great show of being happy warriors, as it were, and approach each other with often deferential friendliness. But an indication of how big a struggle one side faces comes early on. At an outreach session held in a rural province, an unusually large number of citizens proclaim that only the president ought to be permitted to appoint judges.","2134","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/movies/review-democrats-chronicling-politics-in-zimbabwe.html?_r=0"
"What is happening here? Are the Zimbabweans of the old school, veterans of the war that won their country its independence, so flush with nationalist pride that they revere Mr. Mugabe so? Or is the whole process being rigged by Mr. Mugabe’s secret service? Ms. Nielsson’s handling of the events silently stresses that there are no simple answers to those questions.","2135","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/movies/review-democrats-chronicling-politics-in-zimbabwe.html?_r=0"
"The fits and starts of the process put the opposing representatives, both charismatic fellows, through some fascinating changes. Mr. Mwonzora winds up in jail during a particularly crucial point of constitutional drafting, while Mr. Mangwana haplessly finds himself in that dangerous position of being termed a “sellout” later on. Ms. Nielsson’s cameras take us only so far behind the scenes; Mr. Mugabe’s own conference rooms are never entered. But the portrait of passionate people struggling to improve their government is urgent, vivid and satisfactory. Both inspiring and upsetting, “Democrats” is, finally, a film that deserves to be called “necessary.”","2136","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/movies/review-democrats-chronicling-politics-in-zimbabwe.html?_r=0"

"The problem is simple. President Obama’s experience during his first term shows that efforts to find common ground with Republicans are unlikely to be successful. Since then, Mr. Obama has taken a more combative approach, but the results have been similar. Absent the big Democratic majorities of 2009-2010, the party’s legislative agenda has gone nowhere. Democrats can still block Republican proposals, but their own bills are largely dead on arrival in Congress (at least unless dissidents in the G.O.P. undermine the party’s control over that chamber).","2256","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/upshot/democrats-avoid-a-hard-question-how-to-pass-their-proposals.html?_r=0"
"Democrats’ options for changing the status quo are limited. The simplest way that a president can produce legislative change is by taking back the White House from the other party, which makes it possible to enact bills that would otherwise be vetoed. That option, of course, is off the table for Democrats in this election, just as it was for Mr. Obama in his 2012 campaign, when he made the now-disproved claim that his re-election would “break the fever” among Republicans.","2257","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/upshot/democrats-avoid-a-hard-question-how-to-pass-their-proposals.html?_r=0"
"As a result, Democrats will be forced to confront the reality that presidential powers are necessarily limited. It’s easy for candidates to say that they will try harder to use the bully pulpit to win over the public and strong-arm legislators into backing their proposals, but there is little evidence that the presidency actually works that way. The success of a president depends heavily on contextual factors like party strength in Congress and public mood, and neither of those would be expected to be favorable for Democrats in 2017.","2258","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/upshot/democrats-avoid-a-hard-question-how-to-pass-their-proposals.html?_r=0"

Keeping the White House would allow the party to prevent Republicans from rolling back Mr. Obama’s legislative accomplishments; to exercise power via executive action, especially in foreign policy; and to make appointments for any vacancies in an increasingly elderly Supreme Court. But for the most part, those aren’t the arguments that the candidates are making.

Contrary to your assertion, however, the Ennahdha Party, Tunisia’s Islamic democrats, played a significant role in developing what is considered the most progressive constitution in the Arab world.

Yet Mrs. Clinton is completely right about the record: historically, the economy has indeed done better under Democrats.","2700","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/opinion/partisan-growth-gaps.html?_r=0"

"Before I get to those questions, let’s talk about the facts.","2702","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/opinion/partisan-growth-gaps.html?_r=0"
"The arithmetic on partisan differences is actually stunning. Last year the economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson circulated a paper comparing economic performance under Democratic and Republican presidents since 1947. Under Democrats, the economy grew, on average, 4.35 percent per year; under Republicans, only 2.54 percent. Over the whole period, the economy was in recession for 49 quarters; Democrats held the White House during only eight of those quarters.","2703","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/opinion/partisan-growth-gaps.html?_r=0"
"But isn’t the story different for the Obama years? Not as much as you think. Yes, the recovery from the Great Recession of 2007-2009 has been sluggish. Even so, the Obama record compares favorably on a number of indicators with that of George W. Bush. In particular, despite all the talk about job-killing policies, private-sector employment is eight million higher than it was when Barack Obama took office, twice the job gains achieved under his predecessor before the recession struck.","2704","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/opinion/partisan-growth-gaps.html?_r=0"
"Why is the Democratic record so much better? The short answer is that we don’t know.","2705","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/opinion/partisan-growth-gaps.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Blinder and Mr. Watson look at a variety of possible explanations, and find all of them wanting. There’s no indication that the Democratic advantage can be explained by better monetary and fiscal policies. Democrats seem, on average, to have had better luck than Republicans on oil prices and technological progress. Overall, however, the pattern remains mysterious. Certainly no Democratic candidate would be justified in promising dramatically higher growth if elected. And in fact, Democrats never do.","2706","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/opinion/partisan-growth-gaps.html?_r=0"
"Republicans, however, always make such claims: Every candidate with a real chance of getting the G.O.P. nomination is claiming that his tax plan would produce a huge growth surge — a claim that has no basis in historical experience. Why?","2707","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/opinion/partisan-growth-gaps.html?_r=0"
"Part of the answer is epistemic closure: modern conservatives generally live in a bubble into which inconvenient facts can’t penetrate. One constantly hears assertions that Ronald Reagan achieved economic and job growth never matched before or since, when the reality is that Bill Clinton surpassed him on both measures. Right-wing news media trumpet the economic disappointments of the Obama years, while hardly ever mentioning the good news. So the myth of conservative economic superiority goes unchallenged.","2708","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/opinion/partisan-growth-gaps.html?_r=0"
"Beyond that, however, Republicans need to promise economic miracles as a way to sell policies that overwhelmingly favor the donor class.","2709","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/opinion/partisan-growth-gaps.html?_r=0"
"It would be nice, for variety’s sake, if even one major G.O.P. candidate would come out against big tax cuts for the 1 percent. But none have, and all of the major players have called for cuts that would subtract trillions from revenue. To make up for this lost revenue, it would be necessary to make sharp cuts in big programs — that is, in Social Security and/or Medicare.","2710","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/opinion/partisan-growth-gaps.html?_r=0"
"But Americans overwhelmingly believe that the wealthy pay less than their fair share of taxes, and even Republicans are closely divided on the issue. And the public wants to see Social Security expanded, not cut. So how can a politician sell the tax-cut agenda? The answer is, by promising those miracles, by insisting that tax cuts on high incomes would both pay for themselves and produce wonderful economic gains.","2711","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/opinion/partisan-growth-gaps.html?_r=0"
"Hence the asymmetry between the parties. Democrats can afford to be cautious in their economic promises precisely because their policies can be sold on their merits.

And they were more likely than the Democrats to point fingers at one another — and to attack their leading candidate, Donald J. Trump — while finding fault with President Obama and his policies.","3016","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/us/politics/even-the-issues-are-in-debate-in-2016-race.html?_r=0"
"“The Democrats are looking ahead toward tomorrow and trying to determine what we should do, while the Republicans are looking at today and talking about what’s wrong,” said Ben Barnes, a Texas Democrat and major party donor. “There are understandable reasons for both. But the debates give off a feeling of deep division that isn’t healthy for a strong country.”","3017","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/us/politics/even-the-issues-are-in-debate-in-2016-race.html?_r=0"
"Frank Luntz, a Republican strategist who conducted focus groups during the debates, said that his participants, from both parties, shared “a concurrent feeling of helplessness and the desire to have an impact on the presidential race and the country’s future.” He said Republicans were more critical of one another.","3018","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/us/politics/even-the-issues-are-in-debate-in-2016-race.html?_r=0"

"Tony Kushner, whose screenplay about an earlier American divide earned him an Oscar nomination for the 2012 film “Lincoln,” said the bellicose language and anti-establishment themes at the Republican debates — that government is bad and elected officials are suspect — put the country “in a very perilous place,” because the candidates appeared to be abandoning policy making and governing.","3020","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/us/politics/even-the-issues-are-in-debate-in-2016-race.html?_r=0"
"“Lincoln was effective in explaining war and sacrifice to Americans because of the lawyerly structure of his thought, the pithiness and clarity and wit and measured cadences of his pronouncements, and the lack of any kind of inflammatory rhetoric,” Mr. Kushner said.","3021","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/us/politics/even-the-issues-are-in-debate-in-2016-race.html?_r=0"
