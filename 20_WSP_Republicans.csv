"It’s safe to say that no president in modern times has had his legitimacy questioned by the opposition party as much as Barack Obama. But as his term in office enters its final phase, Republicans are embarking on an entirely new enterprise: They have decided that as long as he holds the office of the presidency, it’s no longer necessary to respect the office itself.","March 9","1","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/09/republicans-are-beginning-to-act-as-though-barack-obama-isnt-even-the-president/"

"It’s one thing to criticize the administration’s actions, or try to impede them through the legislative process. But to directly communicate with a foreign power in order to undermine ongoing negotiations? That is appalling. And just imagine what those same Republicans would have said if Democratic senators had tried such a thing when George W. Bush was president.","3","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/09/republicans-are-beginning-to-act-as-though-barack-obama-isnt-even-the-president/"
"The only direct precedent I can think of for this occurred in 1968, when as a presidential candidate Richard Nixon secretly communicated with the government of South Vietnam in an attempt to scuttle peace negotiations the Johnson administration was engaged in. It worked: those negotiations failed, and the war dragged on for another seven years. Many people are convinced that what Nixon did was an act of treason; at the very least it was a clear violation of the Logan Act, which prohibits American citizens from communicating with foreign governments to conduct their own foreign policy.","4","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/09/republicans-are-beginning-to-act-as-though-barack-obama-isnt-even-the-president/"
"This move by Republicans is not quite at that level. As Dan Drezner wrote, “I don’t think an open letter from members of the legislative branch quite rises to Logan Act violations, but if there’s ever a trolling amendment to the Logan Act, this would qualify,” and at least it’s out in the open. But it makes clear that they believe that when they disagree with an administration policy, they can act as though Barack Obama isn’t even the president of the United States.","5","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/09/republicans-are-beginning-to-act-as-though-barack-obama-isnt-even-the-president/"
"And it isn’t just in foreign affairs. In an op-ed last week in the Lexington Herald-Leader, Mitch McConnell urged states to refuse to comply with proposed rules on greenhouse gas emissions from the Environmental Protection Agency. Never mind that agency regulations like these have the force of law, and the Supreme Court has upheld the EPA’s responsibility under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon emissions — if you don’t like the law, just act as though it doesn’t apply to you. “I can’t recall a majority leader calling on states to disobey the law,” said Barbara Boxer, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, “and I’ve been here almost 24 years.”","6","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/09/republicans-are-beginning-to-act-as-though-barack-obama-isnt-even-the-president/"
"The American political system runs according to a whole series of norms, many of which we don’t notice until they’re violated. For instance, the Speaker of the House can invite a foreign leader to address Congress for the sole purpose of criticizing the administration, and he can even do it without letting the White House know in advance. There’s no law against it. But doing so violates a norm not only of simple respect and courtesy, but one that says that the exercise of foreign policy belongs to the administration. Congress can advise, criticize, and legislate to shape it, but if they simply take it upon themselves to make their own foreign policy, they’ve gone too far.","7","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/09/republicans-are-beginning-to-act-as-though-barack-obama-isnt-even-the-president/"
"But as has happened so many times before, Republicans seem to have concluded that there is one set of rules and norms that apply in ordinary times, and an entirely different set that applies when Barack Obama is the president. You no longer need to show the president even a modicum of respect. You can tell states to ignore the law. You can sabotage delicate negotiations with a hostile foreign power by communicating directly with that power.","8","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/09/republicans-are-beginning-to-act-as-though-barack-obama-isnt-even-the-president/"

"The 14th Amendment, King told the panel, “did not contemplate that anyone who would sneak into the United States and have a baby would have automatic citizenship conferred on them.” Added King, “I’d suggest it’s our job here in this Congress to decide who will be citizens, not someone in a foreign country that can sneak into the United States and have a baby and then go home with the birth certificate.”","14","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/house-republicans-try-to-gut-a-key-constitutional-principle/2015/04/29/a365c4c4-eeb6-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html"
"It’s no small task to undo a principle, enshrined in the Constitution and upheld by the Supreme Court, that defines the United States as a nation of immigrants.

"Judiciary Committee Republicans brought in three experts to testify in support of this extraordinary maneuver (a lone Democratic witness was opposed), and they evidently had to search far and wide for people who would take this view, because they ended up with a bizarre witness: an octogenarian professor from the University of Texas named Lino Graglia.","16","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/house-republicans-try-to-gut-a-key-constitutional-principle/2015/04/29/a365c4c4-eeb6-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html"
"This would be the Lino Graglia who caused a furor in 1997 when he said that Latinos and African Americans are “not academically competitive with whites” and come from a “culture that seems not to encourage achievement.” He also said at the time that “I don’t know that it’s good for whites to be with the lower classes.”","17","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/house-republicans-try-to-gut-a-key-constitutional-principle/2015/04/29/a365c4c4-eeb6-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html"
"This is also the same Lino Graglia who said in a 2012 interview that black and Hispanic children are less “academically competent” than white children, and he attributed the academic gap to the “deleterious experience” of being reared by single mothers.

"At the birthright hearing, King got things going by informing his colleagues that “birth tourism has grown substantially” and that it costs $48,000 for a Chinese national to fly to the United States, have her baby, get a birth certificate and take the child back to China.

"A second rebuttal is that the estate tax weakens investment and economic growth. “The estate tax is a tax on capital,” writes Harvard economist Greg Mankiw, who served in the administration of President George W. Bush, in a blog post. Repealing the estate tax “would stimulate growth and raise incomes for everyone.” If so, the effect would be minuscule. An economic simulation by analysts at the conservative Heritage Foundation estimated that eliminating the estate tax would create 18,000 private-sector jobs and increase spending by $46 billion over 10 years. Even accepting these figures at face value, they are rounding errors in a $17 trillion economy with 148 million workers.","117","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-estate-tax-folly/2015/04/26/9ef6ebca-eaba-11e4-9767-6276fc9b0ada_story.html"

"Liberals want to redistribute wealth aggressively by lowering exemptions and raising rates. These ambitions face obstacles. It’s doubtful the tax would be extended downward to where it would affect sizable numbers of Americans, including many small-business owners. Americans dislike government tampering with parents’ desire to leave something for their children. This may help explain why, in many opinion surveys, majorities would reduce or end the estate tax, even though they don’t pay it directly.","119","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-estate-tax-folly/2015/04/26/9ef6ebca-eaba-11e4-9767-6276fc9b0ada_story.html"

"For their part, conservatives’ case for ending the estate tax runs afoul of Americans’ distaste for hereditary aristocracy. Economic success should be earned, not bestowed. Huge intergenerational wealth transfers violate that principle. Today’s estate tax is a confusing compromise of conflicting impulses, between parents’ solicitude for children and a suspicion of passed-down wealth.","121","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-estate-tax-folly/2015/04/26/9ef6ebca-eaba-11e4-9767-6276fc9b0ada_story.html"

"Yesterday, the House voted to repeal the estate tax, apparently in the belief that the American public needed a reminder that the Republican Party is the party of the wealthy. I’ll get to why the arguments they make about this issue are either problematic or just factually wrong (depending on which argument you’re talking about), but as a political decision, holding this vote seems rather foolish. They know that even if they got the 60 votes they would need to overcome a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, President Obama would likely veto the bill.

"The answer can be found in the parable of the scorpion and the frog, which you probably know. The scorpion asks the frog for a ride across the river; the frog says, “But you’ll sting me.” The scorpion replies, “Why would I do that? If I sting you then we both drown.” The frog agrees, and midway across the river the scorpion stings the frog. As they begin to sink to their deaths, the frog says, “Why did you do that?” The scorpion answers, “It’s my nature.”","134","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/17/why-are-republicans-pushing-estate-tax-repeal-its-their-nature/"
"In this case, the frog is the eventual GOP presidential nominee, and the scorpion is congressional Republicans. At a time when everyone is talking about income inequality and stagnant wages, the nominee will want to convince voters that he understands their concerns and will find ways to improve their lot. Meanwhile, his congressional allies are trying to make sure Donald Trump’s kids don’t have to pay taxes.","135","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/17/why-are-republicans-pushing-estate-tax-repeal-its-their-nature/"
"It isn’t that the estate tax is incredibly popular, because it isn’t. If you ask people in a poll whether they think it ought to be repealed, a majority will say yes. (I discussed some reasons why here.) But this isn’t a problem because voters will be angry at Republicans for trying to repeal the tax, it’s a problem because it demonstrates what Republican priorities are, in exactly the way they don’t want. You can bet that Hillary Clinton will contrast her economic plans with those of Republicans, who want to cut upper-income rates, as well as taxes on investments and inheritances. This is a concrete demonstration of what she’ll talk about.","136","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/17/why-are-republicans-pushing-estate-tax-repeal-its-their-nature/"
"Republicans say that they aren’t really trying to help wealthy heirs; instead, this is motivated by their deep concern for the fate of family farms and small businesses. But today, the first $5.43 million of any estate is exempt from taxes. That’s the single most important fact to understand about this tax.","137","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/17/why-are-republicans-pushing-estate-tax-repeal-its-their-nature/"
"And what about those family farms Republicans are always talking about, the ones that are constantly being sold off to pay the estate taxes? They’re a myth. When The Post’s fact-checker Glenn Kessler was doing his estate tax fact check, he asked the office of John Thune, the sponsor of the Senate version of repeal, about the farms we keep hearing about. “Thune’s staff conceded that they could not identify a single farm that had been sold because of the estate tax, but they said some farms had to sell acreage in order to pay the tax.” Nobody else seems to be able to find one, either. You’ll notice that when Republicans talk about this, they always posit a hypothetical family farm being sold off and not “My constituents the Millers had to sell off their farm,” because the Millers are the equivalent of a unicorn. According to the Department of Agriculture, in 2013 only .6 percent — or 1 in 167 — of the estates of farmers who died owed any estate tax at all.","138","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/17/why-are-republicans-pushing-estate-tax-repeal-its-their-nature/"
"Because of that large exemption, currently at $5.43 million, the numbers for all estates are even smaller. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, “In 2013, the most recent year for which final numbers are available, there were 2.6 million deaths in the United States, and 4,700 estate tax returns reporting some tax liability were filed. Thus, taxable estate tax returns represented approximately one-fifth of one percent of deaths in 2013.”","139","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/17/why-are-republicans-pushing-estate-tax-repeal-its-their-nature/"
"That’s 1 in every 553 estates that owed any tax. Which does make you wonder why repealing the estate tax is an issue of such terrible urgency to Republicans. You’d think that if they were smarter, they’d say to themselves, “We want to do this eventually, but it isn’t going to happen with a Democrat in the White House. And we won’t get a Republican president unless we show the voters we care about ordinary people. So let’s just put this off until 2017.” But if there’s just one wealthy heir out there who might have to pay some tax on his inheritance, and heaven forbid decide to get a Porsche instead of a Ferrari next year, then that’s an injustice they simply can’t ignore. Politics might dictate otherwise, but Republicans can’t help themselves.

"On Wednesday and Thursday, senators took several votes on how they view climate science. Republicans couldn’t dodge the issue with vapid rhetorical evasions, such as “I’m not a scientist.” Nor could they simply grant that climate change is occurring without taking a position on why. Ninety-eight senators voted for that least-common-denominator proposition, but then they had to clarify what they meant in subsequent votes.

"In fact, three potential 2016 GOP presidential candidates sided with scientists — to at least some degree — this week. In addition to the votes of Graham and Paul, Mitt Romney said this on Wednesday: “I’m one of those Republicans who thinks we are getting warmer and that we contribute to that.” (h/t National Journal).

"But there is no question about the logical implications of their positions. If more than half the Senate believes that climate change is real and human-influenced, then more than half the Senate should be working on a policy response. If there is a risk, even one senators see as uncertain, a rational government would hedge against it. And any free-marketer worth her passing Economics 101 grade knows that the efficient way to deal with externalities such as carbon dioxide emissions is to set a price on them, through a carbon tax or similar policy.

"Immediately after Republicans gained control of the U.S. Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, incoming majority leader Mitch McConnell pledged that “there will be no government shutdowns” on his watch. Yet the newly unified Republican Congress took less than two months to force a standoff with the Obama administration over appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security, due to Republican demands that funding be made contingent upon a reversal of Obama’s executive actions on immigrants.","March 10","241","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/10/more-proof-that-republicans-are-from-mars-and-democrats-are-from-venus/"
"In what has become a familiar series of events, a bloc of conservatives pushed the congressional Republican Party into a procedural confrontation despite the risk that this could produce a damaging backlash. The showdown ended after 75 House Republicans joined with Democrats on March 3 to approve a bill funding DHS without restrictions over the opposition of more than two-thirds of the majority party — another increasingly common outcome. With Congress facing the exhaustion of the Highway Trust Fund in May, the need to raise the federal debt ceiling by the fall and the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30, more governing crises are possible, and maybe even probable.","242","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/10/more-proof-that-republicans-are-from-mars-and-democrats-are-from-venus/"
"The repeated pattern of threatened shutdowns is hardly accidental. Republican officeholders’ proclivity for confrontation reflects the distinct preferences of Republicans in the public. As the graph below illustrates, a consistent majority of Republicans in the mass electorate admire politicians “who stick to their principles” more than those “who make compromises,” while most Democrats hold the opposite view. This partisan gap prevailed even when Republicans held the White House.","243","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/10/more-proof-that-republicans-are-from-mars-and-democrats-are-from-venus/"
"In a new study published in Perspectives on Politics (ungated), we find that this difference is one manifestation of a broader and more enduring asymmetry between the parties. The Republican Party, we argue, is best understood as the agent of an ideological movement dedicated to advancing the cause of conservatism. Republican activists and voters are united by their devotion to limited government and consistently seek a more conservative and uncompromising party.","244","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/10/more-proof-that-republicans-are-from-mars-and-democrats-are-from-venus/"
"The Democratic Party, in contrast, is best understood as a coalition of social groups seeking various forms of government action. Most Democratic supporters in the mass public are attracted to the party for reasons of group interest or identity rather than a devotion to the principles of liberalism. Democratic leaders face a strong incentive to govern pragmatically in order to deliver concrete programs and benefits to their partisan constituencies. The extended network of Democratic Party elites is largely populated by single-issue activists and representatives of discrete groups, as compared to the more comprehensively ideological actors who lead the GOP.","245","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/10/more-proof-that-republicans-are-from-mars-and-democrats-are-from-venus/"
"When voters are asked what they like and dislike about the two major parties, Republicans often give ideologically-oriented answers to these open-ended questions — describing their own party, for example, as “conservative” or “for smaller government” while characterizing the opposition Democrats as “socialistic” or “wanting the government to run everything.” Democratic identifiers, in contrast, characteristically speak in terms of group interest, viewing their own party as “having concern for the middle class,” “working to help women” and so forth, in contrast with a Republican Party that “looks out for the rich” or “stands for older white folks.” The graph below demonstrates the strong relationship between citizens’ own party identification and their propensity for either ideological or group-oriented conceptions of the parties.","246","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/10/more-proof-that-republicans-are-from-mars-and-democrats-are-from-venus/"
"This asymmetry is reinforced by the contours of American public opinion, which tends to be right-of-center in terms of how people self-reported their ideology and their support for limited government in the abstract — but simultaneously left-leaning on more specific issues such as spending on popular domestic programs. Republican politicians are therefore rewarded by both their partisan base and the public at large when they emphasize broad themes such as reducing the size and role of government in general. Democratic politicians are rewarded when they focus their attention on individual issues and policies designed to benefit particular mass constituencies.","247","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/10/more-proof-that-republicans-are-from-mars-and-democrats-are-from-venus/"
"Our research shows that these differences extend to the activist and donor bases of each party and are even reflected in party platforms and opinion columns. Republicans have been more ideologically unified and motivated than Democrats for at least 50 years. Given this foundational asymmetry, it is hardly surprising that the Republican Party is particularly susceptible to powerful internal movements pursuing greater ideological purity.","248","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/10/more-proof-that-republicans-are-from-mars-and-democrats-are-from-venus/"
"The asymmetric nature of the parties is likely to shape the 2016 presidential nomination contests. As long as presumptive favorite Hillary Clinton retains strong support among the social groups that constitute the Democratic electoral base — such as racial minorities, single women, union members and non-Christians — she has little reason to fear a serious intraparty challenge from the ideological left, despite the efforts of a few liberal activists to coax an alternative candidate, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, into the race. The Republican presidential field, in contrast, will likely be dominated by multiple candidates who each claim the mantle of true conservatism.","249","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/10/more-proof-that-republicans-are-from-mars-and-democrats-are-from-venus/"
"In the meantime, Republican leaders in the House and Senate will seek to satisfy the increasingly stringent demands of their party’s activist base through procedural warfare and vehement public expressions of opposition to Obama’s policies. Democratic supporters prize the substantive achievements of pragmatic lawmaking but the Republican base insists that party officials display repeated commitment to ideological principles. To satisfy these demands, Republicans in Congress have come to prefer confrontation, even when it ultimately results in defeat. Making sense of contemporary government requires understanding the distinct goals of each party base.","250","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/10/more-proof-that-republicans-are-from-mars-and-democrats-are-from-venus/"

"If I were a Republican voter, I wouldn’t be particularly pleased with what my representatives have managed to do so far — in fact, it’s been more like a month-long string of pratfalls than anything else. There was the abortion bill they introduced and then pulled over language concerning rape victims. They did pass the Keystone XL bill, which will be vetoed — and their timing wasn’t great, given that with gas at $2 a gallon, people aren’t feeling a desperate need for Canadian tar sands oil.

"In fairness, with a Democratic president there really isn’t much that a Republican Congress can achieve unless it’s willing to compromise, which this Congress isn’t. But after six years of waiting for the moment they’d take complete control, you’d think they’d have some kind of plan. If they do, it’s hard to discern how it’s supposed to work. Every conflict they have with the president only seems to make them look worse, and they seem to be lurching from day to day with no idea how to do anything but fall on their faces.","257","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/04/is-it-too-early-to-call-the-new-gop-congress-a-failure/"
"Ironically, the Republicans had a lot more power when they were in the minority than they do now. With a Democratic Congress, the administration set out an ambitious legislative agenda, which Republicans were able to obstruct and subvert as long as they stayed unified, which they did very well. But once they took control, the administration all but gave up on legislating (apart from unavoidable tasks like passing budgets to keep the government open), which leaves Republicans with no fights to wage apart from the meaningless ones they manage to concoct on their own. And they can’t even figure out how to win those. Winning Congress has put Republicans in a position where they have little choice other than to make things worse.","258","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/04/is-it-too-early-to-call-the-new-gop-congress-a-failure/"
"Nevertheless, there are still 23 months left in this Congress. There will be opportunities for Republicans to make practical gains, and maybe even improve their image along the way. They could come to an agreement with President Obama on infrastructure spending, which everyone used to agree is absolutely necessary. They could make tough but realistic demands on the budget, and pass something that Obama will be willing to sign but still manages to move government’s priorities in the direction they’d like — even if tea partiers call it a betrayal, because tea partiers will call any compromise a betrayal. If the Supreme Court rules in their favor in King v. Burwell and takes insurance subsidies from millions of people, they could be ready with a plan to help them immediately, instead of just celebrating the fact that they successfully made so many Americans’ lives worse.","259","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/04/is-it-too-early-to-call-the-new-gop-congress-a-failure/"

"It’s time for the Republican Congress to start the long, tortured process of creating a budget, and as Alexander Bolton of The Hill reports, now that Paul Ryan has moved from chairing the Budget Committee to running Ways and Means, this version is going to be a little different from recent ones. Specifically, the transformation of Medicare is out:","March 16","262","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/16/congressional-republicans-surrender-on-transforming-medicare/"
"Ryan always got a lot of credit from the chattering class for the wonky forthrightness of his budgets, which did indeed contain many numbers (though they also had plenty of smoke and mirrors). When it came to Medicare in particular, there was a certain courage in Ryan’s proposal, at least in so far as it admitted that what he sought was a radical change in the program. Instead of what it is now — an insurance program — Ryan would change Medicare to essentially a voucher program, where seniors would get a certain amount of money from the government with which they could buy private insurance.","263","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/16/congressional-republicans-surrender-on-transforming-medicare/"
"We don’t have to go into all the dubious assumptions and projections that went into it, but the point is that Ryan’s proposal made seniors very unhappy, because they love their Medicare. And it made Democrats happy, because they could say, quite accurately, that Republicans wanted to end Medicare as we know it and replace it with something that would still bear the name “Medicare” but wouldn’t be the same thing. The potency of this argument can be seen every two years, when Republicans air one ad after another proclaiming their fervent commitment to Medicare, despite the fact that in reality they fought against it when it was created in 1965 and have sought to undermine it ever since. The fact that it’s one of the most successful social programs in American history, works exceedingly well and is tremendously popular only deepens the degree to which they consider it an ideological affront.","264","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/16/congressional-republicans-surrender-on-transforming-medicare/"
"So if Republicans no longer want to talk about voucherizing Medicare (or “premium support,” as they would have it), does that mean they’ve given up the idea? I actually think it does. This doesn’t mean they wouldn’t do it if they could. But they know they can’t, and this is a concession to that reality.","265","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/16/congressional-republicans-surrender-on-transforming-medicare/"
"One of the main reasons Ryan put his voucher proposal down on paper was to start a debate that over time could move opinions and make change possible. But it didn’t work. Maybe he didn’t have enough time, or maybe altering Medicare in this way is just politically impossible and always will be. Either way, once you stop talking about it, you have no chance at all to build support for your position, and that affects your range of options in the future. It isn’t as though a Republican president could get elected, then Congress could just spring an overhaul of Medicare on the public. “Oh, by the way, while we’re cutting taxes and increasing defense spending, we’re also going to turn Medicare into a voucher program.” Not a chance.","266","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/16/congressional-republicans-surrender-on-transforming-medicare/"
"It takes years to prepare the ground for that kind of change.

"Before officially becoming Senate majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told The Post’s Paul Kane that he had a request for the new GOP majority: “Don’t be ‘scary.’ “ “I want the American people to be comfortable with the fact that the Republican House and Senate is a responsible, right-of-center, governing majority,” he said. Across Capitol Hill, the office of House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) put out a press release the day before the new Congress began, promising that “House Republicans have pledged to continue making the American people’s priorities – jobs and the economy – our priorities and are wasting no time getting started.” Seven days later, the bills that House and Senate Republicans have proposed in their first week paint quite a different picture — one of the same old “scary” Republican Party.","January 13","290","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/01/13/republicans-tellingly-scary-first-week-in-congress/"
"Perhaps we should have seen the dearth of new ideas after looking at the three bills touted in Boehner’s press release. The “Hire More Heroes” Act would let businesses hire veterans already covered by Defense Department health-care plans without having them count toward the Affordable Care Act’s rule that businesses with 50 or more employees must offer health insurance. The bill is a fine gesture, but targets a vanishingly small portion of the population. The second — approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline — can be debated on the environmental and energy merits, but studies have found that at most, the pipeline will create only 42,000 short-term jobs (a small percentage of healthy growth over the course of a year) and 50 (yes, fifty) long-term jobs.","291","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/01/13/republicans-tellingly-scary-first-week-in-congress/"
"The third — changing the ACA’s definition of full-time work from 30 hours to 40 hours — is the farthest-reaching and the most destructive. Even conservative policy maven Yuval Levin (who opposes the individual mandate) says “employers are less likely to reduce a worker’s load by 10 hours than by just 1 or 2 to avoid the mandate … So by setting the definition lower, Obamacare’s architects were trying to mitigate the damaging effects of the employer mandate some, and by setting it higher Republicans would be worsening those effects.”","292","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/01/13/republicans-tellingly-scary-first-week-in-congress/"
"And when we look at the more than 200 bills Republican senators and representatives proposed in the first week of the new Congress, an even more depressingly familiar picture of the party emerges. Republicans’ priorities are clear: They want to deregulate the environment, repeal Obamacare and derail the president’s immigration plans. Those were the three most common topics of the bills introduced, along with bills or resolutions to cut spending, force a balanced budget or restrict Obama’s options the next time the United States hits a debt ceiling crisis. Economic packages were almost entirely absent, relegated to secondary reasons for deregulating the environment or repealing Obamacare.","293","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/01/13/republicans-tellingly-scary-first-week-in-congress/"
"And fresh ideas on either immigration or health care are noticeably absent as well. Rep. Steve King’s ObamaCare Repeal Act runs less than 180 words, just long enough to repeal the law with no replacement. Rep. Ted Yoho’s “Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act” just prohibits the president from carrying out his immigration executive order (again offering no replacement plan), which would be a great solution if Congress had any constitutional authority to do that.","294","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/01/13/republicans-tellingly-scary-first-week-in-congress/"

"To some degree, the persistence of the die-hard faction in the Republican Party is hardly surprising; after all, it’s hard to think of many far-right conservatives who lost this past Election Day. But it cannot be a coincidence that a Republican economic agenda is little in evidence at the same time that the economy is growing at its fastest rate in years. As of yet, the party still wants to be seen as making jobs its priority; it just can’t figure out what policies will support that impression. As conservative writer James Pethokoukis says, “It’s not just that Republicans need to offer a positive agenda; they also need one that goes beyond an obsession with deficits and debt and that tackles the everyday concerns of most Americans.” If Mitch McConnell’s dream of a Republican White House and Congress is to come true, the party will have to come up with something fast.","296","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/01/13/republicans-tellingly-scary-first-week-in-congress/"

"Part of the reason Republicans have gained over 900 state legislative seats since Obama became president is that they have a very well-funded infrastructure that focuses only on winning state legislative chambers.

"One reason is the number of Republican senators who are thinking about running for president. Opposition to Obama — rather than any set of ideas, values or principles — is the party’s North Star.

"The Israeli election takes place tomorrow, and there is a real possibility that Benjamin Netanyahu will lose. While the election will be close and the intricate coalition system the country uses leaves lots of room for uncertainty, the final election polls showed Netanyahu’s Likud Party trailing the Labor-led Zionist Union; Netanyahu is even telling his own supporters he could be headed for defeat, which is not something one ordinarily hears from a politician on the eve of an election.","March 16","360","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/16/if-netanyahu-loses-will-republicans-still-be-pro-israel/"
"Here in the United States, that raises an interesting question. In recent years, the Republican Party has elevated “support for Israel” to a level of passion and consensus usually reserved for things such as tax cuts and opposition to abortion rights. But that happened during a string of conservative Israeli governments. If Israel is led by a Labor Party prime minister and begins to change some of its policies, will Republicans decide that “support” is more complicated than they used to think?","361","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/16/if-netanyahu-loses-will-republicans-still-be-pro-israel/"
"It may be hard to remember now, but Israel became a Republican fetish object relatively recently. At times in the past, support for Israel was seen as a liberal cause, but as the Labor Party’s long dominance of the country’s politics faded and policy toward the Palestinians hardened, Republicans became more and more devoted to the country. The real shift probably started in 2001, when Ariel Sharon took over for the last Labor prime minister, Ehud Barak. Since then, the opinions of Democrats and Republicans about Israel have diverged, and the Republican evangelical base has grown intensely interested in the country. These days, one of the first things a freshman Republican member of Congress does is book a trip to the Holy Land (lots of Democrats go, too, it should be said). Mike Huckabee leads regular tours there. Sarah Palin used to brag that she displayed an Israeli flag in her office during her brief tenure as governor of Alaska. Given the rapturous reception he got from GOP members when he came at John Boehner’s invitation to address Congress, Netanyahu could become the 2016 Republican nominee for president in a landslide, if it were possible.","362","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/16/if-netanyahu-loses-will-republicans-still-be-pro-israel/"
"But what you don’t find within the Republican Party when it comes to Israel is anything resembling a debate. As far as Republicans are concerned, Israel is just right; whatever Israel wants to do is right; and whatever Israel asks of the United States is precisely what we should do. The only question is whether you’re “supporting” the country with the proper zeal. Republicans don’t concern themselves much with the lively debates over policy within Israel, because the government is controlled by conservatives (Netanyahu’s Likud Party has ruled since 2001, with an interregnum of control by Kadima, a Likud offshoot). “Support for Israel” just means support for the current Israeli government.","363","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/16/if-netanyahu-loses-will-republicans-still-be-pro-israel/"
"But tomorrow, Republicans could learn that by the standard they’ve been using, most Israelis are insufficiently pro-Israel. And then what? What if a Labor-led government moves toward a two-state solution, or a curtailing of Jewish settlement in the West Bank? And what if those changes are enthusiastically supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton? “Support for Israel” sounds great when the country’s prime minister and a Democratic president regard each other with barely disguised contempt, but things could get complicated.","364","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/16/if-netanyahu-loses-will-republicans-still-be-pro-israel/"
"That might actually force Republicans to think about Israel, and America’s relationship to it, with a little more nuance. They’d have to admit that when they used to say “I support Israel,” what they actually meant was that they support the Likud and its vision for Israel’s future. More broadly, they’d have to acknowledge that one can disagree with what the Israeli government does and still support the country, since that’s the position they would find themselves in. They might even realize that you can take a one-week trip to the country during which you climb Masada and go for a dip in the Sea of Galilee and still not know everything there is to know about the Middle East.","365","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/16/if-netanyahu-loses-will-republicans-still-be-pro-israel/"

"“There is simply no way that Republicans can seem like a modern political party with widespread appeal in the New America unless they adjust to the new reality on at least a few of their long-standing policy positions. . . .

"Expanding on this point at a breakfast with reporters Tuesday hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, Ayres, an adviser to presidential contender Marco Rubio, said: “We are headed to the point where a political candidate who is perceived as anti-gay at the presidential level will never connect with people under 30 years old.”","398","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-self-defeating-stand/2015/03/31/8ffe064c-d7cf-11e4-8103-fa84725dbf9d_story.html"

"As word of Indiana’s new “religious freedom” law began to spread, businesses howled and the state House speaker and Senate president pro tem promised to fix the bill. Pence backed down Tuesday and called for new legislation “that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone.”","400","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-self-defeating-stand/2015/03/31/8ffe064c-d7cf-11e4-8103-fa84725dbf9d_story.html"

"Ayres had come to breakfast to make the overall case that Republicans need to improve their standing among racial minorities if they are to win in 2016 and beyond. If the GOP nominee doesn’t do better than the 17 percent of the non-white vote Mitt Romney got in 2012, he will need 65 percent of the white vote — a feat accomplished only once in modern history: in Ronald Reagan’s 1984 landslide.","403","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-self-defeating-stand/2015/03/31/8ffe064c-d7cf-11e4-8103-fa84725dbf9d_story.html"

"I can see why he’d demur. His book acknowledges the astonishing shift on gay rights. Support for same-sex marriage is now 55 percent, a doubling over 18 years. Fifty-eight percent now think gay relationships are morally acceptable, an 18-point increase from just 2001. As Ayres notes, the shift is “remarkably similar” to the change on interracial marriage, and those opposing gay marriage on religious grounds (the justification Rubio used to support the Indiana law) are using the same argument used against interracial marriage.","407","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-self-defeating-stand/2015/03/31/8ffe064c-d7cf-11e4-8103-fa84725dbf9d_story.html"

"Pence, in his news conference late Tuesday morning, repeated earlier claims that the Indiana law was similar to a federal law signed by Bill Clinton in 1993.

"“It is clearly taught by Jesus the Christ himself,” Walberg preached to members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, “for those of us who believe in him — and I understand and I accept the fact that there are those who don’t — but he said render unto Caesar what’s Caesar’s and God what’s God’s, and I think that’s an important consideration for us on this committee tonight.”","416","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-again-appeal-to-theocracy/2015/04/22/0c82e898-e920-11e4-aae1-d642717d8afa_story.html"
"Claiming Jesus in a political dispute is inflammatory, particularly when you accuse your opponents, as Walberg did, of “a continued attack on religion.” The appeal to theocracy Tuesday night was even more incendiary because it was used to justify a bid to strike down a new District of Columbia law protecting women from workplace discrimination if they receive fertility treatments, use birth control or have abortions.","417","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-again-appeal-to-theocracy/2015/04/22/0c82e898-e920-11e4-aae1-d642717d8afa_story.html"

"The late committee meeting, which ended after 7 p.m., was bound to get little press attention.

"Instead, it was a classic cultural skirmish: Democratic women defended reproductive rights and Republican men defended religious liberty. “This is another example of women being second-class citizens,” said Rep.

"GOP support for Israel has been increasing for some time, while less than 50 percent of Democrats in some polls are sympathetic toward Israel. In short, the gap between Democrats and Republicans has widened because Democrats are less supportive of Israel than ever before. One need only read left-leaning blogs or see what comes out of the left-wing J Street to see that anti-Israel sentiment is surging on the left.

"One contributing factor to the gap is, of course, the shared interests the United States and Israel have in combating jihadist terror. For the president and other liberals, the notion this is a worldwide religious war is hard to admit. They therefore are reduced to calling the perpetrators “extremists” with no context (extreme vegetarians?). For conservatives, who see the global threat of Islamic terrorism quite clearly, they are very much focused on the persecution of Christians and Jews in Arab lands and the rampant anti-Semitism in Europe. They likewise see that the jihadists (Hamas, Hezbollah) are aimed at Israel. So long as Republicans see the Islamic threat more seriously and clearly than Democrats, they will be attuned to the two countries’ shared security interests and more sympathetic toward Israel’s plight.","454","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/03/27/republicans-democrats-and-israel/"

When he and his anonymous advisers blame Israel for the failure of the peace process or make a federal case out of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress, Democrats are obliged to go along. It is also true that Obama’s mismanagement of the entire Middle East has fortified Republicans’ pro-defense identification. They see in Netanyahu a quality the president lacks — moral clarity.","455","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/03/27/republicans-democrats-and-israel/"
"That brings us to two interesting questions. First, with the change of the Senate minority leader, will the presumed heir to the post, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), bring Senate Democrats back to their pro-Israel roots? He fancies himself as a great defender of Israel, but unlike Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), he has rarely crossed the White House, whether it was on giving the stamp of approval to former defense secretary Chuck Hagel (whose many anti-Israel comments surely would have discouraged every prior president from nominating him) or championing sanctions. He has at best been a reluctant follower. We will see, if he gains the top job for Senate Democrats, whether he shows more conviction on the topic.","456","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/03/27/republicans-democrats-and-israel/"
"And finally, the big question remains Hillary Clinton. She has been in lockstep with the president these days. Now, however, this entails a policy that may cease to protect Israel at the United Nations, a frosty relationship with its elected government and an Iran deal that ignores Israel’s interests. So which Clinton will run — the one who shows up periodically at AIPAC conferences to boast of her pro-Israel credentials or the one who is tying herself to Obama’s anti-Israel mast? Stay tuned.","457","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/03/27/republicans-democrats-and-israel/"
"But one thing is clear: There is one party that is very, very pro-Israel and one in which it is perfectly acceptable not to be.

"• Roll back the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid and lay the groundwork for further cuts. All those millions of low-income Americans who got coverage through the expansion are suffering terribly, because “Medicaid’s promises are empty, its goals are unmet, and its dollars are wasted.” House Republicans would liberate them from this oppression by taking away their health insurance. The rest of the program would be block-granted so that states could have “flexibility,” which in practice means the flexibility to dump even more patients from their coverage.","462","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/18/give-house-republicans-credit-for-producing-a-budget-this-cruel/"
"• Repeal the rest of the ACA. The subsidies that have allowed millions of people to afford insurance? Gone. Protection against denials for preexisting conditions? Not anymore.

"At this stage, it isn’t so terrible for their proposals to lack specificity; this part of the budget process is meant to sketch a broad outline, while later legislation will set all the particulars. But let’s give the House Republicans credit. They aren’t shying away from talking about voucherizing Medicare (as their Senate colleagues did), and the rest of the document lays out a virtual war on the poor and middle class.

"Which is as it should be. Sure, the White House is going to criticize it, because the Democrats’ priorities are very different. Now we can have a debate. Should we turn Medicare into a voucher program? Should we toss millions of people off Medicaid and take away the subsidies that allow millions more to afford insurance? Should we cut food stamps and education grants? What are the alternatives? Those are the questions that debate should address, and then the two sides will have to arrive at a budget that incorporates the answers.","470","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/18/give-house-republicans-credit-for-producing-a-budget-this-cruel/"
"A specter is haunting America's super-rich — the specter of progressive taxation.","April 1","471","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/01/republicans-have-a-new-plan-to-cut-taxes-for-the-top-2-percent/"
"Don't worry, though, the Republican Party is manning the barricades against this menace. That's been true for the last 35 years, and it's no less so now. Indeed, the Paul Ryan-led House Ways and Means Committee just symbolically voted to end the estate tax entirely. In other words, to stand in solidarity with the heirs of the top 0.2 percent.","472","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/01/republicans-have-a-new-plan-to-cut-taxes-for-the-top-2-percent/"
"That's how many households pay the estate tax now: 2 out of 1,000. Why so low? Well, the first $5.43 million that an individual or $10.86 million that a couple leaves behind isn't taxed when they pass away. The estate tax, with its 40 percent top rate, only kicks in for anything more than that. And even then, creative accountants and big deductions can shield a lot of the rest from Uncle Sam. So it's important to remember that there's a difference between the top marginal tax rate and the effective tax rate that estates pay. Since the super-rich only owe the estate tax on some of what they own, they actually pay, on average, 16.6 percent of the value of their estate. Republicans like to say that this is still too big a burden on small businesses and family-owned farms, but the reality, as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities points out, is that only 20 of them—in total—owed any estate tax in 2013, and then at just an average rate of 4.9 percent.","473","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/01/republicans-have-a-new-plan-to-cut-taxes-for-the-top-2-percent/"
"But that, Republicans say, is still 4.9 percent or 16.6 percent or however else too much, because they think the estate tax is a double tax. Assets get taxed once as income, the story goes, and then again as part of the estate. So getting rid of the estate tax would supposedly make things fairer, and give the uber-rich even more reason to save—which should, yes, trickle down to everyone else. Hey, it's not like those yachts are going to clean themselves. Now there's a very small amount of truth to this, but only that. Economists estimate that the economy would be slightly—0.1 to 0.6 percent—bigger if there weren't any estate tax, but that assumes that the government would either replace the lost revenue or cut spending. If it didn't, GDP wouldn't go up at all.","474","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/01/republicans-have-a-new-plan-to-cut-taxes-for-the-top-2-percent/"
"The bigger problem, though, is that a lot of times the estate tax isn't a double tax. That's because of a loophole called ""step-up basis"" that lets heirs avoid paying any tax on some capital gains. Here's how it works. Suppose you bought $1 million of stocks that become worth $10 million by the time you pass away. That's a $9 million capital gain you'd owe tax on, which, at the 23.8 percent rate, works out to about $2 million for the IRS. But—here's the magic—you can make that capital gain disappear from the government's point-of-view if you don't sell your stock and leave it to your kids instead. Why? Because the capital gain your heirs are taxed on isn't based on the original price, or basis, you bought it at, but rather the new price that they inherited it at. So, in this case, your kids would only owe taxes, whenever they sell the stock, on any gains above $10 million—and your $9 million gain before that would go untaxed. Now in theory, you could get rid of the estate tax, and, as long as you also got rid of step-up basis, it at least wouldn't be a massive giveaway to the top 0.2 percent. But that's not the Republican plan. They don't want to tax heirs at all: neither an estate tax nor step-up basis. In other words, a $246 billion gift to the Paris Hiltons of the world over the next decade.","475","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/01/republicans-have-a-new-plan-to-cut-taxes-for-the-top-2-percent/"

"Ed Rogers’s piece last week on global warming is timely in a number of respects and worth reading to see how the Republicans, having lost their argument that global warming is not real and man-made, have shifted to a new argument: Global warming may be real, but the solutions cost too much and won’t work anyway. The new Republican argument against doing anything to combat global warming has moved from denial of its existence to despair of its mitigation.

There is, perhaps, no state in our union more vulnerable to global warming’s impacts, which have already begun to threaten Florida’s coasts and aquifers.

"Rogers’s piece is timely, too, because this weekend The Post reported on an ongoing utility-led and Koch brothers-funded effort to stop homeowners from installing solar panels and selling excess energy back to the grid. Solar energy has taken on aspects of a grass-roots movement to free customers from the grip of high fossil-fuel utility bills. Large coal and oil interests are afraid of the trend, so they are working to impose new burdensome regulations and fees to make it much more difficult and expensive to compete with them. Yes, the same people who continually bash Democrats for regulatory overkill are at it themselves.

"Brattin's proposal is part of what Rank laments is a long history of stigmatizing food stamps and welfare programs in America. Ronald Reagan famously told the story of one ""welfare queen"" as though she were representative of the system at large.

"A week ago, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) went on television and proposed abandoning the nuclear deal just reached with Iran and returning to the 2013 interim agreement that started the talks. “What I would suggest is, if you can’t get there with this deal, is to keep the interim deal in place,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” He repeated his idea of “keeping the interim deal in place that’s been fairly successful and have a new crack at it with a new president that doesn’t have the baggage of Obama.”","519","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-and-netanyahus-wildly-inconsistent-opposition-to-an-iran-deal/2015/04/13/ef4957f0-e215-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html"
"It’s a reasonable argument, but it was roundly refuted by . . . Lindsey Graham. In November 2013, he panned the interim deal he now praises as successful. “This still allows 18,000 centrifuges to stay in place, and it basically just suspends construction of the plutonium reactor,” he told CNN, adding: “I’m very worried. . . . This interim deal gives the Iranians $7 billion in cash, and it leaves in place one of the most sophisticated enrichment programs around.”","520","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-and-netanyahus-wildly-inconsistent-opposition-to-an-iran-deal/2015/04/13/ef4957f0-e215-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html"
"At that time, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) was even more alarmed. “I think people are very concerned that the interim deal becomes the norm,” something that would make Iran “a threat to the world,” he said then.

"But just three weeks ago, Corker, now chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CBS’s Bob Schieffer that if Iran talks fail, he’d rely on . . . the very same “Joint Plan of Action” he panned 16 months ago. “Number one, we do have JPOA in place, the interim deal, and it could continue for some time,” he said. “It keeps the existing sanctions in place, although there is some sanctions relief for Iran, okay, but it stays in place for a while.”","522","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-and-netanyahus-wildly-inconsistent-opposition-to-an-iran-deal/2015/04/13/ef4957f0-e215-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html"
"There are plenty of good reasons to be suspicious about the tentative deal the Obama administration and international partners negotiated with Tehran.

"Moshe Yaalon, Israel’s defense minister, wrote in The Post last week: “The choice is not between this bad deal and war. The alternative is a better deal.” This is the same Yaalon who said in February that “every deal that will be signed between the West and this messianic and apocalyptic regime will strike a severe blow to Western and Israeli interests and will allow Iran to become a nuclear threshold state and continue its terror activities.”","524","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-and-netanyahus-wildly-inconsistent-opposition-to-an-iran-deal/2015/04/13/ef4957f0-e215-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html"

"Back in 2012, Netanyahu said the international sanctions regime had been “ineffective” and “hasn’t worked” and had failed to deter Iran’s nuclear progress. Even after the United States and Europe toughened sanctions early in 2012, Netanyahu said that year that there hadn’t been “any impact on Iran’s nuclear weapons program.” He had earlier predicted that sanctions “probably” wouldn’t work at all.","526","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-and-netanyahus-wildly-inconsistent-opposition-to-an-iran-deal/2015/04/13/ef4957f0-e215-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html"

"Sometimes, lawmakers here at home have found themselves contradicted by the facts. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), the author of a letter to Iran’s leaders signed by 47 Republican senators seeking to scuttle nuclear negotiations, asserted that “if Congress does not approve a deal, Congress will not accept a deal.” But that’s not true, historically: The Congressional Research Service found that at least 18,500 international executive agreements had been reached since 1789 (17,300 since 1939) and that only 1,100 treaties have been ratified by Congress.","528","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-and-netanyahus-wildly-inconsistent-opposition-to-an-iran-deal/2015/04/13/ef4957f0-e215-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html"
"More often, lawmakers are at odds with themselves. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who on Monday formally announced his presidential candidacy, complained earlier this year that “too many of our allies and strategic partners see our foreign policy as a riddle and our actions as inconsistent with our rhetoric. They only see movements toward disengagement and feel that we’re overly eager to negotiate a deal with Iran.”","529","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-and-netanyahus-wildly-inconsistent-opposition-to-an-iran-deal/2015/04/13/ef4957f0-e215-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html"
"But as U.S. negotiators completed the Iran framework, with the support of Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, Rubio told the Associated Press that he would “absolutely” rescind the Iran deal — even if it meant defying the very allies he had recently accused Obama of alienating.","530","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-and-netanyahus-wildly-inconsistent-opposition-to-an-iran-deal/2015/04/13/ef4957f0-e215-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html"

"At oral arguments before the Supreme Court yesterday, two of the conservative justices — Samuel Alito and Antonin Scalia — both floated versions of the idea that, if the Court does strike down Obamacare subsidies in three dozen states, it might not be that big a deal, because surely lawmakers would then fix the problem and avert disruptions for millions.","March 5","596","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/05/conservative-justices-if-we-gut-obamacare-republicans-will-fix-it-no-they-wont/"

"Here are the key quotes. After Solicitor General Donald Verrilli claimed that a Court decision against the law would cut off subsidies “immediately,” producing “very significant, very adverse effects” for “millions of people,” Alito suggested that the Court could side with the challengers but delay the ruling “until the end of this tax year.”","598","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/05/conservative-justices-if-we-gut-obamacare-republicans-will-fix-it-no-they-wont/"
"That would mean people would not abruptly lose their subsidies; the suggestion was that if the Court did this, the disruptions might not be immediate, and perhaps somehow contingency plans could come together to soften the blow for those millions of people. Verrilli suggested the Court might have this authority, but disputed whether doing this would actually make much of a difference in practice, because many of the states would be unable to set up exchanges — keeping the subsidies flowing — by the end of the year.","599","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/05/conservative-justices-if-we-gut-obamacare-republicans-will-fix-it-no-they-wont/"

"That was indeed a richly comic moment! But it was also very significant. The conservative Justices implicitly suggested that the consequences of ruling with the challengers — which Scalia himself termed “disastrous,” though there may have been a hint of sarcasm there — are in fact weighing on the Court, and they themselves floated the idea that a legislative fix might mitigate those consequences.","601","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/05/conservative-justices-if-we-gut-obamacare-republicans-will-fix-it-no-they-wont/"
"I don’t pretend to know for certain what motivated the conservative justices to say this stuff. But here’s a guess: The idea that a legislative solution might soften the disruptions could make it easier for Anthony Kennedy (who appeared torn over federalism concerns, particularly in light of the punishment that might be inflicted on states) and/or John Roberts (who seemed at least open to the idea that Chevron deference should be accorded to the government) to rule with the challengers.","602","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/05/conservative-justices-if-we-gut-obamacare-republicans-will-fix-it-no-they-wont/"
"If so, Congressional Republicans have perhaps endeavored to play their own part in this little dance. They, too, want to appear eager to step in to help anyone hurt by an anti-ACA ruling.

"Both plans were devoid of specifics. And what’s more, during oral arguments, the idea (floated by Scalia) that Congress might provide such a contingency plan was basically laughed out of the Court.

"Meanwhile, Alito’s suggestion — that any ruling nixing subsidies could be delayed until the end of the year — seemed designed to sound like a reasonable compromise that might allow public officials time to come up with a contingency plan.","605","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/05/conservative-justices-if-we-gut-obamacare-republicans-will-fix-it-no-they-wont/"
"But here’s the thing: It seems likely that it will only get harder later this year — not easier — for Republicans to fulfill any promise of a backup plan, either on the state or federal level. By then the 2016 GOP presidential primary will be in full swing, and continued Total War resistance to Obamacare — in the form of opposition to any fix that Obama and Democrats will be demanding — could very well emerge as a conservative litmus test. It’s hard to see GOP state lawmakers coming together to create exchanges in many states, and it’s even harder to see consensus forming behind a contingency plan among Congressional Republicans. Indeed, Ted Cruz — who is expected to run for president — is already insisting that any “alternative” in the wake of a Court decision against the ACA must repeal most of the law, the subsidies included.","606","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/05/conservative-justices-if-we-gut-obamacare-republicans-will-fix-it-no-they-wont/"

"But, wait, you say. Texas is ALREADY majority minority by population, and Republicans won overwhelmingly there in 2014. True.

"This is at least somewhat understandable for two reasons: 1) Cruz isn't that well-known nationally to casual followers of politics, and 2) there are a lot of viable potential GOP candidates. This makes it difficult for any one of them to look very strong in early polls, relative to past years when fewer big-name candidates were splitting up the vote.","635","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/23/ted-cruz-is-a-conservative-icon-but-plenty-of-republicans-dont-care-for-him/"
"But Cruz's ballot-test numbers aren't the only ones that don't look great for him -- or perhaps more accurately, aren't as good as you might think. No, you also could make a pretty strong argument that Cruz's take-no-prisoners style (on display during the 2013 government shutdown) has alienated plenty of Republicans, too. And overall, his national brand is a little less sterling than you might think for a supposed conservative hero.","636","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/23/ted-cruz-is-a-conservative-icon-but-plenty-of-republicans-dont-care-for-him/"

"1) An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released this month showed that 38 percent of Republicans said they couldn't see themselves backing Cruz, with 40 percent saying they could support him.

"And the number of Republicans who said they couldn't back Cruz was on par with former Florida governor Jeb Bush (42 percent), former Texas governor Rick Perry (40) and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky (40), all who have much clearer reasons for their detractors -- Bush because of his more moderate positions on immigration and Common Core, Perry because of his disastrous 2012 campaign, and Paul because of his libertarianism and non-interventionist foreign policy.","639","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/23/ted-cruz-is-a-conservative-icon-but-plenty-of-republicans-dont-care-for-him/"
"2) A January poll of the Iowa caucuses from Bloomberg News and the Des Moines Register showed that 20 percent of likely caucus-goers considered Cruz ""too conservative,"" compared with 48 percent who said he was ""about right"" ideologically (others were not sure, and a few curious souls said he was too moderate).

That seems like solid territory, but it's pretty much on par with Louisiana Gov.

"The most curious question all of this raises is: Why? Cruz, while in office for just more than two years, has been a high-profile senator in Washington from Day One, including on some pretty high-profile issues such as the government shutdown and his 21-hour anti-Obamacare filibuster. And his conservative credentials are without compare in today's national GOP.","642","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/23/ted-cruz-is-a-conservative-icon-but-plenty-of-republicans-dont-care-for-him/"
"It's still very early, and Cruz will be introducing himself to many voters who aren't that familiar with him in the coming weeks and months.

"A staggering 54 percent of Republicans said that “Muslim” best described what Obama “believes deep down.” Thirty percent of Republicans answered the way Walker did, by selecting “I don’t know.” Relatively few Republican respondents “take [Obama] at his word,” as Mitch McConnell put it: only 9 percent selected “Christian” to describe what Obama likely believes.","648","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/02/25/scott-walkers-view-of-obamas-religion-makes-him-a-moderate/"

"Previous survey questions about Obama’s religion tend to sound like a pop quiz — such as “do you happen to know the religious faith of Barack Obama?” But by asking “what Obama believes deep down?” I was intentionally granting respondents license to stray from the president’s self-reported Christian faith. This reveals a prevalent willingness to distrust this president or categorize him as “the other” in terms of religion.","652","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/02/25/scott-walkers-view-of-obamas-religion-makes-him-a-moderate/"

"But it should be pointed out that 25 percent and 47 percent of independents in my survey answered “Muslim” and “I don’t know,” respectively, when asked about Obama’s beliefs.

"The White House, emphasizing the point, staged the speech at a DHS campus in Northwest Washington, an old naval facility that occupies one of the highest perches in the city. From here, facing rows of men and women in the uniforms of the Coast Guard, Border Patrol, FEMA and other DHS agencies, Obama unquestionably occupied the high ground as well in his looming fight with Congress.","666","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obama-holds-high-ground-in-budget-fight-with-republicans/2015/02/02/5ccd5270-ab1d-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6_story.html"
"“The work you do hangs in the balance,” Obama said to those assembled, warning Republicans not to “jeopardize our national security over this disagreement” and mocking a claim by a Republican lawmaker that cutting off the department’s funding is “not the end of the world.”","667","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obama-holds-high-ground-in-budget-fight-with-republicans/2015/02/02/5ccd5270-ab1d-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6_story.html"

"This is why Republicans will probably come to regret the showdown they forced with Obama by allowing DHS funding to expire at the end of this month while the rest of the government operates through September. Their argument — that they are happy to fund homeland security as long as it doesn’t include funds to implement Obama’s executive actions on immigration — is unlikely to prevail in public opinion against Obama’s claims that Republicans “jeopardize our national security.” This has echoes of 2002, when President George W.

"Their uphill fight over DHS funding also distracts from Republicans’ budget arguments, where they are in a stronger position.

In three out of the last four presidential elections, the Republican nominee hasn't broken into double digits with black voters.

"Smith is less correct in saying that Republicans have never tried to address African Americans' voting interests. Ken Mehlman, during his time as chairman of the Republican National Committee when George W.

"""By the '70s and into the '80s and '90s, the Democratic Party solidified its gains in the African American community, and we Republicans did not effectively reach out.

"Mehlman spent much of his time as chairman trying to change the perception of the party as unfriendly to black voters, but he struggled mightily to succeed.

"""Radically new approach"" is the key to the analysis above. If Republicans want to begin to compete for the black vote again, it's hard to imagine that a single cycle turnaround -- as Paul suggests -- is even remotely possible. And, while Smith is clearly suggesting something -- all African Americans vote for the 2016 GOP nominee -- that he knows won't happen, the broader problem his comment exposes is this: Black voters, over the course of the past few decades, have become more and more convinced that the Republican Party is not concerned about their views and, in some cases, is actively working against the community's best interests.","715","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/19/stephen-a-smith-wants-all-black-people-to-vote-republican-in-2016-um-ok/"
"What Smith fails to realize is that votes for president are rarely symbolic. People vote for the candidate or the party they believe will look out for them and make it most possible for them to succeed. Black voters don't believe the GOP is that for them, and one election -- no matter who Republicans nominate -- won't change that. What's needed is a long-term commitment to small electoral growth based on policies that appeal to black voters and that begin to change perceptions of what it means to be a Republican.","716","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/19/stephen-a-smith-wants-all-black-people-to-vote-republican-in-2016-um-ok/"
"On Wednesday morning, the GOP-controlled Senate Budget Committee is set to hold a hearing entitled: “The coming crisis: Social Security Disability Trust Fund Insolvency.” The dry bureaucratic language masks the drama inherent in what could prove the first high-profile skirmish in a series of battles that could go a long way towards defining the new GOP Congress: Battles over the future of the safety net.","February 9","717","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/09/republicans-planning-stealth-attack-on-social-security-democrats-fear/"
"To hear Democrats tell it, the hearing represents the first shot from Republicans in what is shaping up as a stealth attack on Social Security. And the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, Senator Bernie Sanders, tells me he intends to use the hearing to frame the stakes in a battle over the program’s future that is only just beginning.","718","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/09/republicans-planning-stealth-attack-on-social-security-democrats-fear/"
"“Republicans have made it clear that they intend to pursue ‘entitlement reform,’ which is code for cutting Social Security and Medicare,” Sanders said in an interview today. “This is their first step forward. Whether they will focus on disability, or cuts in the retirement program, I don’t know. But there’s no question that they intend to push forward and try to cut Social Security.”","719","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/09/republicans-planning-stealth-attack-on-social-security-democrats-fear/"
"The basis for this suggestion is a recent House GOP rules change that would greatly restrict the ability to fund the Social Security Disability Insurance program through a simple reallocation of funds from Social Security’s larger overall retirement fund. The disability fund’s reserves are set to run low in 2016, potentially leading to a steep cut to millions of disabled beneficiaries, sparking a debate over how to replenish it. Republicans have claimed restricting a fund transfer is all about forcing a necessary discussion on how to improve Social Security’s long term finances, rather than merely “kicking the can down the road,” as one GOP lawmaker put it.","720","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/09/republicans-planning-stealth-attack-on-social-security-democrats-fear/"
"But Democrats believe Republicans are exaggerating the sense of crisis to realize one of two political goals. Either they want to force immediate, and unnecessary, cuts to the disability fund — targeting an aspect of the program, after having failed in the past to achieve broader cuts — or they want to hold the disability fund hostage, in order to have another run at cuts to the broader program.","721","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/09/republicans-planning-stealth-attack-on-social-security-democrats-fear/"
"“Republicans are creating a phony crisis,” Sanders says. “They are saying the disability insurance program will be running out of money, and therefore one of two things has to happen: Either we cut disability or we have to look at the solvency of the whole program, to protect disability benefits, which means we’re going to have to cut benefits either through Chained CPI, or raising the retirement age, or through privatization.” Chained CPI is a way of rejiggering indexing to inflation that amounts to a benefits cut.","722","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/09/republicans-planning-stealth-attack-on-social-security-democrats-fear/"
"In other words, Republicans might argue that we mustn’t simply transfer money from the broader program to the disability program, because that might weaken the program for seniors. A recent analysis from the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities concluded that such transfers are routine, have happened 11 times in the past, and that another one right now would be easy to do. “Another reallocation to replenish the DI trust fund wouldn’t threaten seniors, contrary to the rule’s implicit attempt to pit retirement and disability beneficiaries against each other,” the analysis concluded.","723","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/09/republicans-planning-stealth-attack-on-social-security-democrats-fear/"
"Similarly, Senator Sherrod Brown has suggested that Republicans are pursuing a kind of divide-and-conquer strategy against the program: “They want to separate ‘good’ Social Security (retirement security) from ‘bad’ Social Security (disability insurance), to win support for structural reform.”","724","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/09/republicans-planning-stealth-attack-on-social-security-democrats-fear/"
"Fueling such suspicions of an effort to pit seniors against undeserving recipients, Senator Rand Paul stirred controversy when he recently seemed to disparage disability beneficiaries, opining that “over half of the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts.” Politico reported recently that Democrats were further alarmed when discussion at a recent Congressional hearing turned to raising the Social Security retirement age.","725","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/09/republicans-planning-stealth-attack-on-social-security-democrats-fear/"
"But Obama’s new budget includes a simple reallocation of funds, and Democrats are signaling that they are prepared to fight for it. Sanders tells me he will use the coming hearing to try to draw out the factual details of Social Security’s finances and the true motive of Republicans in opposing such a reallocation. Sanders also suggested the politics of the disability fund could get tangled up in the coming effort to negotiate a budget. “What I would like to hear them say is that they will support what has been done on 11 occasions, and that we should be working together to find a long term solution,” said Sanders. “I’m going to make it as clear as I can what the Republican agenda really is.”","726","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/09/republicans-planning-stealth-attack-on-social-security-democrats-fear/"
"When it comes to Social Security’s broader solvency, Sanders favors raising the cap on maximum income hit by the payroll tax to fund the program. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has similarly concluded that its long term finances can be fixed mostly through such reforms.","727","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/09/republicans-planning-stealth-attack-on-social-security-democrats-fear/"
"It’s always possible, of course, that a handful of moderate Democratic Senators could side with Republicans when it comes to efforts to “reform” Disability Insurance (by cutting it), and might oppose efforts to raise taxes on the well-off to preserve the broader program. Pressed on this possibility, Sanders said: “I think it’s fair to say the vast majority of the Democratic caucus will support the president and reallocation.”","728","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/09/republicans-planning-stealth-attack-on-social-security-democrats-fear/"
"Obviously, given GOP control of Congress, the chances of getting long term reforms that involve more revenues are remote to nonexistent. Indeed, more broadly, Republicans are set to propose a budget that purports to achieve balance in 10 years with no new revenues from the wealthy, which would likely require extraordinarily deep cuts to programs that help lower income Americans. Thus, many battles over the safety net lie ahead, and they will be fought mostly on GOP turf. This week’s disability hearing offers a dress rehearsal of sorts.","729","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/09/republicans-planning-stealth-attack-on-social-security-democrats-fear/"

NBC News asked Scott Walker the question directly, and he seemed to reply that he does favor an end to birthright citizenship, though his campaign qualified the statement later. Bobby Jindal tweeted, “We need to end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants.” Then reporters began looking over others’ past statements to see where they stood on this issue, and found that this isn’t an uncommon position among the GOP field.

You can’t end birthright citizenship without repealing it. That means that no matter who gets elected in 2016, birthright citizenship is not going to be eliminated.

"And they may have to improve dramatically.

As a point of comparison, according to exit polls Mitt Romney got 27 percent of Hispanic votes in 2012, while John McCain got 31 percent in 2008. Under a more likely scenario, with an electorate that votes something like in 2012 but with African-American turnout reduced, the Republican would need 47 percent of the Hispanic vote.

"But conservatives revolted, Boehner shelved plans to pursue reform, and Republican leaders and aides quietly assured reporters that the party could always pass reform in 2015, to fix the Latino problem in time for 2016.","945","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/25/dear-republicans-you-could-have-avoided-this-whole-donald-trump-disaster-very-easily/"
"But some Republicans explicitly warned at the time that if the party failed to pass reform in 2014, it would only get harder to do so in 2015, because the GOP primaries would start up. GOP pollster Whit Ayres warned:","946","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/25/dear-republicans-you-could-have-avoided-this-whole-donald-trump-disaster-very-easily/"
"Veteran GOP operative Rob Jesmer similarly warned that if Republicans didn’t embrace reform, “presidential politics will consume our party, which will make it more difficult to get it passed. ” Jesmer added: “We will severely diminish our chances of winning the presidential election in 2016 if this isn’t solved.” And as Jonathan Chait details, some conservative pundits, operating from the same rationale, also called for Republicans to pass “immigration reform as quickly as possible” and take the short term hit from the right, “allowing the base to vent its spleen and make up in time for the presidential campaign.”","947","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/25/dear-republicans-you-could-have-avoided-this-whole-donald-trump-disaster-very-easily/"
"In other words, some Republicans warned at the time that the party needed to embrace reform precisely to avoid the epic slow-motion disaster that might unfold if immigration got tied up in primary politics, creating fertile conditions for a talented demagogue to pull the party further to the right. Which is exactly what is happening now.","948","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/25/dear-republicans-you-could-have-avoided-this-whole-donald-trump-disaster-very-easily/"
"To be fair, it’s hard to know for certain if passing reform then would have led to less fertile soil for Trump-ism to take root later.

"But it’s hardly an unreasonable suggestion. Imagine if House Republicans had simply held a vote on the Senate immigration bill, passing it with a lot of Dems, or had passed their own proposals and entered into conference negotiations that resulted in a bill that included legalization. The resulting measure would have meant enormous new investments in border security that would have carried — and this is a crucial point — bipartisan buy-in. As it is, border apprehensions have been at near record lows, and the flow of illegal immigration has leveled off, so the story Trump is telling is already ludicrous enough. But if Republicans and Democrats had cooperated to invest billions in further militarizing the border, it probably would have been harder still for Trump to tell his tale, and his immigration demagoguery might not have gripped his supporters’ imagination in quite the manner we’re seeing.","950","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/25/dear-republicans-you-could-have-avoided-this-whole-donald-trump-disaster-very-easily/"
"Also, if legalization had passed, Trump would obviously have had a tougher time calling for mass deportations. And at any rate, if Republicans had passed immigration reform, the long term damage Trump-ism (and his rivals gravitating towards his positions) could do to the party among Latinos probably would have been mitigated.","951","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/25/dear-republicans-you-could-have-avoided-this-whole-donald-trump-disaster-very-easily/"
"Obviously foes of legalization will argue that none of the above constitutes a substantive rationale for reform. But it bears repeating that many Republicans support legalization on substantive and even moral grounds. The party has long been split between those who can’t accept legalization under any circumstances (or unless some undefined ideal of border security has been attained first), and those who are willing to enter with Democrats into some kind of compromise that exchanges more border investments for concurrent legalization, under strict conditions. The former group of Republicans got their way. The latter group of Republicans didn’t. They declined to pursue that compromise. Even though they themselves knew that their punt could result in an outcome like the one Trump has bought us today.","952","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/25/dear-republicans-you-could-have-avoided-this-whole-donald-trump-disaster-very-easily/"

"Despite the fatigue one might expect within the American electorate after two terms of a Democratic president, there’s anxiety within Republican ranks that their party may lose the 2016 election.

"Since first winning election with a minority government in 2006, Canada’s Prime Minister, Stephen Harper — leader of the Conservative Party — has reshaped much of the direction of the country, and subsequently won a majority in 2011. Some pollsters are predicting the prime minister will once again sail into another majority government in the October election, though it’s difficult to tell because of Canada’s parliamentary system and three popular parties, as opposed to the two-party U.S. system.","956","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/11/what-canadas-conservatives-can-teach-republicans-about-diversity/"
"How did the Conservatives manage to do this? After all, Canada is a notoriously liberal country, previously led for over 13 years by a liberal government. It’s country famous for its peace-seeking reputation abroad, no death penalty, gun control, universal healthcare, official bilingualism (federal government services are guaranteed in both English and French) and multiculturalism, and home to thousands who avoided the Vietnam-era draft (Canadian forces were not involved in the Vietnam War nor the 2003 Iraq invasion). The reverence the American left has for Canada is reflected by the view of progressives such as filmmaker Michael Moore, whose documentaries portray Canada as a veritable utopia, and who once boasted on Twitter that “Canada’s poverty rate is 40% lower than the U.S.’s.”","957","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/11/what-canadas-conservatives-can-teach-republicans-about-diversity/"
"In part, Harper benefited from timing. A decade ago, the Canadian right became fatigued by years of being shut out of power due to vote splitting between the traditional Progressive Conservative Party and the upstart Reform Party. (Harper had been a key part of the latter.) The two parties merged and with the right united, Harper had to figure out how to appease crucial swing voters who might be put off by his party’s potential to move away from the center and toward the political margins. So he visibly embraced racial and ethnic minorities; this may sound like an obvious approach, but given that he had played such a key role in the Reform Party, it was actually a huge roadblock.","958","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/11/what-canadas-conservatives-can-teach-republicans-about-diversity/"
"Harper first cut his teeth in politics with the Reform Party, which, throughout the 1990s, offered the messages of limited immigration and ending multiculturalism as official policy. Supporters, who sounded a lot like Tea Partiers-in-waiting, often offered up little defense when asked if their views were less about immigration policy and more a xenophobic stance against Canada’s communities of color. This made his proactive campaign to attract racial and ethnic minorities that much more surprising.","959","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/11/what-canadas-conservatives-can-teach-republicans-about-diversity/"
"The Reform Party’s rhetoric was often hostile to non-European immigration and to refugees. Harper began to change the tone by speaking in community halls and houses of worship to majority nonwhite audiences, making the case that their values —conservative, family values — were more aligned with Conservatives than with those of the Liberals or the left-leaning New Democratic Party.","960","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/11/what-canadas-conservatives-can-teach-republicans-about-diversity/"
"“Immigrants have the same values as us,” one of Harper’s senior ministers, Jason Kenney, said in 1994. “We have to talk to them, to convince them,” he told Maclean’s Magazine. Harper reached out to the key demographics of Canadians of Chinese and Indian descent — two communities that are, in effect, voter goldmines in key suburban districts of both Vancouver and Toronto, places where Conservatives had to make inroads.","961","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/11/what-canadas-conservatives-can-teach-republicans-about-diversity/"
"In April of this year, Harper welcomed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a state visit. The two appeared onstage at several rallies where Indian Canadians cheered for the leaders’ statements about new joint economic and cultural ventures. There are 1.2 million Canadians of Indian descent, and in a country of roughly 30 million people, that’s a significant voting bloc. Even Harper’s critics acknowledged this was a coup in terms of wooing the Indian Canadian vote. “Barriers have turned into bridges,” Modi said of his successful visit to Canada.","962","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/11/what-canadas-conservatives-can-teach-republicans-about-diversity/"
"Snatching the mantle of multiculturalism from the Canadian Liberal Party was something once seen as unimaginable. It was Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau who declared that multiculturalism would be official government policy in 1971. Since then, immigrant communities have shown their loyalty by overwhelmingly favoring the moderate Liberal Party at the voting booth. Liberals declared Canada a nation where everyone was welcome. But by reaching out to minority voters and steadfastly reminding them that their values are his, Harper has managed to change that perception.","963","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/11/what-canadas-conservatives-can-teach-republicans-about-diversity/"
"The other key to Harper’s outreach was moving past the issue of same-sex marriage. Harper knew that when members of his own party spoke about gay rights, they usually came across as intolerant and out of touch. But as in the U.S., voters’ discomfort with the idea of same-sex marriage eroded rapidly as a series of lower court decisions and the Liberal government’s eventual championing of same-sex marriage came into effect. Images of gays and lesbians getting married saturated the media as courts and provincial parliaments made the unions a legal reality and thus more accepted in Canadian society.","964","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/11/what-canadas-conservatives-can-teach-republicans-about-diversity/"
"But Harper had his base to contend with, and he had promised them that if elected he would reopen the issue in parliament, and on December 7, 2006, he did. But the move was a shrewd: at that point, his government was still in the minority; he knew that the opposition parties would vote down his motion to reopen the debate on same-sex marriage, and that enough of his own members would dissent, effectively killing the motion. Harper could tell his base that he kept his promise, while simultaneously putting the contentious same-sex marriage issue behind him.","965","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/11/what-canadas-conservatives-can-teach-republicans-about-diversity/"
"Granted, the comparison is imperfect: the U.S. and Canada are different countries, with different conservative voting bases. America has a much more powerful religious right, and the porous U.S.-Mexico border makes the issue of immigrants entering the country illegally much larger.","966","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/11/what-canadas-conservatives-can-teach-republicans-about-diversity/"
"Harper’s success at the polls, however, has allowed him to reshape a country once regarded as staunchly liberal. Since coming to power, he has scrapped a major piece of gun-control legislation (the long-gun registry), pulled Canada out of the Kyoto Protocol (and Canada was in fact one of the architects of that deal), enacted a foreign policy adamantly defensive of Israel, all while making as many Conservative appointments to the Senate and judiciary as possible. By shifting tone, Harper was able to reshape Canada in a Conservative direction.","967","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/11/what-canadas-conservatives-can-teach-republicans-about-diversity/"

"Meanwhile, if anything, Republicans may be moving away from their previously-stated vow to participate in providing a contingency fix to temporarily keep those millions covered. The Hill reports that GOP Rep. Tom Price, the chairman of the House budget committee and a leading conservative, has now come out against any plan to temporarily keep those subsidies going.","1026","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/15/republicans-brace-for-for-glorious-victory-over-obamacare/"

Burwell.","1027","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/15/republicans-brace-for-for-glorious-victory-over-obamacare/"
"In coming out against a temporary subsidies fix, Price appears to be somewhat at odds with other Republicans, such as Rep. Paul Ryan and Senators like Ron Johnson, Orrin Hatch, and John Barrasso, who want to offer some kind of transitional plan for those who would lose subsidies, putting off the fallout until after the election and buying time for Republicans to produce a comprehensive Obamacare alternative.","1028","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/15/republicans-brace-for-for-glorious-victory-over-obamacare/"
"Instead, Price wants to proceed straight to repealing Obamacare and replacing it with his new proposal. The simplified version of Price’s reforms is that it would do away with the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion and the required minimum standards for health plans and the protections for people with preexisting conditions. It would subsidize people’s insurance, but it would replace the current subsidy system, which is based on income, with one based on age. Philip Klein, who has all the details, explains this component of it:","1029","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/15/republicans-brace-for-for-glorious-victory-over-obamacare/"
"Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation tells me that the subsidies in Price’s plan are not necessarily that stingy — for some people, they might equate to what they’d get under Obamacare — but overall, a lot of people would probably get less in subsidies, because they are not set by income. That doesn’t mean those people would necessarily pay more, though, because the nixing of minimum standards might mean lower prices for insurance. Of course, Levitt adds, the insurance might not be as good as it is under Obamacare — this could mean a return to a pre-ACA universe of substandard plans that cover less and possibly carry greater risk of illness-induced financial catastrophe.","1030","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/15/republicans-brace-for-for-glorious-victory-over-obamacare/"
"As for those with pre-existing conditions, Levitt says he doubts an approach such as this one would provide enough funding to states (however it would be paid for) to cover the same numbers of people in that situation that Obamacare does.","1031","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/15/republicans-brace-for-for-glorious-victory-over-obamacare/"
"But in a way, it’s good to have a fleshed out GOP alternative, because it helps clarify the differences between the parties on health reform. GOP reforms would likely translate into lower-quality plans and a coverage expansion that would benefit fewer people. But that would be the tradeoff Republicans would make to achieve their goal of less government spending and interference in the market than that which occurs under Obamacare.","1032","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/15/republicans-brace-for-for-glorious-victory-over-obamacare/"
"The rub is that if somehow we did switch from Obamacare to the Price alternative, there would be vast disruptions, Levitt says. “This would be a complicated set of changes to implement on one-sixth of the economy,” Levitt notes. “Insurers would have to change everything they’re doing. States would have to create high-risk pools. None of that can happen quickly. Changing the system would create disruption, just as Obamacare did when it was first implemented. Without some kind of transition, it’s unclear how you’d get from here to there.”","1033","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/15/republicans-brace-for-for-glorious-victory-over-obamacare/"
"Of course, even if the Court does gut subsidies, the Price alternative isn’t going to happen. Even if Republicans could unite behind the Price plan, or some other alternative, Obama would veto it, and try to pressure Republicans — in Congress and the states — to implement a simple subsidy fix. But the fact that a leading conservative like Price is now opposed to a temporary subsidy patch even on Republicans’ own terms is a reminder that Republicans may prove too divided to accomplish even that.","1034","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/15/republicans-brace-for-for-glorious-victory-over-obamacare/"
"Meanwhile, a Court decision gutting subsidies would force more debate among Republicans over what alternative they can unite behind, if any. More specificity might clarify the contrast between the two parties on what each really wants for reform over the long haul, and while Obamacare continues to poll badly, there’s no particular reason to assume that contrast would benefit Republicans. Indeed, the possibility that the GOP might not unite behind any contingency fix — and beyond that, the disruptions that repeal-and-replace would actually cause, after Republicans widely criticized the disruptions caused by Obamacare — suggest they might be better off if the Court just left the law as is.","1035","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/15/republicans-brace-for-for-glorious-victory-over-obamacare/"

"If you’ve followed the news over the past several days, it’d be easy enough to think that politicians on the right, without exception, are and have been unwavering opponents of fetal tissue research while politicians on the left have callously enabled the sale and donation of fetal tissue for research use.

Indeed, almost every American has benefited, in the form of vaccines for polio, chicken pox and German measles; and research toward treatments for blindness and furthering our understanding of cancer cells. It may shock our sensibilities to hear about fetal “remains” being treated as medical products — GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s campaign was called out in 2012 when Mother Jones reported that he had a business connection with a company called Stericycle that disposed of fetal remains as “medical waste.” Equally disconcerting may be the language used routinely every day to “harvest” (as opposed to “recover”) the hearts and bones from “cadavers” (not “donors” or “the deceased”).","1068","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/04/despite-their-planned-parenthood-outrage-many-republicans-in-congress-once-supported-fetal-tissue-research/"
"But multiple federal advisory commissions have found fetal tissue research ethically acceptable. The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research was asked to study fetal research and in 1975 issued a report, Research on the Fetus, that concluded that the practice was ethically permissible. Despite this, the practice has been caught up in the abortion debate. Unlike our use of organs from deceased adults, opponents have claimed that using fetal remains for medical research makes funders and users “complicit” in the underlying abortion.","1069","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/04/despite-their-planned-parenthood-outrage-many-republicans-in-congress-once-supported-fetal-tissue-research/"
"In the 1980s, while research proceeded in other countries to treat Parkinson’s disease, the Reagan administration rejected a request for NIH support, thus beginning a moratorium on federal funding. President Reagan created a Human Fetal Tissue Transplantation Research Panel to review the research. It concluded that use of the tissue did not encourage ambivalent women to choose abortion, and the panel distinguished the moral analysis of abortion from the moral analysis of using remains for research. Like the earlier advisory committee, this panel found the research to be ethically permissible, provided that the decision to have an abortion was separated from the decision to donate the remains, and that tissue recovery did not affect the safety of the procedure for the woman.","1070","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/04/despite-their-planned-parenthood-outrage-many-republicans-in-congress-once-supported-fetal-tissue-research/"

Those numbers are also pretty high (all of them have lurched rightward on the issue). But Trump’s numbers are highest. Given that he has vowed to carry out the deportation of all the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country, and has said he’ll charge Mexico $100,000 for every one of them, you’d think that might merit a bit of notice.","1082","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/04/morning-plum-large-majority-of-republicans-trusts-donald-trump-on-illegal-immigration/"
"As you regulars know, I think it’s unfair to caricature the views of GOP voters as nothing more than raging xenophobia, as some have done. As I’ve argued — with the help of a GOP pollster — it’s perfectly plausible that GOP voters can be brought around to legalization if they are led through the moral and practical complexities surrounding the problem of the 11 million. Indeed, some polls have shown that surprisingly large numbers of them already do favor some kind of legalization. The CBS poll cited above does, too, which is interesting, given the confidence in Trump on the issue.","1083","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/04/morning-plum-large-majority-of-republicans-trusts-donald-trump-on-illegal-immigration/"
"So it’s possible that large numbers of Republicans are confident in Trump on illegal immigration because he’s speaking effectively to a general sense of dissatisfaction over it, and not because of his actual positions. I don’t claim to fully grasp the source of Trump’s appeal. But the possibility that plenty of Republicans simply agree with his specific pronouncements and positions, such as they are, should at least be entertained. A recent Fox News poll found that 70 percent of Republicans think Trump was basically right in sentiment when he classified immigrants (some, not all! only some!) as drug-dealers and rapists. A recent CNN poll found that 63 percent of Republicans think the focus of immigration policy should be on securing the border and “deporting those already here.”","1084","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/04/morning-plum-large-majority-of-republicans-trusts-donald-trump-on-illegal-immigration/"

"The Republican plans rest on three pillars. First, limit and ultimately eliminate the tax exclusion that allows employers’ contributions to workers’ health insurance not to be subject to income or payroll taxes. Second, subsidize people to buy health insurance individually. Third, allow the interstate sale of insurance. That is, preempt state health insurance regulation to allow insurers to sell plans approved in one state in other states.","1107","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-republicans-health-care-plans-are-bad-deals-for-americans/2015/08/28/5c1ebff4-483d-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"
"The vast majority of health economists and health policy experts agree that the tax exclusion is a bad policy. It represents the single largest tax deduction in the United States, valued at more than $250 billion a year — more than three times the value of the mortgage deduction. The tax exclusion also incentivizes the over-purchase of health insurance. Because a dollar in health insurance is worth more than a dollar in added wages — the insurance is tax-free — Americans, and especially unions, have opted to have their employers give them more and more insurance, while wages have stagnated. The exclusion also contributes to higher health-care inflation.","1108","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-republicans-health-care-plans-are-bad-deals-for-americans/2015/08/28/5c1ebff4-483d-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"
"But if the tax exclusion is eliminated, then many employers will terminate their health coverage for workers and many Americans will have to buy their own insurance. Here is the rub: Most Americans cannot afford to buy their own health insurance. Hence, they need government subsidies.","1109","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-republicans-health-care-plans-are-bad-deals-for-americans/2015/08/28/5c1ebff4-483d-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"

"One, Republican subsidies are too meager. Years ago, Stanford economist Vic Fuchs and I proposed eliminating the tax exclusion and combining all health-care spending to give Americans a voucher equivalent to the premium for a basic health package.","1111","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-republicans-health-care-plans-are-bad-deals-for-americans/2015/08/28/5c1ebff4-483d-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"
"But Republicans give far less. In 2008, McCain proposed subsidizing each family $5,000 toward the purchase of health insurance. A few days ago, Walker proposed that subsidies be age-based, as opposed to the Affordable Care Act’s income-based subsidies. For a family of four with parents ages 35 to 49 and two children under 18, the subsidies would be $6,000. (Rubio’s plan did not disclose his level of subsidies.)","1112","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-republicans-health-care-plans-are-bad-deals-for-americans/2015/08/28/5c1ebff4-483d-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"
"Last year, the average cost of employer-based health insurance in the United States was about $16,800. This means with $6,000 in subsidies, an average family would have to come up with $10,800 to afford their old insurance. A less generous silver plan in the exchanges cost $10,776 in Philadelphia, meaning a family would contribute nearly $5,000. With the median U.S. income at $52,000 per year, these premiums constitute up to 20 percent of a family’s pre-tax income. With deductibles and co-pays on top of that, soon a family is paying 25 percent of its income on health care. Unlike the ACA, Walker’s plan does not include annual limits on out-of-pocket expenses and provides no subsidies for co-pays. It doesn’t take an economist to figure out that this is a bad deal for the average American.","1113","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-republicans-health-care-plans-are-bad-deals-for-americans/2015/08/28/5c1ebff4-483d-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"
"The second important detail is: How do the subsidies grow over time? Traditionally, Republicans have tied the increase to the consumer price index (CPI). Because health-care costs and insurance premiums have grown faster than the CPI, over time the subsidies would cover less and less, pushing more and more costs onto Americans. This makes a bad deal even worse.","1114","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-republicans-health-care-plans-are-bad-deals-for-americans/2015/08/28/5c1ebff4-483d-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"
"Finally, it is worth noting that the ACA does permit insurance companies to offer plans across state lines, as long as such states create a joint compact with common regulatory standards to avoid a “race to the bottom” that would allow them to undermine other states’ insurance laws. There has been no significant take-up. Health insurance, like malpractice insurance, remains largely state-regulated and states — as Republicans often emphasize — are closer to their citizens and better able to determine what is good for them than a state insurance agency thousands of miles away with no accountability. Hence, states jealously guard their regulatory prerogatives and rarely are willing to delegate them to other states. This may be one reason that there has not been one multi-state exchange formed.","1115","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-republicans-health-care-plans-are-bad-deals-for-americans/2015/08/28/5c1ebff4-483d-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"

Lindsey Graham (S.C.) called Trump a “jackass,” but others have tended to be gentler.

"The Supreme Court is set to rule on the King v.

"But as Jonathan Cohn reports today, there are not exactly grounds for optimism that Republicans will make good on this promise. “With the clock ticking down to a ruling, it’s gotten awfully hard to take the GOP’s vows seriously,” Cohn writes, adding: “The mere thought of extending Obamacare subsidies — in any form, even temporarily — will run into opposition from more conservative Republicans, particularly those in the House, who want a repeal and nothing more.”","1211","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/11/republicans-want-court-to-gut-obamacare-subsidies-and-dont-want-congressional-fix/"
"Indeed, GOP lawmakers might have another reason not to make good on these promises: Republican voters apparently don’t want them to. A new poll finds that a solid majority of GOP respondents want the Court to nix subsidies — and an even larger majority of Republicans want Congress not to update the law if the Court rules that way.","1212","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/11/republicans-want-court-to-gut-obamacare-subsidies-and-dont-want-congressional-fix/"
"The Associated Press-GFK poll finds that a majority of Americans overall, 56 percent, want the Court to “allow the government to continue subsidizing premiums in all 50 states.” Only 39 percent of Americans want the Court to “limit the government to subsidizing premiums only in states with their own exchanges.”","1213","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/11/republicans-want-court-to-gut-obamacare-subsidies-and-dont-want-congressional-fix/"
"Meanwhile, if the Court does nix subsidies, a slim majority of Americans, 51 percent, want Congress to “update the law” to allow subsidies in all states. Forty-four percent want Congress to leave the law as is and allow states to decide whether to keep subsidies going by setting up exchanges.","1214","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/11/republicans-want-court-to-gut-obamacare-subsidies-and-dont-want-congressional-fix/"
"The good folks over at the AP sent over a partisan breakdown. Fifty-seven percent of Republicans want the Court to limit subsidies only to states with their own exchanges, and if the Court does that, 65 percent of Republicans want Congress to leave the law as is and leave it up to states to make the call on subsidies.","1215","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/11/republicans-want-court-to-gut-obamacare-subsidies-and-dont-want-congressional-fix/"
"But as noted above, majorities of Americans overall want the opposite in both cases, and it turns out that independents lean in that direction, too: 51 percent of them want the Court to keep subsidies in all 50 states; and 50 percent of them want the law updated to keep subsidies going if the Court kills them.","1216","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/11/republicans-want-court-to-gut-obamacare-subsidies-and-dont-want-congressional-fix/"
"And so, it’s perfectly possible that if the Court guts subsidies, it will put Republicans in a bind, in addition to being a terrible outcome for Democrats. GOP voters will want GOP lawmakers to do nothing, but GOP lawmakers may want to create a temporary fix for those losing subsidies, to punt the political fallout among independents and Americans overall until after the 2016 election. Remember, Republicans themselves — see Karl Rove and Senator Ben Sasse — are warning that Democrats will have the upper hand politically if Republicans don’t offer something.","1217","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/11/republicans-want-court-to-gut-obamacare-subsidies-and-dont-want-congressional-fix/"
"As I’ve reported before, one way Republicans may proceed is by offering a temporary fix that also repeals the individual mandate, with the explicit goal of drawing a veto from Obama. This would allow Republicans to at least argue they tried to help the millions who are losing subsidies (thanks to the lawsuit Republicans cheered on), but because Obama is hopelessly addicted to his tyrannical individual mandate, he won’t let them.","1218","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/11/republicans-want-court-to-gut-obamacare-subsidies-and-dont-want-congressional-fix/"

"Such an outcome — individual GOP lawmakers publicly oppose a fix, while privately being okay with it if GOP leaders allow a fix to get through with Dem votes — might also work for GOP governors. Remember, folks like Scott Walker — who might have a particularly difficult political problem on his hands from a Court ruling gutting subsidies — are already telegraphing that they will pressure the federal government to fix the problem, apparently so they don’t have to anger conservatives by setting up exchanges.","1220","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/11/republicans-want-court-to-gut-obamacare-subsidies-and-dont-want-congressional-fix/"

"“The ongoing changes in the demography of the U.S. as a whole, and within key battleground states, are not favorable towards the Republican Party,” McDonald emails. “From the mid-1990s up to the present, the non-Hispanic white share of the electorate dropped ten percentage points.

"There are plenty of caveats. There is the aforementioned historical pattern favoring the non-incumbent party. As Ed Kilgore notes, it is hardly certain that Hillary Clinton will be able to pump up turnout among core Dem voter groups to Obama levels.

After all, it’s possible Clinton could improve on Obama’s performance among whites, even if blue collar white voters continue to back Republicans at high levels. As Ron Brownstein has noted, polls are already showing her outperforming among a key subset, white college-educated women. What’s more, a contrast is developing between Clinton and the Republicans on a number of issues — gay rights, health care, climate change, even possibly a negotiated settlement with Iran — that could help her among college educated whites in general.

Still, for the above reasons, I wouldn’t be all that surprised if GOP establishment types make a huge push for Jeb Bush in the not too distant future. As I’ve noted, Bush, with his Mexican wife, Latino-American kids, and fluency in Spanish, can plausibly argue that only he combines leadership heft with a genuine opportunity to improve the GOP’s cultural appeal to nonwhites.

"Yes, it’s a poor deal in many respects, and the Republicans, and some Democrats, who are criticizing it are right to do so. But this also must be said: Talk is easy, and also cheap. It is the favored medium of members of Congress, particularly those in opposition, and it is the particular specialty of presidential candidates, whose only task is to stir the blood of their followers.","July 16","1319","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-need-to-back-up-their-complaints-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal/2015/07/16/05653928-2b3b-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"Critics of the recent nuclear deal struck between Iran and the United States are entirely right to point out the serious challenge that will now be posed by the Islamic republic. It is an aspiring hegemon in an important region of the world. It is deeply engaged in a region-wide war that encompasses Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, the Gulf States and the Palestinian territories. It subsidizes the murderous but collapsing regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and therefore bears primary responsibility for the growing strength of the Islamic State and other radical jihadist forces in that country and in neighboring Iraq, where it is simultaneously expanding its influence and inflaming sectarian violence. It supports Hezbollah and Hamas, both sitting on the front line against an American ally, both acting as proxies for Iranian influence in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine. If and when Iran gets nuclear weapons, or even becomes a nuclear threshold state, its regional power will be even greater, as will its ability to resist outside pressure.","1320","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-need-to-back-up-their-complaints-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal/2015/07/16/05653928-2b3b-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"This is all true, and it is also not new. The burgeoning challenge posed by Iran has been developing for years. And although the effort to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon has always been important, it has by no means been the only element of a strategy to keep Iranian power in check. Any serious strategy aimed at resisting Iranian hegemony has also required confronting Iran on the several fronts of the Middle East battlefield. In Syria, it has required a determined policy to remove Assad by force, using U.S. air power to provide cover for civilians and create a safe zone for Syrians willing to fight. In Iraq, it has required using American forces to push back and destroy the forces of the Islamic State so that we would not have to rely, de facto, on Iranian power to do the job. Overall, it has required a greater U.S. military commitment to the region, a reversal of both the perceived and the real withdrawal of American power. And therefore it has required a reversal of the downward trend in U.S. defense spending, especially the undoing of the sequestration of defense funds, which has made it harder for the military even to think about addressing these challenges, should it be called upon to do so.","1321","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-need-to-back-up-their-complaints-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal/2015/07/16/05653928-2b3b-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"So the question for Republicans who are rightly warning of the danger posed by Iran is: What have they done to make it possible for the United States to begin to have any strategy for responding? Back in 2013, when President Obama was contemplating launching airstrikes against Assad’s forces in response to his use of chemical weapons, leading Senate Republicans, some now running for president, came out against such action. They were fearful at the time of alienating the anti-interventionist followers of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). They made up excuses about how such action would make U.S. warplanes “al-Qaeda’s air force.” With the exception of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who among the current crop of candidates spoke up in support of what might have been a first crucial step toward pushing Assad, and with him, Iran, out of Syria?","1322","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-need-to-back-up-their-complaints-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal/2015/07/16/05653928-2b3b-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"And what about Iraq? Very few Republicans have been willing to say the obvious: that without a commitment of U.S. ground forces, it will be impossible to drive the Islamic State out, and that without such an effort, the only powers likely to succeed in Iraq will be the Islamic State and Iran.","1323","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-need-to-back-up-their-complaints-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal/2015/07/16/05653928-2b3b-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"Finally, and most important, there is the defense budget. The ability of the United States to do anything about the threats posed in the Middle East dwindles by the day. At a time of growing Chinese power, an aggressive Russia and an increasingly hegemonic Iran, the defense budget continues to be an afterthought, among Republicans as well as Democrats. Efforts this year to lift the sequester caps failed. Even the president’s proposed defense budget was higher than what the Republican Congress has delivered. Despite dire warnings by successive secretaries of defense, successive chairmen of the joint chiefs and other leading men and women in uniform, Congress, controlled in both houses by Republicans, does nothing. The army is about to be forced to cut 40,000 soldiers from its active force , but Republican leaders stand by the sequester.","1324","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-need-to-back-up-their-complaints-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal/2015/07/16/05653928-2b3b-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"So, yes, by all means, rail about the deal. We all look forward to the hours of floor speeches and campaign speeches that lie ahead. But it will be hard to take Republican criticisms seriously unless they start doing the things that are in their power to do to begin to address the challenge.","1325","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-need-to-back-up-their-complaints-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal/2015/07/16/05653928-2b3b-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"

"Republican voters don’t seem to value electability this election cycle. As Donald Trump has maintained (though not increased) his lead for the 2016 Republican nomination, a recent Fox News poll found that only 13 percent of GOP voters said defeating the Democratic nominee was the most important quality in a candidate. Contrast that with four years ago, when poll after poll showed that a solid majority of Republicans valued beating Barack Obama more than anything else. Why the change?","August 21","1364","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/21/why-republicans-dont-care-about-electability-in-2016/"
"Many theorize that the Republican base is simply tired of being asked to choose the most electable candidate. John McCain’s and Mitt Romney’s defeats, as well as the failures of the GOP congressional majorities to come even close to living up to what they promised the right, have left conservatives feeling that, if they are going to fail, they might as well fail with an ideological true believer, someone they love rather than someone they only kind of like. The 2016 GOP field is relatively strong, especially compared with 2012. It’s easier for GOP voters to find a candidate they love so much that it overrides concerns about electability.","1365","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/21/why-republicans-dont-care-about-electability-in-2016/"

"In Trump’s case, backers don’t appear to be sending the message that candidates should be “more conservative” or “more ideological,” but that they want to “change how things are done in Washington.” Polls suggest that Trump doesn’t draw his support from one or two specific candidates, but a few points from almost all of them. It’s much less about the content of the message, and much more about the style with which it is delivered. Whether Trump adopts conservative or moderate policies doesn’t really matter to these voters; they just want him to “Make America Great Again.”","1367","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/21/why-republicans-dont-care-about-electability-in-2016/"
"Republicans are also confident. For months, even non-Fox outlets have been running story after story about Hillary Clinton’s weaknesses. Plus, the party now controls both houses of Congress, and at the state and local level, the GOP looks even stronger. Yes, there are daunting demographic challenges down the road, but in terms of state and federal seats held right now, the GOP is “the strongest it’s been in decades.” If you’re a GOP voter, it’s hard not to think that even a walking combover could, well, trump Clinton.","1368","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/21/why-republicans-dont-care-about-electability-in-2016/"
"The confidence of the base and the disdain for Washington elites suggest that it will be harder for the GOP base to be persuaded to opt for a more electable candidate. That would be a dangerous step for Republicans. The 2016 election will likely be very close. The economy continues to recover, but slowly; the GOP is deeply unpopular, but President Obama’s approval rating (the one number that has been predictive this far out in past elections) remains negative; Clinton has her problems, but almost every GOP candidate has glaring flaws. In such a close race, ignoring electability could come back to hurt Republicans, whether through nominating Trump (however unlikely) or some other almost-as-damaging candidate.","1369","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/21/why-republicans-dont-care-about-electability-in-2016/"

"“The question is what does it look like, and if they don’t have the Republican votes to pass it, then hopefully we can have some influence over what is in that CR,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said last month, referring to the stop-gap spending bill, or continuing resolution (CR), Congress is expected to consider before Sept. 30.","1373","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/23/why-come-fall-republicans-will-need-democrats-on-capitol-hill/"
"Democrats have gained leverage over spending bills in recent years because of the staunch opposition of fiery conservatives, particularly in the House, to supporting spending increases or raising the debt limit without getting something in return, such as budget cuts. The practical result: Republicans end up depending on Democrats to keep funding the government or raise the borrowing limit.","1374","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/23/why-come-fall-republicans-will-need-democrats-on-capitol-hill/"

"House conservatives are already making noise about opposing any bill that funds Planned Parenthood following the recent controversy over the use of tissue from aborted fetuses for research.

"Any one of those items could cost Republican votes. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) will have to calculate just how many GOPers they are willing to lose to avoid a shutdown or debt default by making a deal with Democrats — a process that may be a bitter pill after months of refusing to even consider negotiations.","1379","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/23/why-come-fall-republicans-will-need-democrats-on-capitol-hill/"
"The likely reliance on Democrats also means Republicans will probably have to greatly scale back their efforts to use the appropriations bills to block or defund a slew of Obama administration initiatives, including environmental rules and the effort to renew diplomatic ties with Cuba.","1380","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/23/why-come-fall-republicans-will-need-democrats-on-capitol-hill/"

"But an easy budget deal, as is always the case in Congress, isn’t likely in the offing. Republican and Democratic aides said no formal discussions have taken place since lawmakers left town for the August recess, making it all the more likely that a short-term CR will be necessary to allow time for long-term negotiations.","1382","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/23/why-come-fall-republicans-will-need-democrats-on-capitol-hill/"
"Of course, Republican leaders could decide to appease conservatives and attempt to pass funding bills that deeply cut domestic programs, slash funds for Planned Parenthood and strip dollars from Obamacare.

"Previously, Republican leaders haven’t been able to rely on their most conservative members on year-end spending votes or when increasing the debt limit. For instance, last year 53 House Republicans opposed a short-term CR that kept the government funded into December and then 67 voted against the year-end spending deal or “cromnibus.” On the debt ceiling, 144 House Republicans opposed raising it and ending the government shutdown in 2013 and 199 voted against a debt limit increase in 2014.","1384","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/23/why-come-fall-republicans-will-need-democrats-on-capitol-hill/"
"The path is not much easier in the Senate. Several conservatives, including Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), have pledged to continue their fight to defund Planned Parenthood.

"The 2016 Democratic and Republican presidential nomination campaigns are very different from one another. One race features a front-runner without a strong rival for the nomination. The other includes more major candidates than pollsters will list in their surveys. My new book shows that these campaigns represent distinct paradigms with different patterns of competition and coalition formation, and differences in who makes the critical decisions that nominate presidential candidates. When a dominant front-runner emerges during the invisible primary, there is less competition during the primaries and the critical decisions are made by party insiders and activists before the voters cast their ballots. When party insiders don’t coalesce strongly behind a front-runner during the invisible primary, the critical decisions are made by caucus and primary voters who get to choose among several viable candidates.","May 29","1439","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/29/the-invisible-primaries-of-2016/"
"It is well known that the invisible primary — the year or so before the caucuses and primaries — plays an important part of the nomination process. One study characterizes the invisible primary as a long national discussion among party elites, groups, and activists who try to coordinate among themselves to anoint a presidential nominee even before voting begins in the caucuses and primaries. If enough party elites rally behind a front-runner, that candidate can build a sufficient lead in money, organization, and popular support to prevail in the caucuses and primaries.","1440","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/29/the-invisible-primaries-of-2016/"
"That’s how the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination is unfolding. Hillary Clinton has a host of endorsements by party elites and activists, a growing fundraising operation, and a strong lead in presidential opinion polls. As a result, some would-be candidates are staying out of the race, leaving Clinton to run virtually unopposed. That makes the front-runner’s path to the nomination much easier. In nomination campaigns like this, a rival or two may emerge — but caucuses and primary voters generally support the candidate backed by party elites and group leaders. The main question is whether the front-runner will stumble enough to blow the nomination, which hasn’t happened since Gary Hart’s fall from grace during the invisible primary of 1988.","1441","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/29/the-invisible-primaries-of-2016/"
"The 2016 Republican race, in contrast, shows some serious competition with a lot of candidates, but none with a meaningful plurality of support in opinion polls. As a result, there is little to deter even more politicians like Lindsay Graham from entering the race. With a number of potentially appealing candidates in the race, Republican insiders are undecided and divided about who they will support. Most Republican elites are standing on the sidelines, waiting to see who catches fire before endorsing a candidate. As a result, rank-and-file Republicans lack clear signals about who to support. Such nomination campaigns tend to remain competitive at least through the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, when party activists and a broader population of party identifiers begin to settle the matter. These nominations tend to hinge more on campaign momentum gained or lost during the primaries, rather than the machinations of party insiders during the invisible primary.","1442","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/29/the-invisible-primaries-of-2016/"
"Since 1972, about two-thirds of the presidential nominations have been largely settled by the end of the invisible primary — but one-third have not. Consider the Democratic nominations of 1972, 1976, 1988, 1992, and 2008 and the Republican nominations of 2008 and 2012. As the figure below indicates, competitive nomination races have had a larger number of viable candidates in the primaries, which give these voters a meaningful choice among candidates. There are fewer viable candidates in the primaries when party insiders and party identifiers unify behind a front-runner during the invisible primary. Which of these scenarios emerges in a given election year depends largely on the unity and stability of the political party coalitions and on which candidates decide enter the race.","1443","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/29/the-invisible-primaries-of-2016/"
"The unity of each party’s coalition varies over time. It is easier for party elites to unify behind a front-runner when the party coalition is stable than when the coalition is divided. For instance, Democratic nominations in the 1970s and 1980s were competitive in part because the Democratic Party was more divided as William Mayer has shown. Democrats appear to be more unified in the past twenty years and their presidential nominations have become less competitive. In contrast, Republican nominations from 1980 through 2004 were not competitive. This owes in part to the closing of Republican Party internal divisions during the Ronald Reagan years. Republican presidential nominations are becoming more competitive as party divisions emerged in the aftermath of the Bush years. While Republicans are unified around broad themes of lower deficits, less government, and lower taxes, they differ over policies and priorities. Consider the differences between social conservatives and libertarians, supply-siders and deficit hawks, and between neo-isolationists and hardliners. Reconciling these differences is particularly challenging in a race in which several candidates try to establish themselves by carving out a niche of support from groups in the broader party coalition.","1444","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/29/the-invisible-primaries-of-2016/"
"How much party insiders coalesce behind a front-runner also depends on who enters the race. Party insiders unify much earlier in the invisible primary when their nomination race features a candidate who had a majority lead in public opinion polls taken before the mid-term congressional elections. Hillary Clinton is such a candidate. Many progressive Democrats are not fans of Hillary Clinton, but they will have little choice if Elizabeth Warren does not enter the race. Warren knows that it is a gamble to enter the race against a candidate who already has a substantial bloc of support among party insiders, donors, and identifiers. Democratic nominations have been competitive whenever they have had an expected front-runner who declined to enter the race, such as Ted Kennedy in 1976 or Mario Cuomo in 1992, or who dropped out, as happened with Gary Hart in 1988.","1445","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/29/the-invisible-primaries-of-2016/"
"In comparison, the 2016 Republican race is historic in that Republicans do not have a similarly situated candidate. In almost every presidential nomination race since the 1970s, the Republicans have had a candidate with a large plurality or even a majority in pre-midterm, national opinion polls. Without that clear front-runner, most Republican insiders are waiting to see which candidate gets constituents excited. Could any of the GOP candidates actually win the invisible primary this year? That’s an open question. Nate Cohn wrote that it would be Bush, or no one. Nate Silver and Harry Enten gathered the endorsement data to show just how few endorsements have been made. Campaigns like this can—and often do—take a long time to sort out and typically remain competitive at least through the early caucuses and primaries, when voters begin to separate the winners and losers. One potential caveat: Republican elites may still unify around Jeb Bush who has yet to declare. John Sides and Lynn Vavreck have shown that the choice of party insiders still has an edge in the caucuses and primaries even if most party elites refrain from a public commitment of support.","1446","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/29/the-invisible-primaries-of-2016/"

"The Republican fight against Planned Parenthood's federal funding is not new.

"""We can no longer allow the atrocities committed by an organization that receives state and federal tax dollars, and that receives special tax treatment from the federal government,"" said former Texas governor Rick Perry in a Friday statement.

"Perry has taken the hardest line of any contender. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush has been the most moderate, reacting to the video by calling for a congressional investigation into Planned Parenthood and a review of its funding. It's been easy for his gubernatorial rivals to drive to his right. Gov. Bobby Jindal (R-La.) launched a statewide investigation of the group, leaving some exasperated chapters explaining that they did not perform abortions, and thus had no fetal tissue to donate or talk callously about. Gov. Scott Walker (R-Wis.) boasted that one of his first acts in power was to cut the group's state funding. ""We need to be defunding Planned Parenthood, not only state by state, but I think, across the country,"" Walker told Fox News, a departure from his habit of saying policy fights should be decided locally.","1454","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/31/republicans-compete-to-register-toughest-planned-parenthood-attack/"
"The scramble is even rowdier among the Republicans currently serving on Capitol Hill. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) started the week promoting his bill to defund Planned Parenthood and ended it with a Web ad and video about his battle. ""As a pro-life doctor, Rand Paul cared for premature babies to save their sight,"" says a narrator in the new ad.

"Some in Paul's campaign point to the Planned Parenthood fight as a reason for the senator's steady uptick in a Reuters tracking poll. Paul himself has none-too-subtly compared his guaranteed vote on the bill with Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Tex.) failure to attach it to a must-pass bill. Cruz, who's at home warring with ""the Washington cartel,"" said in a fundraising letter this week that the defeat had only fueled his passion.","1456","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/31/republicans-compete-to-register-toughest-planned-parenthood-attack/"
"""This is a national tragedy, but the liberal media won't treat it as such,"" said Cruz in the letter. ""In fact, the very same people, who after the shootings in Charleston, SC, and Aurora, CO, want to take guns away, will in the same breath support and defend taking away a child's life."" The same day Cruz said that, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) fired off a tweet that asked why the shooting of ""Cecil the Lion"" had sparked more outrage than the Planned Parenthood videos. There wasn't much evidence of that. By week's end, a growing number of congressional Republicans were suggesting that Planned Parenthood funding be stripped in the government funding bill scheduled for after the August recess.","1457","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/31/republicans-compete-to-register-toughest-planned-parenthood-attack/"
"To Democrats, it sounded as though the GOP's presidential candidates were setting up another shutdown fight -- one in the heat of the presidential primary, and one that would turn all attention to Cruz and Paul. Democrats might welcome that. So would the anti-abortion movement, where it's felt that the new sting videos have shifted the national conversation. At the Friday conference in Illinois, Planned Parenthood was discussed as an issue that could win over black voters and millennials. Matt Batzel, the national executive director of the political organizing group American Majority, argued that the right could turn Planned Parenthood into a ""Death Star,"" a villain that all voters could understand.","1458","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/31/republicans-compete-to-register-toughest-planned-parenthood-attack/"

""All American citizens should be protected,"" he later told the paper's reporter.

What if she got the identical 88 percent of the black vote that John Kerry got in 2004, and the Republican nominee in 2016 got the 11 percent George W. Bush won?

"On June 6, Nick Gibb, the Minister for Schools in the newly minted Conservative government of Prime Minister David Cameron, came out as gay.

"The symbolism was powerful: A generation before, Gibb’s party, led by Margaret Thatcher, had systematically demonized lesbian and gay Britons and outlawed the teaching of the “acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship” through the much-reviled Section 28 of the Local Government Act. Now the Tory government had an openly gay man in charge of British schools.","1523","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/18/why-does-the-republican-party-still-oppose-lgbt-rights/"
"Nick Gibb is no anomaly. British voters apparently no longer see sexual orientation or gender identity as relevant politically: The 155 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender candidates who stood in last month’s general election did no worse than their straight colleagues. In fact, in the fifty races where there were competitive LGBT candidates, Tory LGBT candidates performed considerably better; 72 percent had larger vote share increases than the national trend, and on average their gains were three times the Tory average.","1524","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/18/why-does-the-republican-party-still-oppose-lgbt-rights/"
"Gibb’s coming out brings the Tory lesbian, gay and bisexual caucus in the British House of Commons to thirteen, equal in size to the Labour Party LGB group.

"Nor is this a peculiarly British phenomenon. Of the 82 openly LGBT national representatives newly elected around the world over the last five years, one-third have been from right-wing parties, another third have come from left-wing parties, and the remaining third are centrists, greens and nationalists. Right-of-center politicians who identify as LGB are members of parliaments in Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland, and there is likely to be a gay Likud MP in the Israeli Knesset soon.

"In contrast to Europe, LGBT voters in America are overwhelmingly liberal. Three-quarters of self-identified LGBT voters supported Obama in 2012. But the Republicans aren’t losing only those few votes by opposing LGBT rights. Republicans’ antigay agenda limits their ability to reach out to moderates and independents.

"Why is the Republican Party so out of step with voters? Indeed, why is the American right so far behind similar parties in other democracies? The answer may rest on a distinctive idiosyncrasy: the GOP is often beholden to evangelical Christians. “Evangelical” is key in that sentence. Mainline Christians, Catholics and Jews in the U.S. favor LGBT rights; that’s true elsewhere in the world, with Catholics (and Catholic countries) being notable supporters. But evangelicals are a particularly powerful constituency within the Republican Party, and can threaten to “primary” a candidate who does not stay close to their position.","1533","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/18/why-does-the-republican-party-still-oppose-lgbt-rights/"

The truth of the matter then is that the men and woman who want to the be the GOP nominee don't really care all that much about the fiscally conservative/socially moderate Republicans living in the other 48 states.

"That basic dynamic -- with a bit of a twist -- explains what's going on in the growing partisanship among Congressional Republicans too. Two straight decennial redraws of the 435 congressional districts in the country have largely solidified the partisanship of the House seats in the country. That means that the path to Congress for most Republicans (and, to be fair, Democrats) is to make the base happy. Just like at the presidential level, the most conservative voters tend to be the ones who vote in downballot contests -- meaning that if you are seen as the most conservative person in a race, you are very likely to win. The only danger to an incumbent Republican in most of the districts in the country is a primary challenge from their ideological right. Given that, Republican incumbents do everything they can to compile as conservative a voting record as possible while in Congress.","1569","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/03/the-republican-party-is-getting-less-conservative-wait-what/"

Plus, the $114 million Bush has raised is a stunning number that ensures he will be in the race for as long as he wants to be. One note: He still has problems with the GOP base.

Solid majorities of Democrats would favor the use of U.S. troops to participate in an international peacekeeping force if a peace agreement is reached between Israel and the Palestinians (83 percent Democratic leaders, 64 percent of Independent leaders) and if a peace agreement is reached in Syria (61 percent Democratic leaders, 47 percent Independent leaders).

"Taken together, it’s clear that the Republican elite have a greater tolerance for sending troops and drones abroad, as well as arms to Syrian anti-government groups. GOP candidates are already appealing to their base with the philosophy of “might is right.” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) emphasized the importance of continued military strength in a May 13 speech at the Council on Foreign Relation: “When America has the mightiest Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and intelligence community in the world, the result is more peace, not more conflict.” And in an interview with Fox News last month, former governor and expected GOP candidate Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) went on the offensive, stating that, “And the narrative that the left wants to bring which is either you’re for this nuanced view of pulling back and they were leading from behind and that we’re part of the community of nations and blah, blah, blah, that if you don’t believe that, you’re a warmonger, I just reject that out of hand.”","1600","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/08/are-republicans-or-democrats-closer-to-general-american-public-opinion-on-the-middle-east/"
"While these statements might sit well with Republican influentials, they do not dovetail quite so neatly with American public opinion. For the most part, Americans lean toward staying out of conflicts abroad (aside from anti-terrorism efforts and to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon), even in hypotheticals when an ally is attacked. While other polls have shown dissatisfaction with President Obama’s handling of foreign policy, public preferences nevertheless do seem to align with the administration’s general restraint. Moreover, the public’s top priority is to protect American jobs (76 percent of overall public) – which does not register very prominently among either Republican, Democratic or Independent opinion leaders’ radars in this survey.","1601","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/08/are-republicans-or-democrats-closer-to-general-american-public-opinion-on-the-middle-east/"

"Last week, as a sexting scandal overtook the Missouri House of Representatives, state legislators voted on one of the more contentious bills that had come before them this year: A right-to-work law that would prevent unions from collecting fees from workers they represent but who don’t want to pay. Such measures have been sweeping the Midwest, with Wisconsin recently becoming the 25th state in the country to pass one, boding ill for organized labor down the road.","May 20","1603","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/20/the-conservative-case-against-picking-on-unions-courtesy-of-missouri-republicans/"
"The vote was chaotic, with Republicans breaking age-old protocols to end a Democratic filibuster as the end of the session approached. The bill passed, but not by enough to sustain an expected veto by Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, which means the unions averted another setback.

"That’s rare, considering how closely unions have aligned themselves with Democrats over the years. And it’s a consequence of Missouri’s political geography at the moment, with moderate Republicans being elected in fast-growing exurban counties that might be socially conservative but whose residents are still largely members of trade unions. Places, for example, like Jefferson County, home to seven members of the anti-right-to-work GOP contingent.","1605","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/20/the-conservative-case-against-picking-on-unions-courtesy-of-missouri-republicans/"

"It’s certainly true that unions made themselves heard in those districts. State Rep.

"“As I talk with people in our district, a lot of the union members agree with GOP on issues of the second amendment, taxes, and right to life -- but this was a dividing issue for them,” Conway says. “They might be with you on lots of other issues, but if you try and mess with their livelihood, they would not be with you.”","1608","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/20/the-conservative-case-against-picking-on-unions-courtesy-of-missouri-republicans/"

"First: Unions can actually attract employers, because they provide the trained workforce that corporate leaders need to do business.","1610","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/20/the-conservative-case-against-picking-on-unions-courtesy-of-missouri-republicans/"
"“The number one thing that Missouri is missing, that businesses are looking for, is workforce development,” said Rep. John McCaherty (R) during floor debate, citing a poll by the Missouri Chamber of Commerce. “They were looking for trained individuals. You know what they’re looking for training in? Construction. Machinsts. Welders. Our unions are training people to do those jobs. So our answer to that poll is to do away with the people who are doing that work. That’s confusing to me.”","1611","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/20/the-conservative-case-against-picking-on-unions-courtesy-of-missouri-republicans/"
"Although it’s declined over the years, Missouri still has a substantial auto manufacturing industry, as well as electricians, pipefitters, carpenters, and other trades with robust training systems that orient young people who may not have a college degree, but can learn to fix the plumbing.","1612","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/20/the-conservative-case-against-picking-on-unions-courtesy-of-missouri-republicans/"
"The second argument the Republican lawmakers made has do with meddling in other peoples’ choices. There are plenty of non-union shops to work for if you’d rather avoid unions, says Rep. Shane Roden, and nobody’s forcing union members to stick with the representation they have.","1613","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/20/the-conservative-case-against-picking-on-unions-courtesy-of-missouri-republicans/"
"“Any of these organizations, if they feel necessary to go from a closed shop to an open shop, the members can always vote to open that shop up,” says Roden. “That’s up to them. As a conservative, I don’t think we need to be basically sticking our noses into private individuals’ business. It’s a contractual agreement between employer and employee.”","1614","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/20/the-conservative-case-against-picking-on-unions-courtesy-of-missouri-republicans/"
"Finally, conservatives argued that debates over right-to-work legislation -- as contentious as they are -- are a distraction from issues that really need attention, like taxes, education, and infrastructure.","1615","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/20/the-conservative-case-against-picking-on-unions-courtesy-of-missouri-republicans/"
"“We have more problems in this state that need more attention than this by far,” said Rep. Ron Hicks, a former firefighter, during the floor debate. “How about we protect the jobs we already have, Instead of trying to get rid of them. How about we try to build our economy? Let's go back 10, 15 years ago. Small businesses booming, I didn't hear about right to work issue in this state. Why? Because there was enough to go around.”","1616","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/20/the-conservative-case-against-picking-on-unions-courtesy-of-missouri-republicans/"
"And besides, Hicks pointed out, it’s not like unions are a huge threat these days, since they represent only 8.5 percent of the population in Missouri. “Come on. Why are we picking on em?” he asked. “Who’s the bully now?”","1617","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/20/the-conservative-case-against-picking-on-unions-courtesy-of-missouri-republicans/"
"The right-to-work bill is by no means dead in Missouri, with a confluence of increasingly powerful Republicans from rural areas and interest from outside groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council and National Right to Work Committee helping to push it forward. And if a Republican ever wins the Governor’s mansion, as is the case in many states with increasingly conservative legislatures, the unions’ battle is likely lost.","1618","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/20/the-conservative-case-against-picking-on-unions-courtesy-of-missouri-republicans/"

"Barry Goldwater ran in opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Bill, winning only five states outside his home state of Arizona – all of them in the Deep South. In 1968, candidate Richard Nixon garnered a majority of Southern votes by calling for “law and order” against protest and urban uprisings, and by voicing opposition to court-ordered school desegregation plans. Ronald Reagan opened his 1980 campaign in Neshoba County, Miss.–where civil rights workers James Cheney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman had been murdered in 1964–telling voters, “I believe in states’ rights,” widely understood to mean that he, like them, opposed federal action to enforce black civil or voting rights in the South. In 1988 George H.W. Bush’s campaign strategist was Lee Atwater, a South Carolinian infamous for targeting Bush’s Democratic opponent Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis through a series of televised campaign advertisements featuring a convicted black rapist.","1666","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/24/republicans-say-goodbye-to-the-confederate-flag-and-hello-to-a-new-strategy/"
"How has it come to be that Republicans are now turning their backs on the symbol of white southern resistance that was at the center of this strategy in the Goldwater-to-Atwater era? Political scientists have long debated when, why, and how partisan political identities and interests change. They often point to dramatic events or the emergence of crucial new issues as moments that trigger political shifts. But we can also look to slower, more subtle changes in the ideas and commitments of political actors and in the political environment to understand how micropolitics produce broader shifts.","1667","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/24/republicans-say-goodbye-to-the-confederate-flag-and-hello-to-a-new-strategy/"
"What are some of these changes? First, in the 1990s, the Democratic Party also began exploiting white fears for political gain. Bill Clinton strongly supported passage of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, the largest federal anti-crime bill history, which widely expanded federal offenses and put nearly $10 billion toward new prison construction. He also worked to pass the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which dismantled the existing welfare system through instituting lifetime limits for recipients, reducing benefits and enforcing work requirements.","1668","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/24/republicans-say-goodbye-to-the-confederate-flag-and-hello-to-a-new-strategy/"
"Second, Republican leaders in the post-civil rights era included George W. Bush, who acknowledged and apologized for the Southern Strategy while arguing for individualist and market-based forms of black empowerment. As he said at a speech to the NAACP in 2006, “Most of your forefathers didn’t come to this land seeking a better life; most came in chains as the property of other people. Today, their children and grandchildren now have an opportunity to own their own property.” Later, prominent conservative figures like Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed and Fox News commentator Glenn Beck would regularly invoke the Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King, Jr.","1669","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/24/republicans-say-goodbye-to-the-confederate-flag-and-hello-to-a-new-strategy/"

"Broad political shifts emerge from smaller recombinations of political elements. When we look closely, we see the awkward, contradictory language at work which is meant to shift political identifications. Listen to Haley’s statement on the flag: “For many people in our state, the flag stands for traditions that are noble. Traditions of history, of heritage, and of ancestry. At the same time, for many others in South Carolina, the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past.” The state, Haley said, can survive and thrive “while still being home to both of those viewpoints. We do not need to declare a winner and a loser.” Clearly those opposed viewpoints cannot co-exist easily in South Carolina, and just as clearly one of those viewpoints has had a victory.","1672","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/24/republicans-say-goodbye-to-the-confederate-flag-and-hello-to-a-new-strategy/"

Latino voters, the nation's fastest growing racial group with which Republicans must make inroads, overwhelmingly supported Obama's immigration plans.

In 2010, Pew's chief demographer Jeffrey Passel estimated that a full 45 percent of undocumented immigrant adults live in a household with a spouse or children who are U.S. citizens or legal immigrants. These so-called ""mixed status"" families' daily lives are shaped by the threat of deportation.

"Bruce Bartlett, a former Reagan staffer, thinks Fox News is bad for the GOP.","May 27","1726","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/27/a-former-reagan-aide-says-fox-news-is-bad-for-republicans-is-it/"
"In a paper titled ""How Fox News Changed American Media and Political Dynamics,"" Bartlett writes about the rise of Fox and how it has changed the way conservatives consume and think about news and politics. He ended the paper by citing a political scientist who said Fox made it hard for the party to move to the center or increase its appeal.","1727","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/27/a-former-reagan-aide-says-fox-news-is-bad-for-republicans-is-it/"
"Fox News is usually dinged by the left, so when a guy who worked for Reagan (and George H.W. Bush, Ron Paul and Jack Kemp) does it, it's noteworthy. But it's not unheard of. Bartlett cited some anti-Fox comments from noted Republicans in his paper; Newt Gingrich characterized the network as biased during a private meeting in 2012, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Fox made it hard for him to pass immigration reform in 2011, and last year, now-former Sen. Tom Coburn (Okla.) said Fox is ""totally not fair and totally not balanced."" But typically, GOP politicians play nice with the network. It's a no-brainer for politicians courting GOP primary voters. The channel occupies the top of the ratings — not just among cable news channels, which it consistently does, but sometimes all of cable TV. And going on Fox is speaking to the GOP base.","1728","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/27/a-former-reagan-aide-says-fox-news-is-bad-for-republicans-is-it/"
"The media landscape for Republicans that Barlett outlines is pretty bleak. Fox News is a giant that's ruining everything, he argues, but with its audience and reach, you deride it at your own peril. But is it really that serious? Jack Shafer noted for Politico that Fox is ""better at employing presidential candidates than electing them"" (Gingrich, Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee, among others, have all been on the Fox payroll, but none of them have been president). And the network's biggest show, ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" has as many as 3.3 million viewers, which are numbers MSNBC would love to have, but in the context of a voting-age population of more than 234 million, it's less significant.","1729","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/27/a-former-reagan-aide-says-fox-news-is-bad-for-republicans-is-it/"
"But Fox has proven it can influence elections. It went on the air in October 1996, and by June 2000, 17.3 percent of Americans said they watched it regularly. It wasn't available nationwide, so researchers tracked 2000 election results in towns where it was and wasn't available, with controls for demographics and geography. In a study on their findings, published in 2006, the researchers found that Fox had had ""a significant impact"" on the election, and towns where it was available saw anywhere from a 0.4 to 0.7 percent increase in the Republican vote share — or about 200,000 votes nationwide. Its influence was less pronounced in rural areas and Republican congressional districts and the South, which they believed was because voters there already voted Republican, and thus there was a smaller portion of the population that could be persuaded to do so. Towns with more cable channels, and thus more competition for eyeballs, also saw less effect.","1730","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/27/a-former-reagan-aide-says-fox-news-is-bad-for-republicans-is-it/"
"A lot has happened since 2000. Fox News is now a frequent target and running joke for liberal pundits and comedians such as Jon Stewart, and on-air gaffes have become viral Internet mainstays, even when the gaffe is from a local Fox affiliate and not the actual Fox News. (Remember the to-do over ""Fox News Censors Picasso Painting"" story this month? Yeah, that was Fox 5 in New York City, not Roger Ailes's Fox News. See every tweet embedded here and the correction at the bottom.).","1731","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/27/a-former-reagan-aide-says-fox-news-is-bad-for-republicans-is-it/"
"Obviously, there's no way that after all those times Stewart DESTROYED, DEMOLISHED and OWNED Fox that it could sway voters today like it did in 200o, right? Not so fast. A 2014 Pew study found that the network was ""more trusted than distrusted"" by people who identified as in the ideological middle (i.e. neither liberal nor conservative) — something ""The Daily Show"" can't say. And a 2012 Pew study found that a majority of Fox's audience wasn't even Republican; 33 percent identified as independent and 22 percent identified as Democratic.","1732","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/27/a-former-reagan-aide-says-fox-news-is-bad-for-republicans-is-it/"
"Attacks on Fox News tend to target its openly conservative opinion anchors, like Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly, but often left out is the fact that Fox does straight news, too. Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace often take on Republican candidates. The question about whether Jeb Bush would invade Iraq, for example, came from Kelly.","1733","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/27/a-former-reagan-aide-says-fox-news-is-bad-for-republicans-is-it/"
"Without another study, it's hard to gauge exactly how much effect Fox has on our elections — or to evaluate the point raised by Bartlett with any conclusiveness — but there is one point from the 2000 election study that seems relevant today. In the study, Fox News had less of an effect in towns with more cable channels; the more competition for attention, the less weight Fox had.","1734","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/27/a-former-reagan-aide-says-fox-news-is-bad-for-republicans-is-it/"
"Today, Fox News might be in more households, but there's a lot more competition — and not just from cable channels. Its median prime-time viewership has declined since 2009, though it still towers over its competition. The explosion of online new media, and particularly sites targeting conservatives, eats away at the time people might otherwise spend watching Fox.","1735","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/27/a-former-reagan-aide-says-fox-news-is-bad-for-republicans-is-it/"
"The network is different things to different people. For some, it is the media. For others, it's a punchline. For Bartlett, it's an anchor around the GOP's neck, holding it back from expanding the GOP brand to new constituencies. But increasingly, Fox News is one player in a growing conservative media landscape that it pioneered.","1736","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/27/a-former-reagan-aide-says-fox-news-is-bad-for-republicans-is-it/"

"It was the first thing Arthur Laffer, the famed supply side economist and informal adviser to much of the GOP field, brought up in a recent interview about the real estate mogul.

"The trajectory of Gallup’s data over time also suggests no Trump damage; comparing data from daily surveys from July and August, their surveys tracked no significant shifts in favorability for almost any GOP candidate. The exception was Bush, whose net favorability rating actually increased from plus-1 in July (28 percent favorable vs. 27 percent unfavorable) to +22 in August (41 vs. 19). It’s worth noting that most of Gallup’s August interviewing concluded before Bush used the term ""anchor babies"" to describe children of undocumented immigrants, which could undermine his moderate image on the issue.","1842","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/26/no-donald-trump-isnt-hurting-republicans-with-latinos/"

"In addition, other polling shows Hispanics do not immediately ascribe Trump’s comments to the Republican Party more broadly. Shortly after Trump’s comments about immigrants from Mexico being “criminals,” a large survey of Hispanic voters by Univision/Bendixen & Amandi found 61 percent of Hispanics saying Trump’s comments only represent his viewpoint, while 32 percent said they also extend to the Republican Party.

"The Gallup poll is good news for Bush and other Republicans aiming to demonstrate appeal with Hispanic voters, but Romney’s experience in 2012 shows how attitudes in the year before the election can change drastically. Romney’s net favorability rating was +1 among Hispanics across three Post-ABC polls in late 2011, with 49 percent having no opinion -- quite similar to most candidates in Gallup’s poll. By contrast, the 2012 exit poll showed Romney with a -49 rating among Hispanic voters (29 percent favorable, 68 percent unfavorable), which is almost as bad as Trump’s rating today.","1847","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/26/no-donald-trump-isnt-hurting-republicans-with-latinos/"

"Conservatives often insist that it’s pointless to cut climate change-causing greenhouse gas emissions: It would amount to unilateral economic disarmament; China and the rest of the world wouldn’t reduce pollution, instead taking all the emissions-heavy industries that climate regulations squeeze out of the United States. Any emissions cutting we did would therefore be negligible globally.","August 25","1904","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/25/the-sense-in-republican-climate-change-nonsense/"
"This is a poor argument, mostly. Its natural conclusion is that the United States — the world’s leading power, the country that Republicans constantly remind us is indispensable to world order — should do little or nothing in the face of the greatest environmental threat that human society has ever faced. It doesn’t consider the risks of not trying to fight climate change. It doesn’t recognize the fact that the United States is not acting alone; if anything, the Europeans did that for years as we irresponsibly sat by. And it exaggerates the economic costs of clamping down on carbon dioxide emissions.","1905","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/25/the-sense-in-republican-climate-change-nonsense/"
"But there’s still a nugget of wisdom buried in all the nonsense: As world negotiators meet in Paris later this year to construct a global emissions-cutting pact, they must recognize that countries will have incentives to lie and cheat the system, and they must agree on mechanisms to expose emissions-cutting fraud and other types of climate deceit.","1906","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/25/the-sense-in-republican-climate-change-nonsense/"
"A new study in the journal Nature Climate Change (h/t Politico) underscores this crucial point. Swedish researchers found that people in Russia and Ukraine took wanton advantage of a poorly implemented European emissions program. Some got valuable credits for doing things they would have done anyway. Chemical factories ramped up their greenhouse emissions only to get credit for cutting them later. Local overseers could not or did not stop this corruption. The result was higher greenhouse gas emissions from one emissions-cutting program.","1907","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/25/the-sense-in-republican-climate-change-nonsense/"
"Many of the details of this emissions gaming are unique to the system the Europeans set up. But the underlying lesson is a global one: You can’t just assume that various national and subnational officials will comply with their commitments in good faith. The logical reaction is not to throw up our hands and continue changing the atmosphere’s chemistry, regardless of the consequences. The right reaction is to make sure international carbon commitments and policies are believable and, in some way, verifiable.","1908","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/25/the-sense-in-republican-climate-change-nonsense/"
"This will not be easy. The United States and Europeans will probably push hard for some kind of international emissions monitoring, review and verification at the Paris climate talks. But repressive regimes that see transparency as a threat to the state will resist, wrapping themselves in the principle of national sovereignty. At the least, Western powers should use any international climate funding they might promise as leverage. Accountability can’t be a side issue in Paris; it must be woven into the fabric of the whole deal.","1909","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/25/the-sense-in-republican-climate-change-nonsense/"

"Nine million students participated in the $33.7 billion Pell Grant program in the 2013-2014 school year. Although the program is currently running a surplus, that is expected to dry up by 2017.

"The way it works now, a portion of the funding for Pell is mandatory and another portion is discretionary. If the mandatory money is cut, there is no guarantee that Congress would use its discretion to pick up the costs, which could result in the maximum award declining by 15 percent, according to the Committee for Education Funding, an advocacy group.","1914","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/07/how-the-gop-house-republican-takes-aim-at-funding-for-college-students/"

"That income-driven plan, known as Pay As You Earn (PAYE), is part of a suite of repayment options that's supposed to prevent borrowers from defaulting on their loans, a problem faced by about 20 percent of people repaying college debt. It has taken a while for borrowers to warm up to these plans, mainly because so few have known of their existence.

Now more than 2 million borrowers are enrolled.","1920","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/07/how-the-gop-house-republican-takes-aim-at-funding-for-college-students/"

"An analysis by TICAS concludes that the Republican budget could double the student loan payments of borrowers enrolling in PAYE. If someone owing $29,000 in federal student loans and earning $35,000 a year enrolled in the program, for example, that person's initial payment could increase from $145 a month under the current program to $217 a month under the reduced program.","1922","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/07/how-the-gop-house-republican-takes-aim-at-funding-for-college-students/"

"The budget resolution also calls on lawmakers to get rid of Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which forgives any remaining student loan debt for borrowers who work in the public sector for 10 years. Advocacy groups have argued that the program, created in 2007, is an incentive for students to pursue careers, like public interest law or teaching, that serve the public but may not earn a lot of money.

"Graham, a senator from South Carolina and one of umpteen Republicans running for president, can take a joke — which is why he appreciates the absurdity that is the GOP field.

"CBS evidently wasn’t impressed by the importance.

"Thus did Graham try his hand at the presidential announcement game, in which candidates pretend there is some intrigue about their intentions in order to get some precious airtime. Ted Cruz tried for his 15 minutes of fame by holding the first announcement. Marco Rubio drew thousands to Miami’s Freedom Tower. Mike Huckabee brought in aging crooner Tony Orlando but was easily eclipsed by Ben Carson, who had a musical extravaganza and a video putting the candidate in the company of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr.","1939","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-republican-field-is-a-clown-car/2015/05/18/e8234a9e-fd81-11e4-833c-a2de05b6b2a4_story.html"

"Graham has potential to break out of the pack by saying some truly zany things.

"Yes, it’s true that a Washington Post-ABC News poll reported last week that Hillary Clinton’s favorability rating has dipped to 45 percent.

After all, the history of presidential nominations is full of one-time frontrunners who failed to make it all the way.

"The answer is likely to be disappointing to Republicans worried about Trump’s candidacy. Modern American parties are weak by design. Most people might think this is a good thing, since it allows voters the latitude to choose the candidates they like. But the parties’ weakness also means there is no mechanism to prevent a candidate from being considered. Any viable candidate is on the table, and Trump’s wealth and fame make him a viable candidate. The party’s (weak) gatekeepers face serious hurdles if they want to constrain unwanted candidates, particularly one like Trump.","1974","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/08/18/how-does-the-republican-party-solve-a-problem-like-donald-trump/"

"Traditionally, the political actors who could make such decisions were the party bosses, who used to control candidate selection in infamous “smoke-filled rooms” at national conventions. These were power brokers who controlled local party machines. For example, a Democratic boss like Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley had control over the party’s organization in Cook County, Ill. These bosses’ national power came from their ability to mobilize voters (in part, through buying their votes) and their control over which delegates were selected to represent their state at the national convention—and, therefore, which candidate the convention nominated.","1983","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/08/18/how-does-the-republican-party-solve-a-problem-like-donald-trump/"
"The combination of the two (voter mobilization and delegate control) meant that, as long as presidential candidates were selected during unpredictable conventions, these bosses were a force to be reckoned with.

"In 1972, the last of the party bosses were dethroned as gatekeepers. Within the Democratic Party, the McGovern/Fraser committee reformed how convention delegates were selected, so that they were chosen through primaries and caucuses instead of being hand-picked by the bosses. The Republican Party quickly followed this example. With delegates no longer under their control, the last of the traditional party bosses lost their power to winnow out unacceptable candidates.","1986","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/08/18/how-does-the-republican-party-solve-a-problem-like-donald-trump/"

"In recent years, a group of political scientists specializing in the study of political parties (the “UCLA School”) has argued that this partisan gatekeeping has not disappeared entirely. In “The Party Decides: Presidential Nominations Before and After Reform,” these scholars have argued that even in the modern primary system, party elites can control candidate selection by encouraging (or discouraging) candidates to run, and by sending signals to voters as to which candidates they prefer. In this vein, David Karol, one of the co-authors of “The Party Decides,” argued that lack of support from party elites ended Mitt Romney’s ill-fated flirt with another presidential run earlier this year.","1988","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/08/18/how-does-the-republican-party-solve-a-problem-like-donald-trump/"

"Party elites can influence presidential campaigns through endorsements. Trump, however, is already so well known that voters don’t need help forming an opinion. Party elites might ordinarily be able to constrain a candidate by withholding major campaign donations. But Trump’s billions means he doesn’t need Republican kingmakers like the Koch brothers or Sheldon Adelson. Even Fox News–which can be seen as the media arm of the Republican Party–couldn’t stymie Trump during the first Republican primary debate. This may have surprised some commentators, but as Kevin Arceneaux argues, the media–even Fox–cannot simply replace viewers’ perceptions at will. A considerable number of Republican voters have seen a lot of Trump over the last few weeks, and, at least for now, they seem to like what they see.","1991","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/08/18/how-does-the-republican-party-solve-a-problem-like-donald-trump/"
"Trump’s candidacy has perfectly exposed the inherent weaknesses in the design of modern American political parties. In earlier times, party bosses would have easily been able to sidetrack Trump at the national convention. But these bosses are long gone. The RNC, while it is more active now than was in the age of the party bosses, does not have the formal powers to exclude candidates from the party; it can only try to persuade Trump to tone it down.

"This quote gets at what this whole debate is really about. Trump’s comments — he referred to undocumented immigrants as drug dealers and rapists — have been properly condemned by some of the GOP candidates. But as Graham suggests, they are a reminder of a lingering, deeper fundamental difference between the parties that could prove crucial to deciding the Latino vote and the 2016 outcome. Broadly speaking, many Democratic officials think undocumented immigrants have something positive to contribute to American life, and many Republican officials don’t. Or, even if they do, they are just not willing to countenance legally integrating them — because of their previous lawbreaking — under any set of workable conditions.","1998","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/08/morning-plum-trump-gives-republicans-the-immigration-mess-they-could-have-easily-avoided/"

Since then, the GOP has only trooped to the right on immigration, voting to roll back President Obama’s efforts to re-prioritize our deportation policies around the idea that many of these immigrants represent something more than full-blown criminals. The GOP candidates have pledged to do the same, and have retreated to a safe-zone where mere consideration of legalization can only begin if the border is made entirely secure first.","1999","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/08/morning-plum-trump-gives-republicans-the-immigration-mess-they-could-have-easily-avoided/"

"Then came the Supreme Court. Cue more outrage. Chief Justice John Roberts “betrayed” conservatives! Well, conservatives are supposed to believe justices operate free from political preferences. “Established by the state” seemed clear enough to me, but the majority opinion in King v.

"In this I share libertarian legal guru Randy Barnett’s take: “To the extent that [overriding deference to the government’s legislative scheme] – and not genuine textual ambiguity – is what is driving his opinion, then the Chief Justice seems to be telling us that he is once again putting a thumb on the scale for the government here as he did in his solo opinion in NFIB. Rather than assessing the constitutionality of the law as written – or enforcing it according to its terms – the court will rewrite the law to suit the government. And, if the government needs such a thumb on the scale, then this only reinforces my sense that the challengers actually have the better of the argument.”","2106","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/republicans-get-over-the-outrage/"

"As we proceed forward on Obamacare and look ahead to 2016, one can only hope conservatives stop rending their garments. They should instead get to work. Every Republican candidate running for president, we can stipulate, wants to repeal Obamacare. There is no sense in squabbling over who wants it “more.” The real test is not who can dream up the most outlandish names for things and people they don’t like, but who is best able to navigate away from Obamacare toward something better. The former is how a minority party (or radio talk show host) acts; the latter is how a majority proposes to govern.","2108","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/republicans-get-over-the-outrage/"
"For so long the mantra on the conservative side has been “repeal and replace” that pols and pundits became confused. They obsessed on repeal, as if that was a prerequisite for replacement. Actually, once you have a replacement that er . . . well, replaces the old law then the new law prevails. Moreover, with no replacement, all the GOP is left with is silly shutdown stunts. The governing philosophy going forward for conservatives must be “explain and replace.”","2109","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/republicans-get-over-the-outrage/"
"Conservatives have listed all sorts of objectionable provisions and offer loads of constitutional and statutory arguments, but they have fallen short in demonstrating why the law is bad and how in the real world it is adversely affecting people. Whom is it hurting? They need to make the case that it is necessary and urgent to replace Obamacare. In short, they must answer the question: “Why is the president wrong when he says Obamacare is working?” That means finding real-world cases and statistical data to show why in practice the law is bad. Then the task is to find a feasible replacement that avoids the results of the law that conservatives found so harmful. Conservatives’ alternative must offer greater choice, lower costs, fewer taxes, and better health-care outcomes.","2110","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/republicans-get-over-the-outrage/"

"Now that their hopes that the Supreme Court will undo the Affordable Care Act have been so cruelly dashed, Republicans are looking ahead to the future, to see how they might one day smash that vile law to pieces through the legislative process. But there’s a problem: Even if a Republican wins the White House in 2016, Democrats in the Senate will still likely have enough seats to filibuster any attempt to repeal the law. So the answer seems clear: Why not eliminate the filibuster for legislation?","July 1","2114","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/01/republicans-say-they-wont-eliminate-the-filibuster-in-2017-should-we-believe-them/"

"A little history to remind you: When Democrats took control of the Senate in 2006, the number of filibusters increased dramatically, as the minority Republicans realized that there was nothing preventing them from filibustering essentially every bill of any consequence, which is what they proceeded to do throughout the Obama presidency. In November 2013, during a controversy over a group of filibustered nominees, Senate Democrats eliminated the filibuster for most presidential nominees, including Cabinet secretaries and judicial appointees (but not those nominated to the Supreme Court), meaning those nominees could be approved on a simple majority vote. Though this was called the “nuclear option” by everyone, it really wasn’t — the true nuclear option would have been to eliminate the nuclear option entirely, for legislation as well.","2116","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/01/republicans-say-they-wont-eliminate-the-filibuster-in-2017-should-we-believe-them/"
"And that’s what Republicans are now contemplating. The perfectly reasonable point that McConnell and Cruz make is that a filibuster-free Senate is all well and good when you’re in the majority and control the White House, but there will come a day when Democrats have both, and if Republicans can’t use the filibuster then, America will truly become the nightmare of oppression and social decay they’ve been warning about since 2009.","2117","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/01/republicans-say-they-wont-eliminate-the-filibuster-in-2017-should-we-believe-them/"
"Republicans could win the White House but lose the Senate in 2016 — they have to defend 24 seats, while Democrats only have to defend 10 — in which case, it wouldn’t matter (nor would it if they lose the presidential race, of course). But the greater likelihood is that the two will move in tandem, with a good election for Democrats giving them the Senate (or at least significant gains there), and a good election for Republicans keeping it in their hands.","2118","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/01/republicans-say-they-wont-eliminate-the-filibuster-in-2017-should-we-believe-them/"
"As emphatic as McConnell is on this question, it’s one thing to say now that you won’t eliminate the filibuster, when it’s all hypothetical, but consider this scenario. It’s the spring of 2017, just months after Republicans achieved their victory at the polls. President Walker (or Rubio, or Bush) is moving to implement the agenda that he ran on. Republicans in Congress are eager to pass the bills they’ve been fantasizing about for the last eight years. And there’s a full docket of them: tax cuts, a national ban on abortions after the 20th week of a woman’s pregnancy, eliminating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, forbidding the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, lightening Wall Street’s terrible regulatory burden, block granting safety net programs, and, of course, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Yet Democrats and their filibuster stand in the way of it all.","2119","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/01/republicans-say-they-wont-eliminate-the-filibuster-in-2017-should-we-believe-them/"
"It isn’t hard to imagine that the pressure from Republican legislators, the party’s base and a new president eager to make his mark, all of whom would be urging McConnell to get rid of the filibuster, would be overwhelming. After all, once all that legislation is passed and America strides into its glorious new dawn of prosperity and moral uprightness, why would they ever want to elect Democrats again anyway?","2120","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/01/republicans-say-they-wont-eliminate-the-filibuster-in-2017-should-we-believe-them/"
"In the interests of full disclosure, I should note that back in 2013 I predicted that whenever the day came that the GOP had the Senate majority and White House in their hands, they’d destroy the filibuster forthwith. McConnell makes me a little less sure of that today, but there’s no question that on that day the demand for the nuclear option would be intense. There’s one more thing to consider, though. If the Affordable Care Act is going to be the centerpiece of that debate, Republicans may feel something like they did with King v. Burwell — they’d want to repeal it outright at the first possible moment, but they’d also know that doing so would hurt millions of Americans and end up being a political nightmare. So their best option might be to try to repeal the law and fail, then blame the whole thing on the Democrats. Then they could negotiate a partial, piecemeal repeal with Democrats that minimizes the damage to the public.","2121","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/01/republicans-say-they-wont-eliminate-the-filibuster-in-2017-should-we-believe-them/"

"In the wake of House Speaker John A. Boehner’s announced resignation from Congress, there’s been a lot of chatter about how the GOP House caucus has changed since the Ohio Republican was first elected. And as FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver and The Washington Post’s own Christopher Ingraham demonstrate quite clearly with charts, the data is pretty incontrovertible. As Silver notes, “The most conservative Republicans in the House 25 or 30 years ago would be among the most liberal members now.”","September 30","2165","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/30/why-republicans-are-scared-of-everything-and-everyone-right-now/"

"None of this should be a surprise to regular readers of Spoiler Alerts or The Post.

"In the short term, conservative Republicans can rely on the potent theme of how America is changing in unfamiliar ways.

"If there's one thing Republicans can agree on, other than tax cuts being the solution to every economic problem, it's that inflation is a dire threat. Never mind that it's actually lower than we want — with prices growing at just 0.15 percent.","November 10","2177","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"
"During the last debate, Ted Cruz blamed the Federal Reserve's ""loose money"" policies for the fact that ""hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent"" and the ""cost of electricity is going up"" too. The answer, he said, is to focus on ""sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold."" Nobody on stage voiced a disagreement. And why would they? Rand Paul has been saying the same for years. Jeb Bush might not be sure whether going back the gold standard is a good idea, but he has criticized the Fed for ""just printing money like nobody's business."" Marco Rubio has all-but-said the Fed should stop worrying about unemployment and just try to keep inflation under control instead. Chris Christie has warned that ""the extraordinary printing of money that we're doing ... is going to come home to roost."" And Donald Trump and Ben Carson both think the only reason the Fed isn't raising rates right now is that it's trying to help President Obama manage the debt.","2178","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"
"The question, then, is how almost every Republican presidential candidate has ended up embracing a view that, as we'll see, is not only at odds with economics, but also experience itself. And the answer, in large part, seems to be bad history. Republicans seem to either think that everything has gone wrong since the 1930s, or that everything is about to go wrong like it did in the 1970s.","2179","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"
"Take that first group of Cruz and Paul. They want the dollar to always be worth a certain amount of gold, because that would keep the government from printing money or borrowing too much of it. Getting rid of the gold standard was, conservative thinking goes, the first step that let FDR create the modern welfare state, so bringing it back would reverse that. What they don't realize, though, is that it was also the first step that let FDR put people back to work, and without that, it would have taken a lot longer to do so. That's because the Fed was forced to raise rates in 1931, pulling money out of the economy in the process, to preserve the link between the dollar and gold. That helped turn a bad recession into a Great Depression, and it would have done the same if we'd had the gold standard in 2008.","2180","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"
"But even Republicans who don't want to go as far as restoring the gold standard still want to go quite a ways to rein in the Fed. They're worried that all the money it's printed will inevitably turn into inflation, no matter how high unemployment might be. In other words, that we'll get a rerun of that '70s economic show, with runaway inflation despite an economy at a standstill. That's why they want to give the Fed new rules that would prevent it from buying bonds with newly-printed money, aka quantitative easing, like it has the last seven years. That might mean stripping it of its so-called dual mandate targeting low inflation and low unemployment, as new House Speaker Paul Ryan has tried, and giving it just a price stability mandate instead. Or it might mean forcing the Fed to follow a mathematical rule for setting interest rates, and explain itself before Congress like a naughty child if it ever deviates from that. But in any case, the idea is the same: to handcuff the Fed so it can't do as much as it has been.","2181","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"

"It's a funny thing to be worrying about right now. Inflation is lower and the dollar is higher than both of them were when the Fed started printing money in 2008. And there's no reason to expect that to change anytime soon. It's harder for an inflationary spiral to take off today than it was in the 1970s, because workers have lost the bargaining power to demand wage increases when prices do. And even if it did, the Fed should see it coming soon enough, since it doesn't just look at what inflation is but rather what markets expect it to be, and the Fed would nip it in the bud by raising rates. The upshot is that, just like textbook economics says, it isn't easy for inflation to increase when unemployment already has. Now, it's true that joblessness has finally come down to more normal levels, but maybe not as much as the numbers suggest. So many people have given up looking for work, at least for now, that the economy is acting as if the unemployment rate were higher. That's why the Federal Reserve doesn't think inflation will even get back to the central bank's modest 2 percent target until 2018.","2183","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"
"Republicans, though, haven't just rejected economics when it comes to inflation. They've also ignored the evidence when it comes to what their preferred policies would mean. All they have to do is look at Europe. It raised rates in 2011 to fight non-existent inflation, like Republicans have urged the Fed to do, which only succeeded in pushing itself back into a double-dip recession. To make up for that, the European Central Bank has had to do its own QE, and has even started to talk about extending that. The irony is that it's doing all this despite the fact it has the kind of inflation-only mandate that Republicans think would have stopped the Fed from doing so itself. It's reassuring that a single mandate might not matter much—former George W. Bush adviser Greg Mankiw thinks the Fed could have justified everything it did even with one—but Republicans don't seem to have noticed this.","2184","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"

"Well, part of it is probably Reagan nostalgia, another Bush denial, and the last Obama-Must-Fail Syndrome. The fact, as Jim Pethokoukis of the conservative American Enterprise Institute told me, is that ""a certain demographic of 1980s supply-siders"" in the Republican Party are ""always and everywhere on the lookout for inflation."" Bringing it down was a big part of what made Ronald Reagan so popular, so they might think keeping it down will do the same for Republicans today.","2187","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"
"But it's not just about explaining Reagan's successes. It's also about explaining away the economy's failures under George W. Bush—and in an ideologically comforting way. ""Republicans are looking for an explanation of what went wrong in 2008,"" Pethokoukis said, ""that doesn't blame the private sector."" And the Fed is the perfect scapegoat. It really might have left rates too low for too long during the housing boom—although if that were true, inflation should have gone up more—but more than that, it's about the nature of the Fed itself. It's a bunch of bureaucrats deciding what interest rates will be for the entire economy. If the Fed didn't exist, the Tea Party would have to invent it. Indeed, the Fed has become a bête noire for the conservative grassroots who see it as ""just another arm of the government"" at the same time, Pethokoukis told me, that ""the Republican Party has become more anti-government.""","2188","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"
"And finally—get ready for a bit of cognitive dissonance—it's about explaining President Obama's failures, and his lack of failures. The simple story is that whatever Obama has been for, Republicans have been against. Even when it comes to monetary policy. ""We've had seven years of zero interest rates and the lousiest recovery in 75 years,"" said Stephen Moore, a leading conservative economist at the Heritage Foundation and an informal adviser to several GOP candidates. ""So that's one reason a lot of us feel like it's time to get off the zero interest rate policy."" The implication, he said, is that ""zero interest rates haven't helped the economy."" All that's happened, he continued, is ""Wall Street"" has gotten ""addicted to zero interest rates like it's crack cocaine,"" and is ""potentially creating another bubble."" Now, that sounds like a reasonable enough concern, but it gets cause and effect backward. Rates are low because growth is low, not the other way around. If higher interest rates really wouldn't hurt the economy, then Europe's recovery should have been just as good as our own. It hasn't, not even close: their unemployment rate is still more than double ours. Moore, for his part, attributed Europe's double-dip not to their tight monetary policy, but rather to their ""very Keynesian"" fiscal policies—never mind that they have cut their budgets more than we have.","2189","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"
"Then there was the debt crisis that never happened. Republicans were sure, just sure, that Obama's deficits would send interest rates soaring and the economy crashing. Paul Ryan even called it ""the most predictable crisis we have ever had."" But instead of spiking, interest rates actually fell to historic lows. Why? Well, Republicans had their suspicions. ""They think the Fed is enabling Obama,"" Pethokoukis explained, by buying bonds to push down borrowing costs. Ryan went so far as to complain that ""this looks an awful lot like an attempt to bail out fiscal policy."" It's the Scooby Doo theory of QE: there would have been right about a debt crisis if it weren't for those meddling central bankers! But if Republicans were right that the Fed is the only reason interest rates are so low, inflation should have gone up instead. It's not like the Fed can keep rates lower than the economy needs them to be without overheating it. But that, to say the least, hasn't happened.","2190","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"
"So conservatives have had to resort to one of two strategies to try to excuse their bad predictions: conspiracy theories or cherry-picking. Conservatives like Niall Ferguson insisted that inflation was ""really"" higher than the official numbers said it was, even though independent estimates like MIT's Billion Prices Project showed it going up the same amount. Meanwhile, others like Ted Cruz pointed at one or two prices that were going up more than the average—which, as a mathematical matter, must be true—and said that showed inflation was still a problem. Not only that, but they'd usually pick a price that the Fed has no control over, like beef, to ""prove"" their point. Higher interest rates, after all, wouldn't have done anything about the drought that pushed hamburger prices up. So it's all been about hyping up any hint of inflation—or insinuating that there's more than the numbers are letting on—because admitting that there isn't any would be admitting that they have been wrong about the Fed, and, perhaps, the entire economy.","2191","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"
"It's not just their ideology and their grassroots activists pushing Republicans to worry about inflation. It's their money men too. Now, it's hard to draw a straight line between a rich donor's views and a candidate's, but it turns out that some of the biggest Republican donors have been some of the Fed's biggest critics. Home Depot founder—and Christie benefactor—Ken Langone wants the Fed to raise rates because ""money deserves rent"" and ""an unnatural act, such as giving people money for nothing"" will cause ""unnatural things to happen."" Hedge fund billionaire—and Rubio supporter—Paul Singer thinks the Fed is missing the hyperinflation in the Hamptons (and Aspen, too). Hedge fund billionaire—and Jeb, Christie, and Kasich donor—Stanley Druckenmiller is afraid the Fed is just inflating another bubble. Hedge fund billionaire—and Jeb backer—Ken Griffin says QE has actually cost the economy jobs. And casino billionaire—and Christie contributor—Steve Wynn doesn't see any difference between the Fed's bond-buying and what Bernie Madoff did.","2192","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"
"Now, it isn't easy to explain why the billionaire class has turned against the Fed. Easy money is good for assets, and they have plenty of those. They should love QE—but don't. Maybe, as Brad DeLong argues, it's that they think the Fed is manipulating markets in an unsustainable way. Or maybe it's that they aren't as worried about expanding their empires with cheap money as they are about losing it to worthless money. Whatever it is, though, it doesn't really matter to Republican politicians. All they need to know, as Pethokoukis told me, is that ""very successful hedge fund managers"" who are ""out there in the markets and are not some pointy-headed academic types"" think ""this is bad."" That makes an impression, independent of the fact that they can add quite a few zeros to the candidates' Super PACs. It amplifies what they're already hearing from conservative activists: zero interest rates must be destroyed.","2193","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"
"The lesson, then, is that bashing bureaucrats is good politics in the Republican primaries. Especially when you're saying that savers should get better returns from higher interest rates. But it's awful economics. Everything that's happened the last seven years has shown that inflation fears couldn't have been more wrong, but everything that's happening in the Republican Party is pushing them to continue to worry about inflation.","2194","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/10/why-republicans-are-getting-one-of-the-most-obvious-things-wrong/"

"Much of this has its roots in the reaction to the election of President Obama and to the agenda he has pursued.

"The anger has fed on itself. Grass-roots Republicans are frustrated that their leaders in Washington have not been more successful in checking Obama or rolling back what he has been able to do.

"What is the Republican theory of the 2016 election?

"The Washington Examiner’s Philip Klein has a good piece today in which he posits the latter theory. Klein’s overall point is that the two parties are each making wildly different assumptions about next year’s contest — and that this has driven each party further into its own ideological corner, portending an unusually charged and intense general election battle.","2233","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/16/do-republicans-think-it-will-be-easy-to-beat-hillary/"
"Democrats, Klein points out, are betting that the last two presidential elections show that the way to win is to reconstitute the Obama coalition of millennials, nonwhites, and socially liberal college educated whites. The robust liberal consensus on display at the last debate shows that Hillary Clinton is fully embracing this coalition’s priorities. As I’ve also argued, Democrats see no need to believe this will compromise her in a general election, since many of these policies also have majority support.","2234","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/16/do-republicans-think-it-will-be-easy-to-beat-hillary/"
"The Republican theory of the 2016 election, however, is very different. Here’s how Klein describes it:","2235","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/16/do-republicans-think-it-will-be-easy-to-beat-hillary/"
"Klein seems to be talking mainly about what’s driving the thinking of GOP primary voters. This gives rise to a question: Do serious Republican strategists and establishment figures really believe this? Do they think Clinton is suddenly proving so unexpectedly flawed — thanks to the email scandal and Bernie Sanders’ surprisingly robust challenge — that they are now less inclined to worry about the need for a candidate who can help offset the party’s structural and demographic disadvantages?","2236","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/16/do-republicans-think-it-will-be-easy-to-beat-hillary/"
"If so, you’d think recent events would undercut that confidence. After months of being on the defensive over the email story, we’ve now seen an unexpectedly strong debate performance from Clinton. New fundraising numbers show that she enjoys a large advantage over the serious GOP candidates, and that rank-and-file Democrats may be very energized. A series of disastrous moments of candor from Republicans about the Benghazi probe have undermined the credibility of GOP efforts to exploit the email story. While none of these guarantees anything for Clinton, you’d think they’d remind Republicans that politics changes quickly and that placing too many chips on Clinton’s weakness might be misguided.","2237","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/16/do-republicans-think-it-will-be-easy-to-beat-hillary/"
"And yet recent history demonstrates that GOP strategists sometimes do place too much stock in overly confident, ill-thought-through assessments of the weakness of the opposing candidate and what appear to be insurmountable (but actually prove ephemeral or misleading) political circumstances. In 2012, for instance, the Romney campaign convinced itself that there was no way Obama could possibly get reelected amid such difficult economic circumstances: this made it inevitable that Obama would meet the fate that befell Jimmy Carter, when undecided voters shifted against him to hand Ronald Reagan a big victory. (That itself is bad history, but that underscores my point.) The larger Romney campaign calculation was that there was no way swing voters could possibly see Obama as anything but a total, abject failure, since Republicans knew he had been one. But that reading turned out to be seriously flawed.","2238","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/16/do-republicans-think-it-will-be-easy-to-beat-hillary/"
"Meanwhile, the Romney camp also convinced itself that there was no way the 2012 electorate could possibly be as diverse as it had been in 2008, presumably since Obama’s election was probably a fluke driven by the cult of personality that driven nonwhite and young voters into a frenzy that had worn off once they realized who he really was. That also turned out to be wrong. The point is that Republican operatives adopted a strategic view of the opposing candidate and his circumstances that was largely shaped by their own talking points about him and less about a hard-headed and nuanced look at deeper factors.","2239","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/16/do-republicans-think-it-will-be-easy-to-beat-hillary/"
"Hillary Clinton will of course not be as strong a candidate as Obama was. She does have serious weaknesses. History tilts against one party winning the White House three times in a row. And the question of whether she can mobilize the Obama coalition in Obama-like numbers is a big unknown. But superficial assessments of her current weaknesses — which could be reinforced if Republicans believe their talking points about her — could obscure an appreciation of the built-in advantages that she may enjoy. She could benefit from structural factors such as continued demographic change. The Democratic agenda (this is another possibility that the Romney camp seemed incapable of grasping) may prove more popular than the Republican one with the national electorate, brash assessments that Hillary has lurched “left” notwithstanding. The very real chance at electing the first female president could prove a major factor. And it’s possible — yes, possible — that the Clinton camp may successfully neutralize the email mess after all.","2240","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/16/do-republicans-think-it-will-be-easy-to-beat-hillary/"
"It would be interesting to know just how seriously the smartest GOP operatives are taking these possibilities.

"Of course, if Klein is right, and GOP voters are deciding that Clinton is so weak that they need not worry about their standard-bearer’s electability, then it may not matter what Republican strategists and establishment figures think.

He's been to their districts! Dick Cheney endorsed him! None of that was a match for the fundamental belief -- within the base and among Republican politicians trying to channel that base -- that McCarthy was part of the problem, not the solution.

"Common sense suggests that an ideologically diverse party should be more difficult to lead, and political science research agrees. As Hans Noel explains over at Mischiefs of Faction, under the political science theory of “conditional party government,” lawmakers drawn from a heterogeneous party are much more reluctant to grant their leaders power over the agenda than those from a more homogeneous party. Hence, a diverse flock of Congressional sheep can be more difficult to keep in line than a unified one.","2323","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/10/30/no-congressional-republicans-havent-become-more-polarized/"
"But a look at the data suggest that, in fact, the Congressional GOP is no less unified now than at any point since World War II. Political scientists at Voteview.com have archived every Congressional roll-call vote and have employed a data algorithm called “DW-NOMINATE” that uses these votes to place each member of Congress on the primary axis of conflict in American politics at the time. These days, of course, the primary conflict is between liberals and conservatives, and DW-NOMINATE assigns each lawmaker a score on this liberal-conservative scale.","2324","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/10/30/no-congressional-republicans-havent-become-more-polarized/"
"Thus one way to get a sense of the level of internal division among a party’s members of Congress is to examine the extent that scores vary internally by party. As anyone who took (and remembers) AP Stats can tell you, a good measure of a set of numbers’ variation is their standard deviation. (Bear with me if you’re not statistically inclined; this will be over soon.) A party whose roll-call scores exhibit a low standard deviation is relatively unified; higher standard deviations indicate more heterogeneity and (potentially) within-party fractiousness. Of course, these scores capture just one important aspect of intra-party conflict in Congress; there are many others. But they are a good place to start if we are trying to objectively measure within-party polarization, rather than simply reach conclusions with anecdotal evidence.","2325","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/10/30/no-congressional-republicans-havent-become-more-polarized/"

"In the graph above, I plot the within-party standard deviation of DW-NOMINATE scores among Democratic and Republican members of the House of Representatives from the 80th Congress (elected in 1946) to the present. The steady descent in the variation of Democrats’ scores is unmistakable. This of course is largely due to the fact that the party’s members from the South, who were Democrats in name but conservatives in practice, have been replaced by even more conservative Republicans. What was once a relatively heterogeneous Democratic group is now a more unified (and liberal) party than at any time in recent history.","2327","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/10/30/no-congressional-republicans-havent-become-more-polarized/"
"More remarkable is the essentially flat line tracing the pattern of variation among Republican members of Congress over time. These data say the GOP is no more internally polarized now than it’s been at any time since WWII. The party is certainly less unified than the Democrats: The difference between the two parties’ internal variation now is about the same as it was in the mid-1950s, when the Democrats were the more heterogeneous party.","2328","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/10/30/no-congressional-republicans-havent-become-more-polarized/"

"RC: That’s right. I question the conventional wisdom. Take the rise of evangelical Republican activists. One reason why they’ve increased as a part of the Republican base is as simple as an increase in the number of evangelicals in society as a whole. This is because of their robust birthrates, the fact that the children of evangelicals tend to identify as evangelicals as adults, and the fact that some people have converted to an evangelical faith.

As a Mennonite I graduated from a college owned by the Mennonite Church, Goshen College in Indiana, and my adviser there was an outspoken advocate of avoiding politics for religious reasons.

"To arrive at this estimate we use the best measure of electoral viability — the collective wisdom of prediction markets — and compare that to a measure of ideological conservatism calculated by Stanford political scientist Adam Bonica.

Assuming that if Rubio wins the presidency, he would do so as the GOP nominee — an assumption supported by Betfair’s Winning Party Market.

"It may be surprising that Chris Christie emerges as so electable in this analysis. Why would someone as apparently electable be doing so poorly in the primary polls? It’s likely because Christie has more potential appeal to the average voter in the national electorate than the average voter in Republican primaries.

"Given that Biden has tacitly criticized this Clinton remark for two days running, and in today’s version explicitly linked this criticism to the suggestion that befriending Republicans (as Biden has done) is necessary to “making things work,” it’s reasonable to assume Biden is road-testing an actual argument about how best to approach governing in a bitterly divided Capitol that he may employ against Clinton if he runs.","2439","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/20/what-hillarys-claim-that-republicans-are-her-enemies-is-really-about/"
"That’s what Ezra Klein argues in an interesting piece.

Still, Klein says this might be a decent argument for Biden to make:","2440","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/20/what-hillarys-claim-that-republicans-are-her-enemies-is-really-about/"
"But Phil Klein makes a contrary argument: This won’t hurt Clinton with Democratic voters, because “right now, the Democratic electorate believes that Republicans are intransigent, that they cannot be worked with, and that Obama’s presidency was at its weakest when he tried to deal with GOP leaders in Congress.”","2441","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/20/what-hillarys-claim-that-republicans-are-her-enemies-is-really-about/"
"It’s not clear what calculation is driving Biden here. Does he think criticizing Clinton for being overly confrontational with Republicans will appeal directly to Democratic voters who want a president who can avoid endless partisanship and gridlock? Or is Biden making a roundabout electability argument — is the suggestion supposed to be that swing voters in the general election will agree that a Biden presidency holds out the promise of less confrontation and more compromise, and that Dem voters will realize this, and thus see him as more viable in the general as a result? Either way, as Phil Klein says, it’s not clear that it will win over Democratic voters.","2442","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/20/what-hillarys-claim-that-republicans-are-her-enemies-is-really-about/"
"But whichever it is, if we are going to have an argument over how a Democratic president can best achieve functional government with one or both chambers of Congress in GOP hands, it seems like a real reckoning with recent history might be in order. On the one hand, it’s obviously true that deep connections to the Hill, an ability to forge relations with Republicans, and a proven record of negotiating deals — all of which Biden has — are attributes in a presidential candidate.","2443","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/20/what-hillarys-claim-that-republicans-are-her-enemies-is-really-about/"
"On the other hand, we should scrutinize the assumption that a willingness or an ability to compromise and make deals with Republicans — that being liked and trusted by them — is all it would take, or even primarily what it would take, to achieve functional government under the next Democratic president.","2444","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/20/what-hillarys-claim-that-republicans-are-her-enemies-is-really-about/"
"After all, in a number of instances in the recent past, the Obama administration achieved settlements with Republicans that broke through seemingly intractable stalemates precisely because he was unwilling to compromise at key moments along the way. The whole point of Obama’s repeated refusals during his second term to negotiate on the debt limit was to break the Republican addiction to using leverage in fiscal standoffs to extract concessions from Democrats. The idea was that, even if these standoffs continued to be treated falsely as conventional negotiations, they had in fact strayed on to unconventional, dangerous grounds. The ground rules needed to be reset, so that these standoffs no longer threatened to unleash extreme damage (say, if we defaulted), if something were to go wrong and a deal were to fall through. And it worked. In this sense, it was the refusal to negotiate with Republicans that in the end produced more functional government.","2445","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/20/what-hillarys-claim-that-republicans-are-her-enemies-is-really-about/"
"All of this was, in a way, foreshadowed by the 2008 Democratic primary. Barack Obama argued that a bitterly divided country could be united if enough good will, hard work, and willingness to compromise were brought to the task of finding common ground. Clinton thought that was naive — that our differences are mostly unbridgeable and that politics is mostly a struggle in which one side does sometimes have to accept defeat and disappointment. It’s true, as Phil Klein says, that Democrats often thought Obama was too slow to accept the latter view even when it was clearly necessary to do so. Obama did eventually accept that latter view, and in those cases where he did, he was right to do so — it paradoxically made the system work better. When Clinton says she is proud of making “enemies” of Republicans, she’s signaling, in effect, that she continues to operate — and has long operated — from a place of extreme realism on this underlying question.","2446","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/20/what-hillarys-claim-that-republicans-are-her-enemies-is-really-about/"
"Clinton very well may come to regret that quote. Perhaps it was a ham-handed formulation that could end up alienating swing voters. But in one respect, she may not be wrong — maybe a refusal to compromise is just what is necessary to make the system function better under certain circumstances. Given what we’re seeing from today’s GOP, it’s not unreasonable to assume that we’ll be seeing more of these circumstances under the next Democratic president, if we get one. Yes, Clinton must be pressed to explain in more detail how she will work with Republicans where it is possible to do so, given how much she and they dislike each other. But in similar fashion, those who are going to condemn Clinton over this should be asked why, given recent history, there isn’t some truth to her underlying analysis.","2447","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/20/what-hillarys-claim-that-republicans-are-her-enemies-is-really-about/"

"Halperin describes those advantages as follows: the Clinton team is far more competent than in 2008. She may wrap up the nomination early, while the eventual GOP nominee will be bloodied by a very long and bitter process. Clinton is a formidable debater. Clinton will have a demographic edge. Some of the positions Clinton is taking now may have majority support in a general election (a point your humble blogger has made as well).","2452","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/26/morning-plum-republicans-are-in-denial-about-hillary-clinton/"

"I find it hard to imagine that the smarter GOP strategists really believe all this. But if this is the prevailing Republican theory of the 2016 election, there is precedent for it. In 2012, it often seemed as if Romney campaign officials’ assessments of the election were shaped by a tendency to believe their own superficial, GOP-base-friendly talking points about Obama. The Romney campaign convinced itself that there was no way Obama could possibly get reelected amid such high unemployment. The Romney camp convinced itself that there was no way the 2012 electorate could possibly be as diverse as it had been in 2008. Obama’s election was best explained as a fluke — his cult of personality had captivated nonwhite and young voters, but that would prove as fleeting as a high-school crush. There was no way swing voters in 2012 could possibly see the Obama presidency as anything other than an irredeemable catastrophe, since Republicans knew, just knew, that’s what it had been. Something similar might be happening now.","2454","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/26/morning-plum-republicans-are-in-denial-about-hillary-clinton/"
"To be clear, we don’t know if Clinton will have the advantage next year. As it is the election is probably close to a 50-50 proposition based on the fundamentals. There could be new revelations about her email arrangement; the economy could dip; Republicans may nominate an unexpectedly strong candidate; Sanders could still pull off an upset; and so forth. But, presuming Halperin is right, what remains striking is the absolute certainty among Republicans that Clinton can’t possibly win, because they see how distasteful and scandal-ridden a figure she truly is, and swing voters will just have to see it their way, because it’s so obvious to them.","2455","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/26/morning-plum-republicans-are-in-denial-about-hillary-clinton/"

The year 2016, unlike 2014, should be a high-turnout year for Democrats, which is a critical factor in those congressional races.

"The budget deal solves two problems that Social Security and Medicare faced: It reallocates Social Security funds in a way Democrats had sought to keep disability insurance solvent. And it averts a premium hike for millions on Medicare Part B that loomed as a result of a glitch in cost-of-living calculations.","2502","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/maybe-republicans-dont-actually-want-to-cut-social-security-and-medicare/"
"Meanwhile, the cuts to Medicare and Social Security, which are supposed to help pay for the increased spending in the deal, do not appear to amount to a meaningful cut in benefits. (The AARP endorsed the deal today.) Overall, despite the fact that Republicans control both chambers of Congress, the deal solves two problems that threatened to harm beneficiaries (though Republicans also wanted to solve one of them, the Medicare Part B problem), while failing to cut meaningfully into benefits for them.","2503","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/maybe-republicans-dont-actually-want-to-cut-social-security-and-medicare/"
"This is, as Philip Klein writes, a big loss for conservatives who actually want to substantially slash spending.

"Surely part of it is that many GOP lawmakers want increased defense spending, so this deal is in some ways worth their while. But another possible answer can be found in this piece by Bloomberg’s Sahil Kapur, in which Republicans say the deal (should it pass Congress) will ultimately be a good thing for the eventual 2016 GOP nominee.

It’s true that Paul Ryan’s budgets would have dramatically slashed them. (Ryan is a true ideological limited government hard-liner.) But it’s also true that for three elections running, Republicans have attacked Democrats as the true threat to social insurance for the elderly. Some of these attacks blasted Democrats over the idea that Obamacare supposedly loots people’s Medicare benefits. And in 2014, Karl Rove’s group ran multiple ads against Senate Dem incumbents that dishonestly suggested they supported raising the Social Security retirement age.","2506","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/maybe-republicans-dont-actually-want-to-cut-social-security-and-medicare/"
"Meanwhile, in 2013, the White House repeatedly put entitlement cuts on the table as an offer towards reaching a “Grand Bargain,” something that infuriated the left. But Republican lawmakers resolutely continued to pretend no such offer had been made. At times the White House fairly screamed that it would cut entitlements in exchange for raising taxes on the rich, but Republicans would often respond with some variation of, la la la, I can’t hear you, Democrats have to get serious about cutting spending.","2507","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/maybe-republicans-dont-actually-want-to-cut-social-security-and-medicare/"
"Observers who have tried to explain this confusing overall posture have noted that the GOP is in what Jonathan Chait has called “a geriatric trap.” Republicans are the party that preaches small government, but not only is cutting Social Security and Medicare deeply unpopular; the GOP base is increasingly made up of older voters who rely on these Big Government programs that are eating up an increasing share of spending.","2508","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/maybe-republicans-dont-actually-want-to-cut-social-security-and-medicare/"
"Ryan’s designs on Medicare were a liability for the Republican ticket in the last national election. Meanwhile, those who pay close attention to political demographics suggest that the GOP’s reliance on older voters may, if anything, be growing. Indeed, some observers have noted that Donald Trump’s success may be explained in part due to his opposition to cutting Social Security, which, when combined with his restrictionist stance on immigration, might appeal to GOP base voters, particularly older ones. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but Trump seems to think he’s onto something with these voters: Today on Morning Joe he attacked Ben Carson over the latter’s suggestion that he might want to replace Medicare with private accounts.","2509","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/maybe-republicans-dont-actually-want-to-cut-social-security-and-medicare/"
"Maybe I’m wrong — maybe Republican leaders would have loved to slash Social Security and Medicare benefits as part of the new budget deal, and only accepted it because it hikes defense spending and clears the decks for Paul Ryan to take over as Speaker. Or maybe the failure of the deal to meaningfully cut those programs’ benefits actually constitutes a win not just for Dems, but for the GOP, too.","2510","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/maybe-republicans-dont-actually-want-to-cut-social-security-and-medicare/"

"The top three candidates in national Republican presidential primary polls — Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina — have between them zero years of experience in government. It shows in their public pronouncements, which tend toward the absurd, uninformed and intensely polarizing. Trump has repeatedly called Mexican immigrants “criminals, drug dealers, rapists.” (Actually, first-generation immigrants commit fewer crimes than people born here.) Carson considers evolutionary biology the work of Satan, didn’t know the Baltic states are in NATO, and argues that a Muslim should not be president.

"Two months ago, when Trump was followed in the polls by more experienced public officials such as Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, one school of thought held that Trump’s appeal was limited to a minority of Republican voters; most, surely, preferred a more traditional politician.

"It’s time to consider the possibility that a very large swath of Republican voters do actually prefer flailing amateurs to qualified, serious candidates for the presidency. After all, this year is not an anomaly but rather the growth of a trend: In 2012, the Republican polls were led at various times by Donald Trump, Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann. The 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, accused Barack Obama of “palling around with terrorists,” could not name a single newspaper or magazine she read and reportedly did not know why there are both North and South Koreas. Palin’s popularity only grew after she resigned as governor and starred in a reality TV show.

"This is not just because the most charismatic candidates are always those with the least experience. Ben Carson’s performance in the debates can hardly be described as entertaining or even energetic. Nor is it entirely explained by the intensification of conservatism among Republican voters: Fiorina is no more conservative than the average Republican candidate, Trump’s views are idiosyncratic and even Palin had raised taxes on oil companies — an achievement she still touts.","2515","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/07/republican-dont-want-someone-to-fix-the-system-they-want-someone-to-break-it/"
"The GOP’s increasing preference for callow, reckless candidates represents a culmination of the anti-government, anti-politics, anti-intellectual direction of the conservative movement. Although it overlaps with the GOP’s rightward shift, it presents a unique threat to American democracy because it espouses not mere preference for smaller government, but a visceral hatred of functioning government and the practice of politics. This mindset abhors concessions to objective reality, expertise or political adversaries domestic and foreign.","2516","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/07/republican-dont-want-someone-to-fix-the-system-they-want-someone-to-break-it/"
"While it is unlikely that Trump, Fiorina or Carson will be the Republican nominee, their popularity matters because insurgent challengers rising to the top of the polls tell us something about what a party’s voters want. And they influence the ultimate nominee, often an establishment candidate who mimics the insurgents to co-opt their supporters. In 2012, for example, Mitt Romney, bowing to pressure from his right flank, renounced his prior acceptance of climate science.","2517","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/07/republican-dont-want-someone-to-fix-the-system-they-want-someone-to-break-it/"
"Bernie Sanders is polling impressively in his left-wing challenge to Hillary Clinton and so she has responded to that threat (and pressure from grass-roots environmental activists) by coming out against oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean and the Keystone XL oil pipeline. It would be one thing if mainstream Republican candidates were being successfully challenged from the right by counterparts to Bernie Sanders — experienced public servants with legislative accomplishments and strong ideological convictions — and they were compelled to move right in response. Liberals might not like that, but it wouldn’t inherently threaten the functioning of American democracy. But what if the Republican insurgents who gain traction do so because they are provocateurs who reiterate demagogic falsehoods even when confronted by objective facts? What if Jeb Bush has to mimic that behavior to win the nomination and retain his base’s loyalty? How would that affect his governance?","2518","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/07/republican-dont-want-someone-to-fix-the-system-they-want-someone-to-break-it/"
"Although it has yet to happen at the presidential level, Republicans have already nominated mini-Trumps and Carsons in congressional, senatorial and gubernatorial races. Think of Carl Paladino in New York or Christine O’Donnell in Delaware. Some of these candidates, like Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst — who argues that states can nullify federal laws — have gone on to win the general election. The general understanding of these events has been that it represents a conservative revolt against moderates. But the victims of these challenges are often loyal conservatives whose only sin is being a politician with any sense of pragmatism or comity. Compromising with Democrats, or even talking to them about potential compromise, is seen as a betrayal. Just ask former representative Bob Inglis (R-S.C.), a conservative who in 2010 lost to Tea Party challenger Trey Gowdy because he criticized Glenn Beck and voted to reprimand Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) for shouting “You lie!” at President Obama during a State of the Union address. (Obama was actually telling the truth when he said unauthorized immigrants would not be eligible for coverage under Obamacare.) The lesson to Republicans: You cannot treat Democrats with respect or admit to inconvenient facts.

"When this happens in congressional elections, informed observers attribute it to gerrymandering. Republicans are concentrated in highly Republican districts and only the most conservative party stalwarts vote in midterm primaries, and so congressional Republicans are pulled far to the right. But national presidential field polls of Republican voters are taking a much wider, less conservative sample. The polls are currently telling us that Republicans lust not after conservatism — which they could have gotten plenty of from Scott Walker — but blowhard anti-government, anti-intellectual posturing.","2520","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/07/republican-dont-want-someone-to-fix-the-system-they-want-someone-to-break-it/"
"Even if you believe that illegal immigration from Mexico is a huge problem, that taxes are stifling growth, that cutting carbon emissions would cost more than it is worth, that abortion is morally wrong, it isn’t in your interest to have your party dominated by voters who care less about these policies than about affecting anti-politics, anti-intellectual belligerence. The country still needs to pass budgets, raise the debt ceiling, staff agencies with competent bureaucrats and the federal bench with competent jurists, and to cooperate with other countries on everything from trade and immigration to nuclear non-proliferation. Republican voters are threatening these foundations of American prosperity and security, not as a byproduct of moral conviction but as a statement of inchoate resentment. The scariest thing of all: Warning them that even a conservative agenda, like the country as a whole, would be better served by competent candidates wouldn’t work.

Yet between April 5 and June 23 of that year, the share of white Southerners who approved of Kennedy declined by 35 percentage points to about 20 percent , according to the Gallup polls.

"For decades, Gallup has been asking Americans whether they would consider voting for a black presidential candidate.

But many of those who said they wouldn’t vote for a black candidate left the party.","2534","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/24/how-racism-explains-republicans-rise-in-the-south/"
"That was compelling evidence that race had everything to do with Democrats' decline in the South, but the two economists wanted to rule out other possible explanations. Maybe Democrats who held conservative views on other issues also happened to be more conservative on race. If so, the decline in the number of white southern Democrats might have resulted from the party's positions on other issues. At that time, President Lyndon B. Johnson was pushing his “Great Society” vision, launching a “war on poverty” and creating Medicare in 1965. Those positions also might have alienated more conservative Democrats.","2535","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/24/how-racism-explains-republicans-rise-in-the-south/"
"But if racially conservative white Democrats in the South also were more conservative on economic issues and health care, their counterparts in other parts of the country presumably would be, too. Conservative Democrats west of the Mississippi and north of the Mason-Dixon Line would have left the party as it shifted to the left on economic issues, regardless of their views on race. But they didn’t.

"The researchers also considered whether those Southerners who opposed a black president did so not because of racial prejudice, but because of their support for states' rights.

"Republican candidates have proposed: to favor the admission of Christian over Muslim refugees from the Middle East; to “send home” Syrian refugees, mainly women and children, into a war zone; to “strongly consider” the shutting down of suspicious mosques; to compile a database of Muslims and (perhaps) force them to carry special identification showing their religion.

"There are, of course, Republican presidential hopefuls who have vigorously opposed each of these proposals, arguments and stereotypes.

So in Tennessee, the chairman of the state legislature’s GOP caucus has called for the mobilization of the National Guard to round up Syrian refugees and put them in camps.

"The United States is being transformed by revolutions remaking the country at an accelerating and surprising pace. Witness the revolutions in technology, the Internet, big data and energy, though just as important are the tremendous changes taking place in immigration, racial and ethnic diversity, the family, religious observance and gender roles. These are reaching their apexes in the booming metropolitan centers and among millennials.","2640","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-2016-could-be-shattering-for-republicans/2015/11/13/fae603dc-88b0-11e5-be39-0034bb576eee_story.html"
"As the revolutions interact, they are accelerating the emergence of a new America. Consider that nearly 40 percent of New York City’s residents are foreign-born, with Chinese the second-largest group behind Dominicans. The foreign-born make up nearly 40 percent of Los Angeles’s residents and 58 percent of Miami’s. A majority of U.S. households are headed by unmarried people, and, in cities, 40 percent of households include only a single person. Church attendance is in decline, and non-religious seculars now outnumber mainline Protestants. Three-quarters of working-age women are in the labor force, and two-thirds of women are the breadwinners or co-breadwinners of their households. The proportion of racial minorities is approaching 40 percent, but blowing up all projections are the 15 percent of new marriages that are interracial. People are moving from the suburbs to the cities. And in the past five years, two-thirds of millennial college graduates have settled in the 50 largest cities, transforming them.","2641","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-2016-could-be-shattering-for-republicans/2015/11/13/fae603dc-88b0-11e5-be39-0034bb576eee_story.html"

"It's no secret that the public is deeply divided about Obama as he enters the final year of his presidency. Democrats generally like him. Republicans, almost uniformly, do not.

"Remember back in February, when almost seven in 10 Republicans in an online YouGov poll said that Obama doesn't love America?

"Conservatives are pushing for a vote on a new measure that would prevent any vote on a final resolution of disapproval, until President Obama makes the full contents of so-called “side deals” attached to the agreement, including one between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency, available to Congress. Opponents grabbed onto an IAEA-Iran side deal in a last ditch effort to spook Democrats into opposing the agreement, even though arms control experts clarified that the alarm about it was mostly distortion and hype, but that didn’t work.

"The basic idea, which House conservatives are acknowledging very frankly, is that now that it’s obvious Congress can no longer block the Iran deal, a legal push to get more details of it revealed could conceivably divulge more damaging information about it, thus getting Congressional Democrats to pull their support.

"It’s still unclear what House Republicans will end up doing; a meeting is scheduled for 4 p.m. today.

"If I understand this right, the first would essentially be a declaration that it’s the sense of the House that Obama has not given the full contents of the Iran deal to Congress, which means that under the bipartisan Corker-Cardin framework passed by Congress for its votes on the Iran deal, the clock never actually started on Congress’ deliberations at all, since Obama never gave them the full deal. GOP leaders may then charge that Obama is breaking the law by moving forward with the agreement, which would then have to be sorted out in court. The second would be a measure reimposing sanctions, which we already knew Republicans were going to vote on. The third would be a resolution of approval of the deal, designed only to put Democrats in the politically difficult position of voting for it.","2674","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/09/on-iran-deal-republicans-move-swiftly-to-snatch-defeat-from-jaws-of-defeat/"
"Why that would be a difficult vote for Dems already on record in support of the deal is unclear.

"The oddest thing about this course of action in political terms is that it could end up denying Republicans the slim message victory they stood to gain from this whole procedure. If the House passed a resolution of disapproval of the deal, and more than 50 Senators voted for it (the resolution now looks likely to fall short of 60), Republicans would at least be able to argue that Obama and Democrats moved forward in defiance of a majority of both chambers in Congress, flouting the will of the American people.

"However, they will retain the hope of legally derailing the deal later, or shaking out some new and damaging information that will get Dems to finally abandon it. Do both of those seem unlikely? Yes. But once you understand that for conservative Republicans the following two things are articles of faith — Obama acted nefariously or possibly illegally; and the Iran deal is so awful that there just have to be truly hideous aspects of it still hidden from view — it becomes clearer why this course of action makes more sense than voting on a hopeless resolution of disapproval and failing to block the deal in undramatic fashion.","2678","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/09/on-iran-deal-republicans-move-swiftly-to-snatch-defeat-from-jaws-of-defeat/"

"In the United States, here's what we do know that should really make all of us pause: Most people are inclined to answer poll questions in a way that they think is more socially acceptable -- what pollsters call the ""social-acceptability bias."" So pollsters spend a lot of time crafting surveys that pose questions about sensitive social topics like race, gender, religion and sexuality in ways that also test for consistency and clarity of the public's views. Still, social scientists also presume that any question that quite clearly offers the opportunity to express views that some consider bigoted will produce a kind of low count.","2699","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/29/republicans-are-uncomfortable-with-the-changing-face-of-america-this-poll-proves-it/"
"Understood that way, what the NBC/WSJ poll provides is yet another bit of irrefutable evidence of real trouble and discord. And it's a particular kind of trouble and discord that shows up again and again along partisan lines when the pollsters behind the survey ask about immigration, police brutality and misconduct, gay rights and, oddly, even the use of technology like smartphones. That so many more Republicans express discomfort and anxiety about the changing face of America and expanding certain rights just is not a good sign for a Republican Party trying in vain to adjust to that very same changing face.","2700","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/29/republicans-are-uncomfortable-with-the-changing-face-of-america-this-poll-proves-it/"

"Watching last night’s debate, I experienced a moment of breathless anticipation when one of the moderators, Gerard Baker of the Wall Street Journal, asked Carly Fiorina a version of what I think is the single most important economic question the Republican presidential candidates should have to answer.

"As Brian Beutler noted afterward, that is exactly what Democrats will be saying next year. So how did Fiorina respond? She told the story of a woman she met who worries about her economic situation, then said, “Yes, problems have gotten much worse under Democrats,” which is the opposite of the truth, then went on to decry how government has been “crushing the engine of economic growth for a very long time.”","2704","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/11/republicans-still-cant-explain-why-their-economic-ideas-keep-failing/"
"In other words, she didn’t answer the question. But its essence is this. The Republican candidates all propose variations on the same theme, which is that the way to boost the economy is to cut taxes and scale back government regulation of business. In other words, here’s the plan all the Republicans agree on:","2705","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/11/republicans-still-cant-explain-why-their-economic-ideas-keep-failing/"
"1) Cut taxes, particularly for the wealthy.","2706","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/11/republicans-still-cant-explain-why-their-economic-ideas-keep-failing/"

"3) Watch the economy boom.","2708","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/11/republicans-still-cant-explain-why-their-economic-ideas-keep-failing/"
"The trouble is that we’ve been testing their theory for some time now, and it isn’t holding up well. That’s particularly true of its flip side, which is that tax increases and more regulation inevitably strangle the economy. Barack Obama has increased taxes and regulations, and job growth during his presidency has been solid. Unemployment is now at a mere five percent; you may remember that in 2012, Mitt Romney said his economic plan was so great that he could bring unemployment below six percent by the end of 2016. It’s true that wages have been stagnant, but that’s a condition that goes back decades. Even if you grant that the economy isn’t what we’d like it to be right now, the Republican theory predicts that the Obama policies would have produced not an incomplete recovery from the financial collapse, but outright economic disaster. Their theory also says that we should have had a huge economic boom during George W. Bush’s administration, and another economic disaster under Bill Clinton, who also raised taxes and increased regulations. None of those things happened.","2709","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/11/republicans-still-cant-explain-why-their-economic-ideas-keep-failing/"
"And today, there’s simply no meaningful way in which the proposals of the current crop of GOP candidates differ from what George W. Bush did. There are some differences in the details, particularly the more fantastical proposals that no one takes seriously, like bringing income taxes down to a 15 percent rate for everyone. But those are differences of degree, not kind; they’re just about how deeply you want to cut taxes, not whether tax cuts pave the path to economic glory, which all Republicans accept. The essential strategy is the same: Cut taxes and cut regulations, then enjoy unending prosperity for all.","2710","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/11/republicans-still-cant-explain-why-their-economic-ideas-keep-failing/"
"As Paul Krugman recently observed, the Democrats running for president are much more modest in the predictions they make about the effects their economic policies will have than the Republicans are. The Democrats will give you lots of reasons why it’s a good idea to raise the minimum wage, or change overtime rules to include more workers, or invest in infrastructure, but what they don’t do is say, “If we follow this plan, GDP will surge by eleventy zillion percent!”","2711","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/11/republicans-still-cant-explain-why-their-economic-ideas-keep-failing/"
"Republicans, on the other hand, reliably predict that their formula of lower taxes and fewer regulations will produce an economic supernova. Jeb Bush says that he can bring about sustained GDP growth of four percent; the last president to average growth that high was Lyndon Johnson. Mike Huckabee says his plan will bring six percent growth, because why the hell not?","2712","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/11/republicans-still-cant-explain-why-their-economic-ideas-keep-failing/"
"We heard similar things during the debate. Marco Rubio said that if we could reform taxes and regulations, repeal Obamacare, and do a couple of other things like expand vocational training, “we will be able to increase wages for millions of Americans and we will be able to leave everyone better off without making anyone worse off.” Ted Cruz said that if we can cut taxes and regulations and return to the gold standard (seriously), then the result will be “incredible economic growth.” Jeb Bush said that we can get to his four percent growth if we cut taxes and “repeal every rule that Barack Obama has.” And that’s without even getting into Donald Trump’s ideas.","2713","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/11/republicans-still-cant-explain-why-their-economic-ideas-keep-failing/"

The amplification of the lies is accompanied by growing intolerance in his campaign, with Mr. Trump praising supporters for beating a protestor, crudely denigrating anyone who challenges him and penning reporters into designated zones so that they cannot speak with his followers.

Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) is probably the most egregious of these second-rate flatterers, but he’s far from alone. Asked about the mythical cheering crowds, New Jersey Gov.

"CHRISTIE: Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it. I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home. The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you. They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.

"Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman. Atlantic City has gone bad. I mean, Chris will know about that. I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that. Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.

"Conservatives are demanding that GOP leaders use the looming government shutdown battle to eviscerate Planned Parenthood, by refusing to support funding for the government that doesn’t also defund the group. GOP leaders have dismissed this strategy as borderline lunacy. But some GOP presidential candidates support the idea, and this group isn’t confined to far right conservatives like Ted Cruz: Marco Rubio has signaled some sympathy with this approach. Meanwhile, establishment candidates like Jeb Bush and John Kasich have at a minimum endorsed defunding the group, if not diving headlong off a shutdown cliff over it.","3681","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/23/hillary-republicans-dont-just-oppose-abortion-they-oppose-family-planning-and-contraception/"
"Clinton has defended Planned Parenthood before, but in the portion of the Des Moines Register interview in which she discussed the group, she telegraphed a more detailed response. Asked about the fetal tissue videos, Clinton immediately brushed off that part of the question, noting that fact-checkers had debunked claims (those made by Carly Fiorina) about the videos’ contents, suggesting that Republicans are “trying to inflame their base” against the group.

"The Clinton camp appears to have calculated that an immediate pivot away from the videos and the controversial topic of abortion, and to the group’s role in providing a range of health services to women, is not hard to pull off. And that the politics of this battle are worse for Republicans over the long term, particularly for a general election.","3683","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/23/hillary-republicans-dont-just-oppose-abortion-they-oppose-family-planning-and-contraception/"
"Wonkblog’s Danielle Paquette recently reported that nixing Planned Parenthood’s $500 million in annual public funds would have “broad ramifications, especially for low-income women who rely on subsidized services for birth control.” Paquette cited PP data showing that 80 percent of its clients receive services designed to prevent unintended pregnancies, while only three percent of its services each year are abortions. And she noted that the group provides birth control services to large percentages of women who seek those services in many states.","3684","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/23/hillary-republicans-dont-just-oppose-abortion-they-oppose-family-planning-and-contraception/"
"By vowing to “educate the public” and draw a “clear line” on what defunding Planned Parenthood would really mean, Clinton is in effect telegraphing what Democrats will do if and when this heats up and gets litigated in 2016: try to cast this as a Republican assault on family planning and women’s health care services, by pointing out that killing the group’s funding actually would defund those services.","3685","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/23/hillary-republicans-dont-just-oppose-abortion-they-oppose-family-planning-and-contraception/"
"Republicans who question the push for a shutdown, such as New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte, have raised doubts about its prospects for success. But it would not be surprising if the smarter GOP strategists also recognized that the particular attack Clinton launched above — aside from whether there is even a government shutdown at all — has the potential to be very damaging to Republicans. After all, Obama used it in 2012, attacking Mitt Romney’s suggestion that he would “get rid” of Planned Parenthood to paint him as hidebound and out of touch on contraception and women’s health issues. Obama campaign focus groups found Romney’s remarks to be a terrible turnoff for undecided women.","3686","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/23/hillary-republicans-dont-just-oppose-abortion-they-oppose-family-planning-and-contraception/"
"That exchange unfolded without the benefit of a government shutdown fight over the group. The battle was only over whether Planned Parenthood should be funded. The shutdown aside, all the GOP candidates do favor defunding the group. A shutdown only draws more attention to an underlying dispute that the Clinton camp already appears to relish, as she is (of course) a female candidate who hopes to make this election in part about family and women’s economics.","3687","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/23/hillary-republicans-dont-just-oppose-abortion-they-oppose-family-planning-and-contraception/"
"To be sure, it’s certainly possible that the recently surfaced fetal tissue videos could turn this battle into a more perilous one for Clinton. But it’s also plausible that even if there is widespread public disgust over the videos and real polarization around abortion, shifting the debate to one over whether we should continue funding the group’s family planning, women’s health and contraceptive services won’t be that hard to do.","3688","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/23/hillary-republicans-dont-just-oppose-abortion-they-oppose-family-planning-and-contraception/"

"That dominance — and what it means to the policy and political calculations and prospects for both parties at the national level — is the single most overlooked and underappreciated story line of President Obama's time in office.

"It's hard to overstate how important those GOP gains — and the consolidation of them we've seen in the last few years — are to the relative fates of the two parties. While the story at the national level suggests a Republican Party that is growing increasingly white, old and out of step with the country on social issues, the narrative at the local level is very different.

"There are other, more pragmatic effects of the GOP dominance in governor's races and state legislatures, too. Aside from giving the party a major leg up in the decennial redrawing of congressional lines, which has led to a Republican House majority not only today but likely through at least 2020, the GOP's dominance gives the party fertile ground to incubate policy that makes its way to the national level and to cultivate the future stars of the national party from the ground up.","3700","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/04/the-2015-election-tightened-the-republican-stranglehold-on-state-government/"

Senate Democrats will not support, and Obama will not sign, anything that grants major concessions in exchange for a debt limit hike or anything that funds the government at sequester levels. Before you argue that this proves Democrats are just as intransigent as House conservatives, recall that GOP leaders and many non-Tea Party Republicans in the House agree with Democrats on these matters — they have previously supported raising the debt limit without concessions, and they have already funded the government, temporarily, at higher than sequester levels.","3752","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/20/morning-plum-no-paul-ryan-probably-cant-unify-the-republican-party/"

"And so, if House conservatives are not going to be willing to do those things, Speaker Ryan would have to do them with the help of Democrats, just as Speaker Boehner has done. He’ll have to stiff-arm the Freedom Fraud Caucus; there’s just no way around it. It’s possible that Ryan might be able to offer some kind of procedural concessions in exchange for assurances from House conservatives that they will not overtly target him for removal if he does that.

"Sununu is far from alone in GOP ranks. Think about how most establishment Republicans saw this race playing out: Jeb Bush gets in, raises a ton of money and blows everyone else out of the water.

Bush was elected in 2000 — running, it's worth noting, essentially the same campaign his younger brother is right now. Strategies — get big (in terms of organization), tout electability and inevitability, keep yourself close enough to the center that you can be viable in a general election — that once were fail-safe just don't work in this electoral environment where the dominant sentiment of voters is anger about everything.","3776","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/26/3-sentences-that-explain-just-how-clueless-establishment-republicans-are-about-2016/"

"It's true that many of the jobs gained during and just after the recession ended in June 2009 — and it did end — were low-paying jobs.

"With regard to those larger and long-term job-creation trends, some economists would argue that this is all the more reason why more Americans are going to have to put in the work to gain the skills and education required for higher-paying jobs.

"The thing is, people who can't find work or work that pays even reasonably well have, like most Americans, very likely ingested a steady diet of bromides about the value and payoff from hard work.

"With little fanfare, the United States’ federal judiciary has started coming apart at the seams, particularly in judicial districts represented by at least one Republican senator. That’s no coincidence. Motivated by a desire both to make President Obama look bad and to delay any judicial appointments until there’s (possibly) a Republican in the White House, GOP senators have thrown obstruction after obstruction in front of the judicial appointment process. As a result, the Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed only six federal judges in 2015.","3891","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/clogging-the-judicial-pipeline/2015/09/21/84168be2-609b-11e5-9757-e49273f05f65_story.html"

"It’s the slowest pace in over six decades, as documented in a new report from the Alliance for Justice.

"Also as a result, “judicial emergencies” — basically, courts where caseloads have become unmanageable — have exploded throughout the country.

"To be fair, part of the reason caseloads are piling up has little to do with the Senate. The number of judgeships has not kept pace as the U.S. population has increased.

"The first step in the process for selecting a new judge involves home-state senators evaluating candidates, often by setting up local selection committees. But in states such as Texas, Republican senators have dragged their feet in establishing such commissions, so no one ever reaches the point of potential nomination. In Wisconsin, home to the country’s oldest circuit court vacancy (more than 2,000 days and counting), Sen. Ron Johnson has blown up the selection commission and restarted the process twice.","3897","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/clogging-the-judicial-pipeline/2015/09/21/84168be2-609b-11e5-9757-e49273f05f65_story.html"
"In other states, such as Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, the rigmarole of finding a suitable candidate has been completed and resulted in a nomination from Obama. Both home-state senators have even publicly endorsed the nominees in question. But that’s just led to a new bottleneck: Republican senators have refused to return their “blue slips,” the century-old, behind-the-scenes forms that home-state senators are supposed to sign to indicate approval of a nominee.","3898","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/clogging-the-judicial-pipeline/2015/09/21/84168be2-609b-11e5-9757-e49273f05f65_story.html"
"For example, Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate, publicly endorsed the nominee for the Southern District of Florida, but seven months later still hasn’t returned his blue slip.

"In other cases, the Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), has received the relevant blue slips but delayed holding confirmation hearings and votes on the nominees.

"This happens, I should note, even when the judicial nominees are not the least bit controversial. You remember those six lonely, lucky judges who managed to get confirmed this year?

"One Texas lawyer recently recounted the story of a jailed client who saw her co-defendants — who pleaded guilty — finish their prison terms before her case was even heard. And because criminal defendants have a constitutional right to a speedy trial, their cases get prioritized. That means civil cases get bumped further down the waiting list. This has proven especially problematic for businesses in Texas, a state that usually prides itself on being pro-business, because its senators (John Cornyn and presidential candidate Ted Cruz) have most aggressively slowed the process of finding nominees.","3903","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/clogging-the-judicial-pipeline/2015/09/21/84168be2-609b-11e5-9757-e49273f05f65_story.html"

"In 2002, voters in California were asked to approve Proposition 52, which would have allowed people to register and vote on the same day. Backed by Democratic groups and opposed by Republicans, the proposal would have made it much easier to increase the vote from targeted demographics. Your candidate is supported heavily by older voters? Pull up a bus outside a nursing home, pack it full and drive to the polling place. Anyone not already registered could vote within minutes regardless. The proposal failed by a wide margin -- no doubt thanks to the fact that 2002 was an off-year election in which fewer Democrats vote.","September 15","3939","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/heres-why-california-republicans-oppose-a-measure-to-link-voter-registration-to-drivers-licenses/"

"Comparing data on the number of drivers licenses in each county in California with the number of people eligible to vote reveals that the two figures are generally the same.

"If you assume that unregistered voters would mirror registered voters in terms of party distribution, automatically registering everyone to vote would increase the number of Democrats, Republicans and third-party or independent voters by about 27 or 28 percent across the board.

"Right there, then, you can see why Republicans would be skeptical. But notice that this includes an assumption which might not be valid -- that unregistered voters would mirror registered voters in terms of party distribution. It's possible -- or probable -- that those who aren't registered to vote are younger and poorer than those who are. There's a correlation between stability and voter registration: Younger people move more and are less likely to own homes, for example, so their voter registration needs to be updated more regularly. And younger and less-wealthy people are also more likely to identify as Democrats. This means that assuming that the increase to each party or group would be the same is probably incorrect.","3947","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/heres-why-california-republicans-oppose-a-measure-to-link-voter-registration-to-drivers-licenses/"

"But even if more newly registered Democrats don't vote organically, the left can force the issue. Consider the example we used at the outset. Republicans also oppose the bill because of the prospect of Democrats driving buses not to senior centers but to areas with high densities of Democratic voters who might not usually turn out. Republicans tend to vote more consistently than Democrats, meaning that it's the left that needs to focus on increasing turnout -- and has developed established systems for that purpose. The process of getting your voters to the polls becomes much easier when you can assume that everyone in an area is registered to vote already. Making turning out Democratic votes easier is not in Republicans' interest.","3951","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/heres-why-california-republicans-oppose-a-measure-to-link-voter-registration-to-drivers-licenses/"

"It’s not clear this means more Republican voters than not will support the push to shut down the government. While Republicans back defunding Planned Parenthood, some polls show only minorities of them support a government shutdown to accomplish that goal. Of course, those minorities are probably louder and more important to the GOP presidential candidates than the other Republicans are.

It isn’t just that Clinton is using the new GOP quotes to tar it as a partisan exercise and attack its credibility, though that is a key goal. The Clinton camp is seeking to turn the investigation to her advantage in another way, by casting it as another in a series of trials and tribulations that she must overcome to earn the top job. The idea is to turn the ongoing Benghazi battle with Republicans into an emblem of her willingness to fight on in the face of determined opposition — thus playing to one of her strengths, i.e., perceptions of her tenaciousness.","3979","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/15/morning-plum-republicans-are-destroying-the-house-benghazi-probes-credibility-but-will-it-matter/"

But Dems were going to rally to her side in any case.

It’s the awkward nature of colorblindness; when you claim that you don’t see race, when in actuality you do.”","4002","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"But there is something else to the appeal of Carson among white Republicans. According to Rigueur, the lone African American Republican in the presidential nomination quest rhetorically goes where they dare not go.","4003","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"“I’d argue that a good portion of [Carson’s] popularity stems from his ability, as a black man, to say things that conservative [white] audiences get attacked for.” A prime example is Carson’s criticism of President Obama and the Affordable Care Act at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast. “This is actually not a new strategy — there’s a long history of African Americans rising in popularity and in esteem among white right-wing Republicans, so long as they are willing to say the controversial and uncomfortable things that white conservatives can’t say, especially along racial lines.”","4004","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"“I think it is also important to recognize that Carson is surging in the polls at the same time that ‘Black Lives Matter’ is gaining nationwide prominence,” Rigueur pointed out. “For the conservative public, not only is Carson a stark contrast to the Black Lives Matters crowd — he’s also willing to disparage that movement, which again, comforts conservative voters.” Carson unleashed a harsh, but rather thoughtful, assessment of the Black Lives Matter movement in a USA Today op-ed last week.","4005","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"Rigueur told me that Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, who died on Jan. 3, used the same approach in 1966. That’s the year he made history by becoming the first African American popularly elected to the U.S. Senate. “He publicly denounced Black Power advocates and advocated for ‘respectable’ protest (i.e. The Civil Rights Movement). His popularity among white Massachusetts voters immediately surged,” Rigueur said. “And despite his relatively liberal stance on open housing, he even gained the support of white anti-housing advocates; they overlooked his entire political agenda and simply honed in on what they liked.”","4006","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"In fact, Rigueur sees a lot of overlap between Carson and Brooke. “The strongest overlap that I see is that Carson has adopted the same moderate and middle-class approach to racial uplift, one that suggests that equality rests on behaving properly (or as I say in my book, “equal citizenship rested on an established moral code of acceptable black behaviors that fit within societal norms”),” she said in her e-mail. Of course, Democratic politicians practice respectability politics. But Rigueur told me the way Carson articulates his positions is “unique.”","4007","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"“Unlike other black politicians,” she said, “[Carson] has little interest in the broad societal reasons for inequality. For him, a lot of this boils down to personal accountability (with a little bit of racism). Which partly explains why he continues to reject ‘Black Lives Matters’ as a valid political movement.” Rigueur said another area of overlap between Carson and Brooke is how they tend to their base. But she noted one critical way they differ.","4008","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"There is another aspect to Carson’s rise that Rigueur said we must not overlook, his religious appeal. “This is a man who opened his campaign in May with a full-fledged black choir! Carson’s religious nature really comes out when he speaks and I think the idea of a religiously devout, “trustworthy” and brilliant doctor is appealing to a lot of potential voters,” she said. “He’s also incredibly safe. And by that I mean, Carson is far more mild-mannered and civil when compared to Donald Trump.” That’s for sure.","4009","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"

"But Rigueur told me the appeal Carson generates in the GOP “fall[s] by the wayside” once you look at the national electorate. “He doesn’t have the same appeal as say, Barack Obama in 2008. His politics and policy proposals render him unappealing to white liberals, nonwhite millennials, and women of all races,” she said. That being said, Rigueur said the future political prospects of “Gifted Hands” might be pretty good.","4011","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"Poll after poll shows Carson coming in second to Trump. But they also show him rising and leading his Republican-establishment competition by double digits. Many believe his poll vault is the result of his performance at the first GOP debate. I don’t know. I found him mumbly and dull at the Aug. 6 gathering. With his solid standing among the Republican Party base, Carson has a chance at next week’s debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to show that he is worthy of the support he has garnered.","4012","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"

"The 19th Amendment to the Constitution, of course, gave women the right to vote. It was passed by Congress on June 4, 1919, and ratified on Aug. 18, 1920. The president at the time was Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, and the Web site of the Democratic Party uses that hook to also lay claim to the trophy: “Under the leadership of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, the U.S. Constitution was amended to grant women the right to vote.”","4018","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/15/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-the-gop-is-the-party-of-womens-suffrage/"

"Activists for women’s rights had long made common cause with abolitionists but many were shocked that neither the 14th nor 15th amendments gave women the right to vote but instead remained focused on the rights of African American men. The failure to enshrine voting rights for women helped split the civil rights and women’s rights movements.","4020","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/15/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-the-gop-is-the-party-of-womens-suffrage/"
"Still, the GOP, which was responsible for the emancipation of slaves and dominated the presidency in the late 19th century, made a nod to the rights of women in its 1872 party platform: “The Republican party is mindful of its obligations to the loyal women of America for their noble devotion to the cause of freedom. Their admission to wider fields of usefulness is viewed with satisfaction, and the honest demand of any class of citizens for additional rights should be treated with respectful consideration.”","4021","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/15/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-the-gop-is-the-party-of-womens-suffrage/"
"Moreover, the words that would later become the 19th Amendment were first introduced in the Senate by a California Republican, Aaron A. Sargent, in 1878. But it was buried in committee for years and when it finally emerged for a vote, it was defeated 16 to 34 in 1887. Another vote in the Senate did not take place until 1914, even though supporters repeatedly introduced it in Congress.","4022","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/15/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-the-gop-is-the-party-of-womens-suffrage/"
"“Some Republicans were friends of woman suffrage and did introduce their bills and speak on their behalf,” said Alana Jeydel, a political science professor at American River College who exhaustively studied the debates in her 2004 book, “Political Women: The Women’s Movement, Political Institutions, the Battle for Women’s Suffrage and the ERA.” “But my research indicates that support was largely symbolic and the Republicans really tried to keep the woman suffragists at arm’s length while getting the 15th passed and ratified. And then after it is ratified the support (like the statement in the platform of 1872) was pretty symbolic. There was no serious attempt on the part of the Republican party to get a woman suffrage amendment passed.”","4023","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/15/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-the-gop-is-the-party-of-womens-suffrage/"
"Still, at the same time, there was even less support in the Democratic Party, then a bastion of Southern racists who already were actively thwarting the voting rights of black men just added to the constitution and thus had little incentive to let black women also win voting rights. The Democratic Party at the time also was considered the party of states’ rights.","4024","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/15/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-the-gop-is-the-party-of-womens-suffrage/"

"The progressive wing of the GOP increasingly became pro-suffrage. When ex-president Theodore Roosevelt broke off from the GOP and created the Progressive Party, the party platform fully endorsed the idea: “The Progressive party, believing that no people can justly claim to be a true democracy which denies political rights on account of sex, pledges itself to the task of securing equal suffrage to men and women alike.”","4026","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/15/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-the-gop-is-the-party-of-womens-suffrage/"
"By the 1916 presidential election, women were able to vote in enough states with 91 electoral votes, including New York (then with 45 electoral votes). Both the GOP and the Democrats added planks in their platforms in favor of suffrage, but on state-by-state basis.","4027","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/15/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-the-gop-is-the-party-of-womens-suffrage/"
"“The Republican party, reaffirming its faith in government of the people, by the people, for the people, as a measure of justice to one-half the adult people of this country, favors the extension of the suffrage to women, but recognizes the right of each state to settle this question for itself,” said the GOP platform.

"“Wilson very reluctantly comes around to support suffrage,” Jeydel said. “But he truly just doesn’t care about suffrage.” She said that militant wing of the movement embarrassed him with marches, violent protests and hunger strikes in prison, at a time when he wanted to concentrate on the conclusion of World War I.

"So Wilson, who previously had said that voting rights were a state issue that did not require the attention of the federal government, decided to call for passage of an amendment in a speech on Sept. 30, 1918. Sending the measure to the states for ratification, he reasoned, was in keeping with Democratic Party beliefs in states’ rights.","4030","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/15/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-the-gop-is-the-party-of-womens-suffrage/"
"But the measure fell two votes short in the Senate despite his plea. Meanwhile, the National American Woman Suffrage Association, in an effort to appear nonpartisan, targeted one Democratic senator and one Republican senator for defeat — and was successful in 1918. Further Democratic losses in the midterm elections shifted the balance of power, with the GOP winning narrow control of both the Senate and the House.","4031","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/15/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-the-gop-is-the-party-of-womens-suffrage/"

"“I would never call Wilson a convert. I would call him a pragmatist,” Jeydel said. “Yes, many Democrats voted for it, they could do so and look like they were supporting the war effort (and voting for it only meant it was going to the states). But overall, the progressives within the Republican Party were always the most supportive.”","4033","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/15/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-the-gop-is-the-party-of-womens-suffrage/"

"Broadly speaking, Fiorina gets her history right. The Republican Party was generally more supportive of suffrage, despite mainly paying it lip service, while Democrats, especially in the South, were hostile. Yes, a Democrat was president when the amendment passed, but he was boxed in on the issue — and the amendment only passed once Republicans took control of both houses of Congress. Calling the GOP “the party of women’s suffrage” might stretch the history a tad, but not enough for a full Pinocchio.","4035","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/15/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-the-gop-is-the-party-of-womens-suffrage/"

"Meanwhile, the candidate in second place, Ben Carson, is every bit Trump’s equal when it comes to policy ignorance, appalling statements, and the potential for a disastrous general election. The establishment’s early choice, Jeb Bush, has cratered, while its second choice, Marco Rubio, is creeping up slowly, but so far seems to be generating much more interest from funders and strategists than from actual voters.","4044","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/20/are-republican-voters-going-to-come-to-their-senses-about-donald-trump/"

"The trouble is that they don’t have much of a war plan, partly because “the establishment” is far less organized and unified than you might think, and partly because there are only so many tools at their disposal. There’s talk of a large TV ad campaign against Trump, built on “the political insiders’ unshakable faith that negative ads work.” You can also see that faith in this interview with longtime GOP strategist Mike Murphy, who’s running Jeb Bush’s “Right to Rise” Super PAC. Murphy’s argument for why Jeb is still the candidate to beat, despite the fact that his support has fallen to single digits and he’s now in fourth or fifth place in most polls, is essentially that Jeb will win because unlike the other candidates, he has a lot of money to run ads.","4046","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/20/are-republican-voters-going-to-come-to-their-senses-about-donald-trump/"
"Ads can work, in the right context (though they have a short half-life; their effect tends to fade quickly). But they’re not a guarantee of anything, particularly when you have a candidate who has performed as poorly as Jeb, whose latest genius campaign maneuver is getting into an argument with Trump about whether his brother was actually president when the September 11 attacks happened. And the truth is that while Jeb may have raised the most money, some other candidates aren’t doing too badly either, particularly Carson and Ted Cruz.","4047","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/20/are-republican-voters-going-to-come-to-their-senses-about-donald-trump/"
"In any case, the theory underlying not just Jeb’s candidacy but also Rubio’s is that eventually, the voters will come around to someone reasonable. They may need to be pushed in the right direction, but they can’t stick with the likes of Trump and Carson forever.

"All of which is true, but so far it hasn’t mattered. Trump is still leading, as he has from almost the moment he got into the race. As NBC News said this morning, “Donald Trump and Ben Carson are only getting STRONGER as we head into next week’s third GOP debate.” Nobody supporting Trump is unfamiliar with him; it’s getting less and less likely that an opponent will be able to say, “Did you know this about Trump?” and watch his support ebb away.

"Now, there are still hours to go, so they still could get such a moment, or perhaps even more.

"Now, it’s highly unlikely this moment actually has made much of a difference in the year and a half since it happened. Taken in context, it wasn’t as bad as it sounded.

The hapless Peter Roskam, Congressman from Illinois, unleashed a broadside against Clinton that was comically at odds with committee chairman Trey Gowdy’s repeated and emphatic declarations at the outset that this probe isn’t about her, no, really it isn’t! Gowdy and ranking Dem Elijah Cummings got into a virtual shouting match over the latter’s insistence that the committee release the full transcript of Sidney Blumenthal’s testimony, which as Brian Beutler notes was an “iconic moment” because the obsessive focus on Blumenthal is so revealing of this probe’s farcical nature to begin with.","4151","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/22/republicans-dont-get-the-big-benghazi-moment-they-fished-for/"

But perhaps not immediately, and perhaps not until after considerable accomplishment. The most knowledgeable, thoughtful conservative in the House is now likely to lead the House, which is the sign of an institution still capable of random acts of sanity.

"What might be called the Ryan Test — give me a meaningful job with a reasonable prospect of governing success and a shot at personal happiness or leave me the hell alone — applies most immediately to the workings of the House.

"Rather than an inconsistency, this is an expression of Ryan’s broader political outlook. He is proposing to strengthen mediating structures — in this case, committees that allow members to exert influence and make their voices heard — within an institution capable of, and interested in, governing.

"But the Ryan Test has a larger application. Ryan is essentially asking conservatives within the GOP: What is your actual goal?

"This has been the main question posed to Republicans since the wave election of 2010: governing or rage? The fault line is clearest in the choice of political enemies.

"The House Freedom Caucus has exemplified the demolition option. During the past five years, some 30 or 40 House members took up permanent residence off the reservation, denying Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) an effective House majority. Cruz has been their instigator. Conservative media, particularly talk radio, have provided incitement and attention. Some of these legislators, no doubt, are acting out of conviction.

"He's right. The governing dynamic of the two Republican presidential primaries conducted since the rise of the tea party movement in 2009/2010 has been the so-called establishment candidates calibrating everything they say and do to avoid angering a base that has shown a willingness to oust incumbents —albeit it at the House and Senate level — who show something less than total fealty to ""core"" principles.","4170","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/22/joe-scarborough-is-right-republicans-are-afraid-of-their-own-base/"

Walker's panoply of positions on immigration — most notably his impossible-to-follow series of answers on whether he believed in birthright citizenship — was a function of that same fear.

"The biggest mistake politicians make — and they just keep making it election after election! — is trying to hide, hedge or otherwise obfuscate how they feel about certain issues. It never works.

"The Spanish-language network Telemundo is in talks with the Democratic National Committee about possibly scheduling a new candidate forum with the Dem presidential candidates, after the Republican National Committee canceled its debate on NBC News and the NBC-owned Telemundo to protest CNBC’s handling of last week’s gathering, sources familiar with ongoing discussions tell me.","4186","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/02/morning-plum-republicans-shoot-themselves-in-foot-with-latinos-again/"
"If this comes to fruition, Democrats would effectively be moving into the breach created by the RNC’s decision.

"If Telemundo does hold a candidate forum with Democrats, it would not be a DNC-sanctioned debate, but rather a forum similar to the one being held by MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow this Friday in South Carolina. Thus, ultimately Telemundo would set up such a gathering in direct talks with the Democratic campaigns. But the DNC would offer organizational support, and the DNC appears to be generally supportive of the idea and is giving some input already.","4190","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/02/morning-plum-republicans-shoot-themselves-in-foot-with-latinos-again/"
"“If NBC and Telemundo host a forum for Democratic candidates we’d be happy to promote it, just as we have with others like the November 6th South Carolina forum with MSNBC,” Luis Miranda, the communications director for the DNC, tells me. “While we will not be sanctioning forums, we would be happy to help promote such events should they organize them.”","4191","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/02/morning-plum-republicans-shoot-themselves-in-foot-with-latinos-again/"
"It’s obviously possible that this won’t come to anything. The Democratic campaigns may decide the logistics are too daunting or that they don’t want to take time out of their campaigning schedules for it, or it could fall through for other reasons.","4192","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/02/morning-plum-republicans-shoot-themselves-in-foot-with-latinos-again/"
"But you’d think it would be a good idea for Democrats to try to make this happen. The RNC is claiming there will be another debate scheduled to replace the cancelled one on NBC and Telemundo. But RNC chair Reince Priebus has declined to say whether Telemundo would be included in the replacement debate. Obviously the RNC did not cancel this debate because of the Spanish-language network’s participation; it had many other reasons for doing so. But one consequence of this decision could be that Republicans end up holding no debate aired on a Spanish-language network. If Democrats do add a second such gathering, they would then be able to argue that they are far more interested in communicating with Latino voters than Republicans are, which is a good message for the general election.","4193","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/02/morning-plum-republicans-shoot-themselves-in-foot-with-latinos-again/"
"Indeed, one of the GOP campaigns — that of Jeb Bush — is actually protesting the decision to cancel the NBC/Telemundo debate, and demanding that Telemundo be reinstated, presumably because Latino outreach would be good not just for Jeb Bush, but for the GOP overall. Guess which GOP candidate is opposing a reinstatement of Telemundo? Yep: Donald Trump. All this comes after GOP establishment types went into full-scale panic earlier this fall over the damage Trump — with his call for mass deportations and suggestion that Mexican immigrants are rapists — may already be doing to the GOP brand among Latinos. And it comes as incoming House Speaker Paul Ryan is renewing his pledge not to act on immigration reform while Obama is president.","4194","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/02/morning-plum-republicans-shoot-themselves-in-foot-with-latinos-again/"

But let’s assume that isn’t going to happen. Before today’s hearing, it seemed that everyone — Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative — predicted that Republicans would fail to do her the kind of damage they hoped, and she would emerge triumphant.","October 22","4303","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/22/why-the-clinton-benghazi-testimony-isnt-accomplishing-what-republicans-hoped/"
"That does seem to be how things are developing, but for some less than obvious reasons.","4304","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/22/why-the-clinton-benghazi-testimony-isnt-accomplishing-what-republicans-hoped/"
"The committee’s Republicans found themselves in something of a quandary going into this hearing, which helps explain why committee chair Trey Gowdy spent most of his opening statement justifying the committee’s very existence. If they comported themselves the way members of Congress often do in this kind of hearing — angry, shouted questions, attempts at “gotchas” — they would have ended up looking worse than the person on the receiving end. But if they decided to be polite and substantive, they might avoid a public relations disaster, but their constituents and the right-wing media would be terribly disappointed — feeding the prevailing conservative narrative that their leaders in Congress are wimps who don’t have the courage to really go after Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton the way they should.","4305","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/22/why-the-clinton-benghazi-testimony-isnt-accomplishing-what-republicans-hoped/"
"But it goes farther than that. It’s important to remember that today’s hearing was a media event, in that it was staged for the purpose of being watched in the media. It wasn’t intended to obtain new information, and it hasn’t yet. And as a media event, its impact is tethered to the underlying truth of the issue in a way that hamstrings Republicans.","4306","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/22/why-the-clinton-benghazi-testimony-isnt-accomplishing-what-republicans-hoped/"
"If there were some truly damning piece of information that the committee had discovered about Clinton in the course of their investigation, then all the public relations and spin in the world wouldn’t save her from their efforts. For instance, for some time Republicans have been obsessed with a conspiracy theory which has it that Clinton issued a “stand down” order to the military, telling them not to go save the Americans who were in danger in Benghazi. Had that been something other than a bizarre fantasy of the most fevered quarters of the right, Benghazi would have been her undoing.","4307","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/22/why-the-clinton-benghazi-testimony-isnt-accomplishing-what-republicans-hoped/"
"But that turned out to be fiction, and all the other efforts to find some shocking malfeasance on her part failed. Why did it have such a profound effect when Kevin McCarthy justified the Benghazi committee’s work by saying it had brought down Clinton’s poll numbers? Not because he provided some theretofore unknown piece of information, or because everyone was shocked at the very idea that the committee was political. It had an impact because it supplied a vivid illustration of a fundamental truth. That meant reporters could repeat it, refer to it, and use it to frame their subsequent discussion of the issue.","4308","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/22/why-the-clinton-benghazi-testimony-isnt-accomplishing-what-republicans-hoped/"
"Let me make an analogy. During the Iran-Contra scandal — in which the Reagan administration sold arms to terrorists, then used the profits to fund an illegal war in Central America — Oliver North, who had been a Reagan administration official, testified in dramatic hearings before the committee investigating the matter. His testimony was judged a triumph at the time, the upright former military officer showing the blowhards in suits how real men act. But the fact was that North was a criminal — he admitted lying to Congress to conceal illegal activities, and was later convicted of that crime and of obstructing justice (his conviction was overturned because of the clever immunity agreement his lawyers struck with Congress). North’s dramatic testimony didn’t save the Reagan administration from accountability for the scandal, and when he ran for Senate in Virginia in 1994, he lost (in a year of a huge Republican sweep). His reputation as a liar who believed he was above the law was a key reason.","4309","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/22/why-the-clinton-benghazi-testimony-isnt-accomplishing-what-republicans-hoped/"
"North may have gone on to a lucrative career as a right-wing radio and television figure, but when it came to the politics, he lost, no matter how well his Iran-Contra testimony went from a short-term public relations standpoint.","4310","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/22/why-the-clinton-benghazi-testimony-isnt-accomplishing-what-republicans-hoped/"
"Does that mean that media events don’t make any difference? Not at all. But it does mean that there’s only so much a particular media event can accomplish when the message it sends is fundamentally at odds with the facts. That’s particularly true when there is ample time for the facts to get out, circulate, and influence the rest of the debate and discussion around the issue.","4311","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/22/why-the-clinton-benghazi-testimony-isnt-accomplishing-what-republicans-hoped/"
"Because we repeat and remember those media moments, we often assume that it was the moment itself that shaped subsequent events — that everyone watched it on television, and at that instant their minds were changed. But that’s seldom if ever how it works.","4312","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/22/why-the-clinton-benghazi-testimony-isnt-accomplishing-what-republicans-hoped/"
"It’s too early to say exactly how we’ll remember this hearing. Perhaps because it has (so far) lacked any fiery moments that make for good sound bites, it will get discussed only for a day or two and then fade from memory. If this hearing does provide a coda to this controversy, it will surely become a symbol for conservatives of how feckless and ineffectual their congressional leaders are, and a symbol for liberals of Republicans’ obsession with faux scandals.","4313","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/22/why-the-clinton-benghazi-testimony-isnt-accomplishing-what-republicans-hoped/"

"Under the plan discussed in a series of closed-door meetings held Thursday by Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), the House would immediately start the process of attempting to end federal funds for Planned Parenthood through a process known as budget reconciliation, according to House GOP aides.

"Republican presidential candidates spent a lot of time this week hammering out a list of demands for television networks, in hopes of improving the quality of upcoming debates. Which is interesting, because there’s no evidence that the debates -- while certainly frustrating for the candidates at times -- are hurting the GOP’s chances of winning back the White House next year.","November 6","4339","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/06/dear-republicans-no-those-biased-debates-arent-hurting-you-at-all/"

"Presidential primary debates, believe it or not, weren’t designed to be ratings bonanzas for television networks. They’re supposed to help the political parties who sponsor them. Theoretically, the debates should do this in two ways: By giving primary voters more information to help them select a candidate, and by introducing the candidates to voters outside the party who might be persuaded to vote for them in the general election. Ideally, that introduction would help the party’s candidates win swing voters, not hurt them.","4341","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/06/dear-republicans-no-those-biased-debates-arent-hurting-you-at-all/"
"On the first point, the Republican primary debates appear to be succeeding. They’ve produced greater awareness of lesser-known candidates, including the rise of Carly Fiorina, which shows GOP voters are responding to what they see the candidates saying to each other on screen (or at least to news reports and commentary around the debates).","4342","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/06/dear-republicans-no-those-biased-debates-arent-hurting-you-at-all/"
"The debates also are not exacting any significant damage to candidates’ reputations with political independents, according to Gallup data provided to the Washington Post. Since July, Gallup has been tracking candidate favorable ratings in daily national surveys, and it kindly broke down how Republicans have fared in three time periods: 1) Before the first debate 2) between the second and third debates, and 3) between the second and third debates. (We’ll look at the impact of the third debate a bit later).","4343","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/06/dear-republicans-no-those-biased-debates-arent-hurting-you-at-all/"
"The chart below shows ""net favorable"" ratings for each candidate at these three time periods - the percent rating each favorable minus the percent unfavorable (the higher the better). The flattish lines indicate candidates’ popularity did not shift much after debates. On average, Republican candidates’ net favorable ratings among independents shifted 0.2 points, basically no change at all. One big bonus of Gallup’s tracking survey is sample size -- results are based on at least 1,800 independents interviewed during each time period for almost all candidates.","4344","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/06/dear-republicans-no-those-biased-debates-arent-hurting-you-at-all/"
"Don't squint too hard to spot movement -- the chart below zeroes in on the statistically significant changes. The debates appeared to have helped Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina, whose net favorable ratings among independents rose by +8 and +7 respectively from before the first debate to after the second. The story is worst for Rand Paul, whose popularity has sunk over the same period by negative-11 on net favorability, from +5 to -6.","4345","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/06/dear-republicans-no-those-biased-debates-arent-hurting-you-at-all/"
"None of these are gigantic shifts in opinion – for example, all these changes are smaller than if a candidate’s favorable-unfavorable split went from 50-50 to 56-44 (a swing of +12). Carson also started off as the most popular by this metric and Trump the least popular. That’s still the same.","4346","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/06/dear-republicans-no-those-biased-debates-arent-hurting-you-at-all/"
"While debate season hasn’t altered candidates’ positive/negative images very much, they have become better-known to political independents. Before the first debate, 49 percent of political independents had a positive or negative impression the average Republican candidate tested in Gallup’s polling. That was up to 57 percent after two debates. The biggest rises in familiarity were for Fiorina (+22) and Carson (+19), while others were are up by single digits. Despite the higher ratings, there is still a massive range in familiarity with candidates, ranging from only 33 percent who are familiar with Ohio Gov. John Kasich to 87 percent familiar with Trump.","4347","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/06/dear-republicans-no-those-biased-debates-arent-hurting-you-at-all/"
"And what about that third debate, last week on CNBC, which so enraged Republican candidates and pundits? A different set of polls -- from Quinnipiac University -- suggests it also did not hurt GOP candidates with independents.","4348","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/06/dear-republicans-no-those-biased-debates-arent-hurting-you-at-all/"
"Quinnipiac found that the GOP candidates analyzed above gained, on average, two points of net favorability among independent registered voters from the time after the second debate to after the third debate. (It also found a much larger boost from the debates as a whole than Gallup -- an average net favorability increase of 5.9 percent from before Debate No. 1 to after Debate No. 3.) The bigger shifts could be a result of smaller sample size, as Quinnipiac’s surveys included several hundred independents, while Gallup surveyed more than 1,800 at each time period for almost all candidates. In better news for Paul, Quinnipiac showed he recovered some ground after the latest debate.","4349","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/06/dear-republicans-no-those-biased-debates-arent-hurting-you-at-all/"
"If there’s any complaint for Republicans in the debates, then, it might be that they’re not helping the field enough. Gallup still shows independents view the GOP candidates, on average, more unfavorably than favorably. Quinnipiac shows the candidates are view just slightly more favorably than not. In both cases, though, most candidates' ratings are at least holding steady – even as they're not nearly as high as the party probably would like them to be.","4350","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/06/dear-republicans-no-those-biased-debates-arent-hurting-you-at-all/"
"The Gallup polls were conducted among national samples of U.S. adults interviewed on landline and cellular phones. Sample sizes range somewhat for different candidates as each was not asked of the full sample. For each candidate, favorable ratings were measured among at least 1,800 self-identified independents during the pre-debate period (July 8-Aug. 6); there were at least 2,300 respondents for all candidates between the first and second debates (Aug. 7-Sept. 16), and at least 1,150 interviews for each candidate between the second and third debates (Sept. 17-Oct. 28).","4351","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/06/dear-republicans-no-those-biased-debates-arent-hurting-you-at-all/"
"INSTEAD OF adding his name to the already long list of people running for president, Vice President Biden pleaded Wednesday for something the country has in desperately short supply: functional, cooperative government. “I don’t think we should look at Republicans as our enemies,” Mr. Biden said. “For the sake of the country, we have to work together. . . .

"Mr. Biden’s comments were an implicit criticism of Hillary Clinton, who offhandedly styled Republicans as her enemies during last week’s Democratic debate. But his message was double-edged: In order for Democrats to work with Republicans, Republicans have to be willing to cooperate. Even with Rep.

"As Mr. Biden delivered his remarks Wednesday, Mr. Ryan was meeting with Republicans across Capitol Hill. The previous evening, he issued a demand: In return for accepting the top job in the House, Mr. Ryan insisted he get widespread support in the GOP caucus and that lawmakers agree to a rules change making it harder to oust the speaker. “It is our duty to make the tough decisions this country needs to get back on track,” he said, promising “results.”","4354","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/making-the-house-republicans-behave/2015/10/21/5da428c0-7838-11e5-a958-d889faf561dc_story.html"
"Yet Mr. Ryan didn’t tell his caucus what he would really need from it to make the tough decisions the country requires. The nation faces national default and disgrace next month if Congress fails to raise the debt limit. Even if Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) forced through an increase before Mr. Ryan took over, the issue would come up again. Mr. Ryan did not mention this crucial issue, even obliquely. Nor did he mention the ruinously foolish budget caps that have shortchanged defense and domestic spending, nor the seemingly constant threat of government shutdown over hot-button side issues.","4355","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/making-the-house-republicans-behave/2015/10/21/5da428c0-7838-11e5-a958-d889faf561dc_story.html"
"Whoever leads the GOP in Congress must be clear: Republicans can nudge the country in the direction they want to go, but they can’t drag it kicking and screaming. If a legislative deal leans 60 percent in the GOP’s direction and avoids the threat of default or shutdown, that is a Republican victory. Declining to take the country’s full faith and credit hostage is not weakness, it is wisdom. Toughness means taking votes that the bloviators on talk radio will not like, not just those that pass a conservative purity test.","4356","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/making-the-house-republicans-behave/2015/10/21/5da428c0-7838-11e5-a958-d889faf561dc_story.html"
"Mr. Ryan has shown he appreciates these points. As elements of the perpetually outraged right wing have pointed out, he voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Program when the economy depended on it. He worked with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to craft a compromise budget that, while deeply imperfect, gave the country a rest from near-constant budget acrimony. Though his position isn’t crystal clear, he has supported the sort of comprehensive immigration reform that most Americans favor and that the country requires.","4357","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/making-the-house-republicans-behave/2015/10/21/5da428c0-7838-11e5-a958-d889faf561dc_story.html"
"“It’s not too late to save the American idea,” Mr. Ryan said Tuesday, “but we are running out of time.” As much as anything else, the American idea is that a religiously, ethnically, ideologically diverse group of people can govern themselves through common allegiance to a political system that requires compromise. A powerful bloc in Congress’s majority party refuses to accept this idea, and the fuse on national default is burning low. If Mr. Ryan is to be an effective speaker, he must be clearer about what true GOP leadership would look like.","4358","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/making-the-house-republicans-behave/2015/10/21/5da428c0-7838-11e5-a958-d889faf561dc_story.html"

"Why is that? Because the GOP voters are fed up, not just with President Obama and the Democrats but also with their own party. A Fox News poll found that 62 percent of Republicans feel “betrayed” by their party, and two-thirds believe the GOP leadership has not done anything to stop the Obama agenda. A recent Monmouth University poll found that, by a more-than-2-to-1 margin, Republican voters say the country needs a president “from outside government who can bring a new approach to Washington” rather than “someone with government experience who knows how to get things done.”","4361","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/chaos-in-house-is-good-for-gop/2015/10/12/c2765450-70e8-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"In this atmosphere, promoting the next guy on the totem pole would have sent a message that the House GOP was completely out of touch. McCarthy would have been, in effect, a continuation of Boehner’s speakership. And if you elect the same leadership team, you get the same results: a speaker who can’t get Republicans to stick together on big votes, and thus has to rely on Democrats to get a deal. That produces more liberal outcomes — which, in turn, makes the GOP base even more frustrated and angry.","4362","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/chaos-in-house-is-good-for-gop/2015/10/12/c2765450-70e8-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"McCarthy’s decision not to seek the speaker’s job creates an opportunity to break this cycle by electing a consensus candidate supported by both the Freedom Caucus and the GOP rankandfile who has a chance to actually unify Republicans, and hold together 218 votes — which would produce more conservative results.","4363","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/chaos-in-house-is-good-for-gop/2015/10/12/c2765450-70e8-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"The Freedom Caucus has done the GOP a big favor by shaking up the speaker’s race.

"Some people prefer to be in the minority. Being the brave remnant defending truth without compromise against overwhelming opposition has its attractions.

"To do that, the Freedom Caucus needs to use its newfound leverage wisely. It has enough votes to deny the speakership to the wrong candidate, but it does not have enough votes to elect its own candidate. That means the Freedom Caucus eventually is going to have to back a consensus candidate. So pick the most conservative candidate who can win the support of both conservatives and rank-and-file Republicans and reach an understanding with the next speaker on a bold but realistic conservative agenda. Then promise to fully back him or her in the fight to enact it.","4366","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/chaos-in-house-is-good-for-gop/2015/10/12/c2765450-70e8-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"In the next few months, the GOP will face difficult votes on raising the debt ceiling and funding the government. No speaker can get everything conservatives want so long as Obama still wields his veto pen and Senate Democrats still have a filibuster. But by working together, the Freedom Caucus and the next speaker can force Democrats to accept far more conservative outcomes than Boehner was able to achieve. And just as important, they can lay the groundwork for a positive, hopeful conservative agenda that the next Republican president can enact.","4367","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/chaos-in-house-is-good-for-gop/2015/10/12/c2765450-70e8-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"But that is not going to happen if the next speaker is asked to fly kamikaze missions with his own troops shooting from the ground.

So they push for laws to allow guns to be brought into as many places as possible — schools, government buildings, churches, anywhere and everywhere. They advocate “stand your ground” laws that encourage people to use guns to settle arguments. They seek both open-carry and concealed-carry laws on a “shall issue” basis (meaning the government presumes that you should get the license unless it can prove you fall into certain categories of offenders) to put guns in as many hands as possible.","4419","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carson-perfectly-explains-the-republican-position-on-guns/"

In 2013, the latest year for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released data, 11,208 Americans were murdered with guns, and 505 Americans died due to accidental firearm discharge. Another 21,175 Americans killed themselves with guns (having a gun in the home dramatically increases one’s risk of suicide), for a total of 32,888 gun deaths.","4423","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carson-perfectly-explains-the-republican-position-on-guns/"
"But unlike their position on terrorism, the position that the entire Republican Party now adopts — not necessarily all its voters, but virtually all its elected representatives — is that a toll that size is simply not meaningful enough to justify any action to not even restrict, but merely to inconvenience Americans’ ability to own as many guns as they want and to get them as easily as they want. Presumably there would be some level of carnage that would make even Republicans sign on to gun restrictions — say if a million Americans every year were being shot down, or 5 million or 10 million. But 33,000 a year? Not a big enough deal.","4424","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carson-perfectly-explains-the-republican-position-on-guns/"

"— Back when John Paul II was pope, conservatives relished attacking Democrats as “Cafeteria Catholics” for picking and choosing the church teachings that fit their politics. In 2004, the archbishop of St. Louis warned John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, “not to present himself for communion” because of his support for abortion rights. That cycle, the conservative Sioux Falls bishop ordered Tom Daschle to stop describing himself as a member of the Catholic Church, a breathtaking directive that Republicans used in their campaign to topple the then-Senate minority leader.","4427","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/09/21/the-daily-202-pope-francis-visit-puts-republicans-on-the-defensive/"

Two-thirds of American Catholics said in a Washington Post-ABC poll that it’s appropriate during his congressional address for the pope to urge action on social, economic and environmental issues. Only 13 percent of Catholics want the pope to be less active on such issues, compared to 30 percent who wish he was more active and 52 percent who want him to stay the course. Our poll found that only 55 percent of U.S. adults view the Catholic Church favorably, but 70 percent see Francis positively.

Growing up with the stories of his family’s trials and fresh starts, Jorge [now Pope Francis] would always have a special concern for vulnerable migrants. As cardinal, he had a close bond with Paraguayans and Bolivians in the slums of Buenos Aires, and he has made making room for the stranger a cornerstone of his teaching as pope, insisting that anti-immigrant countries that tighten or close their borders simply turn nearby oceans and deserts into cemeteries for those who die trying to get there….

"I’m telling you, folks, if you think Donald Trump’s demagoguery on immigration has created problems for Republicans, just wait until he unveils his next act. If we get a Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, Trump may well roll out a whole new story about how Republicans and Democrats alike are conspiring with a shadowy cabal of international elites to help China and other foreign countries continue destroying the living standards of American workers.","October 1","4497","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/01/morning-plum-donald-trump-is-just-getting-started-republicans/"
"It turns out Republicans are very worried about this.","4498","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/01/morning-plum-donald-trump-is-just-getting-started-republicans/"
"The New York Times reports this morning that talks have resumed on the massive Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal. This is often cast as a divisive issue in the Democratic presidential primary, which it certainly could end up being. But as I’ve argued, it could also produce serious divisions in the GOP presidential primary. Though it has received surprisingly little attention, Trump has previously attacked the TPP, and the Times’ Jackie Calmes makes these crucial points:","4499","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/01/morning-plum-donald-trump-is-just-getting-started-republicans/"
"The TPP may be debated in Congress precisely when the voting is fully underway in the GOP presidential primaries. And Republican leaders are worried that Trump’s rhetoric against “free trade” will create complications for the party’s Senate incumbents, who would presumably want to vote to pass the deal. But that’s not all: the TPP could also provide Trump with a weapon to wield against his GOP rivals. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio support it. By contrast, Trump has railed against the TPP by warning that China will be given back-door access to the deal, further enabling China’s ongoing ripoff of American workers, and against international “free trade” deals in general by claiming we are being “defrauded” by other countries.","4500","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/01/morning-plum-donald-trump-is-just-getting-started-republicans/"
"And in another signal, Trump gave an interview to John Harwood in which he claimed we are getting taken to the cleaners by a number of other countries, particularly China’s currency manipulation and tariffs. “Countries are taking advantage of us, big league,” Trump said. Thus, his attacks on the TPP could be seamlessly woven into the broader story that Trump is already telling, in which immigrants are to blame for the suffering of American workers. Trump can simply add international trade-negotiating elites, their enablers among the GOP presidential candidates and among Republicans and Democrats in Congress — and a new version of the Chinese menace, which he has been heartily bashing already — to the cast of villains. (There will be plenty of legitimate reasons to criticize the TPP; Trump will likely opt for a lurid and xenophobic tack.)","4501","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/01/morning-plum-donald-trump-is-just-getting-started-republicans/"
"If Trump does go this route, it will be interesting to watch, because it will test the assumption that GOP primary voters (many of whom already appear to agree with the tale he’s telling about illegal immigrants) agree with GOP orthodoxy on “free trade.” As Ron Brownstein has explained, Trump has built a particularly firm foundation among blue collar Republican voters. And Ed Kilgore has noted that Rust Belt and southern conservatives tend to be alienated by internationalist free trade talk. Who will these voters listen to on the Trans Pacific Partnership — Jeb Bush, who is trying to talk in reasonable tones about the virtues of lowering international trade barriers, or billionaire Trump, who is warning that foreign elites are looking to rip off American workers even more than they have done already?","4502","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/01/morning-plum-donald-trump-is-just-getting-started-republicans/"

If so, why are Republicans again threatening to shut down the government, this time over the issue of funding Planned Parenthood?

"Others have addressed the chances of a shutdown and how we got to this point. Still, the question remains: why again? Why does Congress find itself once again facing the prospects of failing to fund the government? Why are hard-core conservatives in the House and Senate threatening to take the government hostage in pursuit of a policy priority — even with partisan and policy losses fresh in their minds?","4520","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"Several considerations come to mind:","4521","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"First, conditions are ripe for continued GOP defections from party leaders’ agendas. Call it the plague of large majorities.","4522","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"Republicans in November celebrated the largest GOP House majority since the late 1920s. But large majorities are not all they’re cracked up to be. They tend to be more diverse, more fractured — as evidenced by the newly organized Freedom Caucus instigating the move to defund Planned Parenthood. A quick glance at the makeup of the Freedom Caucus drives home ideological divisions within the GOP conference.","4523","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"The figure below shows that the Freedom Caucus roster (as reported by Roll Call in the summer) is significantly more conservative than the rest of the GOP conference. So, too, are the GOP lawmakers who were rolled when their party finally gave in during the winter to fund homeland security programs.","4524","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"Party size matters: The larger the majority’s margin, the less costly for any individual lawmaker to break ranks. For example, the number of defectors on the vote to return John Boehner (R-Ohio) to the speakership more than doubled between 2013 and 2015. Perhaps opposition grew. But just as likely, the cost of challenging the Speaker declined: with a larger majority, the conference could afford more defections without upsetting the conference’s commitment to reelect Boehner. If so, joining a rebellious coalition to challenge party leaders by threatening to shut down the government over narrow policy demands remains an attractive strategy.","4525","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"Second, as David Mayhew long ago observed, the “electoral payment [for members of Congress] is for positions rather than for effects.” A politician’s supporters more likely hold lawmakers accountable for the positions they take than for policy outcomes that result. In other words, holding governing funding hostage to defunding Obamacare, homeland security, and Planned Parenthood makes perfect sense for a House member playing to his or her partisan base rather than to the broader public.","4526","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"Viewed in this light, there’s definitely education in the second kick of a mule: Conservative Republicans could see such past episodes as political successes even if the party brand name took a beating at the time. GOP electoral gains in 2014 surely reinforce such positive perceptions. Heading down into the box canyon — not getting out — is the whole point.","4527","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"Third, the rules of the game encourage rebellious behavior by small factions in both chambers. It is now old hat to observe that Republican majorities need Democratic votes to secure supermajorities for passage in the Senate. But McConnell can make a bipartisan coalition without the votes of Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) or Rand Paul (R-Ky.) from the far right of his conference, lawmakers who would support defunding Planned Parenthood even at the cost of shutting down the government.","4528","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"Ironically, House rules also encourage conservatives to take government funding hostage. To be sure, House rules allow cohesive majorities to pass bills without any votes from the minority. But in each past battle over must-pass measures to fund the government or raise the debt ceiling, Democrats came to the rescue when significant numbers of Republicans refused to vote for leader-negotiated compromise.","4529","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"Republicans by now have surely learned that their leaders are ultimately likely to cave to move toward the middle — to avoid a Senate filibuster or a presidential veto. Again, there is indeed education in the second kick of the mule: refusing to compromise forces leaders to the center, but allows rebels to avoid blame for leaders’ concessions.","4530","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"Eventually, House party leaders find Democratic votes to secure must-pass bills, freeing a majority of their conference to vote against the deal. Party leaders and more moderate Republicans show their governing instincts while rank and file claim credit for sticking to their principles. Win-win!","4531","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"

"Understanding why Republicans might go back into the box canyon doesn’t tell us the chances that they will. I tend to think that the conflict over Planned Parenthood could be resolved relatively quickly. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has already named her price: if GOP leaders publicly commit to negotiations to loosen the 2011 spending caps that are due to be tightened in fiscal year 2016.","4533","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"In fact, such negotiations are arguably more important to Democrats than to Republicans. The Ryan-Murray 2o13 budget deal that raised spending caps for two years is about to expire, which allows stricter spending caps under the 2011 Budget Control Act (BCA) to kick in. At stake are tough cuts to both domestic and defense discretionary spending. However, as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities points out, backdoor defense spending via the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO account) relieves some pressure on Republicans to negotiate with Democrats to relieve the caps (since OCO funds are exempt from cuts under the BCA).","4534","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"In the absence of a new deal, lawmakers could write a full year continuing resolution (“CR”) that continues last year’s funding levels but would be subject to sequestration cuts under the 2011 BCA; OCO funds however would lessen the pain on the defense side of the ledger, leaving Democrats’ domestic programs to bear a disproportionate brunt of the cuts.","4535","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"
"Democrats have a strong incentive to get Republicans to the negotiating table in the fall. Although Democrats arguably have more to gain from a deal, they also have a Democratic filibuster and presidential veto on their side. My hunch is that if there are fireworks in Congress in the fall over funding the government, the more dramatic brinkmanship could occur later over renegotiating the BCA caps rather than over a half-billion dollars for Planned Parenthood.","4536","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/16/this-is-why-some-republicans-keep-threatening-to-take-the-government-hostage/"

Boehner tried to rally the GOP conference behind a plan that would allow the debt limit to be raised while extracting a number of concessions from the Obama administration.

Clinton’s national favorable numbers have fluctuated up and down over the years, and are currently on a downswing as she re-enters the political arena; meanwhile, it’s not surprising that her personal numbers among Democrats remain high, since she has that long history as a public official and is widely seen as the likely Dem nominee.","4561","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/14/republicans-think-donald-trump-is-trustworthy-empathetic-and-well-suited-to-presidency/"

That media attention regularly broadcasts images of Trump spewing vaguely Republican-sounding talking points (most of the time, anyway) about things like immigration and China (in addition to all of the insults), which could be helping to create generally positive attitudes towards him.

"Norman Ornstein has a good piece recapping the history that led us to this point.

E.J. Dionne, meanwhile, notes that the feeding of those forces has made the conservative grassroots even less willing to accept the basic structural explanation for the GOP’s inability to roll back the hated Obama agenda and its reconfiguration of America, i.e., Republicans lack the votes to overcome Dem filibusters or Obama vetoes.

"Today Cecile Richards, the head of Planned Parenthood, testified before Congress amid a scrum of cameras and spectators. Hearings like this one are of course not about fact-finding but are created as media events, in the sense that they exist only for the purpose of being broadcast. They allow members of Congress to attempt to get on the evening news, and both parties hope what comes out of the hearing will aid their side in an ongoing controversy, in this case the question of whether the government should “defund” Planned Parenthood (and whether Republicans should shut down the government over it).","September 29","4697","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/29/todays-planned-parenthood-hearing-shows-why-republicans-will-lose-on-this-issue/"

"Let me take just one exchange. Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most conservative members of the House, used his time shouting at Richards because she admitted at one point that she had originally “apologized for the tone and statements” in the “sting” videos that started this controversy. Apparently Jordan imagined that in making this admission, she had fallen into a trap and would now have to admit that Planned Parenthood had committed some kind of misconduct. Watching his voice get louder and louder, it seemed as though Jordan was thinking, “I’ve really got her now.” But what did he actually prove?

"Nor did any of the other Republicans. All seemed to have some very specific question they had prepared, one that was designed to produce a “gotcha” moment. But Richards didn’t have any trouble answering any of them, because the accusations that drove them aren’t all that controversial unless your starting point is that abortion is evil and so is anything in any way connected to it.

"Republicans are trying to make a two-stage argument here. The first is that Planned Parenthood is bad. If they can convince the public of that — a challenge in itself, particularly when so many women have personal experience with the organization — then they need to convince the public further that Planned Parenthood is so bad that keeping it from getting any Medicaid reimbursements (which make up the bulk of the organization’s federal funding) is worth shutting down the government over.","4703","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/29/todays-planned-parenthood-hearing-shows-why-republicans-will-lose-on-this-issue/"

"You may remember that a couple of months ago when it became clear that Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was more than just a momentary bit of entertainment, parts of the GOP swung into action. They found the idea of Trump becoming the Republican nominee horrifying, not just because of his imperfect commitment to conservative dogma, but because he’d be almost certain to lose, delivering the White House to a Democrat who would probably be Hillary Clinton.","November 9","4767","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/09/why-arent-republicans-trying-to-figure-out-how-to-take-out-ben-carson/"
"So they huddled together to come up with a plan. “Top strategists for Trump’s rivals and some corporate and conservative interests are working with opposition researchers, messaging experts, and focus-group gurus to find some plausible scheme to end what has already become an enduring nightmare for much of the Republican establishment: Donald Trump, Front-Runner,” wrote Mark Halperin in September. Wall Street wrung its hands. Bill Kristol said that if Trump were the nominee, he’d support a third-party candidate. The Club for Growth dropped a million dollars into ads attacking Trump in Iowa. Anti-Trump super PACs were planned.","4768","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/09/why-arent-republicans-trying-to-figure-out-how-to-take-out-ben-carson/"
"This campaign hasn’t amounted to much, probably because those insiders just couldn’t figure out how to take Trump on in an effective way.

"You don’t have to think that the questions now consuming the media about the accuracy of the stories Carson has told about his youth are particularly important (I don’t) to see that in the unlikely event that he became the Republican nominee, the party would go down to a defeat of historic proportions. He has never run for office before, and that inexperience becomes more evident every day. His ignorance about policy and penchant for outlandish and wildly inaccurate statements will continue to cause controversy. Inattentive voters have yet to get the full picture of just how bonkers Carson’s views are, whether it’s about the pyramids or America’s resemblance to Nazi Germany, or the fact that whatever conspiracy theory you might believe in, Carson believes in that one and three others. His focused appeal to religious Christian conservatives can be effective in Republican primaries, but would be a sure loser in a general election where a diverse populace goes to the polls.","4770","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/09/why-arent-republicans-trying-to-figure-out-how-to-take-out-ben-carson/"

"That isn’t to say there haven’t been any glimmers of dissent from conservatives. Today, Michael Brendan Dougherty writes at The Week that evangelicals are making a mistake by backing an amateur like Carson, since he “is diverting monetary, emotional, and organizational resources away from the real long-term work of evangelical politics.” Ross Douthat of the New York Times made a similar argument in September, writing: “From Pat Robertson in 1988 through thin-on-policy figures like Mike Huckabee, Sarah Palin, even Michele Bachmann briefly in 2012, the evangelical tendency has been to look for a kind of godly hero, a Christian leader who could win the White House and undo every culture-war defeat.” Back in January, National Review published a critical piece examining Carson’s relationship with Mannatech, a company that uses multi-level marketing (which you might consider a pyramid scheme, and not the kind used for storing grain) to sell its “glyconutrient” supplements.","4772","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/09/why-arent-republicans-trying-to-figure-out-how-to-take-out-ben-carson/"
"But these are the exceptions, not the rule.

"One reason might be that they’re confident Carson’s campaign will implode all on its own. And they’re probably right about that. Novice candidates with narrow appeals have succeeded in moving to the front of presidential campaigns for a brief period, but always end up flaming out. Carson is raising huge amounts of money, but spending most of it on the fundraising itself, suggesting that his chances of succeeding over the long haul are not great.","4774","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/09/why-arent-republicans-trying-to-figure-out-how-to-take-out-ben-carson/"
"Another reason may have to do with race. Republicans may be reluctant to wage a scorched-earth campaign of destruction against one of the few prominent black conservatives, particularly given how important those figures are to arguing against liberals on the topic of race. As far as the right is concerned, Ben Carson is a living rebuke not only to claims that the GOP exploits racism to win elections, but to everything the other side says about the issue. Here’s what Janell Ross recently wrote about what Carson represents to Republicans:","4775","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/09/why-arent-republicans-trying-to-figure-out-how-to-take-out-ben-carson/"
"Many conservatives today are convinced that actual racism is a thing of the past, and the only real racism that remains is when white conservatives are unfairly accused of being racists. Carson, in turn, blames almost every problem that exists on “political correctness.” Not only doesn’t he acknowledge the barely-hidden racial undertone of so many attacks on Barack Obama (like over whether Obama is actually an American), he calls Obama a “psychopath.” When liberals say that the legacy of racism still makes it harder for African-Americans to succeed, conservatives can counter that Carson succeeded, so anyone who can’t make it has only their defective character to blame, or maybe the government that put them in a hammock of dependency.","4776","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/09/why-arent-republicans-trying-to-figure-out-how-to-take-out-ben-carson/"
"So even once his campaign comes to an unsuccessful end, Republicans are still going to want to have Ben Carson around. And as he defends himself against charges of autobiographical embellishment, he’s playing on conservative beliefs about the liberal media, no matter how absurd his claim that he’s the first front-running candidate to ever have his past pored over by reporters. To attack Carson now could seem like a validation of the press’ investigations of him.","4777","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/09/why-arent-republicans-trying-to-figure-out-how-to-take-out-ben-carson/"
"My guess is that all those factors play a role. But let’s say Carson survives this round of controversy and remains the front-runner. It’s entirely possible that he’ll win the Iowa caucus, and as usual, everyone will temporarily forget that the GOP Iowa winner usually loses the nomination (as Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee did). Carson will be on the front page of every newspaper, declared a heroic victor. The prospect of him being the nominee will start to seem like a real possibility. Will those in the Republican Party who have some sense finally turn on him then?","4778","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/09/why-arent-republicans-trying-to-figure-out-how-to-take-out-ben-carson/"

"The weak tea being served by the Republican mainstream explains Trump’s staying power.

"I owe this insight to writer John Judis, who reached back to Warren’s idea in a recent National Journal article that is the best explanation so far for the Trump phenomenon.

"Trump has also played on racial tensions.
