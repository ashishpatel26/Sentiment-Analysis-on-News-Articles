"Why did she choose to rely solely on a private account? ""A convenience,"" she said, so she wouldn't have to carry both a governmental and a personal ""device"" to read e-mails. ""I thought it would be simpler,"" she said, adding, ""Obviously, it hasn't worked out that way.""","88","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/first-take-hillary-clinton-emails/24705871/"

"But by the time she walked away after 21 minutes, her deliberate, even tone had taken on an edge of exasperation — a sign, perhaps, of the fact that she is out of practice in the rough-and-tumble of a news conference.

"Like Secretaries of State before her, Secretary Clinton used her own email account when engaging with State Department officials. For work, it was her practice to email them on their "".gov"" accounts, with every expectation those emails would be captured and preserved immediately in the Department's system.","334","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"When the Department asked former Secretaries last year for help ensuring that their work emails were in fact retained, she said yes and provided printed copies of all of her work-related emails. She has since asked the Department to make the emails she provided available to the public.","335","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"

"As the Secretary has said publicly, when she got to the Department, she wanted the simplicity of using one device. She opted to use her personal email account as a matter of convenience; it enabled her to reach people quickly and keep in regular touch with her family and friends more easily given her travel schedule. That is the only reason she used her own account. Her usage was widely known to the over 100 Department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed, as her address was visible on every email she sent. To address requirements to keep records of her work emails, it was her practice to email government officials on their "".gov"" accounts. That way, they would be immediately captured and preserved in the Department's system.","338","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"Was this allowed?","339","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"Yes. The laws and regulations allowed her to use her own email for work.","340","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"

"The Department has and did provide guidance regarding the need to preserve federal records, which included her work emails. To address requirements to keep records of her work emails, it was her practice to email government employees on their "".gov"" email address.

"On December 5, 2014, 30,490 printed copies of work-related emails sent and received by Secretary Clinton from March 18, 2009 to February 1, 2013 were provided to the Department. This totaled roughly 55,000 pages. About 90% of these emails were already in the Department's record-keeping system because they were sent to or received by ""state.gov"" accounts","346","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"[Before March 18, 2009, Secretary Clinton continued using the email account she had used during her Senate service. Given her practice from the beginning of emailing Department officials on their state.gov accounts, her work-related emails during these initial weeks would have been captured and preserved in the Department's record-keeping system. She, however, no longer had access to these emails once she transitioned from this account.]","347","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"

"In fairness to the Committee, this was an honest misunderstanding. Secretary Clinton used one email account during her tenure at State (with the exception of her first weeks in office while transitioning from an email account she had previously used). In March 2013, a month after she left the Department, Gawker published the email address she used while Secretary, and so she had to change the address on her account.","349","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"At the time the printed copies were provided to the Department last year, because it was the same account, the new email address established after she left office appeared on the printed copies as the sender, and not the address she used as Secretary. In fact, this address on the account did not exist until March 2013. This led to understandable confusion that was cleared up directly with the Committee after its press conference.","350","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"Why did the Department ask for assistance? Why did the Department need assistance in further meeting its requirements under the Federal Records Act?","351","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"

"Why was the Department given printed copies?","355","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"That is the requirement.

"Following conversations with Department officials and in response to the Department's October 28, 2014 letter to former Secretaries requesting assistance in meeting the Department's record-keeping requirements, Secretary Clinton directed her attorneys to assist by identifying and preserving all emails that could potentially be federal records. This entailed a multi-step process to provide printed copies of the Secretary's work-related emails to the Department, erring on the side of including anything that might potentially be a federal record. As the State Department has said, Secretary Clinton was the first to respond to this letter.","363","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"

"All set. Good afternoon. I want to thank the United Nations for hosting today's events and putting the challenge of gender equality front and center on the international agenda.","406","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"I'm especially pleased to have so many leaders here from the private sector, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with advocates who've worked tirelessly for equality for decades. Twenty years ago, this was a lonelier struggle. Today, we marked the progress that has been made in the two decades since the international community gathered in Beijing and declared with one voice that, ""Human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights.""","407","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"And because of advances in health, education, and legal protections, we can say that there has never been a better time in history to be born female. Yet as the comprehensive new report published by the Clinton Foundation and the Gates Foundation this week makes clear, despite all this progress, when it comes to the full participation of women and girls, we're just not there yet.","408","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"As I said today, this remains the great unfinished business of the 21st century. And my passion for this fight burns as brightly today as it did twenty years ago. I want to comment on a matter in the news today regarding Iran. The President and his team are in the midst of intense negotiations. Their goal is a diplomatic solution that would close off Iran's pathways to a nuclear bomb and give us unprecedented access and insight into Iran's nuclear program. Now reasonable people can disagree about what exactly it will take to accomplish this objective, and we all must judge any final agreement on its merits.","409","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"But, the recent letter from Republican senators was out of step with the best traditions of American leadership. And one has to ask: what was the purpose of this letter? There appear to be two logical answers -- either these Senators were trying to be helpful to the Iranians, or harmful to the commander-in-chief in the midst of high-stakes international diplomacy. Either answer does discredit to the letter's signatories.","410","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"Now, I would be pleased to talk more about this important matter, but I know there have been questions about my emails, so I want to address that directly and then I will take a few questions from you. There are four things I want the public to know. First, when I got to work as Secretary of State, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account–which was allowed by the state department– because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails, instead of two. Looking back, it would have been better if I had simply used a second email account and carried a second phone, but at the time, this didn't seem like an issue. Second, the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses, which meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department. Third, after I left office the State Department asked former secretaries of state for our assistance in providing copies of work-related emails from our personal accounts. I responded right away and provided all my emails that could possibly be work-related, which totaled roughly 55,000 printed pages. Even though I knew the state department had the vast majority of them.","411","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work-related emails and deliver them to the State Department. At the end, I chose not to keep my private, personal emails. Emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements. Condolence notes to friends, as well as yoga routines, family vacations: the other things you typically find in in- boxes. No one wants their personal emails made public. And I think most people understand that and respect that privacy. Fourth, I took the unprecedented step of asking that the State Department make all my work-related emails public for everyone to see. I am very proud of the work that I, my colleagues, and our public servants at the Department did during my four years as Secretary of State. And I look forward to people being able to see that for themselves. Again, looking back, it would have been better for me to use two separate phones and two email accounts.","412","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"
"I thought using one device would be simpler, and obviously, it hasn't worked out that way. And Now, I am happy to take a few questions.","413","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-clinton-statement-q-and-a/24718561/"

"The New York Times reported late Monday that Clinton used a personal account for all her e-mail while serving as secretary of State, meaning that her e-mails might not automatically be preserved. Clinton's office responded that 90% of her emails were sent to State Department addresses and would therefore have been preserved — and that all of her official e-mails were turned over to the State Department last fall.","415","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"

"Here's a look at some of the questions that have been raised since reports about Clinton's e-mail use surfaced:","420","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"What's the big deal?","421","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"Merrill said Clinton maintained and used a private e-mail account during her four years as secretary of State, not a government account. That means all her e-mails may not have been automatically archived as government documents, although Merrill said thousands of her e-mails have been.","422","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"Is that legal?","423","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"Any government official can maintain a private e-mail account, as long as they turn over government business for archiving. Federal policy encourages all employees to transact business on government accounts.","424","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"Jason R. Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, said Clinton's ""sole use"" of a private e-mail account is ""highly unusual"" and ""plainly inconsistent with the Federal Records Act.""","425","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"It would not be ""sanctionable"" conduct, he said, because the rules have been clarified in recent years, after Clinton left the State Department.","426","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"A bill passed by Congress last year, the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014, makes it illegal to use a non-official e-mail account to conduct public business.","427","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"There are two exceptions: An employee can copy their official e-mail account on the correspondence, or forward a complete copy of the e-mail to the official account within 20 days. Violations of that law are not criminal, but ""shall be the basis of disciplinary action.""","428","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"But those provisions did not exist until President Obama signed them into law last November, almost two years after Clinton left office. Before that, federal law considered public business conducted via private e-mails to be a federal record and prohibited employees from destroying them, but did not explicitly ban the use of personal e-mail. Under a 2009 regulation, federal agencies that allowed the use of personal e-mail were required to ensure those e-mails were preserved.","429","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"In 2012, President Obama signed a presidential memorandum ordering federal agencies to update their recordkeeping systems. The National Archives and Records Administration issued a directive implementing that order the same year. It required that ""e-mail records must be retained in an appropriate electronic system that supports records management and litigation requirements.''","430","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"The goal of federal law is to make sure that e-mails dealing with government business are kept and recorded, says Peter Swire, a professor of law and ethics at Georgia Tech. ""The updated archiving rules were issued several years after Clinton became secretary of State,"" he said. ""It has taken a while for federal archiving rules to catch up with changing technology. It appears that Clinton turned over her government-related e-mails months before this news story hit.""","431","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"Many executives in the private sector insist on having personal e-mail accounts, Swire said, noting that ""Bring Your Own Device"" is a common rule of thumb at corporations. That is easier said than done at the federal level because of worries about security against hackers. The government had to develop special technology in order for President Obama to send private e-mail on his BlackBerry.","432","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"

"Merrill said that, with official business, Clinton e-mailed federal colleagues on their government accounts ""with every expectation they would be retained."" He added: ""When the Department asked former Secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes. Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved.""","434","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"A Clinton aide, speaking on background, said that 90% of the e-mails from Clinton's BlackBerry were sent to State Department employees at their work e-mail address and therefore were captured. Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of her e-mails last year. ""So if she e-mailed with her daughter about flower arrangements for her wedding, that didn't go in,"" the aide said, ""but if she e-mailed one of the 100 State Department officials she regularly corresponded with, State had it in their servers already and (Clinton's) office replicated that to ensure it was all there.''","435","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"

"""What I can tell you is that very specific guidance has been given to agencies all across the government, which is specifically that employees in the Obama administration should use their official e-mail accounts when they're conducting official government business,"" he said.","439","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"He added that the State Department asked that previous secretaries who used e-mail for official business to send those messages to the department. ""Secretary Clinton's team, in response to that request, reviewed her e-mails and complied with that request by sending all of the e-mails on her personal account that pertained to her official responsibilities as secretary of State.""","440","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"

"State Department spokesperson Marie Harf said that Clinton's use of a private account ""was by no means unusual,"" and ""had been the practice"" until Kerry's tenure.

"Potential election opponents say Clinton used a private e-mail account to hide information. Some are calling on Clinton to release all of her e-mails during her years at the State Department.

"The organizations waiting to support a Clinton presidential run argued that her e-mail use is not an issue for voters. ""If she loses even one vote because she did not have the bureaucracy's preferred email account, I will eat my hat,"" longtime Clinton aide Paul Begala said in an e-mail.

"Correct the Record, an independent group that exists solely to combat negative stories about Clinton, pointed out that previous secretaries of State have also used personal email accounts and that Clinton had provided emails when asked to do so. ""Hillary ​made sure more than 55,000 pages of emails were archived.

"Clinton's avoidance of a government e-mail is an easy fit with existing criticisms of her, even among Democrats. ""This is an issue that has some resonance with folks' reasons for skepticism regarding the Clintons: lack of transparency and forthrightness,'' says Sean Trende, political analyst for RealClearPolitics.","449","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"The e-mail issue is also a test of Clinton's team in handling controversy, says John Hudak, a governance and politics fellow at the Brookings Institution. Clinton should take Jeb Bush's advice and release as many e-mails as possible, he says. ""She should be as transparent as possible within the bounds of executive privilege and national security, just to make the story go away. That's just good politics from her perspective.'' By the time the 2016 campaign is truly underway, ""I don't think anyone is going to care what e-mail server the secretary of State is using.''","450","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/03/hillary-clinton-state-department-e-mail/24321071/"
"The issue could have political implications beyond her possible 2016 campaign.

"Although Clinton and the State Department say that 55,000 pages of her emails were turned over for archiving, it isn't clear how many unclassified e-mails were not turned over.

"Here's a look back at some of the claims from Clinton that FactCheck.org has examined over the years.","455","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/13/fact-check-hillary-clinton/25702685/"
"• In March, Clinton brushed aside calls for her to turn over all her emails she sent as secretary of State — including personal emails — to an independent third party for review. Her office claimed government employees are granted privacy for personal emails, including on .gov accounts. But that's not what State Department guidelines say. Instead they stipulate that there is ""no expectation of privacy"" for emails on a department email system. Clinton exclusively used a private email account at clintonemail.com while at the State Department and deleted about half of them because they were personal, she said.","456","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/13/fact-check-hillary-clinton/25702685/"
"• In a 2008 debate with then-presidential candidate Barack Obama, Clinton claimed that raising the cap on wages subject to Social Security taxes ""would impose additional taxes on people who are, you know, educators here in the Philadelphia area or in the suburbs, police officers, firefighters and the like."" But the cap then was $102,000 a year, and few police officers or teachers earned that much.","457","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/13/fact-check-hillary-clinton/25702685/"
"• In the same debate, Clinton said she believed that ""market manipulation"" was prompting an increase in fuel prices. She offered no evidence, and, in fact, the Federal Trade Commission had repeatedly looked into such allegations and hadn't found anything to prosecute. On the campaign trail, she (and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.) proposed a ""gasoline tax holiday"" that economists said was unlikely to lower prices at the pump.","458","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/13/fact-check-hillary-clinton/25702685/"
"• Clinton's foreign policy experience has increased greatly since 2008, thanks to Obama nominating her for secretary of State. But during the presidential campaign, Clinton exaggerated her foreign policy résumé in an attempt to contrast it with Obama's experience. She said she ""negotiated open borders"" in Macedonia in 1999 ""to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo."" The border had opened a day before she arrived. She also claimed to have ""helped bring peace to Northern Ireland."" There is agreement that she helped, but Irish officials gave mixed reviews as to how helpful her actions were. She wasn't directly involved in negotiations.","459","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/13/fact-check-hillary-clinton/25702685/"
"• She also talked about a ""dangerous"" trip to Bosnia in March 1996, claiming that her aircraft made a corkscrew landing to avoid potential sniper fire. We wrote in 2008 that she failed to mention that the war had officially ended three months before she visited, and that she came with her daughter, who was 16 at the time, and two celebrities as part of a goodwill tour. CBS News footage later revealed she arrived calmly with Chelsea in tow, and Clinton said she ""misspoke"" about the incident.","460","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/13/fact-check-hillary-clinton/25702685/"
"• In early 2008, Clinton wrongly blamed the Bush administration for a nonexistent policy of requiring wounded soldiers to return enlistment bonuses if they were discharged. One incident in which an injured soldier received a letter seeking recoupment was against the official policy of the Defense Department.","461","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/13/fact-check-hillary-clinton/25702685/"
"There's plenty more in our file on Clinton, which is like a trip down memory lane. But it has been a while since she last campaigned for office (2008), so much of our material is dated or no longer pertinent. For instance, Clinton said that her health care plan was the only one that would achieve universal coverage, when experts said it would come close but wouldn't cover everyone. And during her last run, she repeatedly made the misleading claim that a 2005 energy bill included ""enormous giveaways to the oil and gas industries."" It actually increased taxes, on net, on oil and gas companies.","462","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/13/fact-check-hillary-clinton/25702685/"

"As she maps out a possible presidential campaign, Hillary Rodham Clinton has had plenty of time to think about what she should do differently than during her 2008 bid. A far greater influence on a Clinton 2016 run, however, will be the far-reaching changes in the political landscape.","5:50 p.m. EST February 2, 2015","464","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/02/hillary-clinton-president-campaign/22186603/"
"In 2008, Clinton's bid for the Democratic nomination foundered because of infighting among her staff and her own less-than-compelling campaign style. Facing a primary opponent who would go on to become the first African-American elected president, she did not emphasize the history-making potential of a female candidate until she conceded the nomination to Barack Obama.","465","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/02/hillary-clinton-president-campaign/22186603/"
"Initially favored to win the nomination, the 2008 Clinton publicly predicted the Democratic primary would be over quickly, by early February. But she blew the Iowa caucus, spending heavily but coming in third. Obama's campaign capitalized on its skill at grass-roots mobilizing, and Clinton's relative weakness, to win 10 further caucuses to Clinton's two.","466","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/02/hillary-clinton-president-campaign/22186603/"
"And Clinton looked ungracious, at best, when former president Bill Clinton compared Obama's South Carolina primary victory to that of Jesse Jackson, the African-American candidate who won the state in the 1980s. She presented herself as an experienced veteran to Democratic voters who, it turned out, wanted something and someone new.","467","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/02/hillary-clinton-president-campaign/22186603/"
"If Clinton runs in 2016, voters will again have the opportunity to make a historic choice: she would almost certainly be the only female candidate. But Clinton can count on little else resembling her first campaign.

There's not an incumbent Republican president, the technology and the (issues) that were driving 2004 and 2008, that's completely changed as well,'' says Joe Trippi, the Democratic strategist who managed the 2008 campaign of former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards.

"• The tactics: In January 2007, when Clinton announced her exploratory committee — in a video on her website — the iPhone did not yet exist. Social media meant largely Facebook, and digital targeting of voters was just developing. A Clinton 2016 campaign would have to communicate through myriad social media platforms and apps, and reach voters online with e-mail and ads targeted through data analytics.","471","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/02/hillary-clinton-president-campaign/22186603/"
"""Even between the four years in which President Obama ran for president, the ways in which voters consumed information changed in a significant way,'' says Ben LaBolt, who served as press secretary for Obama's 2012 campaign.

"As secretary of State, Clinton embraced social media, not only as an image enhancer, like the flattering ""Texts from Hillary"" site, but as a tool of diplomacy.

"• The money: Clinton isn't likely to have trouble raising contributions for a second presidential campaign, but the dynamics of campaign finance have been radically altered since her last run. The 2010 Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court unleashed unlimited outside expenditures by independent groups that don't always have to reveal their donors. As a result, outside spending on presidential campaigns nearly tripled between 2008 and 2012, from $231 million to $653 million.","474","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/02/hillary-clinton-president-campaign/22186603/"

"• The candidate: Clinton was a popular secretary of State: Her approval rating rose to over 60% in 2011. Now that she appears to be edging toward another presidential run, polls show her favorable rating at 46% and her unfavorable at 45%. But the diplomatic timeout from politics may have lessened the ""Clinton fatigue'' of the 2008 campaign, when voters wondered whether they were ready for another Clinton administration.

"The sharpest difference from the 2008 primary was over Clinton's vote for the war in Iraq. As the next campaign begins, voters will look beyond differences between Obama and Clinton, says Jess McIntosh, communications director for EMILY's List, which raises money for Democratic female candidates. ""The American electorate is forward-looking. They don't really want to engage in the theory of what you would have done had you been there.''","481","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/02/hillary-clinton-president-campaign/22186603/"
"• The big issue: Much of Clinton's campaign against Obama focused on the Iraq War, her level of political experience and whether people should be required to buy health insurance. (At that time, Obama said no.) When the financial crisis blew up in September 2008, Clinton was no longer running. But the economic consequences of that crisis, and its effect on ordinary Americans, would inescapably be a top issue of her 2016 campaign.","482","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/02/hillary-clinton-president-campaign/22186603/"
"Since she left the State Department, Clinton has spoken on all kinds of issues, from clean cook stoves to data collection to endangered elephants. But McIntosh says there's an underlying theme that's the right one for 2016: ""There's not a public speech that goes by … where she doesn't talk about how we move forward by improving the lives of women and families. She should keep talking about that,'' McIntosh says.","483","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/02/hillary-clinton-president-campaign/22186603/"
"Voters want to know ""how Americans can make sure they — and, in particular, their kids — will get a fair shake in getting their piece of the economic pie,'' Lehane says. ""Whoever offers the most compelling big idea that gets at this issue will win the voters' trust.''","484","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/02/hillary-clinton-president-campaign/22186603/"
"""A question to put to the Republicans (is) are they offering policies that are at all new?"" LaBolt says. Could the same question be put to Clinton, who, after all, was arguing policy long before any of her potential Republican opponents?

"Like President Obama — who famously opined that Americans ""cling"" to religion out of bitterness — Clinton seems to view religious doctrine in opposition to her political agenda as nothing more than ""biases"" or ""codes"" to be dismantled by those who know better.

"It would take an army of psychologists to determine why Clinton believes that her worldview should override that of centuries of religious doctrine.

"Clinton's comments echo those of The New York Times columnist Frank Bruni, who wrote this month that opposing same-sex marriage based on religious beliefs ""elevates unthinking obeisance above intelligent observance,""and he argued for ""freeing religions and religious people from prejudices that they needn't cling to.""

"My views on homosexuality are more in line with Bruni's.

"Well, one big difference is that three major news organizations — The Times, The Post and Fox News — are all working on the story. If it were just Fox, the Clintons might be able to spin it as a product of, in Hillary's famous phrase, the ""vast right-wing conspiracy."" But that's unlikely to fly this time.

"Even so, don't count the Clintons out yet. Even if these scandals ultimately kill Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential candidacy, she'll be inclined to keep it staggering along as long as possible.

"But who benefits from Clinton's troubles now, and who suffers? A few thoughts:","594","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/26/hillary-clinton-leaks-travel-democrats-republicans-column/26415031/"
"First, this is a shot in the arm for her potential Democratic challengers, who have labored in obscurity. Probably the biggest beneficiary is former Virginia senator James Webb, whose military background and more centrist views could help bring in the white working-class voters that the Democrats are realizing they have alienated during the Obama era. Also helped is Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, though her close resemblance to Clinton (another northeastern Ivy League white woman) and her own strong corporate ties (Warren made money advising asbestos companies how not to pay claims, and is worth many millions) might hurt. Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley also gets a boost, though he's the probably the longest shot of the three.","595","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/26/hillary-clinton-leaks-travel-democrats-republicans-column/26415031/"
"On the other hand, Clinton's candidacy is well-established, heavily financed (though that's part of the problem, I guess) and endowed with high name recognition, '90s nostalgia and her husband's formidable political skills. Losing that is a sore blow to the Democratic Party's 2016 hopes.","596","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/26/hillary-clinton-leaks-travel-democrats-republicans-column/26415031/"
"On the Republican side, Clinton's travails both hurt and help. By making the political establishment look corrupt, they especially help the anti-establishment candidates such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. By damaging a Democratic front-runner, they might help Republican establishment favorite Jeb Bush. But given the closeness of the Bush and Clinton families in recent years — you'll see that video of Jeb Bush presenting Hillary Clinton with a Liberty Medal, on the eve of the Benghazi anniversary, a lot during the GOP primaries — if the whole Bill-and-Hillary dynasty looks corrupt, the Bush dynasty could be tarnished by association. And, in fact, the corruption associated with the Clintons might make voters more skittish about political dynasties in general.","597","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/26/hillary-clinton-leaks-travel-democrats-republicans-column/26415031/"
"Among the biggest losers, of course, are the people who donated to candidate Clinton in the hopes of winning favorable treatment from her presidency. Those investments are looking shakier. Even if she does somehow find her way to the White House, her actions will get that much more scrutiny from those who suspect that influence-peddling might have been involved — which, it seems, is now pretty much everybody.","598","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/26/hillary-clinton-leaks-travel-democrats-republicans-column/26415031/"
"On the other hand, the biggest winners probably include America's political reporters and pundits, as what a few months ago was looking like a Hillary-vs.-Jeb snooze fest shows signs of opening up into a free-for-all in both parties. For that, we owe the Clintons a hearty ""thank you."" Clintonworld has never lacked for cronyism and shady deals, but it also has always delivered first-class entertainment. This time around, it seems, is no different.","599","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/26/hillary-clinton-leaks-travel-democrats-republicans-column/26415031/"

"Flash forward to 2015, when another public figure around 70 years old has just announced her candidacy for president. Journalists deserve the same opportunity to pore over Hillary Clinton's medical records that we had for John McCain, but will we be given the chance? When she developed a blood clot outside her brain (transverse sinus thrombosis) in 2012, I contacted her neurologist, but was not given the same access to health information that I had when I was working on a story for The Washington Post and interviewing former President Clinton's heart surgeon after his bypass surgery in 2004.","711","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/16/hillary-clinton-health-concerns-medical-records-column/25764577/"

"It's official: Hillary Clinton is running for president. She'll need the enthusiastic support of female voters if she is to shatter the ultimate glass ceiling and become America's first female president. Expect to hear more from her on Tuesday, the day feminists have dubbed ""Equal Pay Day"" to mark when American women finally earn enough to make up for last year's pay gap.","5:01 p.m. EDT April 12, 2015","903","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/hillary-clinton-equal-pay-womens-rights-presidential-candidate-column/25596765/"

"Typically, Equal Pay Day is used to call for more government action to protect women from what is characterized as widespread discrimination. But if Clinton wants to reach beyond her base, she should take a different tact.","905","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/hillary-clinton-equal-pay-womens-rights-presidential-candidate-column/25596765/"
"Rather than parroting the tired trope that women receive 77 cents for every dollar a man earns for the same work, she should talk honestly about the tradeoffs women face, the value of their sacrifices to support family and communities and the need for a culture that truly respects both women and men.","906","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/hillary-clinton-equal-pay-womens-rights-presidential-candidate-column/25596765/"
"First, it's time to acknowledge once and for all that Equal Pay Day rests on a false premise. The Bureau of Labor Statistic calculation that underlies the feminist holiday simply compares the earnings of full-time working women and men. It doesn't take into account the many factors — numbers of hours worked, industry, education, years of experience — that impact compensation. Study after study shows that once those factors are controlled for the wage gap shrinks, leaving just a few percentage points unexplained.","907","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/hillary-clinton-equal-pay-womens-rights-presidential-candidate-column/25596765/"
"Wage gaps exist in every developed country and in the most committed, liberal workplaces, including Barack Obama's White House and in Hillary Clinton's own former Senate office. That's not because Clinton and Obama are secretly virulent sexists, but because women and men tend to make different choices when it comes to work life, which led to women taken on position with lower pay.","908","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/hillary-clinton-equal-pay-womens-rights-presidential-candidate-column/25596765/"
"Discrimination does occur, of course, and women certainly face unfair obstacles in some workplaces. Old-boy networks, such as those in banking and tech industries, can unfairly discount women's contributions; biases against women, particularly working mothers, may contribute to the stubborn dearth of women at the top of corporate America. Women and men alike should reject discrimination, expose lingering sexist attitudes and strive to create work environments that respect women and fully value their contributions.","909","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/hillary-clinton-equal-pay-womens-rights-presidential-candidate-column/25596765/"
"Female leaders like Hillary Clinton, however, do women no favors by implying that American women are doomed to be consistently and significantly shortchanged throughout their careers. Far better for women to understand that the choices they make — about what to study, what fields to enter, how much time to take off from their careers — will primarily determine their earning potential. After all, our goal shouldn't be for everyone to all work and earn exactly the same, but for men and women to make informed choices about how to use their time and talents.","910","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/hillary-clinton-equal-pay-womens-rights-presidential-candidate-column/25596765/"
"And women's contributions to society, not just their earnings, deserve our respect. The feminist obsession with eradicating the wage gap ironically embraces what a women's studies professor might otherwise describe as a male values framework. Women have long understood that there is more to life than the all-mighty dollar. Women aren't necessarily making a mistake when they decide not to ""lean in"" in pursuit of the corner office. They may find that their greatest satisfaction comes from personal successes, rather than professional ones. And even as we celebrate women's increased participation in the economy, we ought to also acknowledge the critical, if often overlooked, role that women outside of the workforce play in our communities. Women are our school volunteers, just-in-time family care for friends and first line of defense in neighborhood security. Too often we only see the importance of these women when we note their growing absence.","911","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/hillary-clinton-equal-pay-womens-rights-presidential-candidate-column/25596765/"
"Men's contributions should also be properly valued. Equal Pay Day events imply that men are all sitting in boardrooms chewing cigars, but men often take on dangerous, dirty and distasteful jobs. They are paving our roads, guarding our prisons, driving trucks overnight and working on oil rigs and in fishing boats. They suffer over 90% of workplace fatalities. Many do so in order to earn more to provide for their families. That deserves our respect.","912","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/hillary-clinton-equal-pay-womens-rights-presidential-candidate-column/25596765/"

"Clinton and her advisers were not oblivious to the precedents and challenges of what she was attempting, but their decision to conduct a ""soft"" roll-out that took her from farm to town, kitchen table to diner table, listening to the concerns of New Yorkers, seemed to provide a solid foundation for the victory to come more than a year later.","963","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/carroll/2015/04/17/hillary-clinton-campaigns-like/25959197/"

"This year's Clinton listening tour reinforces the skills the one-time senator and former secretary of state possesses in talking with people one-on-one, in handling planned as well as spontaneous encounters, in showing that even after eight years in the White House, eight years in the Senate and four years as secretary of state — with a presidential campaign to boot in 2008 — she is ready to do the retail political work required of a White House bid.","966","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/carroll/2015/04/17/hillary-clinton-campaigns-like/25959197/"
"But the listening tour also is a recognition of the fact that, just as in 1999, Clinton seems to be a known brand, with all the loyalty and enmity such a brand generates.

"But you have heard it and I have heard it, from hard-line Democrats, progressives, and independents alike: that Clinton's time may have passed, that the unceasing controversies that dog her and husband Bill are too polarizing, that many people are just weary of the Clintons and want to start fresh.","973","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/carroll/2015/04/17/hillary-clinton-campaigns-like/25959197/"

"CHICAGO — She's the prohibitive Democratic front-runner, David Axelrod says, but if Hillary Rodham Clinton is going to win the White House in 2016 she needs to campaign like an insurgent.","9:23 a.m. EST February 9, 2015","981","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/09/capital-download-david-axelrod-memoir/23031529/"
"Axelrod has credentials to make the critique: He was the strategist for challenger Barack Obama when he wrested the Democratic nomination from her the last time she was the front-runner, in 2008. In his memoir, Believer: My Forty Years in Politics, published Tuesday by Penguin Press, Axelrod recalls both how Clinton's caution and missteps cost her the nomination — and how she then countered and threatened to win it back.","982","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/09/capital-download-david-axelrod-memoir/23031529/"
"""What she can't rely on, and I don't think she will, is the Clinton name, although the Clinton name trades very high in American politics,"" Axelrod told Capital Download in an interview at his office at the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics. ""Americans are always about the future. Bill Clinton was famously the one who said that, and he was right. So she needs a very well-conceived message about where she wants to lead the country.

"That means not only delivering speeches but also connecting viscerally with voters, making herself vulnerable and approachable the way she did in New Hampshire after losing the Iowa caucuses, and not shying from primary debates even against a distant field.

"That said, some of the characteristics that hurt Clinton's campaign last time should help her now, he says. After eight years of President Obama — and amid disappointment over what Axelrod calls his ""great, unfulfilled promise"" to change the capital's politics — voters may well be looking for a Washington insider who knows how to make a gridlocked system operate.","986","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/09/capital-download-david-axelrod-memoir/23031529/"
"""Her status as someone who had worked within Washington and who was familiar with Washington was actually a liability"" then, Axelrod says. Now, ""people are going to be looking, as they always do, not for the replica but for the remedy. They're going to want someone who knows how to manage the system, navigate the system, and I think her skill set and her background are probably better for this campaign than they were for the last.""","987","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/09/capital-download-david-axelrod-memoir/23031529/"

"Axelrod, who turns 60 this month, is one of the most successful strategists in modern American politics. He has helped elect not only a president but also senators, governors and a string of mayors. But he still projects the air of the rumpled political reporter he once was for The Chicago Tribune, and his favorite place to eat is still Manny's, the legendary deli that is a favored hang-out of pols and press.","992","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/02/09/capital-download-david-axelrod-memoir/23031529/"

"""I appreciate his loyalty to his guy,"" Axelrod told USA TODAY's video newsmaker series in his first public response.

"""I've always sort of resisted answering that question in the past because I never wanted to imply that somehow he was being treated unfairly or that whatever our political problems were, were a consequence only of race,"" he says.

"Axelrod's portrait of Obama is overwhelmingly positive and admiring.

"""I think he likes people, (but) I don't know that he likes the politics of Washington very much,"" Axelrod admits, and his disdain can infect his relationships with other powerful figures in town.

"Even as Hillary Clinton makes the long-awaited announcement of her 2016 presidential candidacy, the HBO fantasy epic Game of Thrones begins its (also long-awaited) fifth season. Coincidence? I think not.

"Granted, there are major differences between modern-day America and pseudo-medieval Westeros, the series' main location. In Westeros, stepping over dead bodies on your way up is a much more literal thing. In America, losers in the game of power are exiled to cushy private-sector jobs and the lecture circuit, not to a snowy, zombie-infested wasteland on the edge of the realm. And we have no public executions, except on Twitter. But surely in a larger sense, the game of power knows no place or time.","1033","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/game-thrones-hillary-announcement-column/25671425/"

"Like Dany — a dispossessed princess who believes she's the true heir to the throne of Westeros — Hillary Clinton is the dynasty candidate, who no doubt believes she was denied what was rightfully hers when the Democratic nomination slipped away in 2008. Like Dany, Hillary first gained status through marriage and managed to use a dubious marriage to build her own power base. Before returning to take the throne, both Dany (who will presumably return) and Hillary spent time in faraway lands seeking donations from foreign rulers. Like Dany, who fights to liberate slaves, Hillary has always professed a strong commitment to social justice. (Take note: Dany will learn that social justice crusades have unintended consequences.) Hillary may not have flying, fire-breathing exotic pets — she does have David Brock, Lanny Davis and James Carville. So, how about ""I will take what is mine with fire and blood"" for a campaign slogan?","1036","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/game-thrones-hillary-announcement-column/25671425/"

Hillary Clinton parallels? Well, Cersei was married to a philandering man who was her ticket to power. And she's got no shortage of foes searching for evidence to link her to various scandalous misdeeds.

"Like the materfamilias of the Stark clan, Hillary Clinton is an experienced elder stateswoman who seeks to unite different factions against a common enemy. Also like Lady Stark, she's made strategic blunders that may cost her dearly. Hillary's inner circle has women in many key roles, including her chief ""gatekeeper"" Huma Abedin; Catelyn engaged as her protector a female knight, Brienne of Tarth. Granted, Catelyn is now out of the running; but Hillary may also have a touch of Stark daughter Arya, a survivor prone to reinventing herself.","1040","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/game-thrones-hillary-announcement-column/25671425/"

"And here's an eyebrow-raising parallel: Stannis has as his shadow adviser a witch named Melisandre who claims to communicate with higher powers; Hillary (according to Bob Woodward's 1996 book, The Choice: How Bill Clinton Won) once had an adviser named Jean Houston, a ""mind research"" guru who delved into psychic phenomena and guided Hillary to have chats with Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi.","1044","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/game-thrones-hillary-announcement-column/25671425/"

"She said yes, in hindsight, it probably would have been better not to have mingled her government e-mail with her private e-mail on a private account. But her regret seemed over the political uncomfortableness rather than the merits. Beyond that, she said she had done nothing wrong. And for 20 minutes she pretty much repeated that message, refusing to engage with meaningful followup questions.","1055","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/rieder/2015/03/11/lessons-of-clinton-press-debacle/70141582/"

"It is well-known that Clinton really dislikes dealing with the news media. And some of that, too, is understandable. In our overheated 24/7 news cycle, it sometimes seems as if minor Beltway flaps of the moment and trivial faux-scandals are treated as if they were serious deals.

"But, for better or worse, the press has a vital role to play in our democracy. In something as high-stakes as presidential politics, its role – its duty – is to shine as bright a light as possible on the candidates.

"Six years ago today, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent a memo on the Freedom of Information Act to the entire Department of State.

"So much for that. Today, we know that Clinton took extraordinary steps to prevent any record of her ""deliberations, decisions, and actions."" During her entire tenure as Secretary of State, she exclusively utilized a private email account run through servers located at her home in Chappaqua, New York. This arrangement prevented the federal government from maintaining any record of her email communications — a slap in the face to anyone who cares about government transparency and an obvious example of hypocrisy given the memo Clinton sent to her staff in 2009.","1135","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/16/hilary-clinton-emails-transparency-column/70280434/"

"First, she may have violated the Federal Records Act. Even in 2009, this law required Clinton to ""ensure that Federal records sent or received"" on her private email ""are preserved in the appropriate agency record keeping system."" Clinton claims to have fulfilled this law by turning over 55,000 pages of emails to the Department of State, but the full truth cannot be known until and unless investigators are able to access her private email server. The penalties for violating the Federal Records Act include fines, jail time or disqualification from holding any office under the United States.","1139","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/16/hilary-clinton-emails-transparency-column/70280434/"
"The second law Clinton may have violated is Section 1924 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, which forbids federal employees from retaining classified information in an unauthorized manner — such as in a personal email. A 2009 Executive Order by President Barack Obama has a similar ban on such activity. Clinton has sought to address this problem by claiming that her emails never dealt with classified information, yet this is highly unlikely given her role as Secretary of State.","1140","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/16/hilary-clinton-emails-transparency-column/70280434/"
"And finally, Clinton may have violated the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). By utilizing a private email server beyond the control of the State Department, her email records will never be subject to FOIA requests — the most basic tool in keeping Washington transparent. In fact, Clinton may have used a private email server precisely to evade FOIA.","1141","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/16/hilary-clinton-emails-transparency-column/70280434/"
"Given Clinton's intransigence and unwillingness to give investigators access to her private email server, we cannot yet know with full certainty whether she broke these three laws.

"4. Was Clinton ever investigated by the inspector general or another federal agency for her email practices?","1147","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/16/hilary-clinton-emails-transparency-column/70280434/"

"The public deserves answers to these important questions — they will give us a more accurate picture of the actions surrounding Hillary Clinton's use of a private email account. We may not have the answers now, but one thing is still certain: she did not fulfill her own promise as Secretary of State to preserve ""the record of our deliberations, decisions, and actions.""

"• “Hillary Rodham Clinton exclusively used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state, State Department officials said, and may have violated federal requirements that officials’ correspondence be retained as part of the agency’s record,” the New York Times reports. “Mrs. Clinton did not have a government email address during her four-year tenure at the State Department. Her aides took no actions to have her personal emails preserved on department servers at the time, as required by the Federal Records Act.” Even ex-Obama adviser Robert Gibbs piled on, saying this was “highly unusual.” Jeb Bush tweeted, “Transparency matters.

"Well, all these things are horrible, but then we knew that Bill and Hillary Clinton’s ethical compass has been broken for years and that they consider laws and transparency to be for the little people. I would argue, however, that it is the third that is really the worst if Hillary Clinton intends, as everyone is certain she does, to run for president. This is, of course, the most important national security issue of our time, and if she has neither the courage nor conviction to tell us what she thinks, she arguably shouldn’t be running for the job as commander in chief.","1229","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/03/03/will-democrats-ignore-hillary-clintons-problems/24320131/"
"Needless to say, the political media are focused on the e-mails and not the nukes, but then foreign policy is only superficially considered and dimly understood. Whatever the emphasis, however, it is hard to escape the flashing red lights in front of party regulars and activists: Do you really need Clinton so badly that you would crown her now as the nominee?

Surely, even a candidate who will have to work harder to raise money and create name identification but who is capable and not burdened by scandal would be preferable to a 67-year-old woman of immense wealth, low ethical standards and nonexistent candor.

"Hillary Clinton has been dropping more serious hints about running for president — probably to few people’s surprise. The time she has taken to decide only seems to have grown her favorability ratings, which are so high the New York Times’ Nate Cohn writes, “If a candidate has ever been inevitable (for a nomination) it is Mrs. Clinton today.” Her Iowa poll numbers are a smashing 61 percent among likely Democratic voters. They’re just a point less nationally. And Super PACS for her are amassing a formidable war chest. That momentum had Republican hopefuls skewering her at a conservative political action conference last week.

"That’s an enviable place from which to watch Republican hopefuls tear each other down. But it puts Democratic voters and the general public at risk of writing off the primary campaign as settled.

"And Clinton has some questions to answer. A tough one comes from the recent influx of donations to the family’s Clinton Foundation, breeding suspicions they are intended to gain influence with her if she becomes president. The Washington Post reported the charitable foundation has raised nearly $2 billion, including contributions from corporate giants and foreign governments — $262 million of that since Clinton left the Obama administration. And a sizable share of those donating $10,000 or more are also donors to the Ready for Hillary PAC and to her 2008 campaign.","1235","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/03/02/hillary-clinton-questions-answer/24264231/"
"That may not be illegal — very little seems to be anymore when it comes to money in politics — but it raises the prospect of donations earmarked for charity that are really intended to buy influence. What might corporate donors, dominated by the financial services sector, get in return? Probably not stricter financial regulations. Even foreign governments like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Argentina, which can’t legally spend to influence U.S. elections, have given the foundation over $1 million apiece.","1236","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/03/02/hillary-clinton-questions-answer/24264231/"
"Some Clinton allies are raising those questions. Marianne Williamson, a familiar name to many devotees of spiritual and inspirational literature, is a California-based author and speaker on the progressive end of the Democratic Party. She ran for a congressional seat from California last year. In late March she’s sponsoring a conference on grass-roots Democratic priorities featuring Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as keynoter. In an open letter to Clinton last year, published in The Huffington Post, Williamson wrote, “I want a woman president — really, I do. A lot of us do. And yes, you’re so qualified, and yes, we’ve known you forever, and yes, you’d know what to do from Day 1.” But she continued, “We only want to vote for you if you run like hell away from that corporate box you’ve landed in. ... We know now that Wall Street runs the country, and we don’t like it. And for many of us, we don’t want to vote for you if Wall Street runs you, too.”","1237","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/03/02/hillary-clinton-questions-answer/24264231/"
"In a phone interview Thursday, Williamson said she admires Clinton, but wants to see her priorities challenged from the left. Noting her acceptance of $400,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs, Williamson cautions, “they’ll want a return.” Citing Clinton’s ties to the biotechnology industry, she wonders if GMO giant Monsanto would “be given the keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.” The State Department under Clinton lobbied foreign governments to use GMO seeds. It also lobbied governments to adopt policies benefiting GE, ExxonMobil, Boeing and Microsoft, all foundation donors. Clinton advocated raising subsidies and tax breaks to biotech companies. And in her last campaign, she picked as her chief campaign strategist a CEO for a public relations firm representing Monsanto.","1238","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/03/02/hillary-clinton-questions-answer/24264231/"
"Two progressive Democrats whose names are being promoted for presidential consideration — Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren — have promoted more regulation of Wall Street. Warren introduced legislation to force corporations that move overseas in order to avoid paying taxes to relinquish control to foreign entities. She helped create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to guard against abusive lending practices. Sanders has called for an end to tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas, an end to free-trade agreements, and the breakup of banking monopolies. Will Clinton join them?","1239","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/03/02/hillary-clinton-questions-answer/24264231/"
"For now, she’s making her appeals to professional women. Speaking to Silicon Valley IT employees last week in the first of three speeches to female audiences, she mentioned the wage gap, glass ceilings and locker-room mentalities. Next she’ll speak to EMILY’s List, which raises money for pro-choice women candidates. It’s smart strategy. Women tend to embrace Clinton with a rare loyalty and enthusiasm. We’ve watched her work a punishing schedule, withstand sexism, betrayal and a disappointing campaign outcome. We’ve seen an accomplished woman take her punches and come back stronger. And many celebrate a grandma who still has the fight in her.","1240","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/03/02/hillary-clinton-questions-answer/24264231/"

"Former attorney general Michael Mukasey recently compared the inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of State with former CIA director David Petraeus’ federal conviction for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified information.","12:21 p.m. EDT August 31, 2015","1340","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/30/clinton-controversy-no-comparison-petraeus-column/71421242/"
"As the former U.S. attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, I oversaw the prosecution of Gen. Petraeus, and I can say, based on the known facts, this comparison has no merit. The key element that distinguishes Secretary Clinton’s email retention practices from Petraeus’ sharing of classified information is that Petraeus knowingly engaged in unlawful conduct, and that was the basis of his criminal liability.","1341","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/30/clinton-controversy-no-comparison-petraeus-column/71421242/"
"The facts of Petraeus’ case are a matter of public record. During his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, Petraeus recorded handwritten notes in personal journals, including information he knew was classified at the very highest levels.","1342","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/30/clinton-controversy-no-comparison-petraeus-column/71421242/"
"These journals contained top secret and even more sensitive “code word” national defense information, including the identities of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence capabilities, diplomatic discussions, and quotes and deliberative discussions from National Security Council meetings, including discussions with the president of the United States.","1343","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/30/clinton-controversy-no-comparison-petraeus-column/71421242/"
"Both the law and his oath required Petraeus to mark these books as “top secret” and to store them in a Secured Compartmented Information Facility. He did neither.","1344","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/30/clinton-controversy-no-comparison-petraeus-column/71421242/"
"Rather, Petraeus allowed his biographer to take possession of the journals in order to use them as source material for his biography.","1345","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/30/clinton-controversy-no-comparison-petraeus-column/71421242/"
"Importantly, Petraeus was well aware of the classified contents in his journals, saying to his biographer, Paula Broadwell on tape, “I mean, they are highly classified, some of them. They don’t have it on it, but I mean there’s code word stuff in there.”","1346","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/30/clinton-controversy-no-comparison-petraeus-column/71421242/"
"When questioned by the FBI, Petraeus lied to agents in responding that he had neither improperly stored nor improperly provided classified information to his biographer. As Mukasey also highlighted, the key element is that Petraeus’ conduct was done “knowingly.” That is, when he stored his journals containing “highly classified” information at his home, he did so knowingly. Petraeus knew at that time that there was classified information in the journals, and he knew they were stored improperly.","1347","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/30/clinton-controversy-no-comparison-petraeus-column/71421242/"

Additionally, the Justice Department indicated that its inquiry is not a criminal one and that Clinton is not the subject of the inquiry.","1349","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/30/clinton-controversy-no-comparison-petraeus-column/71421242/"
"Here, the inspector general and the Justice Department are following an established protocol when it is determined that there has been an unauthorized disclosure of classified materials — here, by virtue of a potential after-the-fact change in classification. This protocol ensures that any classified information is properly handled going forward.","1350","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/30/clinton-controversy-no-comparison-petraeus-column/71421242/"
"Reasonable minds can certainly differ about the wisdom of using a personal server to conduct the official business of the State Department.

"In the wake of revelations regarding the questionable nexus between Hillary and Bill Clinton's family foundation and those who benefitted from her tenure as Secretary of State, their defenders say there is no proof of misdeeds, no verifiable quid pro quo, not a shred of evidence against them.

"However there is a pattern of dubious behavior, and certainly an appearance of impropriety. The sheer scale of the money involved is daunting. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations and speaker's fees on the one hand, with contracts and agreements worth multi-millions of dollars being doled out on the other. The fact that Mrs. Clinton has not already been written off as politically dead says a lot about how perceptions of the role of money in politics have changed.","1382","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/05/sleaze-factor-2016-elections-hillary-clinton-column/26653627/"
"The Clintons' troubles bring to mind ""the sleaze factor,"" an expression used by Walter Mondale early in the 1984 presidential campaign to describe what he called ""a tawdry record of unethical conduct"" in the Reagan administration. It was rooted in allegations of misconduct among several members of Reagan's team.

"Mondale took aim specifically at then-Attorney General nominee Edwin Meese, who was being investigated by the Justice Department for a potential violation of the Ethics in Government Act. In particular, questions had arisen over a $15,000 interest-free loan from his assistant Edwin Thomas to Meese's wife, Ursula, that Meese had not reported on his financial disclosure form. Thomas, his wife and son later went on to receive Federal appointments.","1384","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/05/sleaze-factor-2016-elections-hillary-clinton-column/26653627/"
"One editorial from the time summarized the charges against Meese as ""suspicious-looking loans from people who later received White House favors [and] financial dealings that were either unreported or misreported."" That could be used as boilerplate for an article about the Clintons today. Meese was cleared of wrongdoing, only to fall afoul of the Wedtech scandal three years later, an affair the New York Times called ""too indecent and too predictable."" Again, useful boilerplate.","1385","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/05/sleaze-factor-2016-elections-hillary-clinton-column/26653627/"

The money was an honorarium that Allen's longtime friend Tamotsu Takase, husband of Japanese journalist Chizuko Takase, had tried to present to Nancy Reagan for an interview before the inauguration. Allen, then a leader of the transition team, intercepted the envelope and gave it to his secretary, who put it in the safe. He then forgot about it.","1386","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/05/sleaze-factor-2016-elections-hillary-clinton-column/26653627/"
"Allen was cleared, but was later run from office for having accepted inexpensive Japanese watches as personal gifts. This amounted to sleaze? It sounds quaint compared with the Clinton money machine.","1387","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/05/sleaze-factor-2016-elections-hillary-clinton-column/26653627/"
"Liberal commentator Tom Braden thought the sleaze factor would be a major campaign theme. He said the names of the Reagan officials under suspicion such as Meese and Allen ""do not conjure the image of openness, candor, honesty and fair-mindedness that Americans respect."" These are also words one would not immediately associate with the name Clinton.","1388","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/05/sleaze-factor-2016-elections-hillary-clinton-column/26653627/"
"The sleaze charge did not change the outcome of the 1984 election, in which Mondale was trounced. And Clinton lawyer Lanny Davis in his book Scandal noted that ""Democrats paid dearly in the Clinton years for this careless use of the charge 'corruption.'"" But not all charges are baseless. If Mrs. Clinton wins the White House, it would be useful to swear in a special prosecutor the day of the inauguration, just for the sake of convenience. It will be one busy office.","1389","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/05/sleaze-factor-2016-elections-hillary-clinton-column/26653627/"

"FIRST QUESTION: Do you regret the way the Clinton Foundation handled foreign donations when you were U.S. Secretary of State? Your opponents say the donations and your private email account are examples of the Clintons having one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everyone else.

"CLINTON: ""I am so proud of the foundation. I'm proud of the work that it has done and is doing.

"CLINTON: ""Look, I know that there have been a lot of questions about Iraq posed to candidates over the last weeks. I've been very clear that I made a mistake plain and simple. And I have written about it in my book. I've talked about it in the past and you know what we now see is a very different and very dangerous situation. The United States is doing what it can, but ultimately this has to be a struggle that the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people are determined to win for themselves.

"CLINTON: ""Well, obviously, Bill and I have been blessed and we're very grateful for the opportunities that we've had, but we've never forgotten where we came from, and we've never forgotten the country that we want to see for our granddaughter, and that means that we're going to fight to make sure that everybody has the same chances to live up to his or her own God-given potential. So I think that most Americans understand that the deck is stacked for those at the top, and I am running a campaign that is very clearly stating we want to reshuffle that deck. We want to get back to having more opportunities for more people so that they can make more out of their own lives.

"FOURTH QUESTION: Can you explain your relationship as secretary of state with Sidney Blumenthal? There's a report out this morning that you exchanged several emails. Should Americans expect that if elected president that you would have that same type of relationship with these old friends that you've had for so long? (The New York Times reported that Blumenthal wrote her memos about Libya, even as he advised for private business associates with financial interests in Libya, which blurred the ""lines between business, politics and philanthropy that have enriched and vexed the Clintons and their inner circle for years."")","1401","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/19/hillary-clinton-iowa-press-questions/27585859/"

He's been a friend of mine for a long time. He sent me unsolicited emails, which I passed on in some instances, and I see that that's just part of the give-and-take. When you're in the public eye, when you're in an official position, I think you do have to work to make sure you're not caught in the bubble and you only hear from a certain small group of people, and I'm going to keep talking to my old friends, who ever they are.""","1402","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/19/hillary-clinton-iowa-press-questions/27585859/"
"FIFTH QUESTION: We learned today that the State Department might not release your emails until January 2016. A federal judge says they should be released sooner. Will you demand that they are released sooner, and to follow up on the question about the speeches, was there a conflict of interest in your giving paid speeches into the run-up of your announcing that you're running for president?","1403","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/19/hillary-clinton-iowa-press-questions/27585859/"
"CLINTON: ""The answer to the first is: No. And the answer to the second is: I have said repeatedly, I want those emails out. Nobody has a bigger interest in getting them released than I do. I respect the State Department. They have their process, as they do for everybody, not just for me, but anything that they might do to expedite that process, I heartily support. You know, I want the American people to learn as much as we can about the work that I did with our diplomats and our development experts. Because I think that it will show how hard we worked, and the work we did for our country during the time that I was secretary of state, where I worked extremely hard on behalf of our values, and our interests and our security. And the emails are part of that. So I have said publicly — I'm repeating it here in front of all of you today — I want them out as soon as they can get out.""","1404","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/19/hillary-clinton-iowa-press-questions/27585859/"
"SIXTH QUESTION: But will you demand their release? (In March, the New York Timesrevealed that Clinton used a private email account tied to a home-based server to conduct business as secretary of state, which shielded her correspondence from the public eye and raised security questions. The State Department's proposal to release 55,000 pages of the emails, which Clinton turned over to the agency in December, comes in the wake of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, Politico reports. The proposed Jan. 15 release date would fall just a couple weeks before the Iowa caucuses, the first voting in the nation in the presidential selection process.)","1405","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/19/hillary-clinton-iowa-press-questions/27585859/"
"CLINTON: ""Well, they're not mine. They belong to the State Department.

Please move as quickly as they possibly can.""","1406","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/19/hillary-clinton-iowa-press-questions/27585859/"

"THE BACKGROUND: Since Clinton announced on April 12 that she is running for president of the United States again, she has carefully, smilingly side-stepped grillings by press gaggles and avoided sit-down interviews with reporters, saying that she wants to keep her focus this time on voters and their ideas for the country — not on herself.","1408","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/19/hillary-clinton-iowa-press-questions/27585859/"

"Much of the handwringing in the Democratic Party is over the 61% of Americans who now say Clinton is not honest and trustworthy.

"It's a long view of the former first lady’s polling data that explains why it'll take far more adversity before Clinton and her allies sense real danger.

"One could also derive inauspicious signs from her current favorability numbers given that both Bill Clinton and Obama stayed above 50% the year before they were re-elected. Most political experts hold that it’s difficult for any presidential candidate to win with a number much below that. Yet, in the current anti-Washington political climate, none of the 2016 candidates cross that threshold, according to Quinnipiac. To boot, several are already in negative territory, including Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Donald Trump, who, despite leading GOP polls, has the highest unfavorable rating of all at 54%.","1429","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/30/hillary-clinton-approval-ratings/71310258/"

""There're so many major problems facing our country. I think more debates is better. And I think having different organizations sponsor debates outside of the DNC makes a lot of sense to me.""

"But party insiders are making sure their preferred candidate — Hillary Clinton — is protected from debate. “It's all about trying to preordain the outcome, circle the wagons and close off debate,” O'Malley told The Hill. “If (the Democratic Party leaders) could actually accelerate the date of the Iowa caucuses and hold them tomorrow — they'd like to do that.

"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was keenly interested in the events in Libya before and after the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that killed the U.S. ambassador there and three other Americans, emails released by the State Department on Friday show.","4:35 p.m. EDT May 22, 2015","1449","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"The emails, from the personal email account Clinton kept while at State, showed she and her staff tracked the political fallout from the attack, including claims that she had tried to misrepresent the cause of the raid on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.","1450","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"On the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Friday, Clinton noted that the House Benghazi committee has been in possession of the emails for several months and said she is pushing the State Department to publicly release ""all of them as soon as possible.""","1451","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"Friday's release contained 296 emails that are all of the Benghazi-related emails Clinton sent from her personal account. The messages include a series of routine exchanges, such as reactions to news stories and preparations for hearings. The documents also are heavily redacted — one email about ""revised talking points"" has the content blanked out entirely.","1452","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"The files also include emails from the night of the attack, as Clinton is being updated by her staff and being notified about the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens. ""Cheryl told me the Libyans confirmed his death,"" Clinton wrote to top aides late on Sept. 11. ""Should we announce tonight or wait until morning?"" Chief of staff Cheryl Mills replied, ""We are awaiting formal confirmation from our team. We are drafting a statement while we wait."" Early the following morning Mills informed Clinton the bodies had been recovered and a statement would be released.","1453","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"The emails also provide some insight into the Clinton camp's response to charges that she and others in the administration had tried to downplay the fact that the attack was a pre-planned terror attack, instead blaming worldwide protests over an anti-Muslim video. In a Sept. 24 email, her deputy chief of staff provided a collection of her public statements and said, ""You never said spontaneous or characterized the motives. In fact you were careful in your first statement to say we were assessing motive and method. The way you treated the video in the Libya context was to say that some sought to *justify* the attack on that basis.""","1454","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"The Associated Press reported Friday that one of the emails was classified Friday at the FBI's request but was unclassified at the time Clinton received it. Clinton has said she did not send or receive classified material on her private account. She said again Friday that ""all of the information in the emails was handled appropriately.""","1455","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"""The emails we release today do not change the essential facts or our understanding of the events before, during, or after the attacks,"" the State Department said in a tweet before the emails were released.","1456","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"That is unsurprising, said Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who chairs the House Benghazi panel that is investigating the matter, because the emails were selected and vetted by Clinton's own attorneys.","1457","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"""To assume a self-selected public record is complete, when no one with a duty or responsibility to the public had the ability to take part in the selection, requires a leap in logic no impartial reviewer should be required to make and strains credibility,"" he said in a statement Friday. Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, seconded this view.","1458","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"Clinton has been broadly criticized for conducting official business over a personal email account, a practice that threatens to undermine the public record of official acts.","1459","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"In March, she said the personal email account was simply a matter of convenience. ""Looking back, it would have been better for me to use two separate phones and two separate email accounts,"" Clinton said at a news conference following a speech at a U.N. conference on women's economic status. ""I thought using one (mobile) device would be simpler. Obviously, it hasn't worked out that way.""","1460","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"Her office said that she turned over to the State Department about 30,000 emails, a little less than half the 62,000 total that she sent as secretary of State. The rest she deemed personal, and they were deleted.","1461","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"Federal officials are required to retain records related to decision-making and essential functions of the government, but it was only after Clinton left her post at the State Department that Congress passed a law tightening rules on use of private email accounts.","1462","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"Gowdy — tapped by Republicans last year to investigate the attacks on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya — has said that his committee needs all of Clinton's emails to ensure it has a complete record of information on Benghazi. Clinton was originally expected to testify before the committee this week, but Gowdy said the committee needs to settle the email questions first.","1463","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"The New York Times first reported this week that emails provided to the committee show Clinton corresponded about Benghazi with longtime advisor Sidney Blumenthal, who did not have an official government position at the time. The committee has also subpoenaed Blumenthal to discuss his correspondence with Clinton. Those emails show Clinton passing along Blumenthal's impressions of the situation in Libya to others, sometimes with suggestions that they look into his findings. Blumenthal was apparently in contact with business executives working in Libya.","1464","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"Democrats have accused Gowdy and Republicans of turning the committee into a political witch hunt. The Blumenthal subpoena is ""one more example of a partisan, taxpayer-funded attack against Secretary Clinton and her bid for president,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Benghazi committee.","1465","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"Cummings said Friday the emails ""contain no evidence to back up claims that Secretary Clinton ordered a stand-down, approved an illicit weapons program, or any other wild allegation Republicans have made for years"" about the Benghazi attacks.","1466","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"
"But Republicans are clearly not ready to give up the investigation. Gowdy said the emails ""are just one piece of information that cannot be completely evaluated or fully understood without the total record . . . We will not reach any investigative conclusions until our work is complete, but these emails continue to reinforce the fact that unresolved questions and issues remain as it relates to Benghazi.""","1467","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/22/hillary-clinton-state-department-emails/27726633/"

"Two Republican presidential candidates claim the so-called ""birther"" movement originated with the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008.

"In an interview on June 29, Sen. Ted Cruz said ""the whole birther thing was started by the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008,"" and earlier this year, Donald Trump claimed ""Hillary Clinton wanted [Obama's] birth certificate. Hillary is a birther.""","1471","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/07/02/fact-check-clinton-cruz-trump-birther/29631903/"

"At FactCheck.org, we have written about the issue of Obama's birthplace on multiple occasions — indeed we were the first media organization to hold his birth certificate in our hot little hands and vouch for the authenticity of it.

"""It's interesting, the whole birther thing was started by the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008 against Barack Obama,"" Cruz said (at about the 25:25 mark).

"The claim about Clinton's tie to ""birthers"" was made earlier by Donald Trump in February at the CPAC event (at 24:20 mark).

"Politico, April 22, 2011: The answer lies in Democratic, not Republican politics, and in the bitter, exhausting spring of 2008. At the time, the Democratic presidential primary was slipping away from Hillary Clinton and some of her most passionate supporters grasped for something, anything that would deal a final reversal to Barack Obama.","1479","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/07/02/fact-check-clinton-cruz-trump-birther/29631903/"
"According to the article, the theory that Obama was born in Kenya ""first emerged in the spring of 2008, as Clinton supporters circulated an anonymous email questioning Obama's citizenship.""","1480","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/07/02/fact-check-clinton-cruz-trump-birther/29631903/"
"The second article, which ran several days after the Politico piece, was published by the Telegraph, a British paper, which stated: ""An anonymous email circulated by supporters of Mrs Clinton, Mr Obama's main rival for the party's nomination, thrust a new allegation into the national spotlight — that he had not been born in Hawaii.""","1481","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/07/02/fact-check-clinton-cruz-trump-birther/29631903/"
"Both of those stories comport with what we here at FactCheck.org wrote two and a half years earlier, on Nov. 8, 2008: ""This claim was first advanced by diehard Hillary Clinton supporters as her campaign for the party's nomination faded, and has enjoyed a revival among John McCain's partisans as he fell substantially behind Obama in public opinion polls.""","1482","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/07/02/fact-check-clinton-cruz-trump-birther/29631903/"

"It is certainly interesting, and perhaps historically and politically relevant, that ""birther"" advocacy may have originated with supporters of Hillary Clinton — especially since many view it as an exclusively right-wing movement. But whether those theories were advocated by Clinton and/or her campaign or simply by Clinton ""supporters"" is an important distinction. Candidates are expected to be held accountable for the actions of their campaigns.

"Clinton said if she is elected, she will push to eliminate a tax break that allows investors to pay a lower rate on some investment returns than they do on regular income.

"The Clinton campaign did not respond to our inquiry about the statement, but the campaign told the Washington Post Fact Checker that Clinton got the statistic from a study by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. According to the EPI study, released in June 2014, average compensation for CEOs of the top 350 U.S. firms in 2013 was $15.2 million. That's 295.9 times higher than the compensation paid to the typical workers at those firms, the study concluded. By comparison, the ratio was 20-to-1 in 1965 and grew to a peak of 383.4-to-1 in 2000.

"But that study only looked at the CEOs of the top 350 U.S. companies. That represents a fraction of the CEOs in the U.S. In April 2013, Bloomberg looked at the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of companies and found that ""the average multiple of CEO compensation to that of rank-and-file workers is 204, up 20 percent since 2009.""","1536","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/21/fact-check-hillary-clinton-ceo-pay/27719353/"

He found they had average W-2 earnings of $4.4 million, far below the $15.2 million average compensation for the top 350 CEOs in the EPI report.

"In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that there were 246,240 chief executives in the U.S. in May 2014 (a little less than 1% of all workers). The median annual wage of those executives was $173,320 (the average wage was $180,700). That's a little less than five times the median annual wage for all workers, including chief executives, which was $35,540 then.

"When her husband was in the Oval Office and embroiled in myriad of scandals, Bill Clinton’s defenders would often say the president isn’t above the law but he isn’t below the law, either.

"Still, his defenders had a point, at least about impeachment. While we may condemn his weak character and his sordid and often-libidinous judgment, overturning the election of a sitting president is no small thing.

"On their last day in the White House, President Clinton pardoned former CIA director John Deutch, who was being investigated by the Justice Department for having a handful of classified documents on his unsecured computer at home. The mistake, Deutch explained, was born out of a desire for convenience. Sound familiar? The pardon didn’t make too much of a splash, given the more outrageous pardons of Clinton donor Marc Rich and brother Roger Clinton. But it’s hardly something the former first lady would have forgotten.

"Similarly, former CIA director David Petraeus — her Obama administration ally — had his career destroyed and barely escaped jail for being sloppy with classified material. Clinton and her defenders insist that she wasn’t sloppy with classified material, a claim two inspectors general find dubious — and much of the intelligence community finds laughable. But to even debate the details is to miss the point: When she ordered that a private server be set up in the first place — in defiance to rules set by both the State Department and the Obama White House — she should have known it was a terrible, no good, horrible idea. She surely should have known that sensitive information might be sent to her vulnerable server, even if she was careful about sending any herself (and she wasn’t careful).","1551","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/03/hillary-clinton-scandals-response-poor-attitude-column/31019703/"

"Or consider, the sordid incestuous mess that marked her tenure at the State Department while her husband and his foundation were shaking down banks and foreign governments with interests pending at the State Department. Again, forget the ample evidence suggesting that criminal laws were violated, even if there are no “smoking guns,” her judgment still comes up short. With a lifetime of experience as a lawyer in government — never mind the scandals of her husband’s presidency — she has no excuse for not knowing that the appearance of impropriety is the relevant standard.","1553","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/03/hillary-clinton-scandals-response-poor-attitude-column/31019703/"

"MIAMI — Hillary Clinton on Friday called on Congress to put an end to the 55-year-old U.S. embargo on Cuba during a speech delivered in the core of America's Cuban-American community.","4:27 p.m. EDT July 31, 2015","1601","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/31/clinton-cuba-embargo-miami/30931183/"
"Clinton, the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, supported President Obama's December decision to re-establish diplomatic relations with the communist government of Cuba and said it was now up to Congress to take the next step. A president can establish diplomatic relations, but only Congress can remove the economic embargo on the island.","1602","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/31/clinton-cuba-embargo-miami/30931183/"
"In comments aimed at Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, Clinton said: ""It's time for (Republican) leaders to either get on board or get out of the way. The Cuba embargo needs to go once and for all.""","1603","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/31/clinton-cuba-embargo-miami/30931183/"
"While Clinton has long believed that the U.S. should remove restrictions placed on American businesses to trade with Cuba and for American citizens to travel there, her speech showed how much politics in Florida have changed on the controversial issue.","1604","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/31/clinton-cuba-embargo-miami/30931183/"
"Cuban-Americans became a major political force in the presidential swing state after arriving in droves following Fidel Castro's revolution, and most of them lobbied hard to maintain the embargo as a way to force Castro and his brother, current President Raúl Castro, out of power. But the demographics in the Cuban-American community have changed in recent decades, with more identifying as Democrats and more supporting an end to the embargo.","1605","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/31/clinton-cuba-embargo-miami/30931183/"
"""No politician could've given this speech in Miami ten years ago, but it just shows how far the community has come in embracing a policy of engagement toward Cuba,"" said Ric Herrero, executive director of #CubaNow, a group formed last year to push for normalized relations with Cuba, who was at the speech. A March poll of Cuban-Americans conducted by Bendixen & Amandi International found 51% favored normalized relations with the island.","1606","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/31/clinton-cuba-embargo-miami/30931183/"
"Clinton, who'd been a longtime embargo supporter, told the crowd she's gone through a similar conversion. After the Cuban military shot down a civilian plane in 1996 operated by Brothers to the Rescue, a group that patrolled the waters between the two countries for rafters in distress, killing four people on board, Clinton said she supported strengthening the embargo. But as the years rolled on, she said she came to the conclusion that opening the doors to Cuba would do more to accelerate a transition to new leadership.","1607","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/31/clinton-cuba-embargo-miami/30931183/"
"""I understand the skepticism in this community about any policy of engagement toward Cuba,"" she told the crowd. ""As many of you know, I've been skeptical too, but you've been promised progress for 50 years, and we can't wait any longer for a failed policy to bear fruit. We were unintentionally helping the regime keep Cuba a closed and controlled society, rather than working to open it up to positive outside influences, the way we did so effectively with the old Soviet block in Eastern Europe.""","1608","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/31/clinton-cuba-embargo-miami/30931183/"

"""Unilateral concessions to the Castros will only strengthen a brutal, anti-American regime 90 miles from our shore,"" he said in a statement.

"Instead, Clinton received several standing ovations from a crowd that included Miriam Leiva. One of the founders of the ""Ladies in White,"" a group founded in Cuba in 2003 when their husbands were arrested during a crackdown on human rights advocates and journalists, Leiva said the road to normalization is already well underway.

"In 2009, when soon-to-be Secretary of State Hillary Clinton first broached the idea of running her work email through a private server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., the concept should have been dismissed as laughable.","5:40 p.m. EDT August 23, 2015","1910","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/23/hillary-clinton-email-server-fbi-editorials-debates/31992283/"
"But it wasn't, and for reasons more likely having to do with control than convenience, Clinton went ahead with the plan. Now that top secret information, intelligence agency inspectors general, the FBI and federal judges are involved, the matter is far from amusing.","1911","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/23/hillary-clinton-email-server-fbi-editorials-debates/31992283/"
"Clinton, though, seems to think she can dismiss the controversy by making light of it. Earlier this month in Iowa, the presidential candidate joked to a crowd of Democratic Party faithful about sending future communications over the app Snapchat, which famously makes text and photos disappear soon after they are viewed. At a testy press availability on Tuesday, Clinton went for the laugh line again after being asked whether her email server had been wiped clean. ""Like with a cloth?"" she replied, adding that nobody talks to her about the email controversy except reporters.","1912","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/23/hillary-clinton-email-server-fbi-editorials-debates/31992283/"
"Maybe she doesn't get asked about it at tightly controlled town meetings, but the episode raises serious questions about the Democratic front-runner's decision-making and commitment to openness in government. One of the many reasons that it was a bad idea to mix personal and business messages is well known to anyone with an email account: As hard as you might try, you can't control what comes into your inbox. And if you're the secretary of State, that's inevitably going to include some sensitive information.","1913","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/23/hillary-clinton-email-server-fbi-editorials-debates/31992283/"
"Last week, a Justice Department national security investigation kicked into higher gear after intelligence agency officials determined that top secret information had indeed passed through the private email account. The FBI has taken control of the server and thumb drives storing backup data. The number of potentially classified emails involved jumped from a handful to more than 300, according to a State Department count filed in federal court. A federal judge overseeing a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit said, ""We wouldn't be here today if this employee"" — Clinton — ""had followed government policy.""","1914","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/23/hillary-clinton-email-server-fbi-editorials-debates/31992283/"
"Clinton's stance has evolved from saying that no classified material passed through her private account (March), to saying she didn't send or receive anything that was classified at the time (last month), to saying she didn't send any material that was explicitly marked or designated classified (last week).","1915","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/23/hillary-clinton-email-server-fbi-editorials-debates/31992283/"

"Scandals surrounding Clinton and her husband have a habit of being stoked by both the Clintons' penchant for secrecy and their political enemies' overzealousness. Amid all the investigations and lawsuits, a resolution of the email affair will be long in coming. A couple of things, however, are already clear.","1917","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/23/hillary-clinton-email-server-fbi-editorials-debates/31992283/"
"One is that Clinton and her team should have turned the server over to the State Department's inspector general, or perhaps the National Archives, for an independent, confidential sorting of the 62,000 messages. Instead, they took it on themselves to delete about half the messages as personal and scrub the server, raising inevitable suspicions about a coverup.","1918","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/23/hillary-clinton-email-server-fbi-editorials-debates/31992283/"
"Another is that, contrary to the Clinton camp's assertion that the controversy is a lot of ""nonsense,"" federal computer security is no joke.

"As even presidential incumbents have discovered, voters care more about what a candidate will do for them in the future than what he or she has achieved in the past.

"To become the nation’s first female president, Clinton needs strong levels of support from all women, though her immediate challenge may be to improve her standing among white women. Older, working-class white women, many of whom remember the battle for an Equal Rights Amendment, have long formed the backbone of her base of support. However, in an August Quinnipiac poll, Clinton's favorability among white women was 35%, 9 points lower than with woman as a whole and a 10-point drop from April when she launched her campaign.","2104","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/03/hillary-clinton-women-campaign-issues/71657980/"

"Marie Harf, a former department spokeswoman, was asked at a press briefing on March 3 whether there was a connection between the department's request for Clinton's emails and the House Select Committee on Benghazi's request for documents related to the deadly Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Libya. Harf said the department in October 2014 sent letters to Clinton and three other secretaries ""as part of our records maintenance upgrading.""","2113","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/24/fact-check-hillary-clinton-email-narrative/72735716/"

"Clinton and her campaign have stuck to that timeline and narrative. Clinton repeatedly has said she was ""asked to help the State Department"" with ""their record-keeping."" She stressed that it was ""not just me"" but four other secretaries of State who received the October letter asking for copies of work-related emails. She did so most recently on Sept. 20 during an appearance on CBS' Face the Nation.","2115","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/24/fact-check-hillary-clinton-email-narrative/72735716/"
"We now learn, however, from The Washington Post that the State Department in the summer of 2014 contacted Clinton's representatives to discuss her emails and her personal computer server, and that those conversations were prompted by the House committee on Benghazi and resulted in the letters that went out in October 2014.","2116","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/24/fact-check-hillary-clinton-email-narrative/72735716/"

"It makes sense that the State Department would have contacted Clinton's representatives in the summer of 2014, because the State Department has said that on Aug. 11, 2014, it gave the House Benghazi committee 15,000 pages of documents related to the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi that resulted in the deaths of four Americans.

"The fact is, though, Clinton and her campaign — with the initial help of the State Department — provided an incomplete and misleading account when asked a fundamental question about the email controversy. Clinton described the request for her emails as a routine record-keeping request that was made to several former secretaries, just as she has inaccurately described her unusual email arrangement as common because previous ""secretaries of State"" did the ""same thing."" In fact only one, Colin Powell, used personal emails for government business, and he didn't have a personal server.","2121","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/24/fact-check-hillary-clinton-email-narrative/72735716/"

"After Clinton formally entered the race, her campaign posted a second, undated Q&A called ""Updated: The Facts About Hillary Clinton's Emails"" that repeated the question and answer about why the department asked for her emails.

"For races other than president, it is peak candidate recruitment season, and political professionals in both parties have their sights sets on women.

"During the last election cycle, The Atlantic’s Molly Ball wrote that political pros felt women had advantages in terms of being “trustworthy, less corruptible, and more in touch with everyday concerns.” Given Washington’s dysfunction, their “outsider” status was also thought to be a plus. The very qualities that make female candidates especially attractive to recruiters could imperil Hillary Clinton’s candidacy.","2128","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/14/hillary-clinton-not-perfect-woman-candidate-column/72253076/"
"The preference of seasoned pros for female candidates might seem surprising given some long-held biases about female candidates. Polls from the 1970s and 1980s show prejudice against women, particularly on handling military matters. But as we show in the forthcoming edition of AEI’s Political Report, those have largely disappeared. When the Pew Research Center asked in 2014 about women and men in “high political office” dealing with national security and defense, a majority of women and men said there would be no difference between the sexes. Significant majorities also said that female and male officeholders would handle issues such as education, health care, the environment, and economic conditions in similar ways. Seventy-six percent of women and 74% of men said women and men would make equally good political leaders in general.","2129","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/14/hillary-clinton-not-perfect-woman-candidate-column/72253076/"
"Pew also asked about personal qualities. Roughly six-in-ten men and women said there are no differences between the sexes on “being honest and ethical,” but of the remainder, far more thought women were better. This is a problem for Hillary. In recent months, she has lost ground on being honest and trustworthy and on being in touch with people’s everyday concerns — the exact traits that recruiters believe distinguish women candidates. And of course no one would call her an outsider.","2130","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/14/hillary-clinton-not-perfect-woman-candidate-column/72253076/"
"In the late August Quinnipiac poll, 61% of registered voters said she is not honest and trustworthy (34% said she is). On this question, her numbers were worse than Donald Trump’s!

In July, 58% of white women with less than a college degree rated her negatively, up from 40% in March. Forty-seven percent of white women with a college degree, a group especially central to her core base of supporters, rated her negatively, up from 35% in March.","2132","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/14/hillary-clinton-not-perfect-woman-candidate-column/72253076/"

Every day, every ambassador also looks at risk, and thanks to Secretary Clinton's initiative, works to implement every single recommendation of the non-partisan Accountability Review Board convened after the tragic death of our colleagues in Benghazi, Libya.","6:24 p.m. EDT October 21, 2015","2473","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/21/hillary-clinton-secretary-of-state-embassies-john-kerry-column/74328300/"
"Sadly, I was at Andrews Air Force Base to honor the fallen Americans after the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and then again after Benghazi. What we learned in 1998 and again in 2012 is that the world changes; that we cannot know, particularly in an age of threats from terrorists, what new challenge will come at us. But what Secretary Clinton did to meet this challenge, and Secretary Madeleine Albright before her, is what matters.","2474","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/21/hillary-clinton-secretary-of-state-embassies-john-kerry-column/74328300/"
"Because of Secretary Clinton's leadership, our diplomats are more prepared and the Defense Department has more assets to help with evacuations. We have expanded and enhanced training for diplomatic security, particularly for high-risk, high-threat posts. We've created more diplomatic security positions and secured more support from Marine guards. We adopted the Vital Presence Validation Process to assess appropriate staffing levels at high-threat posts.","2475","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/21/hillary-clinton-secretary-of-state-embassies-john-kerry-column/74328300/"
"Because of Secretary Clinton, and, of course, President Obama, our highest priority is security, for our diplomats and for our nation. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton also took critical action to make our world safer, fundamental to making our diplomats and our country safer. She guided the State Department to repair relations around the globe and brokered major agreements that made our world safer, such as the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. She led the effort to impose the toughest sanctions in U.S. history on Iran, fought to expand Internet freedom and continually promoted the betterment of women and girls.","2476","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/21/hillary-clinton-secretary-of-state-embassies-john-kerry-column/74328300/"

"Quite frankly, my former colleagues, who labor every day, now under Secretary Kerry's leadership to ensure our safety, are often dispirited by the polarization and dysfunction of our political system. Congress has now spent 17 months and $4.5 million of taxpayer money in a secret, partisan congressional investigation that has not made one single recommendation. It would be more productive for Congress to increase the overall State Department budget so we could harden more embassies, have more programs for countering violent extremism and build even stronger efforts to thwart terrorists. Indeed, we are heartened that Secretary Clinton has insisted that she testify publicly, not only to answer the committee's questions but also to continue her effective advocacy for security for all of us.","2478","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/21/hillary-clinton-secretary-of-state-embassies-john-kerry-column/74328300/"
"Members of our diplomatic corps risk their lives everyday all around the world in an effort to broker peaceful solutions to perilous conflicts. Even simple acts, such as a young woman diplomat's delivery of books to ensure girls' education in Afghanistan, can end in horrific tragedy. When airlines announce before a flight that servicemembers can board first, I want them to include diplomats who also provide such service. Secretary Clinton honors the memory of all of our fallen as she testifies, yet again, to do whatever she can to hold tragedy back. It's time that Congress also honor their legacy and truly focus on strengthening our expeditionary diplomacy, rather than going on seemingly fruitless fishing expeditions.","2479","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/21/hillary-clinton-secretary-of-state-embassies-john-kerry-column/74328300/"

"The next commander in chief faces many challenges, not the least of which is a Department of Veterans Affairs that routinely neglects America's heroes and even leaves some to die. Yet the leading Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, refuses to acknowledge a nationwide problem exists.","4:54 p.m. EST November 12, 2015","2698","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/05/vet-crisis-hillary-clinton-va-column/75152486/"
"Clinton made her views known in an Oct. 23 interview with MSNBC. She declared that last year's wait-list scandal in Phoenix was little more than an anomaly: ""It's not been as widespread as it has been made out to be."" She also claimed that ""veterans who do get treated are satisfied with their treatment,"" while arguing that Republicans manufactured a non-existent crisis to serve their political ends.","2699","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/05/vet-crisis-hillary-clinton-va-column/75152486/"
"These are astounding comments from someone who wants to command America's men and women in uniform. They betray a shocking ignorance of the facts on the ground. Time and again, the VA has let down the veterans who fought and bled for their country. Simply look at the reams of evidence released since the wait-list scandal was first uncovered in Phoenix in April 2014.","2700","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/05/vet-crisis-hillary-clinton-va-column/75152486/"
"The crisis at the Phoenix VA is well-known. An April Arizona Republic story led to the discovery that ""more than 40 Arizona veterans died while waiting for treatment"" at the facility. To cover up this grisly fact, the facility's managers designed an elaborate and secret waiting list that hid the fact that as many as 1,600 veterans had wait times that often stretched to a year or more.","2701","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/05/vet-crisis-hillary-clinton-va-column/75152486/"
"This horrific practice was not unique to Phoenix. That May, only a month after the scandal hit national headlines, the VA's office of inspector general found that ""inappropriate scheduling practices are systemic"" in the VA health care system, with similar secret waiting lists later discovered at facilities in other states. An internal VA audit released that June found further problems. Employees at 76% of VA facilities had been instructed to change dates for patient appointments. Additionally, more than 57,000 newly enrolled veterans faced wait times of at least 90 days, while nearly 64,000 veterans requested appointments that never arrived.","2702","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/05/vet-crisis-hillary-clinton-va-column/75152486/"
"Subsequent reports have been even more damning. Only two months ago, the VA's inspector general found that a staggering 307,000 veterans might have passed away while waiting to enroll. And in some areas, the VA's record has only gotten worse since last year. Department officials admitted this summer that the number of veterans waiting more than a month for health care was actually 50% higher than at the height of the wait-list scandal.","2703","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/05/vet-crisis-hillary-clinton-va-column/75152486/"
"These facts put Clinton's first claim in context. If anything, the VA's problems are more widespread than they've been made out to be. America's veterans deal with them every day.","2704","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/05/vet-crisis-hillary-clinton-va-column/75152486/"
"Nor should it be a surprise that Clinton's second claim — that veterans are happy with the VA's health care — is equally specious. Many of the veterans who receive care are indeed happy. But the men and women who died waiting for care never had the chance to make their views known. Similarly, the hundreds of thousands of wait-listed veterans are not counted among the evidence Clinton cites.","2705","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/05/vet-crisis-hillary-clinton-va-column/75152486/"
"Other polls show the true state of veterans' feelings about the VA. Concerned Veterans for America, a non-profit that supports significant VA reforms, released a nationwide poll of veterans on Oct. 21. Its findings speak for themselves. Nearly nine in 10 respondents — 88% — say all veterans should have increased access to non-VA health care. And 91% say the VA needs reform, and fast.","2706","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/05/vet-crisis-hillary-clinton-va-column/75152486/"

"Behind these statistics are the faces of servicemembers and their families, countless of whom have suffered from the VA's neglect. Hardly a day goes by without a local headline or newscast telling the story of veterans who waited weeks, months or even years before receiving care — if they received care at all. Yet despite the overwhelming evidence, Hillary Clinton downplayed the existence of systemic problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs, while simultaneously blaming the issue on her political opponents.","2708","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/05/vet-crisis-hillary-clinton-va-column/75152486/"

"WASHINGTON — In case voters haven't noticed, Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to make it clear that he and Democratic presidential campaign rival Hillary Clinton are very different candidates.

"“She and I have very different points of view of on a number of issues,” Sanders told the Burlington (Vt.

"Sanders wants to stress his plan to reinstate the Glass-Steagall law that separated commercial and investment banking activities, a progressive priority that Clinton hasn't endorsed, Devine said.

"At the last debate, Sanders handed Clinton a gift by saying the country was tired of hearing about the former secretary of state's ""damn emails.” He has long said an FBI investigation into her use of a private email server while she served as secretary of State should be allowed to play itself out.","2730","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/12/bernie-sanders-highlight-disagreements-wth-hillary-clinton/75654066/"

"But it’s not enough for Sanders to say he’s more progressive than Clinton, said Dante Scala, associate professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire.

My experience during 38 years in the Foreign Service, including six assignments as an ambassador, has given me a perspective on these issues that differs from some of the arguments developed by the Committee.","10:17 a.m. EST November 13, 2015","2763","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/13/hillary-clinton-state-libya-afghanistan-syria-iraq-column/75666568/"
"First, about security. Every secretary of State and every ambassador has security as a top priority. It is a dangerous world, and we are everywhere in it. An ambassador is responsible for the security of her personnel and her embassy. Internal defense plans, risk assessment, movement controls, adequate defensive systems — these are all on the shoulders of the chief of mission. The department is responsible for getting her what she says she needs. There is no perfect security. Risk has to be measured against mission requirements, and only the ambassador can do that.","2764","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/13/hillary-clinton-state-libya-afghanistan-syria-iraq-column/75666568/"
"The State Department is organized for crises. When the balloon goes up, you don’t email the Secretary. You call the Operations Center. Staffed around the clock, Ops will put you in instant contact with State Department principals, wherever they may be in the world. It’s our 911, and it works.","2765","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/13/hillary-clinton-state-libya-afghanistan-syria-iraq-column/75666568/"
"It probably won’t be the secretary you’re talking to in a security crisis. I was ambassador to Afghanistan under Secretary Clinton. We had some bad days there. In September 2011, the Embassy endured a 12 hour standoff attack by heavily armed terrorists. Clinton stayed abreast of the unfolding situation and made clear that we should get anything we needed. She followed up in the aftermath. Condi Rice took the same approach during and after attacks on the Embassy in Baghdad when I was there, as did Madeleine Albright when my embassy in Damascus was besieged by a mob. This is as it should be. The last thing you want in a hard fight is a call from Washington asking how you’re doing.","2766","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/13/hillary-clinton-state-libya-afghanistan-syria-iraq-column/75666568/"
"Tragically, there was no day after for Chris Stevens. Nor was there for six other American ambassadors killed in the line of duty since 1968. In three of my six posts as ambassador, a predecessor was killed. It’s a tough business — risk can be managed but it cannot be eliminated if we’re doing our jobs in a volatile world.","2767","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/13/hillary-clinton-state-libya-afghanistan-syria-iraq-column/75666568/"
"In over 15 years as an ambassador in some pretty rough neighborhoods, I had exactly one significant discussion with a secretary of State on security. That was with Jim Baker in 1991 on the eve of the first Gulf War which led to a decision to temporarily close the embassy in Beirut (other secretaries, including former secretary Clinton, have also ordered post closures when the experts recommended it). All secretaries take the security of their personnel and facilities abroad very seriously. But they don’t personally run security programs. That’s not how the department works, nor should it.","2768","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/13/hillary-clinton-state-libya-afghanistan-syria-iraq-column/75666568/"
"Some on the Benghazi Committee conveyed the impression that Mrs. Clinton has a detached and disengaged leadership style. I saw it differently.

"My first contact with Hillary Clinton as secretary of State was in early 2009 during her first weeks on the job and my last weeks as ambassador to Iraq where I had been for two years. She wanted my perspective on dynamics in the country, the likely course of events and implications for the U.S. She struck me as anything but detached.","2770","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/13/hillary-clinton-state-libya-afghanistan-syria-iraq-column/75666568/"
"More than two years later, she swore me in as ambassador to Afghanistan. After the ceremony, she asked me to remain, and the two of us sat down. No aides and no notes. She basically laid out my work plan: reset our strained relationship with President Karzai and negotiate a comprehensive bilateral agreement with the Afghan government (the president traveled to Kabul to sign it the following May). She was clear, direct and focused. I left knowing what I needed to get done and that she would be very much engaged.","2771","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/13/hillary-clinton-state-libya-afghanistan-syria-iraq-column/75666568/"

"That didn’t mean that she would be on the phone regularly when I was in Kabul. I worked closely with Marc Grossman, a career Foreign Service officer who had succeeded Richard Holbrooke as Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. He saw then-secretary Clinton regularly, conveying her guidance to me and relaying my views and assessments. That’s how the business of diplomacy works — the secretary should not be the action officer, even (or especially) for the toughest posts. Complex issues require careful staffing and coordination to insure that the secretary has everything she needs to make the right decision. That was just as true in Condi Rice’s State Department as Hillary Clinton’s.","2773","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/13/hillary-clinton-state-libya-afghanistan-syria-iraq-column/75666568/"
"When she visited Kabul or I joined her for major Afghanistan conferences elsewhere, then-secretary Clinton was always focused, wanting to hear from me what she needed to get done and then going out and doing it.

"On Wednesday, Democratic presidential candidate and former secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke sharply with President Obama over the issue of the multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement (TPP). In an interview with PBS' News Hour, Clinton said she was “not in favor of what (she has) learned about it,"" listing specific objections to weak protections against currency manipulation and too many benefits for pharmaceutical companies. She said that any such deal should create American jobs, raise wages and advance national security. Clinton said she felt the TPP failed to meet “the high bar” that she set, though she admitted she was still “trying to learn as much as (she could) about the agreement.”","7:46 p.m. EDT October 7, 2015","2778","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/07/hillary-clinton-tpp-trade-deal-obama-against-column/73539936/"
"This is a very different take from when she was secretary of State. In Singapore on Nov. 17, 2012, in a speech headlined, “Delivering on the Promise of Economic Statecraft,” Clinton praised the “far-reaching new trade agreement"" that sought to “lower barriers, raise standards and drive long-term growth across the region.” It would “cover 40% of the world's total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment.” She promised that “better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions, including for women, migrant workers and others too often in the past excluded from the formal economy will help build Asia's middle class and rebalance the global economy.”","2779","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/07/hillary-clinton-tpp-trade-deal-obama-against-column/73539936/"
"Two days earlier in Australia, she said the TPP “sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.”","2780","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/07/hillary-clinton-tpp-trade-deal-obama-against-column/73539936/"

"Of course, this was just aspirational rhetoric for a deal that was still being hashed out. While 15 of 19 formal rounds of TPP negotiations took place on her watch, it is possible that in the latter rounds, or in the subsequent series of high-level meetings between negotiators and ministers, the agreement changed radically in ways she had no knowledge of.","2782","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/07/hillary-clinton-tpp-trade-deal-obama-against-column/73539936/"
"That also assumes she was highly engaged in the TPP process to begin with. She did not mention it in her farewell address to State Department employees, nor did it come up during her joint valedictory 60 Minutes interview with President Obama in January 2013. Matters pertaining to the TPP do not stand out in the Clinton emails that have been released by the State Department. Maybe one reason Clinton is trying to learn as much as she can about the deal is that she didn’t know much about the details to begin with and since she left government, the details have continued to be under wraps.","2783","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/07/hillary-clinton-tpp-trade-deal-obama-against-column/73539936/"
"In assessing the degree of Clinton’s flip-flop on the issue, we are faced with an opaque trade agreement that the White House has not been forthcoming about, against the word of a highly secretive former secretary of State with no obvious paper trail on the issue beyond some platitudes in speeches. Who can say what the truth is? Maybe she signed off on the provisions of the deal she now vigorously objects to. Maybe the TPP changed significantly from what she approved in the two years after January 2013. Maybe she was sidelined during the entire process and never had any influence. As usual with Hillary Clinton, we have no way of separating fact from fiction.","2784","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/07/hillary-clinton-tpp-trade-deal-obama-against-column/73539936/"

"Over the weekend, Washington Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt was unsparing in his criticism of President Obama’s Syria policy. According to Hiatt, Obama has “presided over a humanitarian and cultural disaster of epochal proportions” and, worse, has done so while telling Americans that it’s no big deal.","8:28 a.m. EDT September 10, 2015","2787","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/10/obama-hillary-clinton-middle-east-debacles-column/71949834/"
"Hiatt is certainly correct about the humanitarian and cultural disaster, and also about Obama’s do-nothing approach. He notes, “On those rare occasions when political pressure or the horrors of Syrian suffering threatened to overwhelm any excuse for inaction, he promised action, in statements or White House leaks: training for the opposition, a safe zone on the Turkish border. Once public attention moved on, the plans were abandoned or scaled back to meaningless proportions (training 50 soldiers per year, no action on the Turkish border).”","2788","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/10/obama-hillary-clinton-middle-east-debacles-column/71949834/"
"Obama initially called for the removal of Syrian President Bashar Assad, only to back down in the face of opposition from Vladimir Putin. Since then, the United States has postured a bit, but done nothing of consequence. The signal to our enemies: It’s safe to ignore us. The signal to our friends: It’s foolish to rely on us.","2789","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/10/obama-hillary-clinton-middle-east-debacles-column/71949834/"
"Now, as the war in Syria has expanded — with the U.S. arming and supporting various groups that have shown a disturbing tendency to take our guns and then switch sides — refugees are flooding Europe.

"This would be bad enough if Syria were the Obama administration’s only foreign policy misstep, but instead it is merely representative of a larger problem. President Obama bragged about Yemen as a showpiece of his administration’s anti-terror program’s success; a few months later, Yemen was taken over by terrorists and now an ugly civil war, featuring Saudi troops, rages there. The administration’s responses, as even the Obama-friendly Vox.com notes, have been ”cringe-worthy.”","2791","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/10/obama-hillary-clinton-middle-east-debacles-column/71949834/"
"Then there’s Libya. Under President George W. Bush, the United States reached an agreement with Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi under which Gadhafi would give up his weapons of mass destruction in exchange for the United States no longer trying to depose him. But just years later, the Obama administration, spearheaded by then-secretary of State Hillary Clinton, went ahead and toppled him anyway. Now Libya, too, is wracked by bloody civil war, and sending waves of refugees pouring into Europe. At the time, Hillary thought the war on Gadhafi would be a strong selling point in her 2016 presidential campaign (""We came, we saw, he died,"" she joked after Gadhafi fell, and advisor Sidney Blumenthal told her to tout her ""successful strategy” to the press); now she’s not talking about it much.","2792","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/10/obama-hillary-clinton-middle-east-debacles-column/71949834/"
"But Democratic presidential candidate Jim Webb has gone after her: ""We blew the lid off of a series of tribal engagements. You can't get to the Tripoli Airport right now, much less Benghazi."" And others are likely to ask her whether toppling Gadhafi was justified, and, if not, why we should trust her judgment in the future. Others are likely to note that she also supported the invasion of Iraq.","2793","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/10/obama-hillary-clinton-middle-east-debacles-column/71949834/"
"And Iraq is an issue, too. As late as 2010, Joe Biden was bragging about how well things were going in Iraq, and as late as 2014, Obama was mocking ISIS as a terrorist JV team. In 2011, in a move calculated to solidify support among Democrats before the 2012 elections, Obama removed U.S. troops from Iraq. Not only did we lose the stabilizing influence of a U.S. troop presence, but we also lost the painstakingly built up intelligence networks that American forces had assembled over a decade, allowing the Administration to be blindsided by the rapid growth of ISIS.","2794","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/10/obama-hillary-clinton-middle-east-debacles-column/71949834/"
"As journalist Bob Woodward noted: “Look, Obama does not like war. But as you look back on this, the argument from the military was, let’s keep 10,000, 15,000 troops there as an insurance policy. And we all know insurance policies make sense. We have 30,000 troops or more in South Korea still 65 years or so after the war. When you are a superpower, you have to buy these insurance policies. And he didn’t in this case.” And we, and Iraqis, are paying the price.","2795","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/10/obama-hillary-clinton-middle-east-debacles-column/71949834/"
"In the Middle East, everything Obama has touched has failed disastrously — and he’s had help in this failure from Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. With 2016 coming, will that provide an opening for Democratic candidates — like Webb, perhaps, or Bernie Sanders — who are untouched by these failures? Maybe so. But a bigger question is what burdens will America, and the world, have to bear because of this awful record.

"The collection of investigative reports reached harsh conclusions. Requests for extra security in Benghazi went unheeded in the weeks and months before the attacks, and there was poor communication within the State Department about those requests.

"“Dozens of emails between Clinton and Blumenthal show an individual who tried to heavily influence the Secretary of State to intervene in Libya,” Gowdy wrote to Cummings.","2822","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/21/benghazi-committee-timeline-clinton-gowdy/74261098/"
"Gowdy also alleges Blumenthal was “pushing Secretary Clinton to war in Libya” because he had a financial interest in a company that stood to win contracts with the new Libyan government.","2823","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/21/benghazi-committee-timeline-clinton-gowdy/74261098/"

"Gowdy told Face the Nation on Sunday that the committee recently received additional emails from Ambassador Stevens, which have not been reviewed by any other committee.

"WASHINGTON — As John Boehner was about to win the speaker’s gavel in 2010, Hillary Clinton’s political confidant offered a crude and scathing assessment of the Ohio Republican — calling him “lazy” and “louche.”","3:28 p.m. EDT September 1, 2015","2827","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/01/blumenthal-boehner-clinton-email/71508778/"

"“They are repelled by his personal behavior. He is louche, alcoholic, lazy, and without any commitment to any principle,” Blumenthal wrote in a note to Clinton on Election Day in 2010, when the Tea Party movement swept House Republicans into power and elevated Boehner to House speaker.","2829","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/01/blumenthal-boehner-clinton-email/71508778/"

"“The fact is the only reason that the mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her staff has been exposed is because of Speaker Boehner's decision to create the select committee and our members' diligence and hard work,” said Emily Schillinger, Boehner’s spokeswoman.","2831","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/01/blumenthal-boehner-clinton-email/71508778/"
"Boehner created a House select committee to investigate the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya. In seeking records about Clinton’s handling of that attack, the panel discovered Clinton was using a private email account to conduct official State Department business.","2832","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/01/blumenthal-boehner-clinton-email/71508778/"
"Republicans have criticized Clinton’s move, saying she put national security information at risk and was trying to avoid disclosure laws.

"In addition to the personal attack on Boehner, Blumenthal offered a blistering political take on the Ohio Republican — portraying him as spineless and scared of the Tea Party faction in his ranks.","2835","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/01/blumenthal-boehner-clinton-email/71508778/"
"“He is not (former House speaker Newt) Gingrich, the natural leader of a ‘revolution,’ riding the crest into power,” Blumenthal wrote. “He is careworn and threadbare, banal and hollow, holding nobody's enduring loyalty. Boehner is beholden and somewhat scared of his base. He twitches when they make gestures that might undermine his position.”","2836","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/01/blumenthal-boehner-clinton-email/71508778/"

"“His impulse is to hand out money,” Blumenthal said. “But Boehner is neither feared nor loved. He's a would-be DeLay without the whip. He's the one at the end of the lash.”","2838","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/01/blumenthal-boehner-clinton-email/71508778/"

"“Congressional Republicans are vulnerable to a strategy that takes advantage of their internal divisions,” he wrote. “Policies/tactics should be calculated to locate GOP fissures, find political space by widening schisms, and ultimately break them apart. This is, emphatically, not a strategy of bipartisanship as Obama has pursued it so far. It is a different and more informed approach.”","2840","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/01/blumenthal-boehner-clinton-email/71508778/"

"As a woman, I believe my ability to make decisions about my own body is a fundamental right. But, there are many candidates running for president, and many others in Congress, like Iowa's Sen. Joni Ernst, who want to deny me, and all other women, that right. I have heard candidates promising to overturn Roe v. Wade, and others are leading the charge to legislate abortion bans with no exceptions for rape, incest or health of the mother. The decision to end a pregnancy is deeply personal and complex. Politicians cannot possibly know a woman's circumstance unless s/he has walked in her shoes. We don't need candidates that judge and condemn women. We need to elect a president who respects every woman and recognizes that choice belongs to each individual woman, not the government. Hillary Clinton is that candidate. Hillary has been a life-long advocate of a woman’s right to choose. She has stood up time and time again to Republican attempts to limit women’s freedom and sovereignty over their own bodies. Unlike her counterparts on the right, Hillary Clinton would uphold Roe v. Wade, fight against bills that endanger women's health, and would stand with the organizations that are integral to this fight, such as Planned Parenthood. This is important to me not just because I am a woman, but because there are so many women out there that I care about, women who are mothers, grandmothers, sisters and daughters who deserve the right to make their own decisions about their bodies. We all, regardless of gender, should fight this battle for them. That’s why I am committing to caucusing for Hillary Clinton, a true champion for the rights of women.","9:22 p.m. EDT September 17, 2015","2843","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/09/17/hillary-clinton-champions-womens-health-rights/32517151/"

"USA TODAY’s article can’t be serious when it claims that Carly Fiorina’s campaign will take a hit if Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee because gender will not be an issue (“Carly Fiorina’s gender may not be asset in 2016 race”).

Carly will eat Hillary’s lunch if the two ever have to square off in a debate, and it will be Hillary losing support from women voters.","2846","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/27/carly-fiorina-hillary-clinton-ben-carson-your-say/72944328/"
