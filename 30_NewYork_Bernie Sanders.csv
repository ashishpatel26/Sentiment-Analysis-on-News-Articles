"If you were expecting a slick campaign video, or a big set-piece speech, to herald Bernie Sanders’s entry into the 2016 race, you don’t know the man or what he represents. For months now, the seventy-three-year-old Vermont senator has been indicating he would run for President. The official announcement, which came in the form of an e-mail to his supporters, merely confirmed that he’ll contest the Democratic primary rather than run as an independent. (Although he caucuses with the Senate Democrats, Sanders was elected in 2006 and 2012 as an “independent socialist.”)","April 30, 2015","1","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"

"The contrast with the carefully orchestrated launches of the Clinton, Cruz, and Rubio campaigns, to name but three, wasn’t due to the fact that Sanders hasn’t got any money—he has almost five million dollars left over from his last Senate campaign. Sanders was sending the message that he isn’t so much a candidate as an anti-candidate. Even more than Howard Dean’s pitch, in 2004, Sanders’s will be based on the proposition that American politics are broken and corrupted to their core, and that only an insurgency can do anything about it. “Let’s be clear,” Sanders said in his e-mail. “This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It’s about a grassroots movement of Americans standing up and saying: ‘Enough is enough. This country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.’ ”","3","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"That last line is one Sanders uses a lot, and it cuts across party lines. Mainly, he uses it to lambaste post-Citizens United Republicans, with their motley assortment of right-wing sugar daddies, from the Koch brothers to Sheldon Adelson to Harold Simmons. But Sanders has also accused the Democratic Party of playing the money game and pandering to wealthy donors. Last November, for example, he said that Party leaders had failed to make clear “that they are prepared to stand with the working-class people of this country, take on the big-money interests.” Now that he’s running in the Democratic primary, we can expect to hear him repeat this argument and apply it to the establishment candidate, Hillary Clinton. Indeed, he’s already doing this.","4","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Asked by Jonathan Karl, of ABC News, what he thought about the controversy over donations from wealthy foreign interests to the Clinton Foundation, Sanders replied, “It tells me what is a very serious problem. It’s not just about Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton. It is about a political system today that is dominated by big money. It’s about the Koch brothers being prepared to spend nine hundred million dollars in the coming election. … We’re looking at a system where our democracy is being owned by a handful of billionaires.”","5","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Sanders isn’t an attack dog. He likes to boast that he has never run a negative ad, and, rather than personalizing things, he generally sticks to the issues. Asked at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday why he was a better candidate than Clinton, he dodged the question. But the Clinton Foundation isn’t the only area where, in the past few days, he has raised questions about Clinton’s record. During an interview on CNN, he said that she ought to say whether she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade deal that the Obama Administration is trying to complete. And, in an interview with the Associated Press, Sanders reminded people that Clinton voted for the Iraq War and he voted against it.","6","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Despite these pointed statements, the conventional wisdom in political circles is that Sanders’s entry into the race is good news for Team Brooklyn. He can’t win the primary, the argument goes, and he will occupy the space to the left of Clinton, thus denying it to more plausible candidates, such as Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland. That may be true. But if Sanders succeeds in building a vigorous grassroots campaign, as Dean did in 2004, he could still have a significant impact on the contest.","7","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Admittedly, that’s a big if. For much of his career, Sanders has been a loner rather than a team player. His social-media presence is respectable but not huge. (His Facebook page has just under a million “likes”; on Twitter, he has close to three hundred thousand followers. ) Until he shows that he can attract big crowds and raise money from small donors, other players on the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, such as labor unions and environmental groups, will remain wary of endorsing him.","8","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"But, for all the challenges Sanders faces, his presence in the Democratic primary field is surely a plus. As I pointed out a few months ago, when he released his Economic Agenda for America, he’s a genuine economic populist, and many of his policy proposals—such as spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure investment, introducing a carbon tax, and replacing private health insurance with Medicare for all—are eminently defensible, if politically unrealistic. Most of all, he will provide a voice to those Democrats who agree with him that the U.S. political system has been bought, lock, stock, and barrel. In the televised debates and elsewhere, he will demand that the other candidates, Clinton included, respond to this indictment and say what they intend to do about it.","9","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"That alone is sufficient reason to welcome Sanders to the race. If, in addition, he manages to expand the range of policy options that can be openly discussed and forces Clinton to move from generalities to specifics, he will have performed a real public service.","10","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"

"For months now, Elizabeth Warren, the liberal senator from Massachusetts, has been saying she isn’t running for President, but that hasn’t stopped people from speculating about whether she might enter the race at some point. “Now, you didn’t think you’d get away with this interview without me asking you point blank,” Savannah Guthrie, of the “Today” show, said to her on Tuesday. “Are you going to run for President?” Warren replied, “No. I’m not running. And I’m not going to run. I’m in Washington, and I’ve got this great job and a chance to try and make a difference on things that really matter.” That sounded pretty definitive. But just to make sure, Guthrie asked a follow-up: “Are you unequivocally and categorically saying, ‘I’m not running for President in 2016’?” To which Warren replied, “I’m not running. I’m not running.”","April 1, 2015","19","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"

"In the past few weeks, a grassroots campaign to persuade Warren to enter the Democratic primaries had attracted the support of some prominent individuals and institutions. Robert Reich, who served as Labor Secretary in Bill Clinton’s Administration, posted a statement on his Facebook page saying that a tough primary challenge to Clinton would be good for her and for Democrats, adding, “I wish that challenger would be Elizabeth Warren.” The editorial board of the Boston Globe, Warren’s home-town paper, published a lengthy commentary headlined, “Democrats need Elizabeth Warren’s voice in 2016 presidential race.” And two highly regarded progressive activists, Larry Cohen, the president of the Communications Workers of America, and Annie Leonard, the executive director of Greenpeace USA, echoed Reich’s message, coupling it with a statement questioning Clinton’s liberal credentials. “If we end up with a single Democratic candidate—and little to no debate in the primaries,” Cohen and Leonard wrote in an open letter published on the Run Warren Run Web site, “those of us unlikely to support a Republican nominee will be left voting for a Democrat who may be opposed to the Republican agenda but is not necessarily a champion of the vision of change that millions of us seek and that this country needs.”","22","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"With Clinton embroiled in a messy dispute over her decision to delete thousands of e-mails that she sent and received as Secretary of State, and also, apparently, to wipe her private server clean, the effort to draft Warren appeared to be gaining a bit of momentum. But following her statements to Guthrie, where will it go next? Is it done? Apparently not.","23","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"On Wednesday, MoveOn.org, the liberal advocacy group that helped to get the draft-Warren campaign started, was still featuring on its home page a petition calling on the Massachusetts senator to run. And the organization was continuing to plan a conference, to be held in New York next month, that will feature a number of prominent progressives who are calling on Warren to enter the race. In an e-mail to me, Brian Stewart, MoveOn’s media-relations director, played down the “Today” show interview, writing, “Sen. Warren has repeatedly made clear that she doesn’t plan to run—that’s why we’re running a draft campaign. We are calling on her to run because we believe our country will be better off if she does.”","24","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"The speakers at the New York event will include the Harvard law-school professor Lawrence Lessig, who is helping to lead the movement for campaign-finance reform (read my colleague Evan Osnos on the subject here); Zephyr Teachout, the Fordham law professor who challenged Andrew Cuomo in last year’s Democratic gubernatorial primary; and Van Jones, the environmental activist who did a short stint in the Obama White House. In a blog post explaining why he’s participating in the conference, Lessig said that the one thing that could persuade Warren to change her mind about running was “the recognition that her jumping in is necessary to make a difference. The more of us who speak up, the more clear it will be that this is just such a moment. That there’s a difference that only she can make, at a moment in our history when we desperately need that difference.”","25","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"The draft-Warren movement isn’t going away, then. But, with Clinton preparing to make her candidacy an official one, the political context in which the movement is operating is about to change. Warren’s supporters, having failed to lure her into the fray early, will be left to press her to join the race later on, which would surely happen only if Clinton were to stumble badly.","26","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"That prospect won’t please a lot of progressive activists. Warren, however, seems content with it. The “Today” show’s Guthrie, an admirably persistent interviewer, pressed Warren on whether she believed Clinton “could give a credible voice” to the issues she had raised, such as fighting for the middle class. “Well,” Warren said. “I think we need to give her a chance to decide if she’s going to run and to declare—” Guthrie interrupted her and said, “We know she’s going to run.” Warren paused for a moment, then ignored the interruption and continued, “And to lay out what she wants to run on. I think that’s her opportunity to do that.”","27","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"Coming from someone who had just reiterated that she was engaged with her own agenda, which includes reforming the student-loan program, raising the minimum wage, and protecting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she helped to create, from Republican attacks, Warren’s words could be interpreted as a statement of encouragement to a party leader whom she respects and wants to be victorious. On the other hand, they fell far short of an endorsement. And for those willing to attribute Machiavellian motives to Warren, they could even be taken as an indication that she had cannily decided to wait and see if Clinton self-destructs.","28","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"In the world of wishing and waiting for Elizabeth, that may well be the preferred interpretation. Even if it’s the correct one, though, it means that Clinton will get to make her case to the Democratic Party, its most progressive supporters included, with only Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, Jim Webb, the former Virginia Senator, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders as potential rivals who have expressed a serious interest in running. While each of these men has policy expertise and a track record, they are still struggling to be taken seriously as Presidential candidates. Which suggests that, for now, at least, Clinton controls her own destiny.","29","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"In the Times on Wednesday, Bruce Ackerman, a professor of law and political science at Yale, raised what is perhaps the critical question about President Obama’s request for an Authorization for Use of Military Force against the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS or ISIL). If Congress grants Obama this power, will it also rescind the 2001 authorization that the President is currently using to justify the conflict with ISIS?","February 13, 2015","30","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-war-authorization-worth"
"The President, who announced the first air strikes against ISIS in Iraq last August, has said for months he would seek formal authorization for the conflict. On Wednesday, Obama submitted a resolution that would allow for military action against ISIS for the next three years and place some limits on the use of ground troops; despite these restrictions, the resolution would grant Obama wide latitude to prosecute the war against ISIS.","31","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-war-authorization-worth"
"","32","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-war-authorization-worth"
"Obama’s text was carefully crafted to negotiate questions about whether the resolution should restrict ground troops, whether it should include any geographic limitations, and whether and when the authorization should sunset. Judging by the immediate response, the President may find it difficult to put together a coalition to pass any version of it. Congressional doves are deeply suspicious of endorsing an open-ended commitment, and hawks do not want any limitations on the President’s ability to wage war against ISIS.","33","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-war-authorization-worth"
"Speaking for the doves, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an Independent who is considering a campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination, immediately came out against the resolution because, he said, it does not sufficiently restrict the deployment of American troops in Iraq and Syria. “I oppose sending U.S. ground troops into combat in another bloody war in the Middle East,” Sanders said in a statement. “I therefore cannot support the resolution in its current form without clearer limitations on the role of U.S. combat troops.” The hawks have been led by Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, who is also weighing a Presidential run. Rubio didn’t say that he would oppose Obama’s resolution, but he made it clear he wanted a more expansive version. “There is a pretty simple authorization he could ask for, and it would read one sentence,” Rubio said in a speech on the Senate floor on Thursday. “And it would read one sentence. And that is: We authorize the President to defeat and destroy ISIL, period.”","34","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-war-authorization-worth"
"This is certainly an important debate to have, even if it is happening, absurdly, six months after the United States went to war against ISIS. But unless Congress also revisits the authorization of force passed on September 14, 2001, which President Obama has claimed applies to strikes against ISIS, the new debate is all but meaningless.","35","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-war-authorization-worth"
"The 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists passed with overwhelming support: only one member of Congress (Barbara Lee of California) voted against it. From a layman’s perspective, its language is fairly restrictive. The President was authorized “to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.”","36","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-war-authorization-worth"
"President George W. Bush used the resolution to justify military action against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. (He obtained separate authorization for the war in Iraq in 2002.) Obama expanded the war and used the resolution to justify military action against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen. But when the Arab Spring drew the United States into a new set of military interventions in the Middle East, the 2001 resolution’s authority was far less applicable. Obama did not try to use the resolution to justify the war in Libya. (He used a different, though still dubious, argument.) When the President considered striking Syria in 2013, he made no attempt to lean on the 2001 law, and was prepared to seek a new congressional authorization.","37","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-war-authorization-worth"
"But, last September, when Obama and his lawyers sought justification for the war against ISIS, they made a decision that will haunt them in the coming congressional debate. The White House argued that the conflict was not a ground war but, rather, a “counterterrorism campaign,” and as such did not require the authorization of war powers. The White House further argued that a war against ISIS would be justified by the 2001 resolution because ISIS is “affiliated” or “associated” with Al Qaeda—never mind that the two groups are now in conflict with each other and that there is no provision in the resolution covering affiliated or associated groups. At the time, many legal scholars argued that this was a ridiculous reading of the 2001 law, but there was little appetite in Congress to debate the issue during the midterm campaign.","38","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-war-authorization-worth"
"These legalistic contortions now have enormous ramifications. As Ackerman notes, even if Congress passes a new, restrictive resolution against ISIS, a new President could always fall back on the unchallenged Obama position of 2014 and insist that the 2001 resolution is sufficient to justify some further campaign. In other words, Obama and his lawyers have made the 2001 resolution so elastic that, unless it is modified or rescinded, it presents an open invitation for abuse to any future Commander-in-Chief.","39","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-war-authorization-worth"
"This issue does not seem to have sunk in yet with many on the right and the left flanks of Congress, who so far have been focussed on tweaking Obama’s proposal. But, as the debate unfolds over the next month, Obama’s prior use of the 2001 authorization is sure to become a major issue, especially among doves in both parties. Last year, Republican Senator Rand Paul, another likely Presidential contender, who is deeply skeptical about any military engagement, drafted a highly restrictive resolution authorizing force against ISIS which incorporated the repeal of the 2001 authorization. On the left, grassroots groups like Moveon.org, which today came out against Obama’s proposed resolution, are citing the failure to rescind the 2001 resolution as the basis for their current opposition.","40","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-war-authorization-worth"
"In his submission to Congress this week, Obama said that he wants to revisit the 2001 resolution—just not now. But, by using the expansive Bush-era law to justify the war against ISIS last fall, he has left Congress with no choice but to review it within the confines of the current debate. As long as the 2001 resolution is still in effect, none of the limits contained in a new ISIS-specific war resolution will matter.","41","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-war-authorization-worth"

"John Podesta, the veteran Democratic official, is leaving the White House to join Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Presidential campaign, probably as its chairman. The move was hardly unexpected: Podesta is a Clintonite through and through. He served in Bill Clinton’s White House from start to finish, rising through the ranks to become Chief of Staff, a post he held from October, 1998, to January, 2001. For months now, Podesta has been telling people that if Hillary decided to run he would most likely join her.","January 14, 2015","48","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"

"","50","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"Even Podesta’s critics concede that he is an effective and experienced operator. Inside the Clinton Administration, he was known as a hard-working, intense figure with a caustic side. In a Times piece from September, 2000, Robert Pear and John Broder wrote, “Colleagues say, half-jesting, that he has an evil twin named Skippy, who is invoked to bring order to an unruly White House.”","51","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"A couple of years after the Clinton Administration ended, Podesta founded the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank that, in a little more than a decade, has become an important player in the Washington power game, providing detailed analysis and policy recommendations, a forum for conversations and debates, and daily commentary on everything from the job figures to Bill Cosby. (Full disclosure: in 2013, I led a panel discussion at the launch of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, which is housed at the Center for American Progress, and for which Podesta once served as chairman.) In January, 2014, Podesta left the Center for American Progress and joined the Obama Administration as a counselor to the President, focussed largely on environmental issues.","52","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"To the delight of environmental activists, when Podesta arrived back at the White House he championed the tactic of using executive power and the edicts of the Environmental Protection Agency to outflank Republican obstructionists on Capitol Hill. Last summer, the E.P.A. proposed a new rule designed to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants by up to thirty per cent. Other federal agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Emergency Management Administration, have also stepped up their environmental initiatives. “I think he”—Podesta—“has made a tremendous difference,” former Vice-President Al Gore told National Journal’s Ben Geman. “I don’t think it, I know it.”","53","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"Some conservatives regard Podesta as an environmental extremist. From the left, the rap is that he is too close to major corporations and to Wall Street. In the late nineteen-eighties, when Podesta was working on Capitol Hill, he and his brother, Tony Podesta, founded the lobbying firm the Podesta Group, which is now one of the most successful in Washington. John Podesta hasn’t had a role in the firm for many years. But the Center for American Progress has faced accusations that it does favors for its corporate donors, most specifically in a May, 2013, investigative report by Ken Silverstein for The Nation.","54","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"The Center vigorously denies this charge. In a letter to The Nation, it said, “The inference at the heart of the author’s story is that corporate donations shape or drive the content of CAP and CAP Action. That assertion is baseless and completely false.” In December, 2013, the Center released a list of its corporate benefactors, which included Apple, Google, Walmart, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. The Center also pointed out that more than ninety per cent of its annual budget was financed through donations from individuals and philanthropic foundations, and that corporate donations accounted for less than six per cent.","55","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"My take on this flap is that with the Center for American Progress, as with any other think tank (or newspaper or magazine, for that matter), it is well worth keeping an eye on whether the folks who pay the bills are dictating the message. The Center would enhance its credibility—and this also applies to its competitors—if it more often promoted findings and policies that some of its financial backers and its political allies disagreed with.","56","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"That said, there’s quite a bit to recommend the Center’s activities, particularly its research initiatives and its Web site, which includes the lively (and editorially independent) ThinkProgress blog. Podesta’s efforts in founding the institution and getting it up and running filled a gap in the Washington ecosystem. Other liberal-leaning think tanks, such as the Economic Policy Institute and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, have long done sterling work. But, until the arrival of the Center for American Progress, which is now headed up by Neera Tanden, another Clintonite, no left-leaning think tank had the heft, the resources, and the drive of the conservative Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute. (I am leaving out the Brookings Institution, venerable as it is, because it tends to stay above the fray, and also the New America Foundation, which is smaller and more narrowly focussed.)","57","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"Washington now has a big and well-financed progressive think tank that engages with the political debate on a daily basis. That’s a positive development—and not just for Democrats. On the basis of the theory of countervailing power, it’s good for democracy.","58","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"As Podesta sets out for 2016, it remains to be seen whether he will be an effective campaign chairman. Until now, most of his experience has been in administration and policy-making, rather than in political campaigning. But whatever services he provides to Hillary, he has already made a big mark on the political topography of the nation’s capital. And that, I’d wager, will be his longest-lasting legacy.","59","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"

Even Peter Schjeldahl, who raves this week about the museum as a whole, describes “a lurching aggregate of shapes in striated steel cladding and glass. … so confusing that, pretty soon, I gave up looking.” Piano, who has designed twenty-three other museums, might take solace in a stanza from Robert Frost’s poem about Christopher Columbus, the first line of which lends the inaugural exhibition its name: “America is hard to see. / Less partial witnesses than he / In book on book have testified / They could not see it from outside.”","April 24, 2015","60","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/art-click-the-new-whitney"
"Once inside the new Whitney, visitors will encounter its first-ever theatre, a hundred-and-seventy-seat space with convertible seating, and programming overseen by the museum’s performance curator (another “first ever”), Jay Sanders, who was a divining rod for talent on the downtown underground scene for years before the Whitney tapped him to join their team. (Regulars at the museum’s uptown Breuer building may recall the 2013 exhibition he organized, devoted to SoHo’s loft performances of the nineteen-seventies.) To whet your appetite, here’s a short video of Sanders discussing the museum’s legacy working with performers, which stretches back to the sixties and includes such major figures as Trisha Brown, Bruce Nauman, and Cecil Taylor. But it’s worth noting that Sanders isn’t all performance, all the time: he’s also organizing the museum’s 2016 exhibition by the filmmaker Laura Poitras.","61","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/art-click-the-new-whitney"

"“So many of the exonerees I met were offered various kinds of plea bargains or deals that they didn’t take because they just were not able to bring themselves to admit to a crime that they didn’t commit,” the New Yorker staff writer Ariel Levy says on this week’s Political Scene podcast. Levy joins her fellow staff writer Jennifer Gonnerman and the host Dorothy Wickenden to talk about wrongful imprisonment and prison abuse in the United States. They discuss New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s plan to prevent people from being held for years without trial, the top-down culture of violence in correctional facilities, and the difference between how the criminal-justice system is supposed to work and how it works in practice. “There is a central tension in the job of a prosecutor,” Gonnerman says. “Some people would say it is their job to seek justice for the victim, and some people would say the job is to get convictions and hit some sort of unofficial quota. That central tension is what you see at play in these cases.”","87","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-political-scene-wrongful-imprisonment"

They discuss the problematic symbolism of a Bush-Clinton race, Obamacare’s impact, and the political appeal, for conservatives, of inequality. “There’s a lot of racial politics behind the Republicans’ newfound fascination with economic inequality.

"This morning, the Times proclaimed a “crushing victory” for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over Zionist Union challengers Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, in yesterday’s election. But crushing victories don’t usually look like this one. In the last national election, in 2013, the five parties that make up Netanyahu’s hard-right “national camp” won sixty-one of the hundred and twenty seats in the Knesset. Yesterday, it won fifty-seven. It’s true that Netanyahu’s Likud surged to thirty seats, nine more than projected by last Friday’s final poll—the Zionist Union, by contrast, was expected to get twenty-four, and finished with exactly that—but Netanyahu’s gain was not really at Herzog and Livni’s expense.","March 18, 2015","119","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahus-compromised-victory"

"What happened, as the Times of Israel ’s editor, David Horovitz, points out, was that Netanyahu “desperately cannibalized” the most strident right-wing parties in his camp, especially Naftali Bennett’s Jewish Home party. In the final days of the campaign, Netanyahu repudiated the two-state principle, promised Bennett a prominent place in his government, and appealed to Bennett’s supporters to vote this time for his own Likud party. He insisted, plausibly, that the national camp as a whole could be forced out of power if the Zionist Union, not the Likud, won a plurality of seats and was granted the mandate, by President Reuven Rivlin, to try to form a majority government. Rightist voters, it turns out, obliged Netanyahu in droves. Bennett was polling at thirteen seats last Friday and finished with eight. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who had ten or more in previous elections, ended with six.","121","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahus-compromised-victory"
"Two new centrist parties, Moshe Kahlon’s Kulanu and Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid, finished, as predicted by the polls, with ten and eleven seats, respectively. These results confirm the steady drift of younger Likud voters toward centrists like Kahlon (who served as a government minister under Netanyahu); as I wrote on Monday, Netanyahu cannot reach a majority without him. Yesterday, it seemed possible that, if Herzog and Livni had a plurality of seats, Kahlon would side with them. His senior partners, General Yoav Galant and the former Ambassador Michael Oren, are not sympathetic to Bennett’s settlers, embraced the two-state formula in their platform, and focussed mainly on economic inequality. But Netanyahu’s strong plurality almost certainly precludes Kahlon’s feeling emboldened to make a majority for the Zionist Union. That majority would have included the Arab Joint List, which would not have been an easy partnership for Kahlon, given his history with Likud.","122","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahus-compromised-victory"
"The vote has fallen in favor of Netanyahu, but the country remains divided, even with centrist parties aiming to create a consensus around economic equality, social liberalism, and diplomatic skepticism. In greater Tel Aviv, Herzog’s center-left (without Kahlon) garnered about sixty-three per cent of the vote. In greater Jerusalem, Likud’s national camp (again, without Kahlon), got about eighty per cent. Today, at the Western Wall, Netanyahu told the press, “I deeply value the decision by Israeli civilians to choose me and my colleagues, against all the odds and against major forces,” suggesting the solidarity he wants and the enemies he needs. He does not yet have Rivlin’s mandate, but he pledged to form a government “within two to three weeks.” We shall see if Kahlon and his partners—who promised voters economic reforms and transparency, but, in a coalition with Likud, would first have to agree to sweeten pots for settlements and yeshivas—will oblige Netanyahu’s timetable. Kahlon may not have the conviction to make a majority for Herzog, but he might summon the rage to deny one to Netanyahu. Anyway, he has the power to force surprises on the coming coalition negotiations—and he just might.","123","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahus-compromised-victory"

"As the curtain rises on Paul Taylor’s 1985 piece “Last Look”—it will be part of his company’s current season at the Koch Theatre—you see, under a low, grimy light, a big pile of God knows what in the middle of the stage. It starts to move. It is a pile of human beings. Slowly, they crawl apart. One man stands out from the others. He rises; he falls; he rises and falls again and again, flinging his arms and legs so violently that he seems to be trying to cast them off his body. The dancer here is Robert Kleinendorst. Much of Taylor’s best work depends on the performers looking human and inhuman at the same time, and no one in the company looks more human than Kleinendorst, down to the corny sideburns that he says the troupe’s set and costume designer Santo Loquasto is always trying to get him to shave off. (“I can’t. I’ve had them so long I can’t imagine being without them.”) He is therefore perfect as the initial display item in “Last Look.” If a man like this could suffer such a fate, none of us are safe.","147","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/divine-comedy"
"When Kleinendorst went to college—Luther College in Decorah, Iowa—he intended to make his living in musical theatre, so he majored in vocal performance and took acting classes as well. After a while, it occurred to him that, in order to get a job in a musical, he would probably have to be able to dance, too, so he added dance classes. Of course, he then grew up to be a dancer, but Paul Taylor makes extensive use of his dramatic training. He often gets character roles, especially comic ones. (He does an excellent pimp, with a big, brown, disgusting cigar, in “Black Tuesday.”) But the thing that Taylor seems to ask of him most often is an unforced sort of poignance—cousin, in a strange way, to the comedy. In the heart-stabbing “Sunset,” the passage most likely to deprive you of your composure is a duet for Kleinendorst and Michael Trusnovec, as two soldiers going to the front. The men do little reaches and kicks and leaps, often side by side or follow-the-leader. Trusnovec seems to be teaching Kleinendorst something. “He’s a mentor,” Kleinendorst says. “This whole dance is about finding comfort wherever you can before you go off and maybe die. It is this very intimate thing that you can’t express.” They express it.","148","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/divine-comedy"
"After Trusnovec, Kleinendorst is the company’s most senior dancer. He is forty-one, with a wife (the former Taylor dancer Amy Young) and a child. About half his time is spent on the road, touring. After seventeen years of doing Taylor’s bone-crunching work, he wakes up three to four times a night because of pain. “I can’t dance that much longer,” he says, almost with bewilderment. Go see him now. ♦","149","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/divine-comedy"
"During his sixth State of the Union address, President Obama is expected to focus on “middle-class economics,” as his adviser Dan Pfeiffer put it on “Meet the Press.” The President will reportedly highlight a proposal to cut taxes for the middle class, raise capital-gains taxes for high earners, and close tax loopholes that largely benefit the wealthy. In his preview of the State of the Union, John Cassidy argues that Obama’s plan is both sound economics and sound politics.

"The director William Greaves, in a 1992 interview, explained the title of his 1968 film as “a take-off on ‘symbiotaxiplasm,’ a concept developed by philosopher/social-scientist Arthur Bentley,” which “referred to all those events that transpire in any given environment on which a human being impacts in any way.” Greaves conceived of a movie as everything that takes place surrounding the fictional drama. He saw that drama as inseparable from the behavior of the actors while acting and not acting, the behavior of the crew while filming and not filming, and, in the case of location shooting, whatever else might be happening in the vicinity of the cameras. Greaves’s apparent renunciation of directorial authority became, in a peculiar way, an extension of that authority beyond the confines of the scripted action. In 1968, Greaves saw filmmaking as a wider social activity and therefore a political act. Without a word about the specifically political turmoil of the time, Greaves (who died last August, at the age of eighty-seven) made the intimate sexual drama of an unhappily married couple a vision of audacious progressive transformations. His original idea was to develop the footage into five “Takes.” The non-release of the first film put an end to that plan (though in 2005 he completed “Take Two and a Half”). Had Greaves’s plan been realized, or “Take One” released in its own time, the vast scope of his ambitions would have been clear.","March 11, 2015","179","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-of-the-week-symbiopsychotaxiplasm-take-one"

"In the midterm elections last year, the G.O.P. picked up nine seats, to move to a fifty-four to forty-six majority; for the first time in Barack Obama’s Presidency, Democrats had lost control of both houses of Congress. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, not only won his own reëlection but assumed the role of Majority Leader, which he had long sought. McConnell is the perfect Senate leader for the modern Republican Party. Though he began his political life as a moderate, he has evolved into a fierce conservative warrior, dedicated to obstructing the President’s agenda in every possible way. Thanks in significant part to McConnell’s maneuvers, the use of the filibuster has become so pervasive that it’s now assumed that sixty votes are required for any Senate action.","201","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"

"In his most brazen act so far, McConnell has prevented a confirmation vote for Loretta Lynch, the President’s choice for Attorney General, even though a majority of Senators have indicated publicly that they will vote for her. It is almost unheard of for a nominee for a major cabinet position like Attorney General to be kept waiting for so long. Especially when her confirmation is assured, this kind of manipulation of Senate processes signals McConnell’s determination to humiliate the President and his nominees seemingly just because he can.","203","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"

The nature of our political parties explains more.","204","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"
"As a matter of principle, Republicans believe in a government of limited powers—one that governs best by governing least. Democrats are activists by inclination and by ideology, which means that they are always trying to do more, not less.

"In the last days of his tenure as Majority Leader of the Democrats, Harry Reid grew so frustrated with Republican obstruction that he changed the Senate rules, doing away with filibusters on lower-court judicial and Administration appointees, like cabinet members. This destroyed what little was left of the once-famous comity of the Senate, where the right to filibuster (for better or worse) has usually been regarded with reverence. Still, Reid’s move was enormously effective, too. President Obama owes his stamp on the federal judiciary to Reid’s aggressive use of his own power.","206","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"
"McConnell has been as fierce in his desire to stop things from happening as Reid was to accomplish them. Since McConnell took over, just after the first of the year, the Senate has been bogged down in a futile effort to defund the Department of Homeland Security (in protest of Obama’s actions on immigration), to fund the Keystone XL pipeline (which Obama was always going to veto), and to pass an anti-human-trafficking bill (which has become derailed by a fight over abortion). In more than three months, the Senate has approved just a single judicial nominee, a district judge from Texas.","207","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"
"As Alec MacGillis notes in his recent e-book biography of McConnell, the new Majority Leader is, above all, a tactician, always thinking about the next vote, the next chance to force his adversaries into a difficult political predicament. But that’s the limit of McConnell’s political imagination. His broader agenda consists entirely of afflicting Democrats rather than passing legislation.","208","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"
"But McConnell’s cramped vision is well suited to his current post. In one way, this has worked to Obama’s advantage. McConnell, like most Republicans, has been intensely critical of the Administration’s preliminary accord with Iran. But McConnell and his Republican colleagues are also reluctant to take responsibility for killing the deal altogether. Despite all of their complaints about the deal, their actual legislation on the subject, in the end, looks as though it will not really limit the President’s authority at all. Indeed, the proposal turned out to be so anodyne that Obama indicated on Tuesday that he would sign it.","209","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"
"Still, the retreat on Iran notwithstanding, there can be little doubt that McConnell will extend himself to obstruct what’s left of the President’s agenda. Judicial confirmations, which remain the exclusive province of the Senate, will continue at their slow pace, especially for appellate-court nominees. Major fights loom about the budget and the debt ceiling. McConnell will keep the government open—barely. By the soft bigotry of our lowered expectations about what was once known as the world’s greatest deliberative body, that will count as success.","210","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"
"Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, wants to inject more discipline into his party’s 2016 Presidential primaries, and while it’s easy to empathize, there are also reasons to regard that prospect with something like dread. Priebus’s memories of 2012, when the competition was intense and curiously entertaining, are by his own admission a little nightmarish. As he told the Washington Post’s Dan Balz and Philip Rucker, the Republican debates, in particular, were “an embarrassment and ridiculous.”","January 21, 2015","211","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"
"This time, the Party is aiming to keep things under control by limiting the number of debates to nine and exercising ideological caution in its choice of interlocutors; MSNBC, which has a reputation for left-leaning partisanship, will not be invited to host a debate. “It means that there’s even a greater responsibility on the national party to contain a process that could get out of control,” Priebus said, with artful understatement.","212","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"
"Why then should there be a feeling of angst? It may be because, despite Priebus’s brave hope to “contain” the process, the perpetual-political-motion machine—the Iowa caucuses, the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, the attempts to “front load” early voting—will run with or without much direction from a legacy political party. The idea that the major parties should have a role as gatekeepers, as a shield against the excesses and illusions of pure democracy, seems almost quaint when the largest field ever may be at the starting gate. By some estimates, as many as twenty-five men and women, few with the benefit of any popular support, are giving the race for the Republican nomination serious thought.","213","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"
"In the early nineteen-nineties, Alan Ehrenhalt, the former editor of Governing magazine, described a phenomenon that was already becoming obvious: candidates for public office were bypassing party machinery and simply nominating themselves—self-selected lone wolves who attracted loyal freelancers who were willing to work for a cause and raise a lot of money. Sometimes, they prevailed. In “The United States of Ambition: Politicians, Power, and the Pursuit of Office,” Ehrenhalt focussed on state and local races, but his argument encompassed national candidates, too, and as a general rule it could describe many people in politics who have ambition, a lot of free time, communication skills, a personal fortune or wealthy backers, and no obvious qualifications (either by training or experience) to deal with the real world beyond America’s borders.","214","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"
"Because the first Republican debate is in August, seven months from now, the Party has time to work out the delicate question of who to take seriously. August also happens to be the month of the notoriously meaningless Ames, Iowa, straw poll, which in 2011 was portrayed as a dramatic turning point by the victor, Representative Michele Bachmann, who said afterward, “What we saw happen today is the very first step toward taking the White House in 2012, and you have just sent a message that Barack Obama will be a one-term president.” The Ames poll probably prompted former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, who finished third, to make a premature exit from the race. But then, anyone who gets frightened off by a summer straw poll should never compete in Presidential politics.","215","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"
"Earlier that summer, a marketing expert named Mark McNeilly wrote about the art and science of “positioning,” the next stage in the Presidential-election cycle. In the commercial world, positioning means showing why the attributes of Tide have a broader appeal than the promises of Wisk. In politics, potential candidates employ gamesmanship and salesmanship to claim narrow territory on issues where a single misstep can be your undoing—they try to find a safe position without actually saying too much.","216","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"
"Indeed, only minuscule differences are visible in the positions of three potential candidates who’ve addressed immigration (none dare speak of “amnesty”): Jeb Bush, who co-wrote a book called “Immigration Wars” with the Goldwater Institute’s Clint Bolick, argues for a narrow path to “legalization” (not citizenship) while encouraging the influx of highly skilled workers. Rick Perry’s main theme, since he ran for President in 2012, has been making the borders less porous, but he’s also made an effort to protect his position with Latino voters. In a Q&A with the Wall Street Journal the other day, he said, “Americans want to have a thoughtful process in place, following the rule of law to allow people to immigrate to this country . . . in a legal way”—a position with which it’s hard to take issue. Marco Rubio, who has modified if not changed his position, now emphasizes the borders, too. Rubio may emerge as the grandmaster of positioning in general; not long ago, he spoke to CBS and said, “The future is now. It’s here. It has arrived. And we need new ideas and new thinking, and quite frankly a new generation of leadership.”","217","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"

"When Barack Obama took office, in 2009, he had a long agenda—mending a collapsing economy, transforming health care, and ending two wars, to name just the top items. Nominating judges to the federal judiciary was low on the list. The President filled two quick vacancies on the Supreme Court with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. As for the dozens of vacancies on the federal circuit and district courts, Obama’s attention was fleeting. He didn’t even submit nominees to fill many judicial vacancies, including on the D.C. Circuit, which is generally regarded as the second most important court in the country. (I interviewed Reid and the President about their impact on the federal judiciary last year.)","221","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-harry-reid-changed-the-federal-courts"

"When Republicans took control of the House of Representatives after the 2010 elections, the President’s chances for pushing through meaningful legislation vanished. But the Senate, which is responsible for confirming judges, remained in Democratic hands—and in 2013, Reid took charge of the issue. The Senate had confirmed only five Obama appointees to the federal appeals court in the election year of 2012, but Reid moved to double the pace in 2013. Republicans responded by filibustering almost every judicial appointment to the appeals court and slow-walking appointments to the district court, which had been routine and uncontroversial under earlier Presidents. Reid fought back, and kept pushing the President’s nominees. In time, though, Reid came to a crossroads.","223","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-harry-reid-changed-the-federal-courts"
"Reid had fifty-five Democrats in the Senate—enough for a majority but not enough to beat back Republican filibusters. So, in December, 2013, Reid invoked what became known as the nuclear option. With Reid’s blessing, Senate Democrats changed the rules so that only a majority would be required to move lower-court judgeships to a vote. Freed from the threat of filibusters, Reid pushed through thirteen appeals-court judges in 2013 and 2014, a group of exceptional quality. They included Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard, and Robert Wilkins on the D.C. Circuit. For the first time in decades, that court now has a majority of Democratic appointees. Other confirmations included such luminaries as Pamela Harris (a noted professor and advocate) on the Fourth Circuit, Jill Pryor on the Eleventh, and David Barron (a Harvard law professor and Obama Administration lawyer) on the First. None received more than sixty votes, meaning that they would not have been confirmed had Reid not changed the rules. In future decades, many of these judges will be candidates for promotion if a Democratic President has a Supreme Court vacancy to fill. At the same time, Reid pushed through more than a hundred district-court judges in his last two years as Majority Leader. Of course, almost all of these judges will serve long after Barack Obama and Harry Reid have left office.","224","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-harry-reid-changed-the-federal-courts"
"Through the Reagan and two Bush Presidencies, Republicans worked hard to put a conservative stamp on the federal judiciary. Under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the subject never received the same attention. But Reid saw the importance of federal judges—which is especially apparent now, as the fate of the Affordable Care Act and the President’s immigration initiatives come before the courts. Congress is famous now mostly for its dysfunction, but as Reid has shown the Senate can be made to work. With focus, passion, and relentless attention to the goal before him, he remade the federal judiciary. This living monument to the Democratic leader will stand long after he retires next year.","225","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-harry-reid-changed-the-federal-courts"
"It’s always a pleasure to listen as musical artists renew their faith in their craft, not only in the doing but also in the appreciation they express toward those artists who inspire them. The protean, game-changing lyricist and composer Stephen Sondheim has said that since he began listening to the legendary minimalist composer Steve Reich, many decades ago now, he has felt constantly energized, moved, and surprised by his near-contemporary. (Born in 1930, Sondheim is Reich’s senior by six years.) On Jan. 31, as part of Lincoln Center’s “American Songbook” series, the two masters will hold a conversation (conceived and co-produced by David Brendel), with musical interludes by the longtime Sondheim conductor Paul Gemignani, the performers Kate Baldwin and Michael Cerveris, and Ensemble Signal, among others.","226","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drama-king"
"When I talked with Sondheim recently, he told me that it was difficult to describe what it was about Reich that moved him so, especially since the two composers work and thrive in such different worlds. “You can’t be an architect of your admiration. It just is,” Sondheim said. “But what I can say is that his work has great rhythmic verve and what we people in the show business call vamps. Then there’s his imagination.” He described Reich’s inspiring use of the human voice. “I think the first thing I heard—on CD, not in a concert hall—was ‘Come Out.’ ” That short, intense 1966 work was created at a politically charged time; the looped voice is that of a young black man who was beaten during the 1964 Harlem riots. Sondheim said that what interested him in that piece was Reich’s phasing technique and his use of speech as music. “When I try to write a song, I try to write the way we speak, and the musicality of conversation is always something I’m intrigued by. In Reich, it’s the rhythmic vitality and the relationship between speech and music that gets me.” He went on: “There’s a great sense of drama in Reich’s work, even the smaller pieces. When you hear ‘Different Trains’ ”—Reich’s 1988 study of family and Jewishness—“you know it’s a great dramatic piece because it is.”","227","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drama-king"
"“Plus, do you know who his mother is?” Sondheim said, after a pause. “You could hear the table break when my jaw dropped after I learned Reich’s mother was June Carroll”—who co-wrote Broadway tunes such as “Monotonous,” which helped make Eartha Kitt a star. “So here you have two people in one family writing songs—I shouldn’t say songs—music that has this conversational quality. I have a blanket admiration for Reich, and I never heard a piece of his that bored me. The people who dig him just look forward to listening. You never know what’s next.” ♦","228","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drama-king"

"When Claude Debussy published his maritime masterpiece, “La Mer,” in 1905, he placed on the score’s cover a stylized detail from “Under the Wave off Kanagawa,” Katsushika Hokusai’s woodblock print of apocalyptic waves towering over Mt. Fuji. Debussy’s veneration of Japanese art helped initiate an intricate, evolving conversation between Western-style classical composition and Japanese culture. The conversation began in earnest when Japanese composers came into their own after the Second World War; the results of the interaction can be heard in this year’s “Focus!” festival at Juilliard, titled “Nippon Gendai Ongaku: Japanese Music Since 1945.” Appropriately, the final program, an orchestral concert on Jan. 30, begins with Debussy and ends with his most faithful twentieth-century follower, Toru Takemitsu.","231","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/sound-silence-2"
"“Music is either sound or silence,” Takemitsu once said, expanding on insights from John Cage, who was also smitten with Japanese culture. A sense of music poised on the edge of stillness marks many of Takemitsu’s works, including “Far Calls. Coming, Far!” and “Twill by Twilight,” both of which will be performed on Jan. 30. Fragrant, ambiguous chords materialize and then drift away in a gently heaving motion that the composer called a “sea of tonality.” It is tempting to relate the effect to the balance of figure and space in Hokusai’s prints, but Takemitsu, who died in 1996, was too sophisticated and cosmopolitan an artist to be limited to a stereotypical Japanese aesthetic. His enveloping textures are mists in which one can easily become lost, in a way both pleasant and eerie; they have the unnerving potency of dreams.","232","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/sound-silence-2"
"Much modern Japanese music veers in a different direction, toward bustle, noise, and neon glare. Misato Mochizuki’s “La Chambre Claire,” programmed on the opening night of “Focus!,” is urban in mood, and its restless, self-replicating rhythms recall Roland Barthes’s ideas about the art of photography. Mochizuki describes the work as a “cry in the midst of silence,” but it is quite distinct from Takemitsu’s deep breaths amid stillness. Still, Mochizuki and the other contemporary Japanese composers featured in the festival would probably endorse Takemitsu’s mission statement: “To replace the great shattered mirror of Western music, to include the reflections of other mirrors—that is our task today.” ♦","233","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/sound-silence-2"

"The Obama Administration has just released its budget for the 2016 fiscal year, which begins on October 1st. I’ll write in a later post about the economics underlying the proposals. In the meantime, based on a reading of the budget documents and a fact sheet posted on the White House Web site, here are some initial takeaways:","February 2, 2015","243","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"1. With the Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress, the budget is as much a political document as an economic one. The chances that it will be enacted in anything like its current form are nil. Instead, the White House is using it to frame the political debate for this year and for the run-up to the 2016 Presidential election—an effort that began with the State of the Union address. The budget fleshes out the populist political agenda that President Obama laid out in that speech.","244","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"","245","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"2. The Administration is proposing a series of tax cuts and spending programs aimed at working families, which would be largely paid for by raising taxes on the rich. This agenda is being marketed, as it was in the State of the Union, under the banner of “middle-class economics.” “The ideas I offer in this budget are designed to bring middle-class economics into the twenty-first century,” President Obama said in a statement. “They’ll help working families feel more secure with paychecks that go further, help American workers upgrade their skills so they can compete for higher-paying jobs, and help create the conditions for our businesses to keep generating good new jobs for our workers to fill.”","246","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"3. In adopting an economic agenda that is explicitly redistributive, the White House is seeking to tackle the glaring problems of wage stagnation and rising inequality, while also daring Republicans to oppose some measures that are likely to be popular. These measures include a new five-hundred-dollar tax credit for second earners, an expansion of the earned-income tax credit, and an increase in the value of existing tax credits available to families paying for child care. In addition, the budget would increase funding for Head Start, Pell Grants, and Obama’s initiative to provide universal preschool, which he unveiled last year.","247","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"4. The budget still includes the President’s plan to provide free tuition for two years of community college for all students who graduate from high school with decent grades. Under the original plan, his initiative would have been paid for by eliminating some of the tax benefits attached to college savings accounts, known as 529s, the benefits of which are largely enjoyed by affluent families. But, after objections from Republicans and Democrats, the White House dropped this proposal. Now the money for the community-college plan will come from general tax revenues.","248","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"5. As indicated by No. 4, the White House’s definition of “middle class” is a bit hazy. The extra funds allotted to the earned-income tax credit, Head Start, community college, and Pell Grants would all be directed at households in the bottom half of the income distribution in the U.S. But it looks like all families, regardless of income, would be eligible for the second-earner tax credit, while families who earn up to a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year would be eligible for the tax credits tied to child care. If your family earns a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year, you are firmly in the top twenty per cent of the income distribution—it’s hard to describe that as middle class. Still, according to a detailed analysis by the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, by far the biggest beneficiaries from Obama’s proposals would be the working poor.","249","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"6. The budget contains three significant tax increases, all of which Obama mentioned in his State of the Union address. The first would raise the estate-tax bills that very wealthy families face, and would do so by eliminating the so-called stepped-up basis for valuing investments in the federal tax code. The budget would also raise the capital-gains tax rate paid by high earners from twenty per cent to twenty-eight per cent. In addition, the Administration would levy a new surcharge on big, highly leveraged financial firms, reflecting the risks they present to the rest of the economy.","250","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"7. Considered on their own merits, many of these policy proposals are well targeted and worthwhile. But nobody should pretend that they would make a big dent in inequality and wage stagnation. For the broad middle class—households situated between the twentieth percentile and the eightieth percentile of the income distribution—the measures, taken together, would raise after-tax incomes by just 0.1 per cent, or even less, according to the Tax Policy Center. (Households in the bottom quintile would see their after-tax incomes rise by one per cent. Households in the top quintile would see their after-tax incomes fall by 0.7 per cent.)","251","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"8. The budget would abolish the sequester and raise domestic spending by about seven per cent in 2016, with the increase evenly split between defense and non-defense programs. The White House says that this increase in spending would be paid for by cuts to other programs, such as agricultural subsidies, and by the elimination of the “carried interest” deduction for hedge funds and private equity firms. These are also good ideas. It barely needs saying that there is no prospect of Congress going along with them.","252","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"9. The White House is also proposing a one-off levy of fifteen per cent on corporate profits held overseas, the proceeds of which would be used to finance investments in road, airports, and other infrastructure projects. After years of neglect, the country’s infrastructure sorely needs upgrading. But this proposal is really just part of an opening bid in a larger debate about how to reform the corporate tax. Since this debate could lead to big corporations seeing their tax rates reduced from thirty-five per cent to twenty-eight per cent, or even less, this is one area where the Republicans may well be willing to coöperate with the Obama Administration.","253","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"10. Rather than seeking to balance the books within ten years, which is what Paul Ryan always claims (with very little plausibility) that his budget proposals would do, the White House is aiming to stabilize the deficit at about 2.5 per cent of G.D.P. That’s not far from where it is now. Later on, I’ll address the economics of all this. From a political perspective, the White House’s budget projections are all of a piece with its over-all strategy. For years, Washington has been fixated on eliminating the budget deficit entirely. The Administration is betting that the American public, in its eagerness to see the fruits of the economic recovery more widely shared, is now willing to tolerate a modest deficit for the indefinite future.","254","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"If you’ve been following recent political news, you’ve probably seen stories about senior Republicans acknowledging that it’s time, finally, for the Party to confront the issues of rising inequality and income stagnation. Speaking in Detroit last month, Jeb Bush said, “Far too many Americans live on the edge of economic ruin, and many more feel like they’re stuck in place, working longer and harder, even as they’re losing ground.” According to numerous reports, Bush is now working toward an economic plan, in anticipation of his expected run for the G.O.P. Presidential nomination, that would tackle some of these issues.","March 26, 2015","255","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"

"In certain Republican quarters, there is even talk of the Party downplaying its commitment to trickle-down economics: the old mantra of cutting taxes, primarily on the rich. “Bush and any other Republican running needs to do a better job … of talking about economic issues in a very different way than Republicans have in the past,” Tony Fratto, a deputy press secretary in George W. Bush’s Administration, told Politico’s Ben White. “If you go to Americans and ask them what their greatest fears are, they won’t say it’s that their taxes are too high. They will talk about things like technology removing the need for hands-on workers and their children not receiving the skills and education to allow them to compete in the global economy.”","257","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"A few Republicans have put forth some actual proposals to address inequality, such as Senator Marco Rubio’s idea to convert the earned-income tax credit, one of the few redistributive programs that enjoys bipartisan support, into a universal subsidy for low-wage workers. One of the shortcomings of the earned-income credit is that it is targeted to low-income families; low-paid workers who don’t have children receive much smaller credits. Rubio’s reform could conceivably address this problem. But still, whenever I hear talk that the Republicans intend to tackle inequality, I can’t help thinking of Deep Throat’s adage: follow the money.","258","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"As E. J. Dionne, Jr., has pointed out, in the journal Democracy, Rubio’s wage-subsidy proposal would be far more interesting if the senator would explain how he would pay for it without hurting the current beneficiaries of the earned-income tax credit. More broadly, it is difficult to take seriously the idea that the Republican Party is changing its ways when its elected officials are simultaneously seeking to bestow more tax cuts on the richest of the rich and slash programs aimed at the poor and the middle class.","259","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"On Wednesday, the G.O.P.-dominated House Ways and Means Committee voted to repeal the federal estate tax, which Republicans have, for years, been labelling a “death tax” that ravages the bequests of ordinary Americans. “This tax doesn’t just hit the big guy,” the committee’s chairman, Paul Ryan, said. “It hits the little guy—like the small business and the family farm.”","260","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"The facts? Since George W. Bush entered office, in 2001, the estate tax has already been reformed several times, and it now applies only to inheritances valued at more than $5.4 million. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, in 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, about 0.2 per cent of estates—that’s two in a thousand, or fewer than four thousand estates in total—owed the estate tax. As Congressman Jim McDermott, a Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee, pointed out, “You cannot call twenty-three-thousand acres a family farm.” A repeal of the estate tax, he said, would amount to a “massive unfunded tax break” for the very wealthiest people in the country. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the move will raise the budget deficit by about two hundred and seventy billion dollars over the next ten years.","261","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"On the same day that this attempted exercise in upward income redistribution was going on in Ryan’s committee, just down the hall, in the main chamber of the House, Republican representatives were approving a new budget that, according to its primary sponsor, Tom Price, the chairman of the Budget Committee, would balance the budget within ten years, primarily by cutting expenditures by nearly $5.5 trillion, as compared with the projected costs of current policies. Who would be most hurt by those spending reductions? You guessed it.","262","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"An analysis by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that more than two-thirds of the proposed spending cuts would come from programs that serve low-income and middle-income Americans. Almost three trillion dollars (yes, trillion) would be saved by repealing Obamacare, which provides income-based subsidies for the purchase of private insurance plans, and by slashing funding for Medicaid, the federal health-care system for the poor, which would be converted to a block-grant program and handed over to the states. The Price budget would also cut spending on food stamps by more than a third between 2021 and 2025. It would allow some existing tax credits for low-income and middle-income families to expire over the next few years. And it would significantly reduce funding for Pell Grants, which help students from families of modest means to afford college.","263","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"In one sense, of course, none of this congressional maneuvering matters. As long as a Democrat occupies the White House, there’s practically no chance that G.O.P. spending cuts will be enacted, marking the Price budget as more of a political wish list than an actual funding bill. But wish lists matter, too, especially for a Party that is supposedly trying to change its public image. And in 2015, it seems, the most that the Republicans can hope for is to shower more gifts on the wealthiest households in America, while depriving poor families of health care, food stamps, and college tuition.","264","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"Nearly eight years ago, Democrats held their first televised Presidential debate of the 2008 campaign, marking the debut of a cast of characters that ranged from the plausible to the preposterous. For two hours, the candidates, some of them now remembered only by those with an unhealthy attachment to politics, went at it as the moderator, NBC’s Brian Williams, made game attempts to nudge them into saying something interesting. The most incautious remarks came from former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel and former Representative Dennis Kucinich, both of whom had nothing to lose and knew it. When Williams asked for reactions to Senator Harry Reid’s remark that “the war in Iraq is lost,” Gravel replied, “Well, first off, understand that this war was lost the day that George Bush invaded Iraq on a fraudulent basis.” Kucinich talked about impeaching Dick Cheney. The leading competitors were simply careful. Senator Joe Biden said, “Look, Brian, this is not a game show. You know, this is not a football game. This is not win or lose.

We have given the Iraqi people the chance to have freedom, to have their own country.” Senator Barack Obama said, “Well, Brian, I am proud that I opposed this war from the start, because I thought that it would lead to the some—the disastrous conditions that we’ve seen on the ground in Iraq.”","April 3, 2015","265","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"

"The other debate participants included the former Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd, the former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, and the former senator and Vice-Presidential candidate John Edwards. They have faded from the scene, in Edwards’s case not in a good way. Yet most of the topics—gay marriage, climate change, immigration reform, and Iraq—are still with us. Hillary Clinton is still being asked to defend her 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq-war resolution, and still sounds much as she did when she said, “Well, Brian, I take responsibility for my vote. … It was a sincere vote based on the information available to me. And I’ve said many times that if I knew then what I now know, I would not have voted that way.” At the same time, Clinton brought real conviction and knowledge to discussions of universal health care, a central issue in 2008 that is still with us.

But it’s a race that’s bound to become ever more compelling, possibly with more candidates (Ben Carson? Carly Fiorina?), and the contenders will be sharpened in the process.

Even her e-mail problems, which polls at first suggested could be shrugged off, aren’t going away. It didn’t help when her lawyer, David Kendall, in response to a subpoena from a congressional committee looking into the 2012 attack on the American Embassy in Benghazi, told the Times, “There are no hdr22@clintonemail.com emails from Secretary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate or legally authorized.” That her personal e-mail server has been wiped clean of any records from her years at the State Department erases the chance of anyone ever making an independent study of their contents and is bound to encourage the suspicion that there was something worth hiding. The investigation community is like a perpetual scandal-seeking machine, quick to seize on any hint of inconsistency, and both Clintons, understandably, are weary of being pursued by those who don’t wish them well. But the public may be getting weary of seeing the words “Clinton” and “lawyers” juxtaposed yet again with any sort of frequency, which could explain her slippage in the polls in three battleground states.","269","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"

The former Virginia Senator James Webb, who began exploring a run last November, is still hinting that he intends to run. But when you look for signs of the Webb campaign, which promised a fresh view of income inequality, military commitments abroad, and the terrible waste of lives—mainly black lives—caused by mass incarceration, what you’re likely to find is the status of the James Webb space telescope, which will replace the Hubble. (That Webb ran NASA in the years of the Apollo program.) Clinton, meanwhile, has not exactly announced her intentions, but her campaign, without coyness, has reportedly leased two floors of office space in Brooklyn Heights, and that, as Politico notes, may be regarded by the Federal Election Commission as the beginning of a campaign.","270","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"

But, according to Gillette, Tananbaum, who was given a spot on Burning Man’s board last year, is there because the founders need the resources of people like him as the festival continues to grow. “He’s not an interloper; he’s a strategic hire,” Gillette writes, and “a reminder of what happens when a local, indie brand tries to go global.”","February 15, 2015","279","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/weekend-reading-burning-man-work-songs"

"At Oxford American, Nathan Salsburg writes about a Texas criminal’s role in preserving the African-American work-song tradition. By the nineteen-sixties, the songs had found their way into Southern prison farms, where black inmates, like slaves and sharecroppers before them, sang while they worked. In 1964, the folklorist Bruce Jackson visited Ramsey State Farm, a prison in Rosharon, Texas, where he met an inmate named J. B. Smith, who was serving a forty-five year sentence for murdering his wife. Smith led work songs on a flat-weeding gang at the penitentiary; he also made up his own original tunes. Jackson recorded Smith’s music and wrote about his songs in a 1972 book about Ramsey State Farm. (The recordings will be released on CD in April.) Salsburg writes that Smith’s songs, “drawn from both vernacular and personal sources, and thick with the cast and the argot of the penitentiary … form an epic of the Southern prison-farm experience.”","282","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/weekend-reading-burning-man-work-songs"

"The first test of whether this new dynamic will lead to a more productive Congress comes this week, with the debate over Keystone XL, the Canadian pipeline project that has been mired in political controversy for six years.

"At first glance, it’s absurd that approval of a Canadian corporation’s pipeline project is the new Republican Congress’s highest priority. The benefit to the U.S. economy from the construction of the pipeline would be modest—a few thousand temporary jobs created during its construction and a few dozen permanent jobs once it’s up and running. Republicans have long argued that the pipeline would help reduce fuel prices, a tenuous claim that is now beside the point because the price of a gallon of gas is at a five-year low.","288","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"Still, there is a scenario in which Boehner and McConnell’s decision to start with Keystone might be encouraging. The Obama Administration immediately announced that the President would veto the legislation. But the veto statement was silent on the merits of the project itself. Obama simply objected to Congress interfering with the pipeline-approval process, which has historically been left to the executive branch. The President’s exclusive right to approve cross-border pipelines may be such a fundamental principle to the Administration that the veto statement is the beginning and end of the debate.

Keystone XL is one of the few G.O.P. priorities in which the philosophical gulf between Obama and congressional Republicans is relatively narrow. In private, Obama has been dismissive of environmentalist claims that building Keystone XL would significantly affect climate change, and his State Department, with some caveats, came to the same conclusion in an environmental-impact statement. In U.S. and Canadian diplomatic circles, officials regularly discuss whether there could be some kind of a deal between the two countries. For example, Canada might make a more ambitious pledge to reduce carbon pollution in return for U.S. approval of the Keystone XL pipeline.","290","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"So why doesn’t Obama have that discussion with Congress instead? What would the G.O.P. be willing to trade to get Keystone approved? A carbon tax? A large infrastructure project? Codifying the E.P.A.’s climate regulations into law? From the White House’s perspective, the Keystone XL pipeline should be an ideal policy to give away in a trade: it’s a major issue that Republicans care a great deal about but one that Obama seems to view as a sideshow. (And if world oil prices remain low, Keystone may be entirely moot because production in the expensive-to-develop Canadian oil sands might not be economically viable.)","291","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"

On Friday, the court ratified that route, clearing the way for the State Department to complete its work. It is possible, and perhaps even more likely than not, that soon after Obama vetoed congressional legislation forcing approval of Keystone XL he would then approve the project on his own. But will he get anything in return? If the Republican Congress and President Obama can’t figure out a way to cut a deal on this issue, don’t expect the next two years to look much different from the last two.","292","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"

"Ever since last July, when a Russian YouTube user uploaded “Giant Hole in the Ground,” a thirty-four-second video of, well, a giant hole in the ground—about two hundred and fifty feet across and more than a hundred and fifty feet deep—the world has been fascinated by a group of mysterious craters in the tundra of the Russian Arctic. On Thursday, Vasily Bogoyavlensky, the deputy director of the Oil and Gas Research Institute, at the Russian Academy of Sciences, told Agence France-Presse that he and his colleagues have now identified seven of these “holes at the end of the world,” including one that is more than half a mile across. “But, in fact, there are plenty more,” Bogoyavlensky said.","March 13, 2015","299","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/siberia-mystery-craters-methane-climate-change"

"Theories about the mystery craters have variously attributed them to meteorite impacts, missile strikes, explosions from nearby gas fields, and the melting of soil-covered ice mounds, known as pingos. The most likely explanation for the phenomenon, however, seems to be climate change. Underground temperatures in parts of Siberia have risen by nearly four degrees in the past fifteen years. As the ground there—mostly permafrost—warms, it releases methane. The methane builds up until there’s an explosion, which leaves behind a hole. “The phenomenon is similar to the eruption of a volcano,” Bogoyavlensky said.","301","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/siberia-mystery-craters-methane-climate-change"
"Whether or not they end in explosions, these methane releases are a serious concern. Methane is a greenhouse gas, and on a molecule-by-molecule basis it is a far more potent warming agent than carbon dioxide (although it doesn’t last as long in the atmosphere). If the permafrost is leaking methane because of rising temperatures, a positive-feedback loop could be taking effect: more methane leads to further warming, which leads to further thawing, and so on.","302","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/siberia-mystery-craters-methane-climate-change"
"But the holes in Siberia also point to another, stranger phenomenon. Global warming and geology turn out to be connected in unexpected ways. Consider, for example, earthquakes. Generally, earthquakes occur because of the movements of Earth’s tectonic plates; they tend to take place along plate boundaries. But recently Greenland has been experiencing an unusually large number of quakes. One widely discussed theory attributes this to the shrinking of the Greenland ice sheet. As the ice sheet melts, its weight declines, allowing the land underneath it to rise. The process, which is known as isostatic rebound, may well be responsible for the increase in seismic activity.","303","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/siberia-mystery-craters-methane-climate-change"
"Iceland, too, is rising, and for similar reasons. As the country’s glaciers melt, the land is rebounding. A recent study showed that some parts of the country are gaining elevation at the astonishing rate of 1.4 inches a year. “What we’re observing is a climatically induced change in the earth’s surface,” Richard Bennett, one of the authors of the study and a geoscientist at the University of Arizona, told the Web site Live Science last month. In the case of Iceland, that change may lead to an increase in volcanic activity. As the land rises, the pressure on the rock beneath it changes. Lower pressure translates into a lower melting temperature, which could, in turn, translate into more (or at least more destructive) volcanic eruptions. The past five years have been packed with “interesting volcanic activity,” Sigrún Hreinsdóttir, Bennett’s fellow-researcher and a geophysicist at the University of Iceland, told the Washington Post. “You can’t make any statistics from those few data points, of course, but you do notice there might be a connection with the uplift,” And there’s a precedent: during the deglaciation that occurred at the end of the last ice age, some twelve thousand years ago, volcanic activity in Iceland is estimated to have increased by as much as a factor of thirty.","304","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/siberia-mystery-craters-methane-climate-change"

"Although Obama ended with one of his trademark calls for unity, the address he delivered was forceful and politically charged. As expected, the heart of it was a populist economics plan that challenges virtually everything today’s Republican Party stands for. “Middle-class economics,” the President called it, and without delving into too many details he made a pretty good fist of laying it out: tax breaks for working families, a higher minimum wage, expanded child care, two years’ worth of free community-college tuition guaranteed, investments in infrastructure—and much of this to be financed by raising taxes on the rich and the big banks. “Let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one per cent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth,” Obama declared. “We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the economy.”","308","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"
"That part of the speech, which echoed some of the themes that were raised by the Occupy Wall Street movement, and that have since been further elucidated by Thomas Piketty, was well trailed. What came as more of a surprise was the President’s over-all tone, which clearly reflected his recent successes in doing an end run around Congress on immigration policy, reaching a deal on climate change with China, reversing U.S. policy toward Cuba, and seeing his approval ratings rise on the back of good economic news. From the beginning, his language was much more celebratory than in his previous State of the Union speeches. “We are fifteen years into this new century,” he said. “It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page.” There followed a litany of indicators showing that things are going right in the Union: a growing economy, shrinking deficits, a falling unemployment rate, millions fewer people without health insurance, an end to the combat mission in Afghanistan. “America, for all that we have endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: the shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong,” he said.","309","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"

He was self-assured, glib, and, at times, bordering on bumptious. “Well, we’ve been warned,” Karl Rove complained on Twitter. “POTUS will spend rest of year campaigning.” In the chamber, the Republicans, some of whom had perhaps been expecting a more humble Obama, sat mostly in silence. (As is usual on these occasions, John Boehner, the Speaker of the House, looked like he was suffering from chronic constipation.) At one point, after reciting another encouraging economic development, the President turned to the Republicans and said, “This is good news, people.” It wasn’t until near the end that he acknowledged the results of the elections—the elections he triumphed in, that is. “I have no more campaigns to run,” he said. And then, departing from his prepared remarks in response to some applause from Republicans, he smiled and added: “I know, because I won both of them.”","310","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"
"In a speech that lasted about an hour, Obama devoted barely ten minutes to foreign policy: here, too, his interpretation of recent events was highly positive. Without providing much evidence to support his assertion, he said, “In Iraq and Syria, American leadership—including our military power—is stopping ISIL’s advance.” He also asked his hosts to pass a resolution authorizing the use of force against the jihadists in Iraq and Syria, and, addressing the nuclear negotiations with Iran, promised to veto a sanctions bill if Congress passes one. Turning to Russia and Ukraine, he didn’t quite declare victory over Vladimir Putin, but he came pretty close, mocking those who suggested, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea last year, that Putin had outmaneuvered the West. “Today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters,” Obama said. “That’s how America leads: not with bluster but with persistent, steady resolve.”","311","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"
"By then, he was rolling toward the finish. He welcomed home Alan Gross, the American who had been held prisoner in Havana until the recent détente; hailed efforts to fight Ebola in West Africa (in truth, he could have made more of the efficacy of the government’s response here at home); pledged, once again, to shut down Guantánamo; and slipped in a stretcher about how restrained the United States has been in its deployment of drones. After declaring climate change to be the biggest threat to future generations, he went into a closing spiel that drew on a familiar Obama trope, saying that there’s no such thing as a liberal America and a conservative America, or a white America and a black America—only a United States of America, in which both parties should come together and embrace a “better politics.”","312","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"

Until the end of the speech, when Obama circa 2004 put in a cameo appearance, he had provided a welcome glance of the Obama whom many Democrats believed they had elected in 2008: progressive, impassioned, and persuasive. “Where was this economic Obama in 2009?” the documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney asked on Twitter. That’s a question that historians will certainly ponder.

"“Caring” might not be the first word that comes to mind in association with multinational luxury conglomerates, but Kering—the twenty-four-billion-dollar company that owns Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, and others—would like to change that. François-Henri Pinault, the company’s C.E.O., was in town from Paris the other day, to help explain. Until 2013, Kering was called P.P.R. (short for Pinault-Printemps-Redoute). That year, in a Web post announcing its new name, the company noted that the homophony was deliberate: “Kering can be pronounced and understood as ‘caring,’ ” an aspect of the company’s attitude “toward our brands, people, customers, stakeholders, and the environment.” It also got a new logo: a semi-abstract owl. Pinault said at the time that the owl is a “discreet and protective animal.”","315","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/flyby"
"Pinault stopped by Kering’s midtown offices, which are small (just thirteen employees) and are strewn with athletic equipment from the group’s sports and life-style brands. A Volcom surfboard leaned against a wall, opposite a bag of golf clubs with a Puma logo. Pinault had just flown in from Texas, which he had never visited before.","316","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/flyby"
"“Coming from Europe, we have a vision of the U.S. that is very much East and West, forgetting that there is a huge part of America in the middle,” he said. “It was quite surprising, the level of sophistication of the people I met.” He’d been fascinated to learn that thousands of foreigners go to Houston for medical treatment each year. “It’s a completely different type of tourism that is very, very attractive,” he said, “because it’s very wealthy people.”","317","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/flyby"
"The unmet luxury needs of medical tourists demand a particular sort of caring, one that F.H.P. (as the C.E.O. is known to his employees) is equipped to provide. Pinault has overseen Kering’s transformation from a grab-bag conglomerate that his father founded—lumber, department stores, pharmaceutical distribution—into a sleek vessel for consumer dreams. He wore a dark-blue suit with small copper-colored “x”s woven into the fabric. He has receding sandy hair, ruddy eyebrows, and a face that looks heartier in photographs than in person. The buttons on his shirt had “Gucci” spelled out along their edges, and when he sat they pulled slightly over his stomach.","318","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/flyby"
"When describing his work, Pinault augments his French-accented English with fluent International Business Hand Gesture. “Methodology”—he chops one palm with the edge of the other. “Two pillars of sustainability”—he grasps these invisible pillars. The first pillar was environmental responsibility, the subject that Pinault was to address on a panel at the Parsons School of Design later in the day. The second was a focus on advancing women’s rights. Pinault recalled the circumstances of his feminist awakening.","319","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/flyby"
"“It was around 2006. It was a meeting between my . . . she was not my wife yet, but my wife and Eve Ensler”—the “Vagina Monologues” playwright—“about the reality of violence against women.” Pinault’s wife is the actress Salma Hayek; they married in 2009, and have a seven-year-old daughter. (Pinault also has two teen-agers from a previous marriage, and an eight-year-old son with the model Linda Evangelista.) “I realized how bad the situation was—in France, in America, in everywhere.”","320","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/flyby"
"The cause of women’s rights aligned nicely with Kering’s demographics, as Pinault believes a corporate cause must. (Puma has sponsored an international day of peace. A worthy cause, he said, “but what does it have to do with a sport brand—peace?”) Seventy-five to eighty per cent of Kering’s customers are women, as are sixty per cent of the company’s employees.","321","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/flyby"
"“Fighting violence against women when you’re a luxury company, when it’s all about desire, and dreams—well, it’s not very sexy to talk about,” Pinault said. “But that’s the way it is.” Pinault referred to a study suggesting that female employees are more hesitant than male employees to seek advancement. “If you take into consideration that, by nature, women won’t express the same thing, you should not have the same type of interview,” he said. “So we changed. Making sure that in interviews we ask the women very directly, ‘What do you think should be the next step for you?’ You don’t have to ask that of men.”","322","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/flyby"

"After Lyndon Johnson obliterated Barry Goldwater in the 1964 Presidential election, lots of people assumed that American conservatism was dead—including, who knows, maybe a seventeen-year-old Hillary herself. Then came the 1966 midterm elections, when, riding the “white backlash” against events like the 1965 Watts riots, in Los Angeles, the Republicans made big gains in Congress. In 1968, they took back the White House, in an election that looked closer than it was because a conservative third-party candidate, George Wallace, had siphoned off 13.5 per cent of the vote from Richard Nixon. By the time that Hillary made her celebrated Wellesley commencement speech, endorsing the student protests of the age in a measured, campus-leader tone, she had to have registered that the country was moving in the opposite direction.","327","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"

"Hillary Clinton is the least instinctive of politicians; you can almost see her thinking her way through a situation. The master situation for her, from the time of her political awakening through her early sixties, when she first ran for President, was the difficulty of winning in American politics as a liberal. This may help explain her much-disputed decision to bring in Mark Penn, who made his early reputation by figuring out how to achieve Democratic victories in a Republican era, as her chief strategist in the 2008 campaign. Clinton was obviously not looking for a strategist who could help her connect with voters on the left. If you were writing fiction, it would be too heavily ironic to deal her the fate of being defeated by someone who felt less constrained about owning up to a youthful admiration for Alinsky.","329","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"In the early phases of the 2016 campaign, there is no form of high-end political expertise that Clinton doesn’t have at her disposal—including much of the leadership of the campaign staff that defeated her in 2008. One can only imagine the polls, the focus groups, and the staff retreats that underlay her runic two-minute announcement video—a high-gloss little movie that was devoted to “everyday Americans,” included a bit of rhetoric about the deck being stacked against them, and hardly showed the candidate herself. The clear message was that Clinton has gone from decades of being spooked by the right to, now, being spooked by the left. The video had none of the old, formerly magical symbolic touchpoints of baby-boom liberal politicians who wanted to win: there was no mention of tax cuts, crime-fighting, militarism, or religion, and there were hardly any white males. The only arguably centrist notes struck were a couple of glowing mentions of small business and a very veiled possible reference to charter schools.","330","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"The United States is a big country with a miraculously durable two-party system, which means that each party has to be an unnatural coalition of disparate elements. The Republicans won their big battle of the late twentieth century, which took up most of Hillary Clinton’s adult life, to persuade social conservatives to leave the Democratic Party. But in the process they drove many who were more socially liberal away. And, because the political system is in constant flux, even as the Democratic and Republican parties have become more efficiently liberal and conservative, generating the hyper-partisanship that everyone claims to despise, each has begun to show a new set of internal strains. The Republicans have to try to unite affluent economic conservatives with financially struggling evangelicals. The Democratic Party that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama made, and that Hillary Clinton now inherits, encompasses minorities, labor unions, and single women, plus significant portions of Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and the broad professional upper-middle class in big metropolitan areas, especially on the coasts. (The historic home of the Bush family, Greenwich, Connecticut, is now represented in Congress by a Democrat.) The Democrats’ diversity enables them to achieve rough financial parity with the Republicans, but it has to be tricky to manage.","331","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"The announcement video indicates that the Clinton campaign believes that in this cycle, the core appeal to Democratic and potentially Democratic voters has to be based on economics. Voters want to hear that the generation-long stall-out of the American working and middle classes’ fortunes is somehow going to end. The problem is that, right now, the Democratic coalition seems to be in agreement on the formerly radioactive social issues—ethnicity, sexuality, values—but not on the economic issues that will define the election. In the video you can detect the hope that it will be possible to declare that the campaign is all about economics, and then to spend it talking mainly about other things. Does Hillary Clinton want to raise taxes on the rich? More heavily regulate financial institutions? Make unions more politically powerful? Throw some sand in the gears of globalization by restricting free trade? These are the kinds of questions that have historically gone along with an overriding concern with the welfare of “everyday Americans,” but they are not pleasant ones for the campaign, because in each case, a clear answer would alienate an element of the Democratic Party.","332","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"Don’t think of this problem as being only about Clinton’s keeping the Elizabeth Warren wing of her party on board through the nomination. Last week, John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio, who’s thinking of jumping into the Presidential race, made a point of going on national television and complaining at some length about “greed” on Wall Street. That indicates that he thinks there may be a way to run against both Clinton and Jeb Bush on what might be called Main Street economics, from within the Republican Party. Exactly what to say about the tough economic situation faced by most Americans could be as tricky for Clinton in the general election as it will be in the primary season. Her policy team is no doubt as well stocked as her message team, and it may have the tougher job.","333","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"What does it mean if someone “doesn’t love” Rudolph Giuliani? Many New Yorkers have considered that question, or a stronger variation; there are a lot of passions in this city. The inquiry hasn’t made us doubt ourselves. It shouldn’t make President Obama feel bad, either—even though Giuliani, on Wednesday night, managed to conflate love for himself with all kinds of grander emotions. “I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America,” Giuliani said at an event for Scott Walker, in Manhattan, according to Politico’s Darren Samuelsohn. “He doesn’t love you. And he doesn’t love me.”","February 19, 2015","334","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/rudy-giuliani-obama-meaning-love"

"We know the weight of the “me” in there—with Giuliani, it is always, in the end, about Giuliani. He spent eight years as New York City’s mayor, which is no time at all compared to the number of hours he has spent bragging about it. But who is this “you” whom Obama also doesn’t love? Giuliani was speaking to, as Politico put it, “60 right-leaning business executives and conservative media types.” The President was less loving than all of them, Giuliani said, because, “He wasn’t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.”","336","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/rudy-giuliani-obama-meaning-love"
"What faces did Giuliani see—or fail to see—at the event that made him so sure of that assessment? He talks as if he knows what the children of loving, patriotic parents look like. Obama was brought up by a single mother who, even when they lived abroad, played him recordings of the speeches of Martin Luther King, Jr., an act in which one really can see many kinds of love mixed together. He was also cared for by grandparents whose love of country Giuliani has no business impugning. These types of casual insults, so characteristic of Giuliani, remind us that he has no business pontificating about other people’s affections. (He talks freely enough about his own.) But, leaving Obama’s heritage aside, is Giuliani really saying that someone without American parents, and without specific early instruction in a particular brand of patriotism, can’t get his mind around this country’s greatness? There are a lot of immigrants who have loved this country and died for it—that is the idea of America. Or was Giuliani just suggesting to the audience that there was something different about Obama? And what might that be?","337","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/rudy-giuliani-obama-meaning-love"
"Perhaps Scott Walker would be a good person to ask. He was, according to Politico, sitting quite close to Giuliani at the dinner. Walker also campaigned with Mitt Romney in Wisconsin, in 2012, on the same weekend that Romney said, “Our President doesn’t have the same feelings about American exceptionalism that we do.” Thursday, on CNBC, Walker said that he wouldn’t comment on Giuliani’s views or on “what the President thinks or not,” saying that each man could speak for himself. Walker added, “I’ll tell you, I love America.” Pressed on whether he agreed with Giuliani, he said, “I’m in New York. I’m used to people saying things that are aggressive out there.” Are they so shy in Wisconsin?","338","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/rudy-giuliani-obama-meaning-love"
"Republicans have made these insinuations, more or less constantly, since Obama appeared on the political scene, seemingly deaf to how he actually talks about America. After Bobby Jindal made similar comments, factcheck.org just last week looked into the “exceptionalism” question and wondered why it kept being repeated when the “claim that Obama ‘won’t proudly proclaim American exceptionalism’ is quickly and easily belied by a search through Obama’s public speeches.” That question sounds like something from a character in a vaudeville sketch who, having forgotten some code-word, asks why everyone keeps saying it.","339","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/rudy-giuliani-obama-meaning-love"
"Politico spoke to Giuliani after the dinner, and reported that he “elaborated” by complaining that Obama “sees our weaknesses as footnotes to the great things we’ve done,” which raises the question of where, if even footnotes are too presumptuous, the weaknesses should go in the book of America. Giuliani continued, “What country has left so many young men and women dead abroad to save other countries without taking land? This is not the colonial empire that somehow he has in his hand. I’ve never felt that from him. I felt that from [George] W. [Bush]. I felt that from [Bill] Clinton. I felt that from every American president, including ones I disagreed with, including [Jimmy] Carter. I don’t feel that from President Obama.” So this is, again, about how Giuliani has “felt” when he’s been with Obama: as if he were talking to someone else’s colonial who was out of place in a position of power. Giuliani also weighed in on the Crusades—“I’m not sure how wrong the Crusades are. The Crusades were kind of an equal battle between two groups of barbarians”—a matter whose connection to American patriotism he left unclear.","340","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/rudy-giuliani-obama-meaning-love"
"John McCain had a fine moment in the 2008 campaign when he told a woman at a town-hall meeting who said that she was scared of Obama because he was “an Arab” that Obama wasn’t, and that she didn’t have to worry. But that was a moment of basic decency, not some grand act of bravery. Trying out rhetoric of the Giuliani kind may be a temptation for the candidates in 2016. They won’t be running against Obama, but they also won’t have to look him in the face. His Americanism will be an idea that the G.O.P. can accept as a given or use to discredit itself.","341","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/rudy-giuliani-obama-meaning-love"

In it, he talked about “the ideals that have shaped us for more than two centuries” and said, “The story extremists and terrorists don’t want the world to know—Muslims succeeding and thriving in America. Because when that truth is known, it exposes their propaganda as the lie that it is. It’s also a story that every American must never forget, because it reminds us all that hatred and bigotry and prejudice have no place in our country. It’s not just counterproductive; it doesn’t just aid terrorists; it’s wrong. It’s contrary to who we are.” He also talked about a card he’d received from an eleven-year-old girl named Sabrina, who is Muslim.

The E.U.’s tough stance toward Greece was partly a negotiating ploy to force Syriza to be more coöperative, but it also reflected a growing anger at the Greeks, and perhaps even a desire to punish Syriza’s leaders for being too uppity.","344","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/angela-merkel-throws-greece-a-lifeline"

"Angela Merkel, the de-facto leader of Europe, stepped in and displayed some of the statesmanship that I called for in a post last weekend. Rising above the squabbling, the German chancellor threw Alexis Tsipras, Greece’s embattled Prime Minister, a lifeline, attending this week’s high-level mini-summit, which excluded some of the smaller countries that are most opposed to cutting Greece a break. She also invited Tsipras to visit her in Berlin. (He’ll go there on Monday.) The mini-summit didn’t provide Greece with any cash right away, but Merkel’s intervention calmed the markets and raised the prospect that some two billion euros’ worth of E.U. funds will be released around Easter if Syriza stops shilly-shallying, puts forward a detailed set of economic reforms, and takes some steps toward implementing them. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said that the funds would come from the E.U.’s development budget, and could be used to alleviate Greece’s humanitarian crisis.","347","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/angela-merkel-throws-greece-a-lifeline"
"Coming just a week after Tsipras outraged many Germans by saying that Greece is determined to pursue a claim for war reparations, Merkel’s willingness to intervene demonstrated why she bestrides Europe like a colossus. In a currency zone of nineteen very different countries, division and fractiousness is the natural state of affairs, but Merkel is capable of imposing some unity and direction. And for now, at least, she seems determined to keep Greece inside the euro zone. “If the euro fails, Europe fails,” she told German lawmakers before leaving for Brussels. “The euro is more than a currency.”","348","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/angela-merkel-throws-greece-a-lifeline"
"The German chancellor’s diplomatic initiative was a welcome one, and it brought Greece back from a financial precipice. But it doesn’t greatly diminish the political challenge that Tsipras and Varoufakis are facing. In the next week or two, they will have to fulfill the task they have been shrinking from since February 20th, when the E.U. provisionally agreed to extend its bailout: provide a list of economic reforms that are market-oriented enough to satisfy the troika of institutions that oversees E.U. bailouts—the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund—but progressive enough to satisfy its own supporters.","349","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/angela-merkel-throws-greece-a-lifeline"
"Speaking to reporters in Brussels after the summit, Merkel couldn’t have been more explicit. “The agreement of February 20th is still valid in its entirety,” she said. “Every paragraph of the agreement counts.” The accord clearly states that Greece’s reform plans have to be approved by the troika before any money can be disbursed, and Merkel repeated this point several times. With public opinion in Germany turning sharply against Greece, she didn’t have much choice.","350","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/angela-merkel-throws-greece-a-lifeline"
"The big question now is whether the Greek government can reach an agreement with the international financial institutions overseeing the bailouts, which have representatives camped out in Athens. Merkel said that the Greeks would have “ownership” of the reforms that they propose, and pointed out that Ireland, when it renegotiated its E.U. bailout, was able to change some of its terms. That was a positive sign, and so was a statement issued by the Greek finance ministry, which said it would welcome a comprehensive list of the requirements that the international institutions are said to be preparing. If all goes well, the talks between the Greeks and the institutions will now intensify, getting down to detailed discussion of issues like privatization, tax reform, and changes to labor laws and competition policies. If this happens, it is possible that the Greek government will have a list of approved reforms ready to present at another Brussels summit in a week or two, and that, shortly thereafter, it will receive some of the money it desperately needs from the E.U. and the E.C.B.","351","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/angela-merkel-throws-greece-a-lifeline"
"But there are still significant obstacles to overcome. According to some reports from Athens, Greek officials are refusing to allow the visiting international bureaucrats into government buildings, and are insisting on meeting them in their hotels. While this may seem petty, it reflects the tremendous hostility that many Greeks feel toward the troika because of its role in imposing austerity policies, and the fact that Syriza campaigned on a platform of expelling it from the country. Anything that seems like a cave-in to the austerity enforcers could be fatal to the new government. Doubtless, that was why Tsipras, at his post-summit press conference, repeated his usual refrain that “the recession measures are over.”","352","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/angela-merkel-throws-greece-a-lifeline"
"Greece’s leaders are caught between the populist demands of their supporters, the economic demands of the E.U., and the immediate financial demands of the Greek financial system. Merkel’s helpful intervention has given them a bit of time and perhaps a bit of wiggle room.

"Earlier this month, Alan Beatts, the owner of a science-fiction bookstore in San Francisco’s Mission District, announced that a minimum-wage increase recently passed by the city’s voters, from less than eleven dollars an hour last year to fifteen dollars an hour by 2018, was going to put him out of business. Not long afterward, I met Beatts at his shop, Borderlands Books, and he seemed utterly defeated; Borderlands is barely profitable, and the minimum-wage increase would all but guarantee the store a significant loss. The difference was too large to make up for by reducing other costs, like rent or utility bills. In a piece on Borderlands’s closure, I wrote that, while Beatts planned to hold a meeting to hear thoughts from customers about how he might keep his store open, he doubted that it would bring to the surface any usable ideas.","February 21, 2015","355","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/can-sponsorship-save-small-bookstores"

To those who oppose higher minimum wages, it was a vindication: if a business owner in a liberal city like San Francisco was upset about a minimum-wage increase, it must be bad. To those who support minimum-wage increases, Beatts was cast as a traitor to the cause. Concerned that some of his critics might show up at the meeting to heckle him, he asked a friend who planned to attend, and also happened to be a cop, to keep an eye out, in case anyone got aggressive.","357","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/can-sponsorship-save-small-bookstores"
"The hundred or so people who showed up mostly had support to offer and ideas to share. One was to sell memberships to people who were willing to be charged simply to have Borderlands continue to exist. This notion had occurred to Beatts, but he had dismissed it as too much like asking for a handout. But, at the meeting, people seemed amused—even intrigued—by the idea. Based on their comments, and on e-mails received over the following days, it occurred to Beatts that, to his customers, something like a membership might seem not only like an opportunity to help Borderlands but also like a genuine business transaction: they would be paying for the continued existence of what, to them, was an important gathering place for science-fiction readers.","358","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/can-sponsorship-save-small-bookstores"
"As Beatts considered what to do, his initial stance was still being claimed by conservative commentators on wage issues. On Thursday, Walmart announced that it would raise its lowest wage to ten dollars an hour; in a statement, the research director of the right-leaning Employment Policies Institute cited an op-ed he had written in the San Francisco Examiner about the impending closure of Borderlands and other negative consequences of San Francisco’s minimum-wage hike. But, later that day, the Borderlands staff made its own announcement—in the form of a blog post on the store’s Web site. In short, Borderlands might not be closing after all. “Starting immediately we will be offering paid sponsorships of the store,” the staff wrote. Each sponsorship—Beatts and his staff opted for that name in lieu of “membership”—would cost a hundred dollars annually and would include a number of perks that wouldn’t cost anything for Borderlands: the ability to rent, at cost, the Borderlands café; invitations to exclusive events; access to preview sales of rare and collectible books; and so on.","359","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/can-sponsorship-save-small-bookstores"
"If Borderlands sells three hundred sponsorships before the end of March, it will stay open for the rest of the year; next year, Borderlands will sell memberships again, with the same end-of-March deadline and the same plan to close up shop if it can’t meet it. Within a couple of hours after the blog post went up Thursday evening, more than sixty memberships had been sold; when I spoke to Beatts on Saturday morning, he reported that the figure had passed two hundred and thirty, and seemed on track to clear the goal of three hundred.","360","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/can-sponsorship-save-small-bookstores"
"Beatts told me, “I actually don’t know of a retail business like a bookstore that has done something like this, because everybody else had tied it to a mercantile element—like, ‘You’re a member, so you get a discount. We will reduce the amount that you spend with us because you support us.’ We’re really trying to move away from that. What the sponsors are trying to accomplish is, flatly, just to keep my business operating. No one wants a discount. No one wants free books.”","361","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/can-sponsorship-save-small-bookstores"
"In a sense, the model merely restores the notion of a store “patron” to something closer to the word’s original meaning. But it appears to be a relatively unusual approach for a retail store—essentially putting a price tag on Borderlands’s continued existence, and the cultural and social benefits that come with it, rather than tying memberships to some monetary benefit like book discounts. It could prove instructive, though, to other cultural and social enterprises that have enthusiastic fan bases but whose business models are facing rising costs or other pressures. “The word ‘cultural’ can seem a little bit pretentious, and I hate to say, ‘Bookstores are part of the cultural fabric of the United States,’ because I’m selling something that’s marginally better than reality TV, I’m selling entertainment—but, yeah, it is something like that,” Beatts told me. One can imagine a video store selling annual sponsorships that come with access to special movie nights, for instance, or a journalism organization that offers its articles for free but sells annual subscriptions to a private lecture series featuring its journalists.","362","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/can-sponsorship-save-small-bookstores"
"Perhaps, Beatts said, the model could extend even beyond traditional cultural enterprises. He mentioned to me that a couple of restaurants in the neighborhood where he lives have recently closed down. He told me that he would have gladly paid a hundred dollars a year so that they could have stayed open; maybe they could have offered him priority brunch seating in exchange, or some similar perk. “I wonder if this idea—‘Look, if you put up this money, we get to stay in business, and in exchange we will do these things for you to demonstrate our appreciation’—I wonder how many businesses that might work for,” Beatts said. “It could be applicable anywhere.”","363","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/can-sponsorship-save-small-bookstores"
"For twenty years, many people in Israel and in the West have expressed the hope that Benjamin Netanyahu would prove to be the Richard Nixon of the State of Israel. Not the paranoid Nixon of the Watergate scandals or the embittered Nixon raving drunkenly at the White House portraits at four in the morning but the Nixon who yearned to enter the pantheon of statesmen, and who defied his Red-baiting past and initiated diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China. Wasn’t it possible that Netanyahu, whose political biography was steeped in the intransigent nationalism of the Revisionist movement, was just the right politician to make a lasting peace with the Palestinians?","364","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"It is amazing to recall how long this fantasy persisted. Even President Obama, whose relationship with Netanyahu is now poisoned by mistrust, once suspended disbelief. “There’s the famous example of Richard Nixon going to China,” he said, in 2009. “A Democrat couldn’t have gone to China. A liberal couldn’t have gone to China. But a big anti-Communist like Richard Nixon could open that door. Now, it’s conceivable that Prime Minister Netanyahu can play that same role.” Netanyahu, as he went on building settlements, deftly kept this illusion alive. In a speech six years ago, at Bar-Ilan University, and in comments as recently as last year, he spoke of his conditional support for “two states for two peoples.”","365","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"In last week’s Israeli elections, Netanyahu did play the role of Nixon—except that he did not go to China. Nor did he go to Ramallah. He went racist. In 1968, Nixon spoke the coded language of states’ rights and law-and-order politics in order to heighten the fears of white voters in the South, who felt diminished and disempowered by the civil-rights movement and by the Democrat in the White House, Lyndon B. Johnson. Nixon’s swampy maneuvers helped defeat the Democrat Hubert Humphrey and secure the South as an electoral safe haven for more than forty years.","366","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"Netanyahu, a student—practically a member—of the G.O.P., is no beginner at this demagogic game. In 1995, as the leader of the opposition, he spoke at rallies where he questioned the Jewishness of Yitzhak Rabin’s attempt to make peace with the Palestinians through the Oslo Accords. This bit of code was not lost on the ultra-Orthodox or on the settlers. Netanyahu refused to rein in fanatics among his supporters who carried signs portraying Rabin as a Nazi or wearing, à la Arafat, a kaffiyeh.","367","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"Last week, Netanyahu, sensing an electoral threat from a center-left coalition led by Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, unleashed a campaign finale steeped in nativist fear and hatred of the Other. This time, there was not a trace of subtlety. “Right-wing rule is in danger,” he warned his supporters. “Arab voters are coming out in droves to the polls.” On Israeli TV, he said, “If we don’t close the gap in the next few days, Herzog and Livni, supported by Arabs and leftist N.G.O.s, will form the next government.” (Twenty per cent of the Israeli citizenry is Arab.) He warned darkly of “left-wing people from outside,” including perfidious “Scandinavians,” and “tens of millions of dollars” being used to “mobilize the Arab vote.” Pro-Likud phone banks reminded voters that Netanyahu’s opponents had the support of “Hussein Obama.”","368","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"The day before the election, Netanyahu made it clear that, after so many years of periodically flashing the Nixon-goes-to-China card to keep the center-left and the meddling “foreigners” at bay, he would play a new hand. “Whoever moves to establish a Palestinian state or intends to withdraw from territory is simply yielding territory for radical Islamic terrorist attacks against Israel,” he said in an interview with NRG, a right-leaning Israeli news site. Pressed to say if this meant that he would never agree to a Palestinian state, he answered, “Indeed.”","369","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"Netanyahu’s survival instincts are impressive. While he was arousing fear of Arabs and Scandinavians, he was relying on the support of an actual foreign patron, Sheldon Adelson, the American billionaire and casino operator. Adelson owns and publishes Israel Hayom (Israel Today), the country’s highest-circulation daily—a propaganda sheet whose sole purpose is to support the Prime Minister and Likud. Adelson is Netanyahu’s piggy bank and reflects a cruder version of his ideological impulses. Adelson has dismissed the Palestinians as “an invented people,” and he doesn’t mind if Israel strays from democratic principles and norms: “I don’t think the Bible says anything about democracy.” He was in a seat of honor and beaming with satisfaction when, three weeks ago, Netanyahu defied Obama and delivered his speech to Congress opposing a nuclear deal with Iran.","370","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"Now that he has been reëlected, Netanyahu has started to walk back his remarks, telling interviewers that he didn’t mean what he said about “droves” of Arabs, that he is all for a secure two-state solution. Nixon goes to China—again! But why should anyone believe it? Netanyahu’s victory—the way he achieved it and what it says about the politics of the Israeli majority—is clarifying. Josh Earnest, President Obama’s spokesman, said that the Administration was unmoved by Netanyahu’s post-election attempts to make nice, and declared that “the United States is in a position to reëvaluate our thinking.” The Republicans’ position is clear—you get the sense that their congressional leadership would like to see Netanyahu go big-time and get on the ballot in Iowa and New Hampshire—but what about Hillary Clinton? Will she have the political courage to speak frankly and risk alienating some of her more conservative donors? The Palestinians, for their part, have every reason to believe that Netanyahu has shown both his hand and his heart; they will likely drop any thought of negotiations and take their campaign for statehood to the United Nations. For the first time, they may not face a reflexive veto from the United States.","371","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"Netanyahu, of course, does not view himself as Richard Nixon. In his imagination, he is Winston Churchill, the valorous protector of his nation, the singular leader of clear, unerring vision. Nearly two hundred former Israeli military and security chiefs, none of them naïve about the multiple dangers of the Middle East, have declared that further brinkmanship threatens the long-term stability of the nation. But Netanyahu is sure that he knows better. The tragedy is that the likely price of his vainglory is the increasing isolation of a country founded as a democratic refuge for a despised and decimated people. He will soon surpass David Ben-Gurion as Israel’s longest consecutively serving Prime Minister. Unfortunately, this has given Netanyahu plenty of time to erode the tone of his country’s political discourse. And so now, as he forms an unabashedly right-wing and religious government, he stands in opposition not only to the founding aspirations of his nation but also to those Israelis—Jews and Arabs—who stand for tolerance, equality, democratic ideals, and a just, secure peace. ♦","372","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"On June 20, 1977, oil began to flow through the recently completed Trans-Alaska pipeline. That same week, The New Yorker published the first part of a four-part series, “Coming Into the Country,” John McPhee’s exploration of Alaska’s still vast open spaces and the people who—often just barely—managed to make a living from them. Oil was changing the state, and many residents were worried about what effects it would have: on the landscape, on the creatures that inhabited it, and on themselves.“The Alaska population is bigger now, because of the pipeline,” one native Alaskan told McPhee. “I don’t like a lot of people. I like the lands.”","373","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/1975-1985"
"“Coming Into the Country” is about how human beings relate to those parts of the world which they did not create, which they may be able to destroy but cannot entirely control. It’s part of a New Yorker tradition of what might be called “man in nature” writing, a tradition that stretches back to before there was such a thing as environmental consciousness, or at least before there was a term for it. In 1951, the magazine published a three-part series on the oceans by Rachel Carson; the following decade, it serialized the book that’s often said to have launched the modern environmental movement, “Silent Spring.” McPhee, meanwhile, continued to probe the uneasy relationship between people and their planet in works like “Atchafalaya,” which appeared in 1987. The subject was taken up in a roundabout way by Ian Frazier in “Great Plains,” published in 1989, and more directly by Bill McKibben, the same year, in “The End of Nature.” It remains a central concern at The New Yorker as the magazine enters its tenth decade and the damage—to the landscape, to the creatures that inhabit it, and to ourselves—mounts up.","374","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/1975-1985"
"In the corporate-food world these days, everyone wants to achieve “the Chipotle effect,” the profit that accrues to a brand that manages to be neither McDonalds nor Applebee’s—not junk food, exactly, and not a punch line. The same appears to be true of Presidential candidates. Less than twenty-four hours after Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy on Twitter—“Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion”—she was in line at a Chipotle outside of Toledo (chicken burrito bowl, yes on guac). Her staff is spending a lot of time emphasizing that the campaign is not simply about Clinton, so it let the Chipotle story filter out by telling donors and advisors, knowing full well where that would lead. By nightfall, the Times was in possession of security-camera footage of the former First Lady paying for her burrito, unrecognized in her shades, and performing the ritual carrying of her tray. Chipotle started trending on Twitter.","April 15, 2015","375","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-shareworthy"

"Clinton’s campaign has made a point of touting its digital savvy and preparations. Her chief technology officer, Stephanie Hannon, was Google’s director of product management for civic innovation and social impact. Her digital director, Katie Dowd, is a longtime Clinton aide, at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation. Clinton is also being advised by Teddy Goff, who oversaw President Obama’s social media, online advertising and fundraising, and digital product development in 2012. This is a significant improvement over Clinton’s campaign in 2008, which wasn’t very good at the computer, fuelling a strain of humor akin to that of the reporter Jonathan Darman, who imagined how the candidate might have responded to news of a Tumblr spoof: “How do we get them to take down the Tumblr and/or how do we destroy Facebook?”","377","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-shareworthy"
"Clinton’s campaign is said to be planning a tech operation three times the size of Obama’s in 2012, but infrastructure is a minimal prerequisite. Digital strategy is long past the point of optimizing clever campaign tweets or testing fund-raising e-mails to induce people to click. (In 2012, the Obama campaign found that more people clicked on messages with the subject line “Hey” than any other.) Today, the challenge is to figure out smart ways to make the campaign “travel,” digitally, that is, bounce around the Web. Unfortunately for Clinton, gravitas is not viral gold, which is part of the reason her campaign released a launch video so relaxed and comforting that it was the television-ad equivalent of pajamas with feet. (My colleague Andy Borowitz imagines a follow-up “featuring nothing but kittens.”) The ad featured a diverse mix of non-actors talking about their dreams—Latino brothers excited about starting a business, two men looking forward to their wedding—but it was most notable for its lack of self-seriousness. A guy with a dog in a kitchen described his dream: “We really just want to teach our dog to quit eating the trash.”","378","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-shareworthy"
"It’s a cliché these days to say that the question hovering over Clinton’s campaign is about its “rationale”: Why is she running? The truth, though not very high-minded, is that Clinton’s success over the next several months (not to mention the next nineteen) will hinge less on her plans for Yemen than on her ability to persuade people not to roll their eyes at the mention of another President Clinton. It’s no coincidence, then, that Clinton is being advised by Roy Spence, the ad guru who persuaded DoubleTree Hotels to make its central marketing icon the warm chocolate-chip cookies that guests receive upon arrival. For Southwest Airlines, his firm came up with “You are now free to move about the country.” “If I owned Roy’s Security Systems, I would have an outdoor board that said, ‘Peace of mind for $48 a month,’ instead of promoting just security systems or monitoring services,” Spence says. He creates a vibe, and Clinton needs one.","379","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-shareworthy"

In January, Clark, an expert on youth-oriented social media, said that she was taking a few months away from Coke. Clinton needs the youth: one of big reasons she lost in 2008 was that voters under thirty leaned heavily toward Obama. Coke has one of the most “liked” pages on Facebook, thanks to its fast and casual approach to messages and campaigns. In a Spencian moment, Clark describes Coca-Cola’s “purpose” as delivering “happiness.” Her first of eight principles for digital success: “Be shareworthy in everything you do.”","380","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-shareworthy"
"Perhaps the most shocking thing about Sunday’s election in Greece, which saw the left-wing Syriza Party emerge with the largest share of seats in parliament, was that something like this took so long to happen. After five years of austerity policies that have plunged much of the euro zone into a deep and grinding recession, parties on the far left and far right have been gaining popularity from the Atlantic to the Adriatic. With public anger rising, it was only a matter of time before one of them won enough votes to take power, and now it has happened. Syriza won a hundred and forty-nine seats in Greece’s parliament, just two short of a majority. On Monday, the party’s forty-year-old leader, Alexis Tsipras, was sworn in as the head of a coalition government that also includes a small right-wing nationalist party.","January 26, 2015","381","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/greece-election-syriza-party"
"During the election campaign, Tsipras promised to reverse budget-cutting measures and to renegotiate Greece’s huge debts, which, even now, after two bailouts orchestrated jointly by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, come to about a hundred and seventy-five per cent of G.D.P. On Sunday night, after the election result became clear, Tsipras hailed what he described as a historic mandate for change. “Greece will now move ahead with hope and reach out to Europe, and Europe is going to change,” he told a cheering crowd of supporters. “The verdict is clear. We will bring an end to the vicious circle of austerity.”","382","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/greece-election-syriza-party"
"","383","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/greece-election-syriza-party"
"What happens next is unclear. As a sovereign government, Tsipras’s administration will have the power to determine its own tax and spending policies. Right now, though, there appears to be little prospect that Greece’s foreign lenders will agree to reduce the country’s debt burden. In Berlin, a spokesman for Angela Merkel said that Germany would work with the new Greek government, but, he added, “We believe Greece has accepted terms that are not off the table after election day.” (Adding to the tension was the fact that Tsipras, in one of his first public acts as prime minister, laid flowers at a firing range where, in 1944, the Nazis executed two hundred Greeks from the Communist resistance movement.)","384","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/greece-election-syriza-party"
"Many people across Europe are hoping that Tsipras succeeds in ending austerity. Over the past five years, Greece has undergone an economic cataclysm that has seen its G.D.P. shrink by a fifth. One in four people is unemployed, and the child-poverty rate is forty per cent. This isn’t merely a recession; it is Greece’s own Great Depression. Elsewhere in the euro zone things aren’t quite that bad, but they’re still pretty dire, especially in countries on the southern periphery. In Spain, for instance, the unemployment rate is 23.7 per cent, not much lower than the rate in Greece. Throughout the euro zone as a whole, the jobless rate is 11.5 per cent, which is more than twice the rate in the United States.","385","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/greece-election-syriza-party"
"Syriza’s rise to power indicates the political dangers facing the euro zone as a whole if some way can’t be found to restore prosperity. Economic slumps, if they persist long enough, tend to generate political extremism: Europe’s history in the twentieth century provides blood-stained testimony to that fact. If the slumps are brought on by elected governments seeking to satisfy the demands of external debtors, the dangers only increase, as the Germans, above all people, should know.","386","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/greece-election-syriza-party"
"This isn’t the nineteen-twenties, of course, but the recent period of austerity policies couldn’t go on indefinitely without generating a populist backlash. Syriza is a protest movement—a coalition of communists, environmentalists, and trade unionists. In the 2007 general election, it got just five per cent of the vote; in 2012, its share of the vote rose to twenty-seven per cent; and on Sunday it got thirty-six per cent of the vote. In other European countries, a similar process is at work. According to some recent opinion polls, Podemos, a Spanish left-wing party that was founded less than a year ago, is now the country’s most popular party. Like Syriza, Podemos draws much of its strength from its opposition to the E.U. and the I.M.F.: last week, its thirty-six-year-old leader, Pablo Iglesias, flew to Athens for a big political rally with Tsipras.","387","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/greece-election-syriza-party"
"And it isn’t just left-wing parties that are gaining ground. In France, the anti-immigrant National Front is surging, with polls showing that its leader, Marine Le Pen, has far more support than President François Hollande, who is up for reëlection in 2017. In Italy, the conservative Northern League is making a comeback under an assertive new leader, Matteo Salvini, who has coupled opposition to immigration with criticism of the euro. Even in Germany, there are signs of polarization, with far right-wing groups recently staging a series of anti-Islamist rallies. The sight of Tsipras being sworn in will give fresh hope to all of these parties, and can only alarm representatives of more traditional parties that have toed the economic line laid down by Brussels and Berlin.","388","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/greece-election-syriza-party"
"Is there room for a compromise short of Greece leaving the euro zone, which is something Tsipras says he doesn’t want to happen? Perhaps. The current agreement between Greece and its lenders runs out at the end of February, but the government isn’t due to make any more debt payments until the summer. There is time yet to talk, and there is also some financial leeway. One of the ironies of the situation is that, strictly in financial terms, the two Greek bailouts—one was in 2010, the other in 2012—have proved pretty successful. After slashing spending more or less as demanded by the bailout agreements, the Greek government is now running a primary budget surplus, which means that, setting aside the interest payments on its debts, it is meeting its bills. This is the outcome that austerity policies are supposed to produce.","389","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/greece-election-syriza-party"
"Shouldn’t Greece be rewarded, then, for its efforts, with a new agreement that allows it to ease up on austerity policies, and that writes off some of its debts? In an article published before the election, Paul De Grauwe, a well-known professor at the London School of Economics who has previously advised the European Commission, pointed out that most international debt crises are eventually resolved through a mixture of austerity policies and debt write-downs. “The unilateral approach that has been taken in the Eurozone in which the debtors have been forced to bear the full weight of the adjustment almost always leads to a revolt of these debtors,” De Grauwe noted. “That is now underway in Greece. It can only be stopped if creditors dare to face this reality.”","390","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/greece-election-syriza-party"
"President Obama gave one of his strongest speeches on Saturday, in Selma, Alabama, on the fiftieth anniversary of “Bloody Sunday”—the day of the violently suppressed march that helped lead to the Voting Rights Act, the climactic achievement of the civil-rights movement. Standing in early-spring sunlight on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Obama praised the American spirit of striving and self-renewal embodied in the moral and physical courage of the marchers: “What greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this, what greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?”","March 10, 2015","391","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"

The speech was inspiring, at moments soaring, but, in a sense, the President didn’t need to give it. His presence on the bridge alongside Congressman John Lewis, who had walked at the forefront of the original march and taken the first blows from Alabama state troopers, was eloquence enough. Here was change—here was the picture of a nation, still imperfect, but more closely aligned with its highest ideals. Obama could have spoken as briefly as when Lincoln said, “The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.” Between Gettysburg and Selma there’s a straight line of history and ideas and sacrifice.","392","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"

"A week after Bloody Sunday, President Lyndon Johnson addressed a joint session of Congress, as well as seventy million Americans watching on television. He urged Congress to pass a voting-rights bill, the second piece of landmark civil-rights legislation in less than a year. It was the greatest speech of his Presidency, and one of the greatest by any President. “I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy,” Johnson began, and from there he kept raising his aim, comparing Selma to Lexington and Concord and Appomattox, to the great turning points in American history. “There is no Negro problem,” he said. “There is no Southern problem. There is no Northern problem. There is only an American problem. And we are met here tonight as Americans—not as Democrats or Republicans—we are met here as Americans to solve that problem.” Johnson said that if America won all its wars and doubled its wealth and journeyed to the stars but failed to solve this problem, “we will have failed as a people and a nation.” He declared that the scene before him gave hope in American democracy: “For the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great government—the government of the greatest nation on earth.”","394","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"

Or “the outraged conscience of a nation,” or “And we shall overcome.” Imagine a President addressing a joint session of Congress on an issue of such moment and framing it in such starkly moral terms, knowing that he could count on some solid support from the opposition leadership. Amid the cheers and applause, some senators and congressmen sat stone-faced, but no one shouted, “You lie!” Articles of impeachment were not drawn up. Southern committee chairmen didn’t invite George Wallace to come to Congress and rebut President Johnson, as Speaker Boehner recently invited a foreign leader to come embarrass President Obama.","395","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"
"As brutal as the Alabama state police and the Dallas County sheriff’s department were on Bloody Sunday, as violent as the vigilantes were who killed Jimmie Lee Jackson, James Reeb, and Viola Liuzzo in those weeks, as much progress as America has made in fifty years, something has gone seriously backward since 1965: the quality of American institutions. The flap over the historical accuracy of Johnson’s portrayal in the film “Selma” obscured this larger truth. “The real hero of this struggle is the American Negro,” Johnson told Congress, but the context for Selma was a country of functioning institutions. Martin Luther King, Jr.,’s desperate strategy was to dramatize white racism to such a degree that the institutions would have to respond.","396","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"

These days, Congress can hardly keep the Department of Homeland Security open without tearing itself to pieces.

The senators didn’t release classified U.S. intelligence on the nuclear negotiations, but it’s not altogether clear what stopped them. They’re doing all they can to sabotage their own country’s position in the talks, practically making themselves the de facto ally of hardliners in Tehran.

Perhaps that’s why, last Saturday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, President Obama spoke more about the daring spirit of the American people than the greatness of constitutional democracy. If solutions arise from this generation and the next, they seem unlikely to come from Washington.

But in recent years the New York Film Festival’s programming—especially since Kent Jones took over as festival director, in 2013—has become wider-ranging and more adventuresome. Meanwhile, other annual events, such as BAMcinemaFest, MOMA’s “Best Film Not Playing at a Theater Near You,” and the Tribeca Film Festival, have scooped up some of the year’s best unreleased films, leaving “Film Comment Selects” to rummage through the leftovers. Nonetheless, this year’s edition, Feb. 20-March 5, offers New York premières of some fascinating new films.","400","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/natural-selection-3"
"The Iranian director Rakhshan Bani-Etemad’s drama “Tales” (Feb. 20 and Feb. 22) fulfills the promise of its title. Stringing together a series of interlinked short films—which are less closely scrutinized by Iran’s censors than features are—Bani-Etemad sketches a broad array of characters in Tehran and the horrific maladies, misfortunes, and oppressions that they endure. In taxis and kitchens and doctors’ offices, she unfolds an extraordinary panorama of pain. Iran, in her view, is drowning in drug addiction, prostitution, and H.I.V. infection; antiquated sexual mores that distort romantic relations and marital bonds; arbitrary and repressive political laws that land dissenters in jail and get protesting students kicked out of school; cavalierly corrupt bureaucrats, who routinely humiliate petitioning citizens; domestic violence; police surveillance; and authorities who take advantage of sincere piety for personal gain.","401","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/natural-selection-3"
"Bani-Etemad’s curt style converges with her seething but seemingly whispered fury. One of her daring single-take scenes is set in a subway car, where a young hipsterish man and woman brazenly, even cheerfully set in motion a plot to kidnap the woman’s own sister, in order to extort money from her father, whom she despises. Another sequence, in which a predatory husband comes to a clinic to demand the release of his wife, whom he has grievously injured, takes place behind panes of frosted glass, as if Bani-Etemad were herself concealing the shame of his deeds. One character who recurs throughout is a documentary filmmaker who employs his own bold long-take methods, as in a scene in a bus filled with unemployed laborers risking arrest to protest the closing of their workplace. His compulsion to bear witness reflects Bani-Etemad’s own intentions.","402","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/natural-selection-3"
"Another highlight comes from the Chinese director Ann Hui. She gives the ironic title “The Golden Era” (March 1) to her oblique, dreamlike bio-pic of the writer and persecuted Communist Party activist Xiao Hong, who died of tuberculosis, at the age of thirty, in 1942. Hui depicts Xiao’s entire milieu of Communist writers under political siege. The whiff of the official Party hero pervades the story, which morphs into patriotic spectacle. Nonetheless, Hui captures the romantic aura of Xiao’s freethinking audacity and artistic vocation in poised, painterly shots that seem less like sites of action than like elusive memories. The images come fully to life through the power of language—Xiao’s own, and that of her friends and family, whose fictionalized documentary-style reminiscences punctuate the story. ♦","403","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/natural-selection-3"
"The news that Greece’s controversial finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has been shuffled out of negotiations with the country’s creditors, in favor of a team led by the deputy foreign minister Euclid Tsakalotos, evidently pleased the European financial markets: on Monday and Tuesday, stocks moved higher and yields on Greek bonds fell sharply. With the outspoken game theorist no longer participating in the talks, investors are betting that it will be easier for the two sides to reach a compromise that will prevent the government in Athens from going bust and crashing out of the euro zone.","April 28, 2015","404","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/sidelining-varoufakis-wont-solve-greeces-real-problem"
"In the short term, the move may well help. The Greek government is virtually out of cash, and relations between Varoufakis and his European counterparts had deteriorated to such an extent that his continued presence was a barrier to a deal to release the $7.2 billion in new loans pledged by the European Union back in February, contingent on an agreement for a Greek reform program. Kicking Varoufakis upstairs—he is staying on as finance minister, and will continue to oversee the negotiations—may well make it easier for both sides to make compromises.","405","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/sidelining-varoufakis-wont-solve-greeces-real-problem"
"In a lengthy television interview on Tuesday night, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras expressed confidence that a deal could be reached by May 9th, which is a few days before Greece is due to make a big payment to the International Monetary Fund. “Despite the difficulties, the possibilities to win in the negotiations are large,” he said. “We should not give in to panic moves.” Tsipras also ruled out calling a snap election, an option that has been mooted recently. But he did raise the possibility of holding a referendum if Greece was forced to accept terms that went outside Syriza’s anti-austerity mandate.","406","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/sidelining-varoufakis-wont-solve-greeces-real-problem"
"On the basis that neither side wants Greece to leave the euro zone, I’ve argued all along that some sort of deal would probably be reached at the eleventh hour. Reports from Athens suggest that it will consist of the Syriza government submitting legislation to enact some of the reforms that the European Union wants, such as the introduction of a uniform value-added tax and the privatization of state-owned assets like ports and airports. In return, the E.U. may let slip, for now, some of the other things it has been demanding, including changes to Greece’s pension system and labor laws.","407","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/sidelining-varoufakis-wont-solve-greeces-real-problem"
"But these issues won’t go away, and neither will Greece’s financial crisis. At this stage, indeed, the extended dispute over the $7.2 billion is starting to look like a sideshow. Come June, the two sides will have to reach a separate agreement on restructuring, or refinancing, the Greek government’s overall debts, which total about a hundred and seventy-five per cent of the country’s gross domestic product. Based on what we’ve seen during the past few months, the chances of those talks reaching a successful resolution are slight.","408","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/sidelining-varoufakis-wont-solve-greeces-real-problem"
"What is needed, most objective analysts agree, is a big write-down in Greece’s debts and a new policy regime that restores economic growth: that’s how almost all sovereign-debt crises get resolved. In this case, though, the 2010 bailout, which was revised in 2012, didn’t impose any write-down on Greece’s lenders, which were, primarily, large financial institutions. Designed by the troika—the E.U., the I.M.F., and the European Central Bank—the bailout “was about protecting German banks, but especially the French banks, from debt write-offs.” (That wasn’t Varoufakis speaking: it was Karl Otto Pöhl, a former president of the German central bank.) In addition to saddling Greece with an unsustainable debt burden, the troika obliged the government in Athens to slash spending and greatly reduce its ballooning budget deficit. It succeeded in those aims, but at great cost to the rest of the Greek economy. Between 2010 and 2014, the G.D.P. fell by about a fifth, and the unemployment rate rose to more than twenty-five per cent. The bailout caused a depression inside Greece.","409","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/sidelining-varoufakis-wont-solve-greeces-real-problem"
"To people who follow Greece closely, this story is familiar, but it bears repeating. Since taking over as finance minister, Varoufakis has at times engaged in wishful thinking, stonewalling, and self-dramatization. (On Sunday, he tweeted a quote from a 1936 speech by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, describing his political enemies as “unanimous in their hate for me; and I welcome their hatred.” Varoufakis added: “A quotation close to my heart (& reality) these days.”) But the arguments that Varoufakis has been making about Greece’s plight, and about the damaging impact of the austerity policies that accompanied the 2010 and 2012 bailouts, are incontrovertible.","410","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/sidelining-varoufakis-wont-solve-greeces-real-problem"
"Sadly, there is still no sign that the leaders of the E.U. are willing to acknowledge these truths, a problem that Athanasios Orphanides, an economist at M.I.T. who formerly served as the governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus, laid out very clearly earlier this year. Why are the Europeans being so stubborn? It’s not simply a matter of faulty economic analysis, although there’s some of that. The main problem is a political one. Having forced the other member countries that have received bailouts—Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus—to swallow the austerity medicine, the E.U.’s establishment (and many of its member governments) is loath to do anything that seems to give Greece, and particularly Syriza, a break. One way to avoid this difficulty might be to adopt an E.U.-wide policy designed to reduce indebtedness, such as the debt-buyback proposals contained in a new report from the London-based Center for Economic Progress. Bur rather than moving in this direction, policymakers in Brussels and Frankfurt are sticking to the pretense that Greece will eventually be able to repay all of its loans.","411","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/sidelining-varoufakis-wont-solve-greeces-real-problem"
"If this standoff continues, then, regardless of what happens over the next couple of weeks, it is probably only a matter of time before Greece defaults on some of its obligations. In that case, the choice would come down to defaulting and creating a new currency, or trying to default without leaving the euro zone. The first option would involve a good deal of short-term pain—limits on bank withdrawals, capital-exchange controls, and, possibly, a spike in inflation. In the long run, however, it could enable Greece to devalue its way out of recession and escape its debt trap. The second option would be complicated. In a new post at the Centre for Economic Policy Research’s policy portal, Charles Wyplosz, one of Europe’s leading economists, points out that much would depend on what the European Central Bank did. If it didn’t agree, in advance of the default, to continue to act as the lender of last resort, there would be a bank run in Greece, and, quite probably, a wholesale financial collapse.","412","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/sidelining-varoufakis-wont-solve-greeces-real-problem"

"Over the weekend, Cyclone Pam, one of the most severe tropical storms ever measured in the Southern Hemisphere, struck the small island nations of Tuvalu, Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, where it killed at least eleven people. Yesterday, speaking at the U.N. Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, in Sendai, Japan, Baldwin Lonsdale, the President of Vanuatu, called the storm a “monster.” He also warned that the climate in the region would remain volatile as long as global warming goes unchecked. “The cyclone seasons, the warm, the rain, all this is affected,” he said. “Yes, climate change is contributing to this.” No deaths have been reported in other countries, but, according to a press release issued by Tuvalu, nearly half of its population has been displaced.","March 18, 2015","414","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-wages-of-cyclone-pam"
"A few years ago, I spent nearly four weeks in Tuvalu, on assignment for Harper’s Magazine. I interviewed dozens of people there—the prime minister, local clergy, oceanographers, the guy who sold samosas near the airstrip—and they all spoke readily about climate change. It was the dominant fact of their lives. Most Tuvaluans are Evangelical Christians, and the Bible verse they quoted most frequently was Genesis 9:11, in which God makes a covenant with Noah: “Never shall there any more be a flood to destroy the Earth.” But this belief sat awkwardly next to the observable reality.","415","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-wages-of-cyclone-pam"
"Tuvalu has around ten thousand inhabitants, spread across nine atolls, most of them made of coral. Coral is porous, so as global temperatures rise and sea levels surge, saltwater bubbles up through the ground, tainting groundwater and killing crops. The Tuvaluans I met talked frankly about the rising seas—within forty years, they would tell me, or fifty years, or a hundred, all of this may be under water. Homeowners improvised seawalls out of sturdy rubbish, and were almost entirely dependent on rain-harvesting tanks for their drinking water. The average elevation in Tuvalu is about three feet above sea level, for now. If, as the National Research Council predicted in 2010, sea levels rise by two feet over the course of the next ninety years, then most of Tuvalu will be inundated within this century. And that doesn’t account for future storms.","416","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-wages-of-cyclone-pam"
"From afar, news reports of disasters such as Cyclone Pam can seem numbingly familiar: deaths are tolled, mourned, and then forgotten. But extreme-weather events in the South Pacific are part of a long-standing pattern. No storm as powerful as Cyclone Pam has yet hit Tuvalu as directly as Pam hit Vanuatu, but cyclones are endemic to the region, and, although they do not appear to be increasing in number, they are increasing in intensity. The threat of destruction—by the gradual encroachment of the tides, or by one cataclysmic wave—is ever-present. In recent years, more than a thousand Tuvaluans have fled for New Zealand, some claiming asylum as climate refugees. The majority have stayed, often with no clear plan in mind. Another Biblical passage I often heard quoted was Matthew 24:35–36: “Heaven and Earth shall pass away … but of that day and hour knoweth no man.”","417","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-wages-of-cyclone-pam"
"For years, political leaders from small Pacific Island states have asked the developed world to address climate change, or to be prepared to assist when disasters occur. On Wednesday, after returning to Vanuatu from the U.N. conference in Japan, Lonsdale told reporters, “We don’t want to be a nation that continues to beg for the dollars. But where there is a disaster beyond our capacity, beyond our financial means, then the whole world, whole international community should stand together as one.” Most of the island chains in the South Pacific first joined the community of nations as colonies of European empires and then, in the twentieth century, became sovereign states. More recently, trade with the West has brought in mopeds, satellite TV, junk food, and dialysis machines, and, more recently, initiatives like passport and Internet-domain sales. (As of last year, anyone with roughly three hundred thousand dollars could purchase Vanuatuan citizenship; Tuvalu continues to make money from the Web domain .tv.) Along with these opportunities has come increased awareness of globalization’s drawbacks, carbon emissions chief among them.","418","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-wages-of-cyclone-pam"
"Environmental activists often remind us that climate change affects us all. This is true, but it affects us differently, at different times. The island nations of the South Pacific have produced a negligible fraction of the carbon emissions leading to climate change, but they will be—in fact, they already are—among the initial victims of its effects. (To put it quasi-Biblically, the last shall be first.) Globalization might once have looked like a party that Vanuatu, Tuvalu, and other Pacific states were eager to attend. Now it has become increasingly clear that the party will be more destructive than anyone had anticipated, and that a few guests will be disproportionately stuck with the mess.","419","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-wages-of-cyclone-pam"
"There are so many people who consider Chris Christie a true friend, according to Chris Christie. This isn’t just a matter of love but of legality, because New Jersey’s ethics rules stipulate that the state’s governor has more leeway in accepting gifts from his personal friends than from, say, businessmen with an interest in the Port Authority, or from the king of a Middle Eastern country. Unless, that is, the governor is a guy like Christie, whom no mogul or monarch could resist. According to a report in the Times, when Christie was asked why King Abdullah of Jordan “picked up the tab” for a weekend getaway for the governor—and three of his children, his wife, her mother, his mother, and his stepfather—his office cited the true-friend rule. “King Abdullah invited the governor and his family to Jordan as his personal guest so the two families could spend time together,” a spokeswoman told the paper. They’d met at a dinner given by Mike Bloomberg, a detail that was somehow offered as proof that the relationship was real. The family time included a thirty-thousand-dollar bill at a Kempinski hotel and “a Champagne reception in the desert.”","February 3, 2015","420","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jersey-jordan-chris-christies-friendships"

"True friendship was also the reason Christie didn’t worry about going to football games with Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys. As I’ve written before, one of the puzzles in that story, as in this one, is whether Christie believes his own excuse—that his wealthy hosts take disinterested pleasure in his company—or is offering it cynically. The first suggests a delusional faith in his own charm (and that of his stepfather, mother-in-law, etc.), the other an openness to trading on his office. Neither is good, and both make him vulnerable.","422","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jersey-jordan-chris-christies-friendships"

"Friendship isn’t everything. Christie also signed an executive order that made it possible for interest groups and foreign governments to pay for him to go around the world, as a travelling advertisement for New Jersey. The vacation in Jordan came at the end of a junket to Israel—a trade mission—for which the many Christies flew on a plane owned by Sheldon Adelson, the gambling magnate who has spent millions on Republican candidates and is likely to do so again in 2016. (See Ryan Lizza for more on the Christie-Adelson relationship.) Part of that trip was paid for by a group called Choose NJ, which, the Times noted, “is financed by companies that are forbidden by pay-to-play laws to donate to the governor.” Its president is a neighbor of Christie’s. Choose NJ paid for a Christie trip this week, which is why his measles-abetting remarks about parental choice and vaccines were issued from the United Kingdom.

"All this is emerging during the rush for potential candidates to get commitments from big Republican donors, which turned into a free-for-all after Mitt Romney announced on Friday that he wouldn’t run. Earlier that day, Mark Halperin, of Bloomberg, reported that one factor Romney and his circle had considered was what they saw as Christie’s unsustainability: “Thanks to the 2012 veep vetting process, Romney became intimately familiar with some of the less publicized controversies from the New Jersey governor’s past, and believes that several of those flaps would mushroom so broadly that Christie soon would be eliminated from consideration by voters and donors.” There was a similar message in “Double Down,” the book that Halperin wrote with John Heilemann. Still, Romney and Christie had dinner Friday night. Whatever doubts Romney may have about Christie, he apparently doesn’t want to help Jeb Bush.

If it’s Clinton vs. Christie, there will be private planes spotted in all directions. If it’s Clinton vs. Bush, there will be no dodging of dynasts. We may be looking forward to a campaign defined by operatives leaking duelling flight manifestos, questionable consulting agreements, and intemperate statements by former Presidents turned campaign surrogates.

"The Passover Haggadah, the short book of hymns, chronicles, and liturgical practices whose reading constitutes the traditional Seder, is thought to have been compiled as early as the second century—around the time the Talmud was compiled, just when rabbinic Judaism as we know it was emerging, a rival to Jewish followers of Jesus in coming to terms with the catastrophe of exile. The Haggadah is thus a book immanently at odds with itself: committed to the principle of emancipation—“from slavery to freedom”—and to symbolic rituals that celebrate deliverance, yet also replete with what Arthur Koestler once called “claustrophilia”—a commitment to self-segregating ancestral commandments and barely repressed rabbinic defensiveness and rage.","April 3, 2015","427","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/this-year-in-jerusalem"
"","428","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/this-year-in-jerusalem"
"At the opening of the Seder, the leader holds up a piece of matza, unleavened bread, and speaks in ancient Aramaic, “This is the bread of affliction that our fathers ate in the land of Egypt. Whoever is hungry, let him come and eat; whoever is in need, let him come and conduct the Seder of Passover. This year [we are] here; next year in the land of Israel. This year [we are] slaves; next year [we will be] free people.” It is easy enough to imagine that for exiled, haunted Jews still living under Roman rule, the “land of Israel” was still a formative place, kept in the collective memory—and initiating yearly Seders helped to memorialize it. But, by the time the Haggadah was itself formative—certainly by the early Middle Ages, when anti-Jewish massacres had become common in Christian lands—the “land of Israel” seemed less a geographical fact than a place of messianic hope.","429","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/this-year-in-jerusalem"
"So the Haggadah also reflects the sense of grief, helplessness—and craving for retaliation—that many rabbis cultivated over the centuries. The divine, not any political figure (Moses, strangely, is hardly mentioned), liberated His chosen “with a strong hand and an outstretched arm.” Early rabbis are quoted revelling, with a unself-conscious pathos, in plagues inflicted on the Egyptians, magnifying oppressors’ suffering like a wounded boy fantasizing about what his father should do to a bully. Rabbi Eliezer hypothesizes that the ten plagues were actually forty, because each plague was delivered with attitude: “ ‘Fury’ is one; ‘indignation’ makes two; ‘trouble’ makes three; ‘discharge of messengers of evil’ makes four.” These forty, plus the notional two hundred plagues inflicted at the Red Sea, make two hundred and forty. Rabbi Akiva then trumps Rabbi Eliezer, reckoning along similar lines that the plagues actually numbered two hundred and fifty. In every generation, the Haggadah exhorts us to sing, unnamed forces “rise against us to annihilate us.”","430","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/this-year-in-jerusalem"
"If there was always this tension in the traditional Haggadah—between valorizing what must be done to liberate all people in need and valorizing what must be done to liberate Jews as a particular people—this hardly mattered in the diaspora, where the Haggadah was composed and for which it was intended. The tension was alleviated, if not resolved, by an implicit knowledge that Jews were the outsiders—so that doing what prevented their persecution, or advanced their civic interests, also advanced social tolerance and the formation of civil society more generally. This is not the way the Haggadah reads today, however: the tension is more palpable and vexing for Israelis—and, increasingly, for American Jews. When you have the military or police power to act against others, or the political power to oppose others, you don’t have the arguable luxury of assuming Jewish interests to be coincident with those of every oppressed person. (As if to prove this point as grotesquely as possible, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government—of all weeks, just before Passover—began the forced expulsion of many hundreds of the forty thousand of Eritrean and Sudanese refugees who had crossed the Sinai to find asylum in Israel.)","431","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/this-year-in-jerusalem"
"Today, the land of Israel is not something poetic and hypothetical, nor is the survival imperative inherently free of bigotry or the hunger for revenge harmless. The last point seems particularly urgent this day of the Seder, the day after the announcement of the great power agreement with Iran; Israelis and American Jews will find it impossible to read the Haggadah tonight without thinking about the deal’s implications. It is worth observing that, already, Netanyahu is denouncing the deal as “threaten[ing] the survival of the state of Israel.” And his view is widely echoed in Israel, including by otherwise balanced observers like Ari Shavit, who argued yesterday in Haaretz that the Lausanne talks were something like Munich all over again; that economic sanctions on Iran should rather have been intensified until “Iran’s nuclear capability was entirely sterilized.”","432","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/this-year-in-jerusalem"
"Hyperbole of this kind is safely conformist in today’s Israel—also among Jews supporting AIPAC in America. Its champions view themselves as stiffening spines against foes who, the Haggadah didn’t need to remind us, are real. Yet it is hard to hear the talk without thinking tonight of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva, cowering and in mourning, defaulting to a frame of mind in which the only response to Jew-hatred is multiplied plagues. If this is Munich, then the alternative, as President Obama justly observed, is “another Mideast war.” But would war, or even the threat of war, really force Iran’s most authoritarian leaders to back down—or would it entrench them? Would increased sanctions really weaken Iranian hardliners as much as the integration of the country’s isolated, restless entrepreneurs and professionals into the global system? Rabbi Akiva, the Haggadah doesn’t bother reminding us, also inspired, early in the second century, the catastrophic Bar Kochba wars.","433","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/this-year-in-jerusalem"
"At tonight’s Seder, I would suggest that the cautionary words of Thucydides, who predated the Haggadah by six hundred years, be added to Rabbi Eliezer’s and Rabbi Akiva’s imaginings of plagues. “A moderate attitude,” he lamented in his “History of The Peloponnesian War,” “was deemed a mere shield for lack of virility, and a reasoned understanding with regard to all sides of an issue meant that one was indolent and of no use for anything.” He added, dismissively, “One who displayed violent anger was considered eternally faithful.” The Haggadah supposes that, in every generation, we should imagine that we ourselves stood at Sinai and assumed the burdens of law. We should imagine that we stood also at Amphipolis, and assumed the awkwardness of moderation.","434","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/this-year-in-jerusalem"

"Attention turned to President Dwight Eisenhower, and to his Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, who was known for his stern views on Communist ideology and used the provocative word “liberation” in connection with Eastern Europe. What Dulles and others said publicly, though, was not exactly what they said behind their office doors. There, the emphasis was less on confrontation and more on how to phrase another numbingly repetitive diplomatic note. In late October, 1956, Dulles telephoned Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., the American ambassador to the United Nations, and said that he was disturbed by “clear evidence of considerable Soviet military activity in the area,” but suggested only that the question be brought before the U.N. Security Council. Dulles seemed equally concerned about how America’s passive response would look to others. “From a political standpoint,” he remarked, “it will be said that here are the great moments and when they came and these fellows were ready to stand up and die, we were caught napping and doing nothing.” The next day, when Vice-President Richard Nixon’s office called for advice on what to say, Dulles was particularly cautious: Nixon could certainly “refer to love of country and individual freedom surviving and bursting forth and today the whole area of Soviet satellites is a seething mass and one can look forward hopefully to when national independence and liberties will be restored,” he said, according to notes taken by his secretary.

"All this is a way of getting to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who conducted official business (though not, she says, classified business) on a private e-mail account with a personal server, using a personal, almost clubby address (hdr22@clintonemail.com). She decided to delete more than thirty thousand e-mails—about as many as she saved—because she judged them to be irrelevant to her work or “my private, personal e-mails,” as she put it at a press conference last week. “For any government employee, it is that government employee’s responsibility to determine what’s personal and what’s work related,” Clinton said. “I went above and beyond what I was requested to do.” That interpretation led one NARA employee to tell me, with something of an archivist’s passion, “Anytime a government official takes it upon themselves to edit their own communications, good government ceases to exist.”","440","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillary-clinton-and-the-historians"
"Keeping track of electronic records has been confusing, and a little overwhelming. Alexander Stille, in his 2002 book “The Future of the Past,” noted that it took the National Archives two and a half years and its entire electronic-records staff “just to make a secure copy of all the electronic records of the Reagan White House.” Adam Mazmanian, a young tech journalist, recently cited a report by the Office of Inspector General that State Department employees in 2011 created about sixty-one thousand so-called “record e-mails,” properly preserved for history, out of about a billion—that’s not a typo—sent. The law has had to hurry to keep up. It may have been perfectly legal to do what Clinton did. But Clinton seemed too untroubled by her role as judge and jury of what’s personal, without acknowledging that the personal is sometimes inseparable from the historic. On a small scale, Eisenhower’s advice to his grandson, David—for instance, a suggestion that he not gobble his food—reveals something interesting about Ike, who had stomach problems for most of his life. That advice can be found in the Eisenhower Library, in Abilene, Kansas. The remarkable diaries kept by Ike’s personal secretary, Ann C. Whitman, include a painful, very personal conversation in which the President told the Republican National Committee chairman to tell Nixon that he was being dumped from the ticket in 1956—but to tell him “very, very gently.”","441","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillary-clinton-and-the-historians"
"But if the law had not been perfectly clear while Clinton was in office, the State Department nonetheless urged officials using personal accounts to be sure that that “federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.” That appropriate system is NARA, the archives where our nation’s official past—with all its peculiarities, embarrassments, compelling personalities, and surprises—is kept and studied. If something as transitory as an e-mail is gone, it’s gone for good, and with it a piece of our shared history.","442","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillary-clinton-and-the-historians"
"Those who don’t like Clinton have used all this as a way to bludgeon her on familiar grounds—her reflexive secrecy, her answers that leave us with more questions. In the overwrought language of Presidential politics, some have tried to evoke the Watergate era by suggesting the cover-up of some unspecified deed and even raising the possibility of obstruction of justice. But that’s not very likely; rather, it is in the obstruction of history, the deletion of America’s past, intentional or not, where permanent damage is likely to occur.","443","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillary-clinton-and-the-historians"
"Last week, Boris Mezdrich, the executive director of Novosibirsk State Academy Opera and Ballet Theatre, the largest opera theatre in Russia, was fired by the Ministry of Culture “for unwillingness to take social values into account in his work, for disrespect for citizens’ opinions, and for failure to fulfill the founder’s recommendations.” Mezdrich’s transgression was his theatre’s production of Richard Wagner’s “Tannhauser,” conceived and directed by Timofey Kuliabin, which appeared offensive to local Orthodox Christian activists. The head of the Novosibirsk diocese, who had not seen the opera, claimed in a letter to the local prosecutor’s office that the production violated laws against offending the feelings of religious believers and inciting religious discord, but a justice’s court in Novosibirsk found nothing wrong with the production. Then the Ministry of Culture stepped in and organized what they described as public hearings, in which prominent clergy members, cultural figures, and ministry officials condemned Kuliabin’s interpretation of the opera. None of the participants mentioned the orchestra, the performers, or the sets.

"The Novosibirsk “Tannhauser” imagines Wagner’s hero, a minstrel who vacillates between Venus and the Church, as a contemporary film director who makes a movie about Jesus Christ. The production speaks directly to the clash between art and the commerce of art festivals; there are clear parallels to the director Lars von Trier and his controversial conduct. The production’s opening-night performance, in December, was met by a full house and a standing ovation. Some of the most prominent opera critics in Russia praised the production; one predicted that Novosibirsk would become a “site of pilgrimage” for the world’s opera lovers.","446","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-new-russian-censors"

The poster appeared on stage for just a few seconds, and after objections emerged, in March, it was covered with a gray cloth. This was not enough for the Ministry of Culture, which demanded that “necessary changes” be made to the production and that the director “convey public apologies to all those whose religious feelings were offended.” Mezdrich refused, and was fired. One of his most zealous persecutors, a fellow theatre director named Vladimir Kekhman, had called the production “blasphemous” and “a demonstration of inner ungodliness.” The Ministry of Culture rewarded Kekhman by appointing him as Mezdrich’s replacement.","447","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-new-russian-censors"
"During Putin’s first decade in power, he focussed largely on consolidating control of the legislature, political parties, national TV networks, and other entities that could conceivably threaten his authority, but since his return to the Presidency, in 2012, the Kremlin has cracked down on individual civil liberties. More recently, artistic expression has become a target of what the Russian theatre critic Marina Davydova has called a “total conservative revolution.” The Orthodox Church has been an active participant (and possibly an instigator) of several notable persecutions of artists, including the Pussy Riot trial and the campaign against the film “Leviathan.”","448","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-new-russian-censors"
"The day after Mezdrich’s dismissal, Magomedsalam Magomedov, the deputy head of the Kremlin Administration, proposed that theatrical productions be subject to “inspections” before they are presented to the public. Though Magomedov did not use the word “censorship” (which is explicitly prohibited by the Russian constitution), this would represent a return to the Soviet system of preliminary censorship, in which no work of literature, theatre, or film could appear without the approval of government censors. Writers who would not adjust to the state’s ideological constraints were forced to write v stol—“into the desk,” not for publication. Theatre and film directors had to submit their work to repertkom (repertory commissions) and khudsovet (artistic councils), and either make the cuts and changes these censors demanded or see their work barred from distribution (the term for that was “put on the shelf”).","449","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-new-russian-censors"
"In fact, the latest government guidelines for controlling the cultural realm sound somewhat similar to those of the Soviet era. According to “Foundations of the State Cultural Policy,” a document produced by the Ministry of Culture and signed last year by Putin, the purpose of these policies includes the “consolidation of the unity of Russian society,” “creating conditions for educating citizens,” and “transmission, from one generation to the next, of the values and norms, traditions, customs, and models of behavior traditional to Russian civilization.” Ministry officials and loyalists now cite this document as the ultimate truth. During the so-called public hearings on the “Tannhauser” production, one of the many objections was its failure to comply with the “Foundations.”","450","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-new-russian-censors"
"Unlike their Soviet predecessors, who relied on strictly atheistic Marxist-Leninist doctrine to identify unwelcome works of art, the current proponents of cultural propriety emphasize the “special role of Orthodox Christianity” in the Russian “system of values,” in the words of the “Foundations.” This makes little practical difference. What the current authorities share with the Soviet ideological masters is the sense that intellectual and creative freedom are a threat to the absolute political power of the government. Today, just as in the nineteen-seventies and eighties, innovative and provocative art is seen as political disloyalty. And, just as it was then, an artist who is willing to make public demonstrations of political allegiance and to defame less coöperative peers stands to gain in career opportunities.","451","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-new-russian-censors"
"It’s no secret that the years since the Great Recession have been hard on American workers. Though unemployment has finally dipped below six per cent, real wages for most have barely budged since 2007. Indeed, the whole century so far has been tough: wages haven’t grown much since 2000. So it was big news when, last month, Aetna’s C.E.O., Mark Bertolini, announced that the company’s lowest-paid workers would get a substantial raise—from twelve to sixteen dollars an hour, in some cases—as well as improved medical coverage. Bertolini didn’t stop there. He said that it was not “fair” for employees of a Fortune 50 company to be struggling to make ends meet. He explicitly linked the decision to the broader debate about inequality, mentioning that he had given copies of Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-first Century” to all his top executives. “Companies are not just money-making machines,” he told me last week. “For the good of the social order, these are the kinds of investments we should be willing to make.”","452","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/fair-days-wage"
"Such rhetoric harks back to an earlier era in U.S. labor relations. These days, most of the benefits of economic growth go to people at the top of the income ladder. But in the postwar era, in particular, the wage-setting process was shaped by norms of fairness and internal equity. These norms were bolstered by the strength of the U.S. labor movement, which emphasized the idea of the “living” or “family” wage—that someone doing a full day’s work should be paid enough to live on. But they were embraced by many in the business class, too. Economists are typically skeptical that these kinds of norms play any role in setting wages. If you want to know why wages grew fast in the nineteen-fifties, they would say, look to the economic boom and an American workforce that didn’t have to compete with foreign workers. But this is too narrow a view: the fact that the benefits of economic growth in the postwar era were widely shared had a lot to do with the assumption that companies were responsible not only to their shareholders but also to their workers. That’s why someone like Peter Drucker, the dean of management theorists, could argue that no company’s C.E.O. should be paid more than twenty times what its average employee earned.","453","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/fair-days-wage"
"That’s not to imply that there aren’t solid business reasons for paying workers more. A substantial body of research suggests that it can make sense to pay above-market wages—economists call them “efficiency wages.” If you pay people better, they are more likely to stay, which saves money; job turnover was costing Aetna a hundred and twenty million dollars a year. Better-paid employees tend to work harder, too. The most famous example in business history is Henry Ford’s decision, in 1914, to start paying his workers the then handsome sum of five dollars a day. Working on the Model T assembly line was an unpleasant job. Workers had been quitting in huge numbers or simply not showing up for work. Once Ford started paying better, job turnover and absenteeism plummeted, and productivity and profits rose.","454","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/fair-days-wage"
"Subsequent research has borne out the wisdom of Ford’s approach. As the authors of a just published study of pay and performance in a hotel chain wrote, “Increases in wages do, in fact, pay for themselves.” Zeynep Ton, a business-school professor at M.I.T., shows in her recent book, “The Good Jobs Strategy,” that one of the reasons retailers like Trader Joe’s and Costco have flourished is that, instead of relentlessly cost-cutting, they pay their employees relatively well, invest heavily in training them, and design their operations to encourage employee initiative. Their upfront labor costs may be higher, but, as Ton told me, “these companies end up with motivated, capable workers, better service, and increased sales.” Bertolini—who, as it happens, once worked on a Ford rear-axle assembly line—makes a similar argument. “It’s hard for people to be fully engaged with customers when they’re worrying about how to put food on the table,” he told me. “So I don’t buy the idea that paying people well means sacrificing short-term earnings.”","455","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/fair-days-wage"
"That hardly seems like a radical position. But it certainly makes Bertolini an outlier in today’s corporate America. Since the nineteen-seventies, a combination of market forces, declining union strength, and ideological changes has led to what the economist Alan Krueger has described as a steady “erosion of the norms, institutions and practices that maintain fairness in the U.S. job market.” As a result, while companies these days tend to pay lavishly for talent on the high end—Bertolini made eight million dollars in 2013—they tend to treat frontline workers as disposable commodities.","456","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/fair-days-wage"
"This isn’t because companies are having trouble making money: corporate America, if not the rest of the economy, has done just fine over the past five years. It’s that all the rewards went into profits and executive salaries, rather than wages. That arrangement is the result not of some inevitable market logic but of a corporate ethos that says companies should pay workers as little as they can, and no more. This is what Bertolini seems to be challenging. His move may well turn out to be merely a one-off, rather than a harbinger of bigger change. But inequality and the shrinking middle class have become abiding preoccupations on Main Street and in Washington. It’s only fair that these concerns have finally reached the executive suite. ♦","457","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/fair-days-wage"

Come Opening Day, however, the Cubs shuttled Bryant back to the Iowa Cubs, their AAA affiliate, rather than to the dugout at Wrigley Field. Many fans blasted the Cubs front office for the move.

"“Opening Day is an unusual game with extra attention and extra anxiety; even veterans don’t feel normal or comfortable during the opener,” Epstein said. “The opposing team throws its best starting pitcher on Opening Day.

"However, many in baseball saw the move as merely being about what was best for the Cubs’ bottom line. The issue hinges on “service time,” or how much time a player spends at the major-league level. There is a significant pay jump for players between the minor leagues and the majors, but service time can also have an impact on how long a team contractually controls an individual player. According to the collective-bargaining agreement between M.L.B. and the players association, a player needs to be in the major leagues for a hundred and seventy-two days out of the hundred-and-eighty-three-day season in order to be credited with a full year of service. But if a team keeps a player in the minors for the first eleven days of the season, the front office keeps that player’s rights for an additional year before he becomes a free agent.

"The more likely focus of the 2016 negotiations will be on player salaries, including whether to institute a pay cap, which other sports leagues have implemented in various forms. Proponents of pay caps say that they can help curb over-all costs and prevent wealthy teams from soaking up high-priced talent. Opponents have argued that caps are ineffective, and that instituting one in baseball could shortchange the players. Even though player salaries have grown along with the league’s revenues in recent years, the over-all share of that revenue going to players has decreased from more than half, in the mid-nineteen-nineties, to less than forty per cent today.

"Dwight D. Eisenhower was in the White House in April, 1955, when Jonas E. Salk’s new polio vaccine was pronounced safe, effective, and potent. Eisenhower never doubted it; he never said, “I’m not a scientist, and so …” Rather, he was someone who talked with scientists, understood what they were saying, and supported those who wanted to bring sense and order to a nationwide inoculation program that was greeted with enormous relief, but also, quite naturally, some apprehension. At a press conference that month (Ike met with the press almost every week), he was asked what role the federal government should play.","474","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ike-trusted-new-vaccine"
"“I believe very greatly in the power that can be developed by the humanitarian agencies of this country when they work together in coöperation,” the President replied. “And if they have the direction which is to be given them through the Advisory Committee set up in [the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare], I believe that we will get the most rapid possible distribution of this vaccine.”","475","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ike-trusted-new-vaccine"
"Sixty years ago, the idea that the federal government might launch a giant program to vaccinate millions of people—for their own protection, and not least to protect others from infection—seemed the height of rationality, an understanding that the best medicine is preventive medicine. This view prevailed despite a truly ghastly mistake in the early days of the program, during the Salk vaccine’s first trial, with 1.8 million children. Licenses to produce the vaccine had been granted with great speed to five pharmaceutical firms, but one of them, Cutter Laboratories, of Berkeley, California, had been careless. Cutter produced a vaccine that contained live polio virus, an error that directly led to five deaths and fifty-one cases of permanent paralysis, and that in turn led to a small epidemic: the Cutter group’s infection spread to friends and neighbors; five more died and more than a hundred family members or neighbors were paralyzed. Recounting this in the New England Journal of Medicine, in 2005, Dr. Paul A. Offit, who later wrote a book about the Cutter incident and its aftermath, described how, despite what he rightly called “one of the worst pharmaceutical disasters in U.S. history,” the program continued, first with the Salk vaccine and then with an effective oral vaccine developed by a medical rival, Albert Sabin.","476","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ike-trusted-new-vaccine"
"But there was very little posturing from the Democratic Congress about the Cutter incident. A House of Representatives committee said that it would look into the Administration’s handling of the program and safety; there were calls for Oveta Culp Hobby, the H.E.W. secretary, to resign. Eisenhower, whose temperament was the opposite of panicky, held a press conference in early May and said that he expected to see a report “covering every single detail, factual and planning detail, of the whole matter. As quickly as I get it, I will make it available to the public.” But the program was in no danger of stopping, and money wasn’t going to get in the way. “I want to emphasize again that the matter of inability to pay is never going to have the slightest thing to do with this, and that it is going to be distributed equitably to every state in the union,” the President said.","477","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ike-trusted-new-vaccine"
"Still, no one could guarantee that the vaccine was absolutely safe; Offit pointed out that the licensing procedure took just two and a half hours. (The process today is, needless to say, far more extensive.) But if anyone doubted what Salk and Sabin and all who came before them had achieved, the statistics were persuasive: the number of polio cases dropped from thirty-eight thousand, in 1954, to twenty-nine thousand, in 1955—and, a year later, to fifteen thousand. Since then, polio has pretty much been wiped out in the United States and most of the world. So have what were once fairly common “childhood diseases”—measles, mumps, and rubella, among others. Or so it was thought.","478","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ike-trusted-new-vaccine"
"Measles and the rest, although they can cause death and misery, never did the damage that polio did, which may be why it’s so easy for some public figures to dilate so irresponsibly on the subject. Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey and world traveller, visited a vaccine laboratory in Cambridge, England, the other day and said that there should be some “some measure of choice” as to whether shots for measles and other diseases should be mandatory—in other words, let your infectious children roam at will. Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator and a doctor, went on a couple of television programs and said that most vaccines should be voluntary, to help avoid the risk of “many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.”","479","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ike-trusted-new-vaccine"
"Christie and Paul, perhaps because they want to be taken seriously as Presidential candidates, are already backing off, if only a little. (Paul said that he was not asserting causality, just a “temporal association.”) They may have realized that they were sounding a bit like the former Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann, who, after a 2012 Republican debate, expressed her view of the HPV vaccine, which offers protection against cervical cancer, when she said, “There’s a woman who came up crying to me. … She said her daughter was given that vaccine. She told me her daughter suffered mental retardation as a result. There are very dangerous consequences.” This view remains dangerously persistent.","480","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ike-trusted-new-vaccine"
"It was, therefore, something of a relief to hear a party leader like the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, emphatically reject any sort of Bachmannism. As a two-year-old, in the nineteen-forties, McConnell had polio, and was unable to walk until he was five. As he grew older, he saw the disease disappear. “As a victim of polio myself, I’m a big fan of vaccinations, and if I were a parent who had a child … being subject to getting any particular disease, I would come down on the side of vaccinations,” he said. There, that wasn’t so hard! Like any injection, even an injection of reality, it will just hurt for a second.","481","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ike-trusted-new-vaccine"

"Every first-year law student learns about the principle of “standing” in civil-procedure class. Under Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts are only allowed to hear “cases” and “controversies.” For decades, the Supreme Court has interpreted those words to mean that plaintiffs must be able to show an “injury in fact” from a law in order to have the right to bring a case challenging the law.","484","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chief-justice-john-roberts-save-affordable-care-act"
"For many years, liberals who have tried to bring federal cases to challenge government actions—in areas from the environment to welfare rights—have been thwarted by conservatives wielding the standing doctrine as a way to throw these cases out of court. During the George H. W. Bush Administration, a coalition of environmental and conservation groups sued to stop new federal regulations that limited the application of a section of the Endangered Species Act. Chief Justice Roberts, then the Deputy Solicitor General, persuaded the Supreme Court to throw out the case because the plaintiffs would not suffer direct harm from the new regulations and lacked standing to bring the case. In Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, the court held that a “generally available grievance about government—claiming only harm to his and every citizen’s interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large—does not state an Article III case or controversy.”","485","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chief-justice-john-roberts-save-affordable-care-act"
"All of which leads to the case now before the Supreme Court, King v. Burwell, which is to be argued on March 4th. The case, which was expressly devised to take down the Affordable Care Act, centers on a provision that gives individuals who fall within a certain income threshold—roughly above poverty but below wealth—tax subsidies to pay for health insurance. The case is based on the claim that the Obama Administration policy of allowing those who received tax subsidies to buy insurance on the federal exchanges—which cover the thirty-four states that don’t have state-run exchanges—violates the terms of the Affordable Care Act itself. If the plaintiffs succeed in making their case, eight million people are estimated to lose their health insurance, and the A.C.A. itself could subsequently unravel.","486","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chief-justice-john-roberts-save-affordable-care-act"
"But the King case, like any case, can only proceed if the plaintiffs have standing—that is, if they can claim an “injury in fact” from the Obamacare law. Thanks to two recent, excellent pieces of journalism, in Mother Jones and the Wall Street Journal, we now know a great deal about the four plaintiffs. Two are veterans of the Armed Forces and can receive health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs; accordingly, they have no reason to seek the tax subsidies under the law. The other two plaintiffs may make too little money to qualify for the tax subsidies, and, furthermore, one who claimed to be a Virginia resident listed a motel that prohibits long-term stays as her address. In short, the provisions of the Affordable Care Act in question in King v. Burwell may be irrelevant to all four plaintiffs—which would mean that they lack standing to challenge it.","487","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chief-justice-john-roberts-save-affordable-care-act"
"The Obama Administration did not raise the standing issue in its brief to the Supreme Court in King v. Burwell. However, the standing issue is “jurisdictional,” which means that plaintiffs must always prove standing, whether the defendants raise the issue or not. The Justices can always take it upon themselves to investigate the record in the case to determine whether the plaintiffs have standing, and even as late as days before the argument, Administration lawyers can write a letter to the court calling attention to the issue of the plaintiffs’ questionable standing. If the Justices ask questions about standing at the oral argument next month, it’s a good clue that a dismissal of the case on standing grounds is at least a possibility.","488","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chief-justice-john-roberts-save-affordable-care-act"
"Of course, a dismissal of the case because the plaintiffs lack standing would not settle the legal issue of whether the tax subsidies are legal in the thirty-four states. Presumably, another lawsuit could proceed with more appropriate plaintiffs. But, in and out of government, lawyers are taught to believe that a win is a win. If lawyers for the Obama Administration can keep the A.C.A. alive, even temporarily, through the procedural device of standing, then they will be more than pleased to do so.","489","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chief-justice-john-roberts-save-affordable-care-act"

"Sex, drugs, and rock and roll. In the sixties and seventies, even the most staid corporate types yearned to turn on, tune in, and drop out, and no one escaped the wry pens of the New Yorker cartoonists. A bemused woman hears the answering machine of her spiritual guide in Eldon Dedini’s 1967 cartoon. In George Booth’s edgy cartoon from 1970, a writer is so caught up in his own creative process that his wife, on the edge of madness from her husband’s self-absorption, pitches him an idea that reveals her homicidal rage. The spiritual and creative aspirations of the decade rub up against more mundane realities: a snazzily dressed gentleman at a cocktail party is just a letch in Charles Saxon’s drawing from 1972, and George Price’s dentist asks a hippie which numbing agent is his “bag.” If we find the right chemical combination, we might be make it to the next decade.","491","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/new-yorkers-ninetieth-cartoons-1965-1975"
"The state of the union is “strong,” President Obama declared last night, and so, it turns out, was the State of the Union address. Tuesday’s speech looked hale and fit, weighing in at around sixty-five hundred words and almost exactly sixty minutes and lifting members of Congress out of their seats like a speech half its age (two hundred and twenty-five years). This might come as a surprise; just last week, Politico accused the President of “killing” the speech by rolling out pieces of it in the days and weeks beforehand. Obama’s “SOTU Spoilers,” as the White House insisted on calling them, were said, by other commentators, to have “robbed the event of suspense.” (The White House delivered the ultimate spoiler when, minutes before the speech, it released the full text on the Web site Medium.)","January 21, 2015","492","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"Never mind that the State of the Union usually has all the drama of the Queen’s annual Christmas message. Arguably, the spoilers—which included steps to normalize relations with Cuba and a proposal to finance middle-class tax cuts by raising capital-gains and inheritance taxes—kept President Obama and the speech at center stage over the past month, displacing the new Republican Congress. Of course, the Nielsen ratings, which will be released today, might show a further decline in viewership of the State of the Union; last year’s audience of 33.3 million was less than two-thirds that of Obama’s first address to Congress, in 2009. If so, it isn’t Obama’s fault so much as your own. The narrowing of the national attention span has not been kind to long speeches. Besides, the only proven way to gin up interest in the State of the Union is to gin up a preëmptive war in the Middle East, which is the approach that George W. Bush took in 2003. That year’s speech, which preceded the invasion of Iraq by several weeks, attracted sixty-two million viewers, the largest audience since 1993. Mission accomplished!","493","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"Since most of President Obama’s initiatives were already familiar, the most notable aspect of Tuesday’s address was his tone: upbeat, unapologetic. Obama did not sound like a man whose party had just lost the Senate. (Senator Harry Reid, however, looked like that man.) Nor did he appear at all prepared to accept the limits that Republicans want to place on his Presidency. Last night, Obama had the punchy, self-assured air of a President on a roll, freed of old encumbrances (a narrow, nervous Democratic majority in the Senate) and buoyed by both a big jump in his approval ratings and, most important, a growing economy. “We have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth,” he said.","494","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"In recent months, as job creation has heated up, some Democrats have warned the President against this kind of ebullience. “People are in trouble,” the political strategist Stan Greenberg told the Times, after reportedly saying the same thing to David Simas, the White House political director. Indeed, many are, as Obama acknowledged last night. “Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?” he asked. His legislative agenda—for example, his sixty-billion-dollar plan to make community college free for most students—shows his refusal to accept that reality, and aims squarely at the problem of income inequality. At the same time, Obama was unrestrained in his discussion of America’s economic progress—and the role that he has played in it. “At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,” the President said. “Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health-care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.” Here he paused, savored these statistics, then ad-libbed: “This is good news, people.” A wink, a smile, a sideways glance. This is a man who is pleased with himself.","495","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"For Obama, this constitutes a meaningful shift. Long constrained by his own overcautiousness, he has, for several months now, been parting by degrees with his reluctance to talk about economic growth and job gains. As recently as April, in a speech about the minimum wage, he offered no indication that the economy was improving, except to say—a bit accusingly—that “those at the top are doing better than ever.” By summer, as the midterm elections approached, he had warmed to saying that, “by almost every measure, we are better off now than we were when I took office.” Last night’s address featured his most full-throated expression of satisfaction about the recovery yet. He has, in his phrase of choice, “turned the page.”","496","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"The reason this matters is that it’s not, in the end, only about taking credit; it’s about credibility. President Obama won’t have much of the latter unless he claims more of the former. By reminding Americans how far the nation has come since the financial crisis of 2008, and what it took to get here, Obama can create at least a little more public confidence in his plans for the rest of his time in office. Of course, that doesn’t mean he’ll have much success getting his agenda through Congress. But, if he sticks to his own story, and tells it repeatedly, he might have at least a fighting chance of winning an argument with the G.O.P. over, say, what elements to include in a tax-reform deal, or which party can, in 2016, be trusted with the hopes of middle-class Americans.

"In 2004, when Danny Meyer opened a burger stand named Shake Shack in Madison Square Park, it didn’t look like the foundation of a global empire. There was just one location, and Meyer was known for high-end venues like Gramercy Tavern. But the lines became legendary, and in 2008 other outlets started appearing—first in New York, then in the rest of the country, then as far afield as Moscow and Dubai. Today, Shake Shack brings in at least a hundred million dollars a year and is planning an I.P.O. that could value the company at a billion dollars. That seems like a lot of burgers, but Meyer’s venture was perfectly timed to capitalize on a revolution in the fast-food business, the rise of restaurants known in the trade as “fast-casual”—places like Panera, Five Guys, and Chipotle.","498","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/shake-shack-economy"
"Unlike traditional fast-food restaurants, fast-casuals emphasize fresh, natural, and often locally sourced ingredients. (Chipotle, for instance, tries to use only antibiotic-free meat.) Perhaps as a result, their food tends to taste better. It’s also more expensive. The average McDonald’s customer spends around five dollars a visit; the average Chipotle check is more than twice that. Fast-casual restaurants first emerged in serious numbers in the nineteen-nineties, and though the industry is just a fraction of the size of the traditional fast-food business, it has grown remarkably quickly. Today, according to the food-service consulting firm Technomic, it accounts for thirty-four billion dollars in sales. Since Chipotle went public, in 2006, its stock price has risen more than fifteen hundred per cent.","499","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/shake-shack-economy"
"The rise of Chipotle and its peers isn’t just a business story. It’s a story about income distribution, changes in taste, and advances in technology. For most of the fast-food industry’s history, taste was a secondary consideration. Food was prepared according to a factory model, explicitly designed to maximize volume and reduce costs. Chains relied on frozen food and assembly-line production methods, and their ingredients came from industrial suppliers. They were able to serve enormous amounts of food quickly and cheaply, even if it wasn’t that healthy or tasty, and they enjoyed enormous success in the last quarter of the twentieth century. The number of outlets septupled between 1970 and 2000.","500","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/shake-shack-economy"
"But, even as the big chains thrived, other trends were emerging. Most of the gains from the economic boom of the eighties and nineties went to people at the top of the income distribution. That created a critical mass of affluent consumers. These people led increasingly busy work lives. They typically lived alone or in dual-income households, so they cooked less and ate out a lot. Michael Silverstein, a senior partner at the Boston Consulting Group and the co-author of the book “Trading Up,” has made a study of this kind of consumer. “These aren’t people with unlimited resources, but they have plenty of disposable income,” he told me. “One of the things they’re willing to spend money on is food away from home.” In the same period, affluent consumers developed a serious interest in food and became more discriminating in their tastes—a development often called “the American food revolution.” Wine consumption jumped fifty per cent between 1991 and 2005. After the U.S.D.A. started certifying food as organic, in 1990, sales of organic food rose steadily, and stores like Whole Foods expanded across the country.","501","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/shake-shack-economy"
"Traditional fast-food chains pretty much ignored these changes. They were still doing great business, and their industrial model made it hard to appeal to anyone who was concerned about natural ingredients and freshness. That created an opening for fast-casual restaurants. You had tens of millions of affluent consumers. They ate out a lot. They were comfortable with fast food, having grown up during its heyday, but they wanted something other than the typical factory-made burger. So, even as the fast-food giants focussed on keeping prices down, places like Panera and Chipotle began charging higher prices. Their customers never flinched.","502","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/shake-shack-economy"
"It might seem that the success of fast-casual was simply a matter of producing the right product at the right time. But restaurants like Chipotle and Five Guys didn’t just respond to customer demand; they also shaped it. As Darren Tristano, an analyst at Technomic, put it, “Consumers didn’t really know what they wanted until they could get it.” The archetype of this model is Starbucks. In 1990, the idea of spending two dollars for a cup of coffee seemed absurd to most Americans. But Starbucks changed people’s idea of what coffee tasted like and how much enjoyment could be got from it. The number of gourmet-coffee drinkers nearly quintupled between 1993 and 1999, and many of them have now abandoned Starbucks for even fancier options.","503","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/shake-shack-economy"
"As Starbucks did for coffee, Chipotle and Shake Shack have changed people’s expectations of what fast food can be. The challenge for the old chains is that new expectations spread. Millennials, for instance, have become devoted fast-casual customers. So McDonald’s is now experimenting with greater customization, and has said that it would like to rely entirely on “sustainable beef.” The question is whether you can inject an emphasis on taste and freshness into a business built around cheapness and convenience. After decades in which fast-food chains perfected the “fast,” can they now improve the “food”? ♦","504","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/shake-shack-economy"
"Last year, researchers travelled around the globe to talk about personal finance with a hundred and fifty thousand people, representing a range of socioeconomic classes, and living both in cities and in remote, rural parts of more than a hundred and forty countries. In some countries, they called people; where phone use was less widespread, they visited interviewees one by one. The questions they asked were, at times, probing. Had respondents, in the past year, received money from a relative or friend? If they needed to come up with emergency funds, how possible would it be, and where would the sum come from? Did they have an account at a financial institution? The results of those inquiries were published Wednesday, in the latest edition of the Global Findex Database, put out by the World Bank. The report found, most notably, that the percentage of adults with some kind of financial account—at traditional institutions like banks, or with companies that let people use their cell phones for transactions—rose from fifty-one per cent worldwide in 2011 to sixty-two per cent in 2014.","April 15, 2015","505","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-slow-global-spread-of-savings-accounts"

"The concept of financial inclusion—bringing more people into the formal financial system—is fraught. It’s hard not to notice that it happens to mean more customers for powerful banking institutions, many of which have ties to the World Bank. Some of the services these entities offer—credit, for instance—have been known to worsen people’s financial lives at least as often as they have helped to improve them; in fact, research on the impact of improving people’s access to credit, as a specific financial service, is mixed. Leora Klapper, a lead economist at the World Bank and an author of the report, acknowledged this (“Not everyone should have credit,” she said), but she added that the Findex Database is more concerned with people’s access to savings vehicles, which, evidence suggests, have a positive impact.","507","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-slow-global-spread-of-savings-accounts"
"One evaluation in rural western Kenya, according to a report from the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, found that access to a savings service helped female market venders to spend more on food for their families and invest more in their businesses. (A study of male rickshaw drivers in the same village didn’t, however, show such benefits.) Another examination in Kenya, cited in the same C.G.A.P. report, found that those who used the popular mobile service M-Pesa, which lets people transfer and store funds with their cell phones, were better able to absorb negative income shocks—events like a severe illness or a job loss—than those who didn’t use the service.","508","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-slow-global-spread-of-savings-accounts"
"In putting together the Findex report, Klapper told me that she was particularly struck by the stories she heard from women that highlighted how savings accounts can be a source of familial power—and how not having accounts can have negative repercussions that go beyond the financial sphere. A Bangladeshi garment worker who didn’t have a bank account told Klapper that her mother-in-law waits outside the factory gates, to take her cash wages as she receives them. Another woman, in Ghana, who was erecting a house, was giving the builder cash to purchase a small amount of materials at a time, as she received her wages, instead of paying him in larger installments; when Klapper asked for an explanation of her methods, the woman quipped that her husband couldn’t drink cement—getting rid of the cash as it came in was safer than storing it at home. Referring to women who had gained access to savings accounts, she told me, “For the first time, they’re not coming home with cash in their pocket for some other family member to take.” That meant more funds to put food on the table, educate children, and save for old age.","509","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-slow-global-spread-of-savings-accounts"
"That scenario is, of course, a best-case one. An important reason for the rise in savings accounts is that in India, the world’s second most populous nation, the government has made a concerted, high-profile push to move “unbanked” adults into the formal banking system. Journalists have noted that those efforts have had mixed results. Mark Bergen explained in a post last year that while people are opening savings accounts in large numbers, many of those accounts are sitting dormant, and the Findex report reinforces that conclusion. In India, the share of people with accounts rose from thirty-five per cent in 2011 to fifty-three per cent in 2014. But about forty-three per cent of those with accounts said that they hadn’t made deposits or withdrawals in the past year, compared with five per cent of financial-account holders in high-income, O.E.C.D. countries. The Indian government put a lot of effort into persuading people to open accounts in the first place but, it seems, could have done much more to make sure people would see the benefits of actually using them.","510","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-slow-global-spread-of-savings-accounts"
"For the Findex report, researchers asked people without savings accounts for the reasons they don’t have them. The explanation people gave most often was that they didn’t have enough money to warrant opening one. Other common reasons were that they didn’t otherwise need one or a family member already had one. After those, the top responses had to do with barriers to access: accounts were too expensive, financial institutions were too far away, or people didn’t have the documentation they needed to open accounts. Governments and account providers, Klapper said, need “to design appropriate products.”","511","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-slow-global-spread-of-savings-accounts"
"The report offers some thoughts on what those products might look like. Financial institutions could license local intermediaries, such as shop owners, to act as their agents, so that people don’t have to travel hours to a banking branch just to deposit a bit of cash. For those small accounts holding the equivalent of a couple of dollars, they could introduce tiered documentation requirements, like allowing a village elder to confirm someone’s identity, while maintaining higher standards of proof for bigger accounts to avoid fraud and other illegal activities. Governments, for their part, could require banks to offer basic, low-fee accounts. An approach that seemed to particularly excite Klapper was for governments to promote mobile accounts like the ones M-Pesa facilitates; from her perspective, financial inclusion in the digital, mobile age might not even require the participation of traditional institutions such as banks. “Throughout Africa, you have rural areas where there are not bank branches,” she pointed out, “but every village has mobile-phone agents.”","512","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-slow-global-spread-of-savings-accounts"

"On one level, Paul’s prediction may prove correct. Many viewers of Hannity and other Fox programs will probably seize on the new book in order to confirm their view that Hillary Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency. But none of these people were going to vote for her anyway. Politically, the important question is what impact, if any, the book’s allegations will have on independent voters, who may or may not vote for Clinton, and also on liberal Democrats who are inclined to vote for her, and maybe even to campaign for her, but who still have some reservations.","517","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"On this front, my guess is that “Clinton Cash” (whose full title is “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich”) could end up benefitting Hillary. With Hannity and other conservative media figures piling on, the Clinton campaign will be able to portray questions about the Clinton Foundation and the family’s finances as a political witch-hunt rather than a legitimate exercise in vetting Presidential candidates. And if that happens, many Americans may end up dismissing the whole thing as a partisan squabble.","518","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"Obviously, this is speculation. Not having read the book, which comes out on May 5th, I am relying on accounts from journalists who have. But if their versions of what the book contains are accurate, then Schweizer doesn’t back up his suggestions of wrongdoing with much in the way concrete evidence, which would allow the Clintons’ defenders to go on the offensive. Indeed, this is already happening. On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Tuesday, David Brock, the founder of Media Matters, the liberal-leaning media watchdog, who recently appears to have morphed into a Clinton campaign spokesman, said, “I think this is a political put-up job, and I can smell it from a mile away.”","519","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"Schweizer is a former fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of several conservative policy tomes as well as books about the Bush family and the Reagan Administration. According to the biography on his Web site, he served as a speechwriting consultant to the Bush Administration from 2008 to 2009. He is now the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative research organization based in Florida that, during the 2012 campaign, issued a report accusing the Obama Administration of illegally soliciting foreign donations. On the other side of the ledger, he has written two books about money and politics that criticized politicians from both parties, including Dennis Hastert, the former Republican Speaker of the House. One of them, published in 2011, was titled “Throw Them All Out.”","520","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"But most of Schweizer’s writing appears to have been directed at Democrats, and he is clearly a man of the right. In 2011, the Times reported that he was advising Sarah Palin on foreign policy. Brock, during his appearance on MSNBC, claimed that the Government Accountability Institute has received funding from entities affiliated with the Koch brothers, adding, “It’s subsidized by Hillary Clinton’s enemies.” On Tuesday night, according to Politico’s Gabriel Debenedetti, Brian Fallon, Clinton’s press secretary, circulated a memo to the campaign’s surrogates and allies, echoing Brock’s charges. “The book was backed by a Koch Brothers–linked organization and a billionaire family that is bankrolling Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign,” Fallon wrote.","521","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"It will be one thing if Schweizer has the goods on the Clintons—i.e., detailed evidence supporting his claim that policy decisions were influenced by financial donations and speaking fees. But, despite Rand Paul’s claims, it doesn’t sound as though the book will supply that level of detail. Reportedly, Schweizer relies heavily on timelines, linking the dates of donations to the Clinton Foundation and speaking fees paid to Bill Clinton with actions by the State Department while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. The Times’s Amy Chozick, for example, writes that Schweizer cites a free-trade agreement with Colombia that benefitted a major donor to the Clinton Foundation, and payments to Bill Clinton by a Canadian bank and a big shareholder in the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which the State Department was studying at the time.","522","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"The timelines are suggestive, but are they anything more than that? Many interested parties and institutions were weighing in on issues like trade deals and the Keystone pipeline, and former Obama Administration officials have already dismissed any suggestion that the Colombia agreement was altered to reward a Clinton Foundation donor. In a blog post published on Tuesday, another person who got hold of Schweizer’s book, Aviva Shen, a senior editor at Think Progress—which is published by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank with ties to the Clintons—writes, “Schweizer makes clear that he does not intend to present a smoking gun, despite the media speculation. . . . Schweizer explains he cannot prove the allegations, leaving that up to investigative journalists and possibly law enforcement.” Shen also quotes Schweizer on the Clintons: “We cannot ultimately know what goes on in their minds and ultimately provide the links between the money they took and the benefits that subsequently accrued to themselves, their friends, and their associates.”","523","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"Of course, given the wealth that the Clintons have accumulated since Bill Clinton left office, it is perfectly legitimate, and, indeed, imperative, for journalists to examine their finances and try to identify possible conflicts of interest. News outlets such as the Post, the Times, and the Wall Street Journal have been delving into these issues for months, generating lots of stories and quite a bit of critical commentary. (Back in February, I published a long post on Hillary Clinton’s money issues. My colleague Amy Davidson has also been following the story closely.)","524","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"In this context, it is neither surprising nor scandalous that several news organizations, including the Times and the Post, have reportedly made deals with HarperCollins, Schweizer’s publisher, to view the book in advance of its publication date. “We are always willing to look at new information that could inform our coverage,” Cameron Barr, the Post’s national editor, said in a statement reported by Politico’s Dylan Byers. “Mr. Schweizer’s background and his point of view are relevant factors, but not disqualifying ones. What interests us more are his facts and whether they can be the basis for further reporting by our own staff that would be compelling to our readers. There is no financial aspect to this arrangement.”","525","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"To repeat, there is nothing untoward about this. The job of news organizations is to ferret out newsworthy stories, check their veracity, and publish them. In this instance, they were on the case well before Schweizer’s book landed.","526","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"From here on out, however, things could get tricky for journalists covering the Clinton donations. Every word they write will be doubly scrutinized for evidence of political bias, and Hillary Clinton’s campaign operatives will be on hand to dismiss as part of a G.O.P.-inspired vendetta anything that is critical of the candidate. Until this week, it was easy to label such tactics as political spin, and few fair-minded people questioned the credibility of the Clinton money stories or the motivations of those writing and publishing them. Now that Schweizer has entered the fray, with the likes of Hannity and Paul to ballyhoo what appear to be largely unsubstantiated allegations, partisan politics is likely to color the views of the broader public. If and when Hillary Clinton falls back on the old argument that it’s all a right-wing conspiracy against her and her family, many people might well be prepared to take her at her word.","527","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"Like Barack Obama, Iran’s President, Hassan Rouhani, took a big gamble last week, but his was riskier. In a speech on Friday, Rouhani declared that the proposed nuclear deal with the United States and five other major powers marked the “first step” in reaching “the highest point of constructive interaction” with the world. Iranians should be prepared to embrace other steps, he said. “If we have any sort of tension with any nation, we want to put an end to such tension.”","April 6, 2015","528","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rouhanis-bet-on-the-iran-deal"

"The speech was dubbed in English and broadcast live on Iran’s PressTV, which runs internationally and on the Internet. Rouhani has now staked his Presidency on closing the deal—the deadline is June 30th—and generating the financial rewards of sanctions relief for his long-stalled domestic agenda. He called it a “new chapter.” If he fails, though, it could be the last chapter for yet another Iranian President.","531","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rouhanis-bet-on-the-iran-deal"
"Iran’s Presidency has been a risky job ever since the revolutionaries amended the constitution, in 1989, following the death of the founding cleric Ayatollah Khomeini. The amendment scrapped the Prime Minister’s job and made the President head of government. It was widely viewed as an attempt to gradually transform the Islamic Republic from a rigid Islamic state with an omnipotent cleric-for-life into something more like an actual republic, with powers shared by an elected President under term limits.","532","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rouhanis-bet-on-the-iran-deal"
"Rouhani’s three immediate predecessors all failed to find a viable formula, however.

It would have been the most lucrative deal in Iran’s history, but it met with suspicions in Washington, in no small part because of Tehran’s practice of arming and aiding terrorist groups. Under congressional pressure, the Clinton Administration instead imposed new sanctions blocking all oil business. At home, Rafsanjani’s domestic openings were derailed by hard-liners reluctant to cede ideological ground and wary of his outreach to the United States. Since then, despite numerous comeback attempts, including campaigning for President and parliament, Rafsanjani has been repeatedly humiliated.","534","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rouhanis-bet-on-the-iran-deal"

It also made a secret overture for a “grand bargain” to end tensions with Washington. The timing and sentiment never synced with the Clinton or Bush Administrations. By the time Khatami left office, in 2005, he was marginalized by suspicious hard-liners at home. Both his reform agenda and his dialogue died. He remains popular—to the point that the anti-reformist judiciary two months ago announced a media ban on mentioning Khatami’s name (without actually mentioning his name in the decree).","535","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rouhanis-bet-on-the-iran-deal"

Shortly after his 2005 election, Iran resumed enriching uranium and increasing its number of centrifuges, and he survived into a second term with the support of the Supreme Leader and of security forces who put down mass protests against election fraud. But he, too, ran afoul of the deep state. One example was his agreement, in 2009, to an international nuclear deal. “We are ready to coöperate” with the West, he insisted. Others didn’t agree. Iran backed out. It was one of many reasons Ahmadinejad’s eccentric coterie was blackballed even by religious conservatives by the time he left office, in 2013.","536","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rouhanis-bet-on-the-iran-deal"

The lawmaker Ahmad Tavakkoli wrote the President to demand that parliament, dominated by conservatives, ratify any agreement.

"The Beijing government avidly asserts its control over matters of reincarnation as a way of securing the loyalty and political complexion of influential Tibetan figures. After the Panchen Lama, the second-highest Tibetan authority, died, in 1989, the Dalai Lama picked a successor. But the Chinese government declared the appointment illegitimate. (The whereabouts of that child and his family is unknown.) The government announced the selection of a different boy as Panchen Lama. He is now twenty-five years old and served as a delegate to the recent meeting of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, where he was seated, in his crimson and saffron robes, between a military officer in uniform and a prominent economist.","545","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/who-will-control-tibetan-reincarnation"
"At the age of eighty, the Dalai Lama has begun to discuss a range of prospects for the future disposition of his soul. Traditionally, after he dies, a search party of senior monks would set out to locate his new incarnation, who is most often a boy toddler, who goes on to be trained as a monk and a leader. But the Dalai Lama has said that times have changed, and the old ways might not make sense; he has suggested that he could be reincarnated as a woman, or reincarnated while he’s still alive, a gradual migration that might give him more control over the process. In December, he told the BBC that the Tibetan public should decide if he reincarnated at all. “There is no guarantee that some stupid Dalai Lama won’t come next, who will disgrace himself or herself,” he said. “That would be very sad. So, much better that a centuries-old tradition should cease at the time of a quite popular Dalai Lama.”","546","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/who-will-control-tibetan-reincarnation"
"The politics of reincarnation, which involves the occasional oddity of an atheist Communist Party pronouncing how and when a spiritual figure can be reborn, pose an increasingly urgent issue to Chinese officials. They are managing fraught relations between Beijing and China’s Tibetan population. Although the question is usually discussed in connection with the Dalai Lama, Beijing also asserts the right, under Order No. 5 of the State Administration for Religious Affairs, to govern the reincarnation of several thousand lesser-known incarnate monks, known as tulku lamas, who are understood to be reborn as great sages or saints.","547","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/who-will-control-tibetan-reincarnation"
"And yet, in the frozen conflict between Beijing and its Tibetan critics, it can be important to distinguish between rhetorical artillery and the political events beneath. When the Chinese President Xi Jinping came to power, in 2012, some observers predicted an improvement in relations, in part because Xi’s father, Xi Zhongxun, had been friendly with the Dalai Lama in the nineteen-fifties; the monk had given him a watch, as a gift, which Xi’s father wore for many years. More than two years later, optimism has waned, in part because Chinese officials have continued to pressure foreign governments not to meet with the Dalai Lama, warning that their countries will face diplomatic and trade consequences if they do. (He met with only two national leaders in 2013, Dalia Grybauskaite, the President of Lithuania, and Donald Tusk, the Prime Minister of Poland, which was down from eleven such visits in 2001.)","548","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/who-will-control-tibetan-reincarnation"
"An optimistic scenario for both sides would be that the recent barrage of criticism of the Dalai Lama is intended to show Beijing’s strength and firmness, as a prelude to improving relations. For months, Tibet-watchers have exchanged rumors that the Dalai Lama might be allowed to visit China. Robert Barnett, the director of the modern Tibetan studies program at Columbia University, told me on Friday, “I think there may well be something behind the rumors.” But he cautioned, “I would guess that we are not yet even at the stage of talks about this yet, let alone on the cusp of an actual visit.” Barnett describes only “micro-signs” of change in Beijing, but he believes that a policy change would probably be abrupt, rather than telegraphed in advance by softening rhetoric. In his view, “the Party can afford to relax on its Tibet policies, because firstly it knows it faces much worse problems in Xinjiang”—the site of growing unrest among China’s Muslim minority—“and secondly, it has now instituted such draconian controls on movement and information in Tibet, way more than in the rest of China, that it must be fairly confident of controlling any situation there.”","549","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/who-will-control-tibetan-reincarnation"

If the Party can defuse tension on one of those fronts, it would take a crisis off the list. Under the current situation, the death of the Dalai Lama, when it comes (he calls it a “change of clothing”), will be a succession crisis that could lead to further instability. A few years ago, a senior Obama Administration official, in a conversation with me about Tibet, brought up the Avignon Popes, who were players in a fourteenth-century European struggle between Catholic authorities. “I think that’s what we’re heading for,” he said.","550","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/who-will-control-tibetan-reincarnation"

As Pacquiao shadowboxed in the ring, Michael Koncz, one of his closest advisers, looked at the reporters and videographers and seemed to wince. “After these two weeks, that’s it!” he said.

"Mayweather versus Pacquiao has been the most talked-about match-up in boxing for more than six years, and many observers had been skeptical, in recent months, that the fighters would finally agree to fight. Now that the date is set, boxing fans can go back to doing what they do best: complain—in this case, about the fact that it didn’t take place years ago, when both men were younger and quicker. But it’s possible that the long anticipation only gave the two boxers more time to draw the interest of casual fans; surely, more people know the names Pacquiao and Mayweather now than did five years ago. Bigger, if not necessarily better—surely any boxing promoter would eagerly accept that trade-off.","555","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/how-much-does-pacquiao-mayweather-matter"
"Perhaps by coincidence, this fight arrives at a time of heightened national exposure for boxing. On Saturday night, NBC broadcast the first in a series of prime-time, major-network fights, part of a new venture called Premier Boxing Champions. In the exciting main event, a bruising and undefeated welterweight named Keith Thurman battered Robert Guerrero, who had only lost twice before (once early in his career, which is understandable, and once to Mayweather, which is even more understandable). Viewership reportedly peaked at 4.2 million, which is an impressive number—more, quite possibly, than the number of people who will order Mayweather-Pacquiao on pay-per-view. Over the decades, boxing has survived by squeezing more money out of fewer viewers, broadcasting its biggest fights on pay-per-view and premium cable. This year, P.B.C. is helping to reverse that trend: its schedule includes broadcasts on CBS and Spike, which will show an appealing fight, between Andre Berto and Josesito Lopez, on Friday night. The most surprising thing about this upswell of interest is its main cause: good fights, including (but not limited to) the one on May 2nd.","556","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/how-much-does-pacquiao-mayweather-matter"
"When the press conference finally started, on the theatre’s main stage, the fighters declined to provide the press corps with any additional drama. Pacquiao seemed grateful for all the attention, while Mayweather seemed appreciative but unimpressed. This is not a grudge match: neither fighter seems to have any strong feelings about the other, which means that the promoters are in the unusual position of having to sell this boxing match as a purely athletic event. Bob Arum—Mayweather’s former promoter, and Pacquiao’s current one—tried his best to find broader significance, treating the crowd to a heartfelt tribute to Pacquiao’s home country, the Philippines; in making a case for the nation’s greatness, he mentioned its history during the Second World War, its large number of nurses, and, of course, Pacquiao himself. But this was, by Arum’s standards, a half-hearted attempt. There really wasn’t much to say, except to insist, as Mayweather did, this is “the biggest fight in boxing history.”","557","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/how-much-does-pacquiao-mayweather-matter"
"Is it? In this giddy atmosphere, it fell, oddly enough, to Arum, arguably the pound-for-pound champion of ballyhoo, to inject a sobering note of historical perspective. In the media briefing room, he declined to call this fight the biggest ever. Arum, who once promoted Muhammad Ali, recalled the last Fight of the Century, when Joe Frazier beat Ali, by decision, in 1971. “The whole country stopped,” Arum said. In his view, it was a shame that, owing to the absence of pay-per-view, so much of that attention had gone unmonetized. “This fight is tremendous. The interest is tremendous. And we should really wrap ourselves around that fact rather than compare it to fights of another era,” he said. “One thing is clear: it’s the biggest fight of this century.”","558","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/how-much-does-pacquiao-mayweather-matter"

"The Supreme Court oral argument on Wednesday in King v. Burwell featured thousands of words, dozens of provocative questions, two engaged and skillful lawyers—and one very striking silence. Chief Justice John Roberts, usually among the most active questioners on the court, scarcely said a word throughout the highly anticipated clash. The justices besieged Solicitor General Donald Verrilli and Michael Carvin, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, who are challenging a central provision of Obamacare, with so many questions that Roberts gave the pair ten extra minutes a side. The chief himself didn’t take up any of that time until practically the last moment.","March 4, 2015","563","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"Roberts’s one question may turn out to be extremely important. The issue in the case is whether the Obama Administration, in implementing the Affordable Care Act, violated the terms of that law. The plaintiffs assert that the A.C.A. only authorizes subsidies for individuals who buy health insurance on the fourteen state-run exchanges, or marketplaces. Under their reading of the law, the eight million or so people in the other thirty-six states who currently buy their insurance from the federal marketplace should be denied their subsidies. Most of the justices’ questions dealt with the issue of how to read the law correctly, but Roberts, in his single substantive question, took a different tack.","564","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"","565","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"Anthony Kennedy had asked about “Chevron deference,” a doctrine of law that describes how much leeway the executive branch should have in interpreting laws. Verrilli, not surprisingly, said that the Chevron doctrine gave the Obama Administration more than adequate permission to read the law to allow subsidies on the federal exchange. “If you’re right about Chevron,” Roberts said, at long last, “that would indicate that a subsequent Administration could change that interpretation?” Perhaps it could, Verrilli conceded.","566","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"The question suggests a route out of the case for Roberts—and the potential for a victory for the Obama Administration. Roberts came of age as a young lawyer in the Reagan Administration, and there he developed a keen appreciation for the breadth of executive power under the Constitution. To limit the Obama Administration in this case would be to threaten the power of all Presidents, which Roberts may be loath to do. But he could vote to uphold Obama’s action in this case with a reminder that a new election is fast approaching, and Obamacare is sure to be a major point of contention between the parties. A decision in favor of Obama here could be a statement that a new President could undo the current President’s interpretation of Obamacare as soon as he (or she) took office in 2017. In other words, the future of Obamacare should be up to the voters, not the justices.","567","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"Roberts’s silence was the most unpredictable part of the argument. Carvin spoke first, and all four Democratic appointees —Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan—battered him with hostile questions about his reading of the law. Based on their questions, and their voting patterns, they look extremely likely to vote to uphold the law in its current form. In a similar vein, Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito went after Verrilli in a way that left little doubt about their sympathies. (Clarence Thomas, who has not asked a real question since 2006, can be assumed to be on their side as well.)","568","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"Alito is often the most clever questioner among the justices, and his intelligence and savvy were on display today as well. Verrilli and his allies have argued strongly that chaos would follow if the federal subsidies were struck down. Millions, they say, would lose their insurance virtually overnight. Alito offered a plan to alleviate that problem, if only for a little while. “Would it not be possible to stay the mandate until the end of the tax year,” he asked Verrilli, to avoid “very disruptive consequences”? Delaying the effect of a Supreme Court decision striking down the mandate would shift the political pressure away from the Court and toward Congress and the states. For colleagues (especially Roberts), who worry about the court as a focal point of partisan anger, Alito’s plan might offer hope.","569","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"For his part, Scalia looks ever more like a Fox News justice, who seems to get his talking points from popular culture rather than from the law. In response to Verrilli’s claim that millions would lose health insurance if the plaintiffs win, Scalia asked, in all seriousness, “You really think Congress is just going to sit there while all of these disastrous consequences ensue?… Congress adjusts, enacts a statute that takes care of the problem. It happens all the time. Why is that not going to happen here?” This is the point that several Republican members of Congress have made in recent weeks—“Sure! We’ll fix Obamacare!” As any half-aware student of the contemporary Congress knows, there is no chance at all—none—that this Congress will amend or improve the Affordable Care Act to save subsidies.","570","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"As for Anthony Kennedy, who is often described as the swing vote on this court, he offered hope to both sides. He seemed to suggest that the plaintiffs’ version of the law would impose undue obligations on the states—a favorite theme in Kennedy’s jurisprudence. At other points, however, he expressed sympathy for Carvin’s reading of the law, namely that it allowed subsidies only to those on the state-based exchanges. At a minimum, the votes of Roberts and Kennedy seem like they are in play—and that may be the best the Obama Administration could have hoped for at the outset of the day.","571","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"At the Westminster Magistrates Court yesterday, Navinder Singh Sarao, a thirty-six-year-old British futures trader who is accused of helping to spark the notorious American “flash crash” of May, 2010, during which the Dow Jones plunged more than a thousand points for no apparent reason, appeared before a judge. According to press reports, Sarao was unshaven and wearing a bright-yellow sweatshirt. His forlorn figure appeared to evoke some sympathy from the presiding judge, Quentin Purdy. “The last twenty-four hours have been somewhat dramatic for you,” Purdy said. “The U.S. seeks your extradition to face very serious charges.”","April 23, 2015","572","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-day-trader-and-the-flash-crash-unanswered-questions"

"Sarao is fighting the extradition request, and he was freed on bail of five million pounds, which, according to his lawyer, was the entire amount he had in his trading account—and most of that money was borrowed. Unlike previous rogue traders who caused billions of dollars in losses, such as Nick Leeson, of Barings Bank, and Jérôme Kerviel, of Société Générale, Sarao didn’t have the balance sheet of a big financial institution behind him. Apparently, he didn’t have anybody behind him. According to accounts in the British media, he was a lone day trader who often conducted business out of his parents’ modest suburban home, near Heathrow Airport. A graduate of Brunel University, he also frequented a local day-trading firm, and drove around in a beat-up Vauxhall Corsa.","575","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-day-trader-and-the-flash-crash-unanswered-questions"

How could a small-time trader of limited means help to almost bring down one of the world’s biggest and most liquid financial markets? Why haven’t any financial institutions, particularly those that specialize in high-frequency trading, been brought to book? And, if the Justice Department’s theory of the case is true, what does it say about the fragility of the U.S. financial system?","576","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-day-trader-and-the-flash-crash-unanswered-questions"
"Beginning in 2009, the D.O.J.’s complaint says, Sarao used commercially produced automated software to buy and sell E-Minis, which are futures contracts, traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, that mimic the movements of the S. & P. 500 stock-market index. Trading these contracts from outside the United States is perfectly legal. But the government charges that Sarao tried “to manipulate the market for E-Minis by placing multiple large-volume sell orders on the CME (to create the appearance of substantial supply and thus drive prices down) and modifying and ultimately canceling the orders before they were executed. SARAO then exploited his manipulation for his personal profit. The investigation has revealed that SARAO obtained substantial trading profits through this activity.”","577","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-day-trader-and-the-flash-crash-unanswered-questions"
"In the volatile and unruly world of futures markets, such activities are hardly unknown. An article in Thursday’s Times highlights a legal case in which one high-frequency-trading firm based in Chicago, HTG Capital Partners, has accused another local firm, Allston Trading, of spoofing on a regular basis in 2013 and 2014. (Allston vigorously denies the charges, and a spokesman for the firm told the Times, “Spoofing should be stopped.”)","578","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-day-trader-and-the-flash-crash-unanswered-questions"
"Some critics claimed, in the aftermath of the flash crash, that it showed how the rapid growth of the high-frequency-trading firms, which spew out countless trading orders, sometimes reversing them within seconds or even milliseconds, had made the market more vulnerable, but this remains a contentious issue. (Defenders of high-frequency traders argue that they provide the market with liquidity.) In any case, though, Sarao wasn’t a firm; he was a bit player, which raises doubts about whether he really played a big role in causing the crash. A November, 2010, report from the Securities and Exchange Commission said that the plunge in the market had been sparked when a big asset-management company, subsequently identified as the Kansas-based Waddell and Reed, executed a computerized sell order worth billions of dollars on the E-Mini market. The S.E.C. report didn’t say anything about spoofing.","579","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-day-trader-and-the-flash-crash-unanswered-questions"
"According to the criminal complaint against him, Sarao’s spoofing trades were much smaller—worth roughly two hundred million dollars, in all. According to the government, they were nonetheless large enough to cause an imbalance in the E-Mini market, which resulted in a cascade of trades by other participants that then fed into the stock market, causing it to crash. I’m not sure whether this version of events is plausible, but let’s just assume that it is. If so, that would mean a lone trader sitting in his parents’ West London home was responsible for setting off a stampede on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean that erased trillions of dollars of wealth, albeit temporarily. It would also mean that his involvement didn’t emerge until five years later (and then thanks only to a whistle-blower, whose existence is revealed in the complaint).","580","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-day-trader-and-the-flash-crash-unanswered-questions"
"If that’s what really happened, something more needs to be done beyond hauling Sarao over to Chicago to stand trial. To begin with, the U.S. regulators and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange need to explain why they didn’t discover his role earlier.

More vacancies means more competition for workers, which should eventually lead to a sustained increase in wages. Indeed, contrary to popular perception, wages are already rising more than prices. Not by much, it is true, but in the year leading up to January, according to the Labor Department, average hourly earnings in outside the farm sector rose by 2.2 per cent.

"History (and James Carville) teaches us that it is likely to be a big one. If healthy employment growth continues throughout this year—which is a big if, to be sure—the G.O.P. will be robbed of one of the most potent arguments any political party challenging for power can have: that the incumbents have screwed up the economy. Should trends continue, 2016 could end up looking more like 1988, when George H. W. Bush scored a third successive victory for the Republicans, or 2000, when the Democrats, under Al Gore, won the popular vote for the third time in row. And it would look a lot less like 2008, when John McCain, burdened by a recession, failed to pull off a party three-peat.","590","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"To oversimplify things a bit, Bush, Sr., and Gore both promised voters more of the same, but with a different face in the White House. In 2008, with the economy in recession, McCain didn’t have the option of running on his predecessor’s domestic legacy, and he had great difficulty articulating a coherent alternative. Of course, many other factors affected the race, including George W. Bush’s disastrous war in Iraq and McCain’s shortcomings as a candidate, but the comatose economy was a big burden on the Republicans, just as it would be on the Democrats in 2016 if job growth were still lagging.","591","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"

The numbers vary from survey to survey, but the Real Clear Politics poll average shows Obama’s rating rising from a low of 41.3 per cent in October to a high of 46.2 per cent on February 2nd. One or two individual polls have seen the President hit fifty per cent. If the economic news stays positive, the upward move will almost certainly continue. “Americans’ ratings of Obama appear to be catching up with their improved economic views,” Gallup’s Lydia Saad noted.","593","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"The economic argument shouldn’t be pushed too far, however. In 1988, Bush, Sr., was facing an uninspiring opponent in Michael Dukakis. In 2000, Gore, for all his success in winning the popular vote, still lost the election (with the assistance of the Supreme Court). Plus, the electoral environment is changing. A new update from Gallup shows that Americans are more polarized than ever where the Presidency is concerned. The gap in Obama’s approval rating among Republicans and Democrats has averaged seventy per cent, higher than George W. Bush’s average of sixty-one per cent, Clinton’s fifty-six, and Reagan’s fifty-two.

Congressional Republicans want something that they can’t get through the standard legislative process—this time, it’s the revoking of President Obama’s executive action temporarily exempting four million illegal immigrants from deportation. So a large faction of Republican legislators decides to hold a routine funding bill hostage to their demands. In this case, the House has passed a bill that would keep the D.H.S. from closing down only if the President’s immigration order is killed at the same time.

In the years that followed, Dorado became the most glamorous resort in the Caribbean, attracting everyone from Ava Gardner to John F. Kennedy.

"Puerto Ricans could have been forgiven for thinking the same was true of the island generally. It had been one of the great postwar economic-development success stories, turning itself from a poor, largely rural society into a manufacturing powerhouse with a thriving middle class. But by the nineteen-nineties the economy had slowed, and then it went off the rails. Puerto Rico has been in and out of recession since 2006. Its unemployment rate is around fourteen per cent; forty-five per cent of the population lives below the federal poverty line; and there’s a fiscal crisis—a scramble to restructure debts of seventy-three billion dollars. Last year, the new governor, Alejandro Padilla, said, “We’ve proved that Puerto Rico is not Detroit and not Greece.” As boasts go, that’s hardly encouraging.","623","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-puerto-rican-problem"
"Puerto Rico’s difficulties are rooted, in part, in its earlier success. Its path to industrialization was paved with corporate tax breaks. The most important one was Section 936 of the U.S. tax code. (Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory.) This went into effect in 1976, and exempted the profits earned by American companies from federal taxes. Mauro Guillén, a management professor at Wharton and an expert in emerging markets, told me, “Puerto Rico became, by a wide margin, the most attractive locale in the world for American companies to operate in.” Between 1970 and 1980, manufacturing’s share of the G.N.P. nearly doubled, as firms, especially pharmaceutical companies, opened plants across the island. (I lived there for four years starting in the late seventies, when my dad ran a plant for Loctite.) At one point, Guillén says, more than half the drugs sold in the U.S. were manufactured in Puerto Rico.","624","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-puerto-rican-problem"
"The problem was that the growth depended on that crucial tax break, and in 1996 Congress began phasing it out. It expired completely a decade later, and, as the subsidies disappeared, so did many factories, relocating to places where labor was cheaper and regulation lighter. Between 1996 and 2014, the number of manufacturing jobs on the island fell by almost half. Last year, the island’s Secretary of Economic Development, Alberto Bacó Bagué, said that, once the island’s tax exemption expired, “we kind of disappeared from the map.”","625","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-puerto-rican-problem"
"This has left Puerto Rico scrambling to come up with a new economic strategy, and there are plans for the island to “reinvent” itself—plans replete with buzzwords of the moment, such as “cloud computing,” “the app economy,” and “innovative entrepreneurship.” There’s nothing wrong with any of these ideas—entrepreneurship is great. But what’s missing is a focus on a simple question: what can Puerto Rico offer that other locations can’t? As Guillén puts it, in a world where capital hopscotches freely from place to place, “countries need to capitalize on their distinctive advantages.”","626","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-puerto-rican-problem"
"As it happens, Puerto Rico has plenty of those: political stability, participation in the U.S. legal and economic systems, an educated and skilled workforce. But it needs to do a better job of exploiting and advertising those advantages. Heidie Calero, a consultant based in Puerto Rico, told me, “One of our main problems is that not many people in the U.S. or the world know that Puerto Rico exists under the U.S. flag and with the U.S. dollar as its currency.”","627","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-puerto-rican-problem"
"More important, Puerto Rico should pluck its low-hanging fruit. Take tourism. Puerto Rico has glorious beaches, tremendous weather, and wonderfully varied topography. Americans can get there easily and without a passport. English is spoken almost everywhere. It should be a tourist mecca. Yet policymakers neglected tourism for decades, while other Caribbean countries aggressively wooed hotel chains and bolstered infrastructure. (In the past forty years, the number of hotel rooms in the Dominican Republic went from three thousand to more than seventy thousand, while the number of hotel rooms in Puerto Rico rose by just seven thousand.) As a result, Puerto Rico has been eclipsed. In 1980, according to a study by Calero’s company, it accounted for more than a quarter of all the tourist revenue in the Caribbean. By 2012, that number was down to fifteen per cent. And tourism accounted for less than five per cent of Puerto Rico’s G.D.P.","628","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-puerto-rican-problem"
"Tourism isn’t a panacea. And it’s not as buzzy or cool as the app economy. But if you want to reinvent the Puerto Rican economy it’s a good place to start. This won’t be an easy task: when you neglect an industry for years, it erodes the skill and knowledge base of workers and managers alike. But Puerto Rico is increasing its marketing push and improving its infrastructure. The main airport is in the middle of a huge makeover, and there’s been a mini-boom in luxury hotels. Dorado Beach is once again the site of an opulent resort, an ultra-luxury Ritz-Carlton property that cost more than three hundred million dollars to build.

A temporary truce was quickly shattered. War erupted. But its premises couldn’t be ignored or defeated by force or intimidation. A year later, the regency of Henry III signed a slightly less radical version, which was reaffirmed by monarchs some forty-four times in the course of the next two hundred years.","633","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/al-qaeda-vs-magna-carta"

(The phrase “due process” would not be used for another century, and “habeas corpus” not for another four hundred years.) The King did pledge to honor the barons’ interests, but there was no mention of “the rule of law.” The document did stipulate, in Chapter 39, that no “free man,” meaning the aristocracy, could be punished without “lawful judgment of his equals.” It said, “Earls and barons shall be fined only by their equals, and in proportion to the gravity of their offence.” It did not, however, introduce trial by jury.","635","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/al-qaeda-vs-magna-carta"

The Bill of Rights “incorporated several guarantees that were understood at the time of their ratification to descend from rights protected by Magna Carta,” the exhibit points out.

In 1941, the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution were taken to Fort Knox, in Kentucky, for safekeeping.

"Big news from Blighty: With just two and a half weeks until the May 7th election, the Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband, a politician who, not long ago, was being lampooned as “Edweird” and “Red Ed,” is now the favorite to become Britain’s next Prime Minister. At the online-betting sites, which are very popular in the U.K., Miliband is odds-on to replace David Cameron, the leader of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition.","April 20, 2015","640","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"

"No one is expecting Labour to win an over-all majority in the House of Commons, mind you, and Miliband is only slightly favored over Cameron. At least in public, senior Conservatives are still expressing optimism that the prospect of Miliband entering 10 Downing Street will generate a last-minute swing in favor of the government. But a long series of opinion polls have shown the two major parties more or less tied, with about a third of the vote each. If that trend holds up until May 7th, the electoral map will almost certainly insure that Labour emerges as the largest party in parliament. Miliband could then form a coalition with the Scottish National Party or the Liberal Democrats, if the latter agrees to switch allegiances. He might also establish a minority government that looks to put together voting majorities on a bill-by-bill basis.","642","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"To constitutional historians, psephologists, and electoral-reform advocates, the uncertain situation, which reflects a generation-long decline in support for the two major parties, is a source of great excitement. To many ordinary Britons, it looks like a bit of a mess. But whatever happens in the next couple of weeks, one thing is certain: there will be no fundamental retreat from the austerity policies that Cameron and George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have inflicted on the British economy for the past five years. Desperate to shed Labour’s reputation as a party that overspent wildly in the run-up to the Great Recession, Miliband and his sidekick, Ed Balls, Labour’s economics spokesman, are promising to cut the budget deficit every year and to balance the books in the next Parliament, even if it means raising taxes to do so. They are marketing this set of policies as a “budget responsibility lock.”","643","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"Indeed, far from lambasting Cameron and Osborne for starving the British economy of public investment—according to some estimates, it has fallen by almost half since the government took office in 2010—and confining the country to a low-growth trap, Miliband and Balls are accusing the Tories of fiscal profligacy for unveiling a series of last-minute spending boosts, including one for the National Health Service, that they claim are unfunded. “You can’t fund the N.H.S. with an I.O.U.,” Miliband said at a campaign appearance last week. “Every promise we make is paid for. That is the difference between the Conservative Party and the Labour Party.”","644","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"To be sure, the two major parties’ budget plans aren’t identical. The government has promised to eliminate the deficit, which is currently running at about four per cent of G.D.P., by 2017-18, while Labour is giving itself until 2020-21 to meet that target. But, in insisting that his party’s spending plans would be “paid for without a single penny of extra borrowing,” Miliband has effectively conceded that Labour has lost the political argument over using Keynesian policies to boost the U.K.’s economy. Even as some erstwhile skeptics, such as the folks at the International Monetary Fund, have discovered the arguments for employing the public treasury to offset persistent weakness in private-sector investment, the country of the Master’s birth has largely abandoned his teachings.","645","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"I should emphasize that I am talking about the politics of the issue, not the economics. An illuminating article by Tim Harford in the Financial Times over the weekend made it clear that many British economists favor taking advantage of record-low interest rates to borrow money, rebuild Britain’s crumbling infrastructure, and invest in sustainable energy sources. That is a traditional Keynesian position, but one that the public doesn’t appear to support. Focus groups have showed that the promise of eliminating the deficit was one of the most popular elements of Labour’s manifesto, which was released last week. Despite the fact that the deficit has fallen by more than half, relative to G.D.P., since 2010, many Britons still think that their country is going broke, a proposition for which there is virtually no evidence. And many of the same voters still blame the last Labour government, which was led by Gordon Brown, for mismanaging public finances.","646","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"In these dire circumstances, it is easy to see why Miliband and Balls, rather than trying to educate the public about fiscal multipliers, the paradox of thrift, and other staples of Keynesian economics, chose to adopt the political strategy of “if you can beat them, join them.” In seeking to rebrand Labour as the party of fiscal responsibility, they have undercut the main accusation that the Tory press makes against them. “Clearly the Tory charge that Labour and its leader, Ed Miliband, were not to be trusted on spending and borrowing has hit home,” Simon Jenkins, one of Britain’s most astute political commentators, wrote in The Guardian last week. “Labour’s manifesto is an in-your-face rebuttal. Miliband has at least got the point. And no one even dares to breathe the word austerity.”","647","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"But, in signalling its break with Keynes, the Labour Party has not undergone a big shift to the right, and it would also be a mistake to conclude that its progressive tax-and-spend policies have been discredited. To the contrary, in eschewing the free lunches (or cheap lunches) that deficit financing might offer, Miliband and Labour have nonetheless adopted an explicitly redistributive policy agenda. They propose to tax the rich in order to pay for initiatives like expanding day care, reducing university-tuition fees, and hiring tens of thousands more doctors and nurses for the N.H.S. While Keynes was being unceremoniously booted out the front door of Labour’s headquarters, Thomas Piketty was being ushered in through the side entrance.","648","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"In its manifesto, Labour promised to raise the top income-tax rate from forty-five per cent to fifty per cent. (The income threshold for being subjected to this tax would be about two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars a year.) Labour also pledged to introduce a “mansion tax” on houses valued at more than three million dollars, of which there are many in London, in particular. And the Party promised to crack down on wealthy people who live in the United Kingdom but claim official residence elsewhere, to avoid paying their full share of British taxes—the so-called non-doms, as in non-domiciled.","649","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"Opinion polls suggest that the idea of cracking down on rich tax avoiders, who include some of Britain’s top business leaders, is particularly popular. It was after Miliband announced the new policy, a couple of weeks ago, that Labour first moved ahead in the polls. But the other two tax proposals, and the way that Labour is selling them, are equally important. Rather than just announcing the new taxes in isolation, the Party is saying explicitly what the monies they raise would be used for.","650","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"In pledging to restore the top tax rate to fifty per cent—the current government had lowered it—Labour said that it would use the proceeds to cut the tax rate paid by low earners to ten per cent. According to a poll carried out by YouGov last week, fifty-nine per cent of the public supports this policy and twenty-seven per cent opposes it. In announcing that it would introduce a new tax on luxury homes, Labour said that it would pay for new nurses and doctors in the N.H.S. Sixty-one per cent of voters said they liked this proposal; twenty-seven per cent said they didn’t. It’s worth pointing out that some of the Conservative Party’s policy proposals also proved popular in the poll, particularly its ideas to relieve people who earn minimum wage of having to pay income tax, and to place a limit on the total value of welfare benefits that a household can receive in a year. But, YouGov concluded, over all, “British people give better marks to Labour’s policy offerings.”","651","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"There may be a message here for other countries, the United States included. Although British voters are suspicious of deficit financing and welfare spending, they seem to welcome the prospect of redistributive policies that target the rich and benefit those on modest incomes in identifiable ways that are spelled out in advance.

"In June of 2009, when an aura of idealism still attended Barack Obama’s Presidency, he delivered a speech at Cairo University that was intended to recalibrate American relations in the region. He had already offered a qualified overture in his Inaugural Address—“We will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist”—and the Cairo speech elucidated a vision of American soft power and democratic progress. Some listeners also noted a bit of historical jujitsu. In making a case for nonviolence in the region, the President remarked:","653","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/president-king"
"Obama elided a few examples to make his argument: the more than six hundred thousand Civil War deaths in the United States; the well-documented though lesser-known history of armed black self-defense in the early twentieth century, which, in the eyes of many, served to make the nonviolent movement a palatable alternative; the armed resistance to apartheid that, for a time, counted even Nelson Mandela among its numbers.

"There are more than six hundred and fifty streets named for Martin Luther King, Jr., in the United States, but, perhaps more significant, there are streets, parks, and monuments dedicated to him in Australia, Austria, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Senegal, South Africa, and Zambia—a reminder that not only American authority but also American contradictions play out on the world stage. Cairo represented a moment in which the nation’s history of racism, long its most obvious moral contradiction and the so-called Achilles’ heel of American foreign policy, was, in the hands of a black President, an element to be used to America’s advantage. Obama’s mere existence was a brief for a kind of American exceptionalism. The credibility of his words derived less from the office he held than from his affiliation with the nonviolent movement that had made it possible for him to attain it.","655","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/president-king"
"From the moment Obama emerged as a serious Presidential contender, he has been viewed as a symbol of the successes of King and the movement that he led. Early in the campaign, when some African-Americans still harbored doubts about Obama’s identity, he travelled to Selma to mark the anniversary of the Bloody Sunday march and to talk explicitly about the ways in which the movement had made it possible for the union between his black Kenyan father and his white American mother to exist legally. His nomination, at the Democratic Convention in August of 2008, coincided with the forty-fifth anniversary of King’s “Dream” speech. After the election, cartoonists deployed King in all manner of celebratory endorsement, and, after the Inauguration, Obama placed a bust of King in the Oval Office. This week, he will deliver his sixth State of the Union address, as he did his first inaugural, a day after the holiday that commemorates King.","656","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/president-king"
"Yet six years in the White House have vastly complicated Obama’s relationship to King. They are two of the three African-Americans who have won the Nobel Peace Prize. (The first, Ralph Bunche, was awarded the prize in 1950, for negotiating a truce between Jews and Arabs in 1949.) When King accepted his award, in 1964, he began his speech by questioning his worthiness as a recipient, since the movement he led had not yet achieved interracial peace:","657","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/president-king"
"Obama opened his acceptance speech, in 2009, on a similarly self-effacing note, stating that he had barely begun his Presidency and his achievements were few. But then he departed from King’s reasoning. There is such a thing as just war, he said, under circumstances in which force is used in self-defense, is proportional to the threat, and, “whenever possible, civilians are spared from violence.” He continued:","658","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/president-king"
"A moral crusader and a Commander-in-Chief grapple with different prerogatives. King was never tasked with national defense; Obama’s election was contingent on a belief that he could keep Americans safe. Some observers nevertheless find it difficult to square elements of Obama’s foreign policy—drone warfare and its civilian casualties—not only with King’s concept of civilization but with the President’s own criteria for just warfare. Cornel West railed against the decision to use King’s Bible at Obama’s second swearing-in. “The righteous indignation of a Martin Luther King,” he said, “becomes a moment in political calculation.” Still, the King who denounced the triple evils of militarism, racism, and materialism would likely hail this week’s address, in which the President is expected to touch upon normalizing relations with Cuba, immigration reform, and providing free education for students at community colleges—along with the Administration’s efforts to prevent voter suppression, the cause that animated the Selma campaign, fifty years ago.","659","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/president-king"
"Beneath all this lies the irony that, nearly six years after the Cairo speech, Obama is less able to deploy the moral capital of civil rights, at least in the Middle East, not only because he is now established as the face of American authority but also because many of the battles that King fought have still not been resolved. Racism remains an Achilles’ heel. The protests in Ferguson, New York, and beyond were watched by a global audience, and, as during the Cold War, America’s domestic troubles become fodder for a morally compromised foreign power to deflect attention from its own failings. Iran’s Ayatollah Khamenei took to Twitter to highlight the seeming contradiction that such actions were taking place under a black President. He tweeted, “Racial discrimination’s still a dilemma in US. Still ppl are unsecure for having dark skins. The way police treat them confirms it.” In spite of Obama’s debt to the civil-rights movement, the ideal of American exceptionalism is only as valid as the standing of people who have just as often been seen as exceptions to America. ♦","660","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/president-king"

With the support of Rubio and thirteen other Republicans, the Senate passed the bill in June, 2013. After the bill generated a backlash among conservative and anti-immigration groups and died in the House of Representatives, Rubio backtracked, disavowing the legislation and saying that it wasn’t realistic.

He’s had some success in this enterprise. “I think that Sen. Rubio has done something that most politicians don’t do,” Jenny Beth Martin, the president and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots group, told Politico. “He evaluated what went wrong … [and] is working to make sure he doesn’t make the same mistakes again.

The Republican Party is chockablock with supine politicians of this sort, and that helps to explain why it has lost the popular vote in five of the last six Presidential elections. The thing that made Rubio an exciting figure a few years ago, the reason he landed on the front of Time magazine, was that he seemed to combine youth, a compelling personal story, and conservative views with a willingness to reach out to parts of the electorate that the G.O.P. had neglected, particularly, but not exclusively, Hispanics. Immigration reform was supposed to be the test case for whether the Republican Party could adopt a more pragmatic and inclusive approach, and when it sunk, it took Rubio down with it.","666","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"

If you look around, you will find that it generally takes not just one or two but three defeats for an unpopular political party to reform itself and abandon the things that made it unpopular. Because of the influence of established politicians, vested interests, and ideology, all democratic parties tend to resist change. Two strikes aren’t enough to overcome this inertia. Only after a third successive beating at the hands of voters can reformers overcome the ideologues and seize control of the party.","667","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"Of course, it’s only a theory, and it has its exceptions. But look at what happened to the Democratic Party in the nineteen-eighties. After losing to the Republicans for a third successive time in 1988, Bill Clinton and his business-friendly “New Democrats” gradually gained the upper hand and won the 1992 election. Something similar happened in the United Kingdom, when the Labour Party, after defeats in 1981, 1984, and 1987, jettisoned much of its ideological baggage: its commitments to public ownership, unilateral disarmament, and compulsory trade-union membership. The more recent experience in France, which saw the Socialist Party lose Presidential elections in 1995, 2002, and 2007, isn’t quite as stark, perhaps, in that the current President, François Hollande, could hardly be described as a great departure from previous Socialist leaders. But even Hollande, in the run-up to the 2012 Presidential election, advocated for some policies that had previously been considered off limits, such as raising contributions to the retirement system and making it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers.","668","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"

With Rubio now parroting the immigration line laid down by Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, et al., the task of taming the right wing has passed to Bush, who, to his credit, has not yet backed down from his support for comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for the undocumented.","669","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"

Still, compared with the likes of Cruz, Walker, and Carson, he’s practically a Rockefeller Republican. But if you look at the surveys of Republican voters collected on Real Clear Politics that I cited earlier, you will find that Bush is stuck at well under twenty per cent.

During O’Malley’s recent trip to South Carolina, the Associated Press reported, he “took a veiled shot at Clinton, warning Democrats that more ‘triangulation’ would not be a successful strategy for the party.”","677","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"The reference, to Dick Morris’s term describing Bill Clinton’s strategy for transcending ideological polarities, hardly constituted a venomous attack. O’Malley, who began his career in politics by working for Gary Hart’s 1984 Presidential campaign, is a thoughtful and deliberate politician, rather than a showman or a brawler. His standing in Democratic politics is currently diminished, however, by the results of last November’s gubernatorial election, in which O’Malley’s chosen successor, his lieutenant governor, Anthony Brown, suffered an upset defeat to the Republican candidate, Larry Hogan.","678","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"O’Malley had a strong record as governor, promoting the use of information technology, seeing liberal measures on immigration and gay marriage into law, and repealing the death penalty for future offenders. In recent months, he has been reaching out to progressives in the early primary states, and echoing many of the themes that made Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren popular, such as calling for the break-up of big banks. ”People want to see new faces,” Dan Calegari, a Democratic activist in New Hampshire, told the A.P. “There’s a certain amount of Clinton fatigue. They’ve been around for thirty years now. Quite honestly, I think if Martin decides to get in the race, he will surprise some people.”","679","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"To repeat, O’Malley would be a long shot. British bookmakers currently have the odds that he will win the nomination set at around twenty-five-to-one. Warren, despite her protestations that she won’t run, is at seven-to-one. Biden is at sixteen-to-one. Clinton remains the favorite, of course, but the betting markets suggest that the race isn’t entirely sewn up. At most of the bookmakers, the odds on her emerging as the Democratic candidate are one-to-three, which means that you would have to put down three dollars to win one dollar. These numbers imply that there’s a seventy-five-per-cent probability that Clinton will get the nomination. Until now, most political operatives and pundits, myself included, have been tacitly assuming that the chances that Hillary won’t be the Democratic candidate were lower than one in four. It may be time for a reassessment.","680","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"Today, the Federal Communications Commission, by a vote of three to two, enacted its strongest-ever rules on net neutrality, preserving an open Internet by prohibiting broadband providers from blocking or slowing content that flows across their pipes. It is a substantial achievement for the Obama Administration and the F.C.C. chairman Tom Wheeler, and also for the many groups that fought hard for the outcome. But it also is a moment to reflect back on the process over the last year that led here, and figure out why what so many people thought they knew turned out to be wrong.","February 26, 2015","681","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-everyone-was-wrong-about-net-neutrality"
"Let’s begin with the most obvious incorrect prediction, namely that passage of a strong rule (a Title II rule in telecom jargon) would be politically impossible. A year ago, Kevin Werbach, a thoughtful and prominent analyst, predicted that “the political and marketplace costs” of strong net-neutrality rules would be just “too great.” He warned, among other things, that Congress would “grind the FCC to a standstill, starve its budget, and do everything in their power to inflict permanent harm on the agency.”","682","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-everyone-was-wrong-about-net-neutrality"
"","683","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-everyone-was-wrong-about-net-neutrality"
"Werbach’s point was echoed by political cynics who believe that federal regulatory agencies like the F.C.C. tend to become captured and obey the bidding of whoever spends the most to lobby them. Money was certainly not on the side of net neutrality. A.T. & T., Verizon, Comcast, and others opposed strong net-neutrality rules, while the richest potential allies, companies like Google and Facebook, mostly sat things out. Some of the only groups in favor of strong rules were little-known activist organizations like Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, and Free Press; a few startups like Tumblr and Kickstarter; a handful of academics dabbling in public policy; and the narrow segment of the public that actually pays attention to such things. Given that lineup, the outcome seemed about as preordained as what happened when Michael Spinks stepped into the ring with Mike Tyson.","684","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-everyone-was-wrong-about-net-neutrality"
"But these predictions were wrong. Why, exactly, is subject to debate. It may have been the unexpected effectiveness of Internet-based activist groups, who protested the F.C.C. and helped convince millions of people to write and send comments about the potential rules. It may have been the White House and the personal involvement of President Obama himself. Or maybe people just misunderstood the character of the F.C.C. chairman Tom Wheeler. Whatever the explanation, the most pessimistic theories of lobbyist power clearly need be revised.","685","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-everyone-was-wrong-about-net-neutrality"
"It is often the case in Washington that ideas gain the status of deep truths not because they are actually true, but only because they are repeated often enough. That was the case for another widespread idea: that enacting strong net-neutrality rules would lead to a collapse in the value of broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon. In a May letter, twenty-eight industry C.E.O.s warned of an “investment-chilling effect” that would destroy millions in market value. And, in fact, fears of such a collapse were a large part of what stopped the F.C.C. from enacting Title II rules in Obama’s first term.","686","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-everyone-was-wrong-about-net-neutrality"
"Yet the moment that Tom Wheeler announced his plans for strong net-neutrality rules, on February 4th, broadband stocks jumped, and they have stayed buoyant. This has confused experts. Craig Moffett, whom I consider to be the smartest telecom analyst around, was forced to blame the market. “I think it just shows you that the market doesn’t really understand these issues,” he said.","687","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-everyone-was-wrong-about-net-neutrality"
"The theory of the wisdom of crowds suggests that the markets have noticed something: the broadband industry hates net neutrality, but its existence has always had a huge and unnoticed upside. Selling broadband is a great business: Moffet has pointed out that the margins are north of ninety-seven per cent. Stated simply, a strong net-neutrality rule locks in the status quo for the most profitable part of the cable industry’s business.","688","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-everyone-was-wrong-about-net-neutrality"
"Looking to the future, there’s one last thing that everyone might be wrong about. The general assumption is that the new rules will be met with fierce and protracted litigation (perhaps decades of it, warn the greatest doomsdayers). I’ve said myself that there will be litigation, and it is true that, in our times, most serious regulation is immediately challenged in court, almost as a kind of corporate reflex. Verizon and A.T. & T. have both already threatened to sue. But maybe this prediction is wrong, too.","689","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-everyone-was-wrong-about-net-neutrality"
"For one thing, given the jump in stock prices, filing a lawsuit will technically be suing to invalidate rules that seem to have created billions of dollars of shareholder value for the broadband providers. For another, suing the F.C.C. tends to annoy the agency, meaning that you might count out A.T. & T. and Comcast, both of whom have pending mergers before the commission. Sprint has already said that it doesn’t mind net-neutrality regulation, and it is hard to imagine a smaller company really wanting to bother. So it probably comes down to whether Verizon or a trade group like the National Cable & Telecommunications Association thinks that it is worth the time, money, and continued uncertainty inherent in trying to knock out the new rules.","690","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-everyone-was-wrong-about-net-neutrality"
"A suit becomes less likely because any such challenge is likely to fail. Unlike in 2010, the F.C.C. has written an exceptionally well-defended rule that depends on its broadest grants of authority to regulate “communications by wire.” Predicting the outcome of an unfiled suit is hazardous business; but it is fair to say that knocking out the rules will be rather hard.","691","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-everyone-was-wrong-about-net-neutrality"
"And so, barring the Republicans in Congress somehow coming up with a veto-proof majority and passing a law that reverses the regulation, the rules are here for at least the near-term. That creates a chance to test one bit of received wisdom, namely, the oft-repeated axiom that strong net-neutrality rules will deter investment in broadband infrastructure. On this we have some early data: with full knowledge that the rules were coming, bidders in late January spent a record $44.9 billion on broadcast spectrum—exactly the kind of infrastructure investment that the laws would supposedly deter. It has been a tough year for what once passed as conventional wisdom.","692","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-everyone-was-wrong-about-net-neutrality"
"Earlier this week, China’s national sports agency announced a decision that is decidedly out of character: the nation will no longer obsess over the pursuit of medals. The spirit of “gold-medal supremacy,” it said on Monday, “undermines the image of sport and is contrary to its value. We must resolutely oppose this and effectively eliminate it.”","January 29, 2015","693","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/corruption-souring-china-gold-medals"

"For decades, the agency, known as the General Administration of Sports, has conducted its business with an air of Soviet science and grand strategy; in 2000, it launched the 119 Project, named for the number of medals its bureaucrats had calculated were just out of reach in track, swimming, and other competitive summer sports, and intended to rack up. They concluded that China could achieve more medals-for-the-buck by investing in individual and obscure sports than in major team events. Thus, canoe-kayak became a Chinese success story, though its role in the nation’s history had been a limited one. In the lead-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Chinese boxing officials, who had never taken home gold, did not pretend to be in it for the love of the game. Chang Jianping, the president of the Chinese Boxing Association, told me, “Our target for the 2008 Olympics is explicit: one gold medal.”","695","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/corruption-souring-china-gold-medals"
"The sports administration now says that it will no longer give out awards to provinces when their citizens win gold medals in the Olympics and Asian Games, and will resist the temptation to rank provinces by how much gold they receive in the national games. Calls for a change have been building, especially since the 2012 Olympics, in London, where Chinese sports fans caught some unhappy glimpses of what the pressure to win had wrought. When the weightlifter Wu Jingbiao won a silver medal, narrowly missing out on a gold, he sobbed before the camera and said, “I feel ashamed to face my country and my team.” Chinese bloggers also expressed alarm at the news that the parents of the Olympic diver Wu Minxia had decided to withhold news of her grandparents’ death and her mother’s breast-cancer diagnosis until after Wu had taken the gold medal in the three-meter springboard. Worried that it would interrupt her training, her father, Wu Yuming, told reporters, “It was essential to tell this white lie.”","696","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/corruption-souring-china-gold-medals"
"Lately, though, the push to reduce the pressure to win has come from another source: Chinese President Xi Jinping’s high-profile campaign against corruption. After an investigation of the sports bureaucracy, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said that it had found evidence of fraud, match-fixing, and “athletes and coaches who will stop at nothing to achieve good results in competitions.” A good haul in the medal count can “boost their political credentials and bring them economic returns,” the state news service conceded.","697","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/corruption-souring-china-gold-medals"
"The corruption drive has focussed particularly on China’s soccer world, which was so marred by bribery and dark dealings that fans shout “hei shao” (“black whistle”) at referees who they think are on the take. (Their suspicions are generally well-founded: China’s most famous ref, Lu Jun, nicknamed “golden whistle” after his appearances in the World Cup and the Olympics, was sentenced, in 2012, to five and a half years in prison for accepting a hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars to fix seven matches in China’s national league.) In all, China’s anti-corruption drive has swept up at least nine soccer officials, four judges, thirteen players or coaches, and seventeen other staff.","698","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/corruption-souring-china-gold-medals"
"But, at the same moment, the sports system is embarking on an effort to boost its success. President Xi is a lifelong soccer fan, and he has listed “three wishes”: to qualify for the World Cup (the People’s Republic has done it only once before, in 2002); to host a World Cup; and to win a World Cup. Since then, he has used the power of his office to improve the odds. In November, China announced that soccer was now a “compulsory” part of the national school curriculum. Twenty thousand schools will receive funding for fields and facilities. Beginning next year, students who excel in soccer can use it to gain entrance to colleges. (Under the old system, élite players could gain entry to national sports teams and training facilities, but lesser players had little to gain from investing their time and energy.)","699","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/corruption-souring-china-gold-medals"
"Indeed, even with sincere talk about reducing the pressure to win, victory remains a tantalizing goal in China’s political culture because it fulfills the country’s craving for respect on the world stage. After first-round eliminations in the 2007 and 2011 Asian Cups, China’s national soccer team had become a constant target of abuse from fans, ranked ninety-sixth in the world, tied with Latvia. But, in the Asian Cup this year, China awoke, finishing first in its group before losing to Australia, the host country, in the quarterfinals. Some credit goes to the new coach, Alain Perrin (a Frenchman), who said of this fragile success, “We have a new record for Chinese football.”","700","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/corruption-souring-china-gold-medals"
"In the current political atmosphere—which celebrates national redemption and a push against corruption that threatens the survival of the Communist Party—Perrin’s sentiment did not go far enough. China’s anti-corruption agency announced that it deserved some credit for the soccer team’s success, saying that it had brought more openness and fairness to the selection of players and referees. It framed its work as a measure of national revival that has “let the people rebuild their confidence”: “With the further improvement in the ecology of the soccer world, the day of China’s soccer rise will come soon.”","701","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/corruption-souring-china-gold-medals"
"Sports, politics, and anxiety remain intertwined in China in ways that will be hard to untangle, even if fans might like to see their athletes driven by more love of the game. If the news of a new approach to gold has tempted any athletes to take it easy, they might reconsider after seeing a joke going around on the Chinese Web last week: President Xi visits the national sports chief, Liu Peng, to discuss soccer, and says, “If the team plays well, I’ll come to greet you at the airport. If the team plays poorly, Secretary Qishan”—the head of the anti-corruption drive—“will greet you at the airport.”","702","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/corruption-souring-china-gold-medals"

But that doesn’t mean that it lacks import. In advance of the 2016 Presidential campaign, this budget provides a valuable blueprint for what a moderately progressive economic agenda would look like.

"Traditionally, tax reform is a cause of the right. That’s largely because corporations and rich people follow the details of taxation closely—or, rather, they hire lobbyists to follow it for them. But what the Obama Administration has grasped, and what its budget proposals reflect, is that changing the tax code, and stripping it of some (or all) the favors it bestows on the wealthy and well connected, should be a great rallying cry for liberals, progressives, and anybody else who takes seriously the notion of equal treatment under the law.","704","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"

"Reading budget documents line by line, which is what I did last night, isn’t the most exciting activity. But it gets you down to the level of detail where the loopholes, the scams, and the lobbyists live. Take Table S-9 in the numbers section, which details how each one of the Administration’s many proposals would affect the deficit over the next ten years. It’s a dry and lengthy set of figures, but also a revealing one.","706","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"
"In a section of the table headed “Loophole closers,” we learn that taxing the profits earned by hedge funds and private-equity firms as ordinary income would raise more than two billion dollars a year between 2017 and 2021. At the moment, and for reasons that don’t withstand any serious scrutiny, these firms are allowed to categorize much of the profit they generate as “carried interest,” which is taxed at a reduced rate of twenty per cent.","707","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"
"Now, in a four-trillion-dollar budget, two billion dollars doesn’t seem like a huge amount. But most of the profits that hedge funds and private-equity firms generate are concentrated in a few dozen partnerships, which benefit greatly from the giveaway. For example, it was by taking advantage of this loophole that Mitt Romney, formerly of Bain Capital, was able to pay just fourteen per cent of his 2011 income in federal taxes. If Bain’s profits had been treated as regular income, which in 2011 was taxed at rates of up to thirty-five per cent, Romney’s tax bill would have been much higher.","708","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"
"Moving up a bit in the table, there is an entry titled “Reforms to capital gains taxation, upper-income tax benefits, and the taxation of financial institutions.” The first proposal—reforming the capital-gains tax—is actually two reforms together. The first would raise the rate that high earners pay on capital gains and dividends, from 23.8 per cent to twenty-eight per cent, which is the rate they paid during the soak-the-rich Reagan Administration. The other reform would eliminate a loophole in the income-tax code that allows heirs to reduce their tax bills.* Known in the industry as the “stepped up basis” loophole, it allows the beneficiaries of estates to estimate the cost basis of their inheritances at current market prices, rather than the prices that were paid for them, often years earlier. Since the value of most investments rises over the years, this loophole can make a huge difference to tax-liability calculations. Eliminating the practice would have a big effect on some inheritances. But since the vast majority of estates fall below the threshold for federal inheritance taxes—$5.4 million in 2015—it would mainly impact the top one per cent, which owns forty per cent of the nation’s wealth.","709","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"
"Over ten years, these two reforms would raise more than two hundred billion dollars in new tax revenues. For the sake of comparison, that would be more than enough to cover an annual five-hundred-dollar tax credit for second earners, an expansion of the earned-income tax credit to low-paid workers who don’t have children, and more generous tax credits for parents who pay for child care—all proposals contained elsewhere in the budget.","710","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"
"The budget would also address another way in which wealthy people reduce their tax bills, which is by employing crafty accountants and taking deductions for things like mortgage interest, state taxes, charitable donations, and Cadillac health-care plans. One of the budget proposals that hasn’t received much attention would place limits on the total amount of deductions than can be taken by individuals earning more than two hundred thousand dollars a year and couples earning more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. To most ordinary people, taking deductions is a way of saving a few bucks. But for the very rich the sums involved are enormous. Once again, Table S-9 tells the tale. In placing limits on deductions for high earners, the budget would raise more than six hundred billion dollars over ten years. That’s more than enough to pay for all of the tax breaks contained in the budget that are aimed at the middle class. In fact, it would pay for them twice, with about fifty billion dollars left over.","711","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"
"I could go on, addressing the whole issue of corporate loopholes. The picture should already be clear, though. After decades of money politics and anti-tax ideology, the U.S. tax code is festooned with giveaways to the rich and powerful. In seeking to eliminate some of these blights straight away, the 2016 budget seems destined to fail. But in highlighting some of what’s wrong, and showing how it could be remediated, the budget will help to shape the political agenda for years to come. And that makes putting it out a very worthwhile exercise.","712","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"

"Finally, I went back to the text of a speech given on Tuesday at the University of East Anglia, by Andrew Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, that is causing a bit of a stir across the pond. Titled “Growing Fast and Slow,” it’s a characteristically sharp and erudite discussion of the forces that underpin economic development. The speech takes as its launching point the ongoing debate about secular stagnation, which I wrote about last month. But what caught the attention of British reporters wasn’t Haldane’s discussion of neoclassical growth theory, or the role of education in the industrial revolution, but a bit about the rise of the Internet, and how it may be hindering material progress. “Is Twitter bad for economic growth?” was the headline of an article in the Guardian.","716","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twitter-buzzfeed-hurting-economic-growth"
"I was keen to read Haldane’s argument, and it turned out to go a good deal deeper than providing mere examples of workers wasting time on social-media sites. The main issue is a neurological one, Haldane suggests. Technological advances, and the ubiquity of always-on media, may be undermining one of the key psychological prerequisites for economic growth: patience, and the willingness to put off current gratification for future gains.","717","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twitter-buzzfeed-hurting-economic-growth"
"If that sounds like a stretch, I should point out that Haldane has a reputation for extending the bounds of economic-policy debates to incorporate psychological, evolutionary, and moral considerations. After the financial crisis of 2008-2009, he said that Occupy Wall Street protesters “were right” about the banking system. Last year, Time included him in a somewhat arbitrary list of the world’s hundred most influential people, for which I wrote a little blurb about him.","718","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twitter-buzzfeed-hurting-economic-growth"
"In the pre-modern era, Haldane now reminds us, life was a daily battle to survive: short, unpredictable, and threatening. In this environment, patience was a virtue humans couldn’t afford, because “surviving on limited means absorbs huge amounts of cognitive energy. It causes a neurological focus on the near-term.” Eking out an existence took up virtually all of people’s mental energy; they had neither the resources nor the inclination to save and invest in projects that take a long time to come to fruition. And a society that doesn’t invest in capital equipment and the accumulation of knowledge won’t grow much. In Haldane’s words, “Poverty and impatience would have been self-reinforcing, in a Malthusian poverty trap.”","719","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twitter-buzzfeed-hurting-economic-growth"
"As societies developed during the Middle Ages, things began to change. Or, at least, they did in Haldane’s version of history. “In the run-up to the Industrial Revolution, society became more willing to wait than in the past,” he writes. “That, in turn, promoted saving, investment and, ultimately, sustained growth.” Part of the reason that people became more patient was that, in countries like Britain and Holland, their incomes were gradually rising above subsistence levels, Haldane says. Also playing an important role was technological progress, particularly the invention of the printing press.","720","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twitter-buzzfeed-hurting-economic-growth"
"Citing Nicholas Carr, the author of “The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains,” Haldane suggests that the experience of reading may have “rewired our minds” to favor deeper thinking and more patient decision-making. “Technology was, quite literally, mind-bending,” Haldane suggests. This reshaping of our forebears’ mental processes helped to promote the development of intellectual capital (“creativity, ideas, innovation”), which plays a key role in modern economies. “Technology will have first shaped neurology and then neurology technology, in a virtuous loop. Slow thought will have made for fast growth,” he says. The world experienced this kind of fast growth in the quarter of a millennium after the first industrial revolution.","721","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twitter-buzzfeed-hurting-economic-growth"
"Haldane concedes that his argument is speculative. But he also pushes it further, saying, ”Just as the printing press may have caused a neurological re-wiring after the fifteenth century, so too may the Internet in the twenty-first. But this time technology’s impact may be less benign.” Rather than promoting thrift and deep thoughts, technology may now be crunching attention spans and accentuating “short-termism,” which Haldane identifies as an increasingly pervasive force in many areas of contemporary society, from reading habits (he mentions Twitter), to sports, to finance:","722","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twitter-buzzfeed-hurting-economic-growth"
"I should point out that Haldane isn’t claiming that Facebook and Buzzfeed are responsible for the recent slowdown in growth that many developed economies have experienced. His analysis is wide-ranging and conjectural. He acknowledges the positive impact of Moore’s Law (which observes that computer-processing power doubles approximately every two years), and the progress it is generating in robotics, genetics, data analysis, and other areas. Discussing the fashionable notion of computers eventually overtaking human brains, he says that, if it happens, “the sky becomes the limit innovation-wise … With exponential rises in processing power, the economy could become ‘super-intelligent.’ And with close to zero marginal costs to expanding processing capacity, it may also become ‘super-efficient.’ ”","723","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twitter-buzzfeed-hurting-economic-growth"
"For now, though, our own gray matter remains in the ascendant, and, for some reason, it craves short-term distraction, which Haldane categorizes, along with declining population growth and rising inequality, as “headwinds” that may be limiting the economy’s potential. “Psychological studies have shown that impatience in children can significantly impair educational attainment and thus future income prospects,” he writes. “Impatience has also been found to reduce creativity among individuals, thereby putting a brake on intellectual capital accumulation. Innovation and research are potential casualties from short-termism.”","724","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twitter-buzzfeed-hurting-economic-growth"
"In response to this suggestive line of reasoning, of course, there are counterarguments that can be made. (With Haldane’s contributions, there often are. That’s one of the reasons they are stimulating.) If people are getting more impatient, and this is leading to less saving, shouldn’t long-term interest rates be going up rather than falling to historic lows, as they have done in the past decade? The rise of short-termism in financial markets and labor markets may reflect political and institutional developments, such as deregulation and the rise of shareholder activism. Perhaps attention spans aren’t getting shorter at all, but are merely being refocussed on digital, rather than analog, objects. (When my eight-year-old and six-year-old daughters play Minecraft, they don’t seem to have any problem concentrating for hours at a time.)","725","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twitter-buzzfeed-hurting-economic-growth"

David Denby wrote, at the time, that Gore “presents a combination of intellectual force, emotional vibrancy, and moral urgency that has hardly been seen in American public life in recent years.” With the economy booming, people seemed in the mood to consider long-term problems and to start to come to terms with them.","April 1, 2015","727","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-california-can-teach-other-states-about-climate-change"
"In California, the legislature passed a landmark bill, the first of its kind in the nation. It required the state to create regulations to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions, by 2020, to where they stood in 1990. This plan presented a couple of unanswered questions. First, would the reduction hurt California’s economic growth by hampering businesses that emit greenhouse gasses? Second, given that the state was responsible for a relatively small proportion of the world’s emissions of these gasses, did it really matter if it, alone, met these stringent standards? It was difficult to answer the first question without implementing the plan. The second question seemed easier: it mattered, the thinking went, because if California did this, others would, too. California has long been a political bellwether, with the federal government and other states often following California’s lead in passing laws. Surely, the state’s climate-change bill would galvanize others to bring forth similar legislation.","728","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-california-can-teach-other-states-about-climate-change"
"At the time, federal climate-change legislation seemed almost inevitable—if not during the Bush Administration, which was coming to a close, then certainly during the next one—as did action at the state level. But following California’s lead proved to be more difficult than originally thought: the financial crisis came along, crippling the states’ tax-reliant budgets and compelling politicians to focus on shorter-term problems. Some states, including Hawaii and Minnesota, did pass climate-change legislation, but not nearly as many as environmental advocates had hoped for. In 2009, when Obama entered office, environmentalists thought that federal legislation couldn’t be far away. But the President and a divided Congress couldn’t come to an agreement.","729","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-california-can-teach-other-states-about-climate-change"
"So California stood mostly alone until this Tuesday, when the Obama Administration—which seems to be on a mission to accomplish as much as it can, without having to go through Congress, before the President’s term ends—announced a unilateral action that echoes the California plan. In a document filed with the United Nations, in preparation for a global climate summit scheduled to take place in Paris this December, the White House said that the U.S. intends, by 2025, to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by more than a quarter, through existing and new regulations drawn up by the Environmental Protection Agency and other government bodies. The regulations wouldn’t require congressional approval because they would take advantage of the regulatory power granted to agencies by existing laws such as the Clean Air Act. “The target is fair and ambitious,” the White House wrote.","730","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-california-can-teach-other-states-about-climate-change"
"Obama’s announcement comes at a time when the U.S. economy is looking more like it did back in 2006, when California set its original goals and “An Inconvenient Truth” was still in theatres. People’s priorities, not surprisingly, appear to shift depending on whether their own short-term concerns, in any given year, supersede the long-term ones; in the past, this has meant that environmental policies have fallen by the wayside whenever more immediately pressing matters arise. In a January poll, the Pew Research Center found that seventy-five per cent of Americans considered strengthening the nation’s economy to be a “top priority,” the lowest percentage since January of 2008. At the same time, thirty-eight per cent described dealing with global warming as a top priority, the highest level since January of 2007.","731","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-california-can-teach-other-states-about-climate-change"
"Even if economic growth begins to falter, some recent evidence might help make the case for continuing to pursue climate-change-related goals. For years, Tom Steyer, a billionaire activist and Democratic donor in San Francisco, has been campaigning for the federal government and other states to follow California’s lead. He argues that environmental policies don’t have to come at the expense of economic growth. But, for some time, it was hard to present evidence backing up his argument. Steyer and his allies could offer projections but, since the California law was so new, they had few facts to offer. Now, California, which is home to companies such as the electric-car manufacturer Tesla Motors and the solar-power company SolarCity, has seen disproportionate gains from growth in “green” jobs. In the past couple of years, Steyer told me, “the ratio of facts to projections” has become “a lot better for us.”","732","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-california-can-teach-other-states-about-climate-change"
"There’s another reason that people might be more interested, lately, in pursuing climate-change-related policies: a growing realization that climate change is a short-term problem as well as a long-term one. In California, for instance, evidence suggests that climate change may be partly responsible for an ongoing crippling drought that has parched many of the state’s farms and hurt its agriculture sector. When it comes to getting individuals to care about climate change, Steyer told me, it appears that immediate, local effects play a big role. “You probably don’t lie awake at night worrying about storm surge in Miami, and, conversely, I bet you anything they’re not lying awake at night worrying about the drought in California,” he told me. (California Governor Jerry Brown, early this year, vowed to set new, more ambitious climate-change-related environmental targets for the state, and soon thereafter, leaders of the state legislature unveiled a package of bills meant to meet those goals. On Wednesday, Brown also announced new drought-relief measures.)","733","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-california-can-teach-other-states-about-climate-change"
"Environmental activists have continued to press for both federal and state action, though they seem to have all but abandoned the prospect of achieving that through Congress. “President Obama put forth strong goals that demonstrate our national commitment to addressing climate change, but there’s still more work to be done,” Steyer told me. It’s unclear how much Obama will be able to accomplish without the help of Congress; states, faced with new regulations from the E.P.A. and others, might resist, as they have with other federal programs such as Obamacare. I asked Kyle Aarons, a senior fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a think tank, about the greenhouse-gas-emissions target set by the President. “That number by itself doesn’t mean much,” he said. “There have to be policies and regulations in place to drive those reductions.” That, he said, is where California’s experience could prove most useful. Its legislation might not have spurred a series of copycat laws, but now, as states contend with the policies Obama intends to put in place, they will surely look to California’s regulations as a model to help them reach the federally mandated goals. “In doing this,” Aarons said, California is “developing this experience and this knowledge that it can then share with states.”","734","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-california-can-teach-other-states-about-climate-change"
"Six days after formally entering the 2016 Presidential race, Senator Bernie Sanders is having some time of it. After attracting overflow crowds at a number of stops in Iowa late last week, Sanders moved on to Minnesota on Sunday, where he appeared at the Minneapolis American Indian Center and declared, “Our country belongs to all of our people and not just a handful of billionaires.” According to a report in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, about three thousand people turned out. A local television station estimated the number of attendees at four thousand.","June 1, 2015","735","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"Whatever the exact number was, the seventy-three-year-old from Vermont appears to be attracting bigger crowds than any other candidate, Democrat or Republican. With one recent national survey finding that fifteen per cent of likely Democratic voters support him, and a new Des Moines Register poll showing him picking up sixteen per cent of the Democratic vote in Iowa, the media is starting to accord him some serious attention. The Times, having initially failed to report Sanders’s formal announcement of his candidacy in its print edition, ran a front-page story on Friday about his appeal to senior citizens, and another piece over the weekend about the enthusiastic reception he was receiving in Iowa. Before speaking in Minneapolis on Sunday, Sanders appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” where he highlighted the “grotesque level of income and wealth inequality” in the U.S. and said, “I think we need a political revolution in this country.”","736","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"To be sure, not all of the Sanders coverage has been helpful to his campaign. Last week, Mother Jones, as an accompaniment to an interesting piece about his early years in left-wing politics, reprinted an article he wrote in 1972 for an alternative newspaper called the Vermont Freeman, the subject of which was male and female power relations, and sexual fantasies. One line in particular got quite a bit of media attention, including an explainer by NPR’s Danielle Kurtzleben. “A woman enjoys intercourse with her man—as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously,” Sanders wrote. On “Meet the Press,” the host, Chuck Todd, asked the senator about the piece. Sanders described it as fiction, adding, “It was dealing with gender stereotypes, why some men like to oppress women, why other women like to be submissive. You know, something like ‘Fifty Shades of Grey.’ Very poorly written, forty-three years ago.”","737","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"While it is embarrassing to Sanders, the flap about his literary effort, which he wrote while trying to get by as a carpenter and freelance journalist, seems unlikely to have much lasting effect on his campaign. That’s partly because Sanders’s run for the White House isn’t based on his personal character, or even his record as a mayor, congressman, and U.S. senator. Sanders is running for a cause—a resurgent progressivism that was conceived during decades of wage stagnation and rising inequality, born during the great financial crisis of 2008, and announced on the political stage by the street protests of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the widespread public support they engendered.","738","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"Of course, many candidates claim that their campaigns aren’t about them but about something larger. But when Sanders uses this line, which he does all the time, he is merely stating a fact. Before he entered the 2016 race, the new progressivism was a cause in search of a candidate. After Senator Elizabeth Warren refused to step up and run, Sanders seized his chance, and he is now getting his reward. In a contest dominated by a consummate insider with strong ties to the moneyed élite, many disaffected Democrats are embracing him as an underdog and an outsider. During a general election, almost all of Sanders’s supporters would vote for Clinton over Jeb Bush or any other Republican, but, right now, his presence in the primary gives them the opportunity to raise a rumpus, and to try to pull the party in a liberal direction.","739","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"As the campaign progresses, it will be fascinating to see how far this effort succeeds. Already, Clinton has shifted her stance on immigration reform and the criminal-justice system. In two recent speeches, she pledged to extend President Obama’s initiatives aimed at undocumented workers and their families, and called for an end to mass incarceration.","740","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"Although each of these policy proposals is important in its own right, neither would cost the Democratic Party’s donor class any money. The political test for Clinton will come in the area of economic policy, where Sanders has put out a comprehensive and, by American standards, quite radical manifesto. It includes reforming the tax code to make the rich pay more, raising the federal minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour, reforming trade policies, breaking up the big banks, and turning Medicare into a public health-care system for Americans of all ages.","741","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"When Sanders unveiled this plan last December, I pointed out that it isn’t all at variance with the policies of the Clinton-Obama wing of the party. Virtually all Democrats support raising the minimum wage and eliminating some of the tax breaks for the rich, for instance. In these areas, and others, Clinton should be able to find common ground with progressives. But the question remains: In positioning herself as a battler for the middle class, how far to the left will she go?","742","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"We may get some clues on June 13th, when she speaks at Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park, on Roosevelt Island. In a note to reporters on Monday, a campaign official said that Clinton would “lay out her view of the challenges facing this country and her vision and ideas for moving the country forward.” As I wrote on Friday, Clinton has made a strong start in the opinion polls, with her approval ratings largely withstanding the barrage of stories about deleted e-mails and the finances of the Clinton Foundation. But with Sanders and Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, now officially in the race, the dynamics are changing. Although neither of Clinton’s challengers is known as a political cutthroat, both will look to knock holes in Clinton’s record, and to draw contrasts with their own policy positions.","743","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-a-man-with-a-cause"
"Sanders, indeed, has already begun. “I know where I have been on trade agreements,” he told NBC’s Todd. “I know where I have been on Wall Street. I know where I have been on the Keystone pipeline.

"On Thursday, while the political world was focussed on the Supreme Court’s Obamacare ruling, two polls came out showing Bernie Sanders making up ground on Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire and Iowa. In a survey carried out by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center for CNN and the Manchester-based WMUR TV, Clinton was leading Sanders by just eight percentage points: forty-three per cent to thirty-five per cent. Meanwhile, a poll carried out in Iowa for Bloomberg found that Sanders now has the support of about a quarter of likely Democratic voters, by far his strongest showing yet in the state that will be the first to vote in the Democratic primary. “It’s tremendous progress that he is making with voters in the first two states,” Tad Devine, Sanders’s chief political strategist, told Bloomberg’s John McCormick. “It’s something we felt on the ground.”","June 26, 2015","745","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"At this stage, it’s necessary to issue a few qualifiers.","746","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"First, it’s not July 4th yet, and there are still seven months until the 2016 primaries begin. At this early stage, opinion polls bounce around quite a bit, and no single survey should be accorded very much weight. Second, Clinton is trouncing Sanders in the national polls. Third, even in the early primary states she still has a big advantage. In Iowa, Sanders has yet to come within twenty-five points of her in any poll, and in New Hampshire a separate Bloomberg survey found that she retains a much bigger lead than the CNN/WMUR survey suggested: twenty-six points. “Clinton remains enormously well-known and well-liked in New Hampshire, a state she won before,” Doug Usher, of Purple Strategies, the research firm that carried out Bloomberg’s New Hampshire poll, said. “She benefits from a gender gap in a primary that will be disproportionately female, and even Sanders’s voters admit Clinton is likely the nominee.”","747","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"So there’s no need for panic in the Clinton camp, which has adopted the public position that it expected a competitive primary all along. But for Sanders, and for Democrats who would like an alternative to Clinton, the signs are encouraging. The seventy-three-year-old Vermont senator is clearly enjoying himself, hurtling around the country, drawing large crowds, and promoting his progressive agenda. In the past few days, for instance, he has welcomed Pope Francis’s encyclical on climate change, criticized Congress for granting President Obama fast-track authority to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and reiterated his call to expand Medicare into a national health-care system for everyone.","748","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"As Sanders promised when he started out, he isn’t criticizing Clinton directly. But he is seeking to draw a contrast between his clear positions on such issues as trade with his opponent’s nuanced statements. And he’s insisting he’s in it to win. Speaking to David Corn, of Mother Jones, Devine explained that Sanders’s strategy is based on raising enough money—forty or fifty million dollars—to advertise in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, and he claimed that, thanks to lots of small donations, this strategy is working so far. “I don’t know if we can outright beat her in Iowa and New Hampshire,” Devine said, “but we have a real shot at it in both places.”","749","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"That may be stretching things. Still, if Sanders keeps gaining, he will certainly have the capacity to disrupt some of the Clinton campaign’s carefully laid plans. Should they go after Bernie? Should they ignore him? Something in the middle? Up until now, the Clintonites have been running a professional and highly scripted operation that has achieved most of its initial goals, but that sometimes resembles painting by numbers. Clinton has the money, the infrastructure, and the support from other prominent Democrats that Sanders lacks, but the Vermont senator has advantages, too: enthusiasm at the grassroots, the flexibility that comes with being a one-man band, and the ability to position himself as a scrappy underdog and outsider.","750","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"“You can make the case that a certain amount of Bernie Sanders’s support is a protest vote, but there’s more to it than that,” J. Ann Selzer, the president of Selzer & Co, which carried out Bloomberg’s poll in Iowa, said. “People like him. They like what he stands for. They like showing up at his events and hearing him say things they believe in.” In short, Sanders is running a classic insurgency campaign. And as many establishment candidates have discovered in the past, running against such an opponent can be an uncomfortable experience.","751","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"Bernie Sanders formally announced that he was running for President on May 26, 2015, in a stern thirty-five-minute speech he delivered in Burlington, Vermont, on the green-gray shores of Lake Champlain. But, really, his campaign began nearly five years earlier, on the floor of the Senate, on December 10, 2010, when Sanders spoke—without eating, or sitting down, or taking a bathroom break—for eight and a half hours. The “filiBernie,” people called it—“the most Twittered event in the world on that day,” Sanders wrote later–though it wasn’t, technically, a filibuster, since it wasn’t holding up any vote. “You can call it a very long speech,” the Senator suggested. Or: you could call it a manifesto.","July 9, 2015","752","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"
"“When I walked on to the floor, I had no idea how long I would stay there,” Sanders explained. At the time, he was sixty-nine. The longest speech he’d ever given, he said, was an hour. He wondered, “Would I last three hours, five hours, twenty hours?” He didn’t have a speech written out, though he had pages, scraps, and notes, and he knew what he wanted to say. He had only one rule: No “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” (“I wasn’t going to read from the phone book or sing songs.”) He figured he’d just riff off bits and pieces of old speeches until he dropped. The idea seems to have been to talk for as long as it would take for people to hear what he had to say. And that, more or less, is his plan for this election, too.","753","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"
"How long will he last? Sanders, who used to be a long-distance runner, has always said that he intends to run a very long campaign. Up until now, the press hasn’t taken that, or him, seriously. “Who Is Bernie Sanders?” CNN asked, in a video posted to its site in April. Who cares? Was the answer of a lot of pundits in May, and into June. Sanders, though, has been drawing huge crowds. And in polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, he’s steadily gaining ground against Hillary Clinton. It’s all very Aesop’s Fables. (You can easily kill two or three torpid summer afternoons trying to pick animals for a parable about Clinton and Sanders.

"Sanders was born in Brooklyn in 1941. In the nineteen-sixties, at the University of Chicago, he became a civil-rights and antiwar activist. He led sit-ins against segregated housing on campus; he worked for S.N.C.C.; he went to the March on Washington. He graduated with a degree in political science in 1964, the year that Ronald Reagan gave a speech on behalf of Barry Goldwater, called “A Time for Choosing,” that was aired on television the week before Election Day. The choice, Reagan said, was between the Johnson Administration, which Reagan called “socialist” (because of the War on Poverty), and Goldwater, representing the Founding Fathers, who, as Reagan imagined it, knew that “outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy.” Among Reagan’s speechwriters, “A Time for Choosing” became known as “The Speech,” since every speech Reagan gave was essentially a version of it. (For more on The Speech, see Robert Schlesinger’s “White House Ghosts: Presidents and Their Speechwriters.”) In 2011, when Bernie Sanders had the transcript of his quasi-filibuster published as a book, he titled that book “The Speech.”","755","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"

In 1981, he took office in Burlington; Reagan took office in Washington. Sanders isn’t a Debsian socialist; he’s a socialist in the sense that Reagan used that word to describe L.B.J. “He campaigned on the promise of a better life for the working man,” Alan Richman wrote in the Boston Globe. “Nobody seemed to mind that the dream Sanders believes in is called socialism.” He drew the attention of the national press when he ran for reëlection, in 1983. In the Wall Street Journal, for instance, Jane Mayer (who is now at The New Yorker) reported that Sanders began a speech at a fundraiser for the United Way by saying, “I don’t believe in charities.” (He later explained by pointing at the donors: “Most of them were conservative Republicans busy cutting services to low-income people. Then they go collect nickels and dimes, mostly from working people, and congratulate each other on their generosity. I find that hypocritical.”) The head of the Burlington United Way told Mayer, “His speech was, uh, a little longer than we expected.”","759","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"

He told Elizabeth Kolbert, then a political reporter for the Times, that there were perks to being the only socialist in Congress. “I can’t get punished,” Sanders said. “What are they going to do? Kick me out of the party?” At the time, the most notable way in which he had bucked the Democratic Party had to do with gun control: Sanders opposed the Brady Bill, which placed regulations on the purchase of handguns, a position that’s come up, lately, now that the press is taking him a bit more seriously. (Sanders said then that he did not believe gun control was a federal matter; more lately, he has said that, as a man who holds a middle ground on the issue, he can broker a compromise. Many critics are unpersuaded.) After serving eight terms in the House, he was elected to the Senate in 2006.

"Fair enough. After all the horrible things that have been written and said over the years about the former First Lady and Secretary of State, and about her family, it would be surprising if she didn’t dislike the media. But, as Ronald Reagan’s handlers discovered many years ago, the problem with giving journalists the slip, which Clinton has been doing with evident enthusiasm in the early weeks of her Democratic primary campaign, is that eventually this avoidance strategy becomes the story. So, just as Michael Deaver, Larry Speakes, et al. prevailed on the Gipper to do the occasional press conference in an effort to keep the jackals at bay, Clinton’s communications advisers evidently persuaded her to sit down with CNN’s Brianna Keilar for an interview that was advertised as the first of many media interactions to come.","766","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"If the Clinton campaign thought that she would be treated more softly by Keilar than by one of the network’s more well-known names—Wolf Blitzer or Jake Tapper, say—it was disappointed. Keilar peppered Clinton with questions about the private e-mail server she used as Secretary of State, polls showing that many American distrust her, and the big crowds that her opponent Bernie Sanders is attracting. Then, when Tapper asked Keilar about the interview, Keilar criticized the answers Clinton gave her, saying, “I did not hear a more open or transparent Hillary Clinton.”","767","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Keilar’s raspberry wasn’t the only one blown in Clinton’s direction. She “looked and sounded cagey and defensive, when her apparent goal is to inspire,” Lloyd Grove, an editor-at-large for the Daily Beast, wrote, adding, “The candidate was, by turns, self-justifying and pugnacious, and occasionally just plain inauthentic.”","768","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Clinton certainly didn’t sound very convincing at times, especially when she sought to blame Republicans for whipping up concerns about her deleted e-mails and other matters. Given that she didn’t have anything new to announce, it was perhaps surprising that the campaign chose to put her out there now. Why not wait until next week, when she is due to give a speech laying out some economic proposals? As Clinton showed when she steered a question from Keilar about Donald Trump toward the Republican Party’s position on immigration, she’s much more comfortable and persuasive when talking about policy issues.","769","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"On the positive side, Clinton avoided making any major gaffes, which was probably her primary goal. In today’s always-on media climate, attacks and mistakes dominate the news cycle, and all campaigns know this. If a campaign can supply the former and avoid the latter, it is doing fine. Failure to abide by this maxim leads into Trump territory, where his obnoxious remarks about Mexicans are currently doing serious damage to his business empire.

"In any case, forging a working relationship with the national media is just one of two immediate challenges facing Clinton. The other—what to do about the rise of Bernie Sanders—is far more important. Earlier this week, in a front-page piece in the Times, the Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, who ran Howard Dean’s 2004 Presidential campaign, was quoted as saying about Clinton, “Certainly she could lose Iowa.”","771","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Even if this happened, Trippi added, Clinton would probably go on to win the nomination. That’s true. But just a few weeks ago, the very idea of Sanders winning the Iowa primary would have seemed far-fetched. Now, perceptions are changing. In an interview with Politico (for a piece headlined “The socialist surge”), Robert Reich, the former Secretary of Labor, compared Sanders to Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern, two liberals who, in 1968 and 1972, picked up a lot of support in the early primary states and derailed establishment favorites.","772","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"It’s far too early to mention Hillary Clinton in the same breath as Lyndon B. Johnson or Ed Muskie, but how she chooses to deal with the Sanders phenomenon will have a greater impact on public opinion than whether she gives regular media interviews. So far, she has largely adopted a watching brief. A Clinton adviser admitted to the Times that the campaign had underestimated Sanders’ appeal in Iowa, but added, “It’s too early to change strategy because no one knows if Sanders will be able to hold on to these voters in the months ahead.”","773","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Most likely, he will hold on to a good number of them.","774","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"There are two reasons Sanders is doing so well. Firstly, he’s perceived as an outsider, and he’s tapping into a progressive movement that has little faith in the Democratic Party establishment. Secondly, the primary timetable favors him. On a national basis, according to a recent CNN/O.R.C. poll of likely Democratic voters, Clinton still has a huge lead over Sanders: fifty-seven per cent to fourteen per cent. (In fact, the poll found that Sanders was in third place, behind Vice President Biden, who got sixteen per cent despite not having entered the race.) It so happens, though, that Iowa and New Hampshire both contain many white, college-educated liberals who are sympathetic to the Vermont senator’s views. Sanders is polling less well among other elements of the Democratic coalition, particularly African-Americans and Hispanics, who won’t come out in force until the primary contest moves to states like South Carolina.","775","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Clearly, Clinton can’t do anything about the electoral calendar. Can she successfully counter Sanders’s political message in the early primary states? Over the next few weeks, as she starts rolling out her campaign proposals, we should get some indication. After that, she is planning on taking a vacation. The schedule for televised Democratic debates, of which there will be half a dozen, has yet to be set, and voting day in Iowa is still almost seven months away. But the race is now on.","776","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"In December of last year, I quoted a statement Bernie Sanders made as he launched his “Economic Agenda for America,” a twelve-point plan designed to tackle wage stagnation and promote high-paying jobs. “We have a corporate establishment whose greed is destroying the economy, a political establishment which is beholden to billionaires, and a media establishment which largely ignores the major issues facing working families,” he said. “We need a political revolution.”","August 15, 2015","777","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"At the time, the seventy-three-year-old Vermont senator was mulling a Presidential bid, but few commentators or Democratic voters were paying much attention to him. Now, of course, his standing in the political world is very different, but his language isn’t. “We have a message to the billionaire class, and that message is you can’t have it all,” he told a crowd, estimated at more than twenty-five thousand, in Los Angeles earlier this week. “You can’t get huge tax breaks when children in our country are going hungry. . . . You cannot continue to hide billions in profits in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. Corporate America and the billionaire class are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.”","778","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"Sanders has long been consistent in his views. For many years, he has been about the only politician on Capitol Hill who openly described himself as a socialist. What has changed is the American political environment. After Elizabeth Warren declined to enter the 2016 race, Sanders, by virtue of his leftist views, his energy, and his willingness to challenge Hillary Clinton, inherited Warren’s position as the tribune of a reinvigorated progressive movement.","779","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"Anyone who wondered how far this movement could carry Sanders now has an answer of sorts. It’s not just that he’s drawing much bigger crowds than any other candidate in either party. This week, a poll carried out by Franklin Pierce University for the Boston Herald showed him leading Clinton in New Hampshire, by forty-four per cent to thirty-seven per cent among likely Democratic voters. While this seven-point lead only slightly exceeded the poll’s margin of error, it represented a huge turnaround from a poll taken in March by the same organization, which gave Sanders just eight per cent of the potential Democratic vote, compared with forty-seven per cent for Clinton.","780","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"In Iowa, too, Sanders seems be making up ground. As recently as Memorial Day, he was trailing Clinton by about fifty points in the Hawkeye State, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average. Now Clinton’s lead has been cut in half, and one poll this week, from CNN, showed Sanders getting within twenty points of her. That’s still a comfortable margin, but the trend is in the underdog’s favor.","781","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"Based on the current polling, Sanders’s summer surge has left him with a realistic chance of winning one of the first two primary states, and of scaring the favorite in the other. For an insurgent candidate whom some political observers are still dismissing as a no-hoper, these are considerable achievements.","782","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"And, of course, Sanders’s contribution can’t be measured solely in polling numbers. In lambasting tax-dodging corporate élites and highlighting the corrosive effect that money is having on U.S. politics, he is telling truths that need to be told and giving voice to the feelings of many Americans, particularly young Americans, who feel alienated by the current system. Not only that: with Sanders leading the way, progressives are pushing the rest of the Democratic Party to the left, which could have a lasting impact on policy should the Democrats go on to retain the White House.","783","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"Sanders, however, insists that he’s not running merely to cheer up progressive activists or to be a thorn in the side of the Clinton political machine. He insists he’s in it to win, which means he needs to move beyond his base of white, college-educated liberals and start picking up votes from other elements of the party coalition, such as non-whites, women, and Southern Democrats, all of whom still slant heavily toward Clinton.","784","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"Indeed, one of the most surprising things about Sanders’s rise is how little impact it appears to be having on Clinton’s base. So far, Sanders has done an excellent job of enthusing and mobilizing Democrats and independents who had serious doubts about a Clinton restoration to begin with, particularly those living on the East Coast and West Coast. Hillary’s large core of Democratic support remains largely in place, however.","785","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"You can see this is in the national polls, which show her retaining a huge advantage over Sanders. The last six national polls showed Clinton leading him by thirty-seven percentage points (Ipsos/Reuters and Morning Consult), thirty-five points (another Ipsos/Reuters survey), thirty-three points (Zogby), thirty points (YouGov/The Economist), and twenty-nine points (Fox News). As of Saturday morning, the Huffington Post’s poll average, which combines these and other surveys, showed Clinton at 53.7 per cent, Sanders at 18.2 per cent, and Joe Biden (who isn’t officially a candidate) at 11.9 per cent.","786","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"While the former Secretary of State’s popularity among the electorate at large has fallen recently, the vast majority of Democrats still think positively of her, surveys suggest. For example, a Monmouth University poll published last week showed that seventy-six per cent of self-identified Democrats have a favorable opinion of Clinton; the latest CBS News poll put her favorability rating among Democratic primary voters at eighty-two per cent. In the same polls, among the same groups, Sanders’s favorability ratings were thirty-nine per cent and thirty-seven per cent.","787","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"These look like the numbers of a protest candidate rather than one capable of putting together a broad coalition of supporters, which is what you need to win the Democratic primary. A Gallup poll published this week showed that just twenty-three per cent of African-Americans have a favorable opinion of Sanders, and just thirty-three per cent of African-Americans are even familiar with him. (Clinton’s numbers on these two questions were eighty per cent and ninety-two per cent, respectively.) A prior Gallup survey found that Sanders was also on the wrong side of a big gender gap. Among men who self-identify as Democrats and “Democratic leaners,” his favorability rating was forty-seven per cent; among women who self-identify in the same way, his favorability rating was just thirty-two per cent.","788","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"If these numbers don’t change, Sanders will struggle mightily once the first two primaries are out of the way and attention switches to places like South Carolina, Nevada, and the twelve states—eight of them in the South—that will vote on “Super Tuesday,” March 1st. That likelihood explains why many commentators believe the best he can do is to serve as a stalking horse for an established Democrat with broader appeal, much as Eugene McCarthy did, in 1968, when his strong showing in New Hampshire prompted Robert Kennedy to enter the race.","789","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"While the primary calendar invites such historical analogies, they are, at this stage, pure speculation. Sanders, well aware of his current position, is reaching out to African-Americans and other groups. After protesters from the “Black Lives Matter” movement disrupted some of his rallies, he hired a black twenty-five-year-old activist, Symone Sanders (no relation), as his national press secretary. He also announced a “Racial Justice” platform that called for the elimination of minimum-sentence guidelines, the demilitarization of urban police forces, a ban on private prisons, and a “ban the box” law designed to prevent employers from discriminating against job candidates with minor criminal records. Next week, Sanders is heading back to South Carolina, where he will hold rallies in four cities, including Charleston.","790","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"In trying to move beyond his white liberal base, Sanders faces a huge challenge, but it would be folly to underestimate him. Thanks to the groundswell of support among progressive activists, young Democrats, and small donors, he has the money, the manpower, and the social-media presence to expand his footprint. And, with televised Democratic debates starting in the fall,* he will have the opportunity to introduce himself to a broader audience. Based on what we’ve seen so far, it seems likely that more potential Democratic voters will warm to his message.","791","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"

"Bernie Sanders, the Independent socialist senator from Vermont and now Democratic Presidential candidate, is a serious man and a welcome addition to the 2016 race. Which is to say that, in the first week of his extremely long-shot challenge to Hillary Clinton, he deserves better than for us to dwell on an indiscretion that he committed nearly thirty years ago, in 1987, when, in the course of two nights in a Burlington studio, he recorded a five-song folk album called “We Shall Overcome.”","May 1, 2015","793","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"
"On Thursday, Jonathan Karl, a reporter for ABC News, played a few seconds of a song off the album for Sanders on his phone. The seventy-three-year-old senator laughed gamely but tried to move the conversation along. “Look I’m worried about your viewing audience,” he said. “You’ll have mass click-offs. You don’t want me singing.”","794","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"

"The Senator may underestimate the audience-enhancing possibilities of Internet virality, but he is probably correct to want to avoid being pinned down by this novelty, at a time when his very candidacy is being dismissed by some as just that. When the short album was rediscovered last year, by the Vermont alternative weekly Seven Days, it made brief rounds as a political curio, but now that Sanders is officially running for President, the songs will get a new and wider airing.","797","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"
"Sanders is likely to come in for some ridicule from the ungenerous. While he never quite sings (the producer is said to have nixed that early on), he performs spoken-word monologues in his ur-Brooklyn accent—transcription utterly fails to capture his pronunciation of words like “marble” or “door”—backed by a chorus of thirty capable singers. At the time, Sanders described the intended effect as a localized version of “We Are the World,” and that gets it right. The smooth, blue-eyed folk spirituals conjure a different time and place—not necessarily the hardscrabble life and times of Woody Guthrie but rather a less disadvantaged era characterized by the Moosewood Cookbook and Volvos with rear-facing back seats.","798","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"
"As for embarrassing songs to be caught singing in 1987, however, Sanders could have done much worse: it’s not as if he was doing karaoke versions of “Walk Like an Egyptian” or “I Think We’re Alone Now.” The album is a little batty in places: on “Where Have All the Flowers Gone,” Sanders opines about the threat of dangerous “laser beams” and warns against a coming Third World War. But, if you can get past the earnest bombast of the whole project, it sounds a lot like Sanders’s current progressive economic agenda—a musical accompaniment to his policy positions of supporting unions, raising the minimum wage, and reforming the tax code to make wealthy individuals and corporations pay their fairer share.","799","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"
"In some ways, the album is a campaign consultant’s dream: on message, catchy, humanizing. (He’ll be lip-synching on Fallon by next week!) “Most of the people in this world work hard their entire lives and end up with very little. Others exploit that labor and end up with millions,” Sanders says on “The Banks of Marble.” He’s saying the same thing today, just without the backup singers.","800","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"
"The album could conceivably give Sanders a kind of unexpected credibility as a national candidate. The mortifying musical performance has itself become a required act for ambitious American politicians. Just the short list includes such ear gougers as Bill Clinton singing John Lennon’s “Imagine” in Israel; former Attorney General John Ashcroft letting his broken eagle soar; Trent Lott “boom-bop-a-bowing” some white-boy doo-wop with the Singing Senators; George W. Bush donning a cowboy hat and white tie for a parody of “Green, Green Grass of Home”; John McCain warbling Streisand on “Saturday Night Live”; and Barack Obama scoring with a few credible bars of Al Green’s “Let’s Stay Together,” and falling flat on “Sweet Home Chicago.”","801","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"
"This is not to suggest that we need more singing politicians. (Marco Rubio wrote in his memoir about singing a Lionel Richie song at his high-school talent show, Mike Huckabee and Martin O’Malley are never far away from their guitars, and Ted Cruz did this.) But if we are to suffer in this corner of political inanity, I’d prefer to do it with Sanders, who on his recording of “We Shall Overcome” identified the problems facing the world: “War, starvation, the degradation of our environment, people being manipulated and lulled into a stupor by the mass media, consumerism, the futile striving for happiness by earning more and more money to buy more and more things—and on and on it goes.” I think he’s found his campaign song.","802","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"

The apartment, according to an article called “Teach Your Parents Well,” in Dwell, had been eco-fitted at the behest of Ronen and his sister, when they were eight and five. “I just said they should do a sustainable apartment, and they hired an architect,” said Ronen, who will attend the University of Chicago, after a gap year spent farming in Europe and hiking the Appalachian Trail.","804","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/enter-sandman"

Something that fits very snug, but you know it’s going to stretch over the years and get comfortable and lived-in.

"The oddest thing about the candidacy of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator seeking Democratic nomination for President, is not his distaste for fund-raising, his insistence that he is a “democratic Socialist,” or even his unofficial slogan, “Feel the Bern,” a phrase that vividly recalls Jane Fonda at the moment of her disentanglement from the New Left. It is his popularity with kids. Since tossing his worn cap into the ring, in April, Sanders has racked up a disproportionate share of the youth vote: thirty-seven per cent of voters twenty-nine or younger, compared with Hillary Clinton’s forty per cent, in one poll. Why? Outwardly, he does not seem like a particularly hip or youthful guy. Sanders is nearly seventy-four, dresses like Willy Loman, and can name, from direct memory, the Dodgers’ lineup in the year 1951. When he shows up at events, his fleecy hair, or what remains of it, looks ravaged, as if he had puttered all the way there in a drop-top Model T. He wears a watch; it’s not by Apple. And yet, today, Sanders boasts a larger Facebook following than Clinton and Jeb Bush combined.","August 25, 2015","814","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"
"It’s on Facebook that Sanders fandom, and a language associated with it, has flourished. Followers post about the way he “slayed” in this or that speech, how he seems “so logical” compared with other politicians, how he motivated them to vote, for the first time, in their late twenties. As Sanders, an independent, throttled into a strong second place for the Democratic nomination, Bern-ers on Twitter praised him as “clever” and “trustworthy.” In the magazine last week, Daniel Wenger reported on an eighteen-year-old kid’s attempt to organize a Sanders YouTube viewing party in his parents’ living room. On Friday, in a greater coup, Sanders received the endorsement of the fifteen-year-old prank candidate Deez Nuts, who made a splash in some Midwestern polls earlier this month, and who cited his frank and accessible style. Queried about Sanders’s leading opponent in the race, Hillary Clinton, Mr. Nuts simply asked, “Why can’t you be more open and friendly like Bernie?”","815","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"
"“Open” is a reasonable description of Sanders’s campaign, which has worked to underscore the candidate’s ideological consistency over the decades. When Sanders started out, in the sixties, he was a civil-rights activist and a sit-in coördinator. After settling in Vermont, he worked in carpentry, wrote weird satirical erotica, and set about the business of losing elections. The goals of the young Sanders were a lot like the goals of Sanders now. From 1981, in his first elected post, as the mayor of Burlington, he fought for corporate regulation and against big-money fund-raising. He sought to lift the minimum wage. Recently, his supporters have produced old footage from his early years, as if to show that, in a field of opportunists, Sanders has held firm to his beliefs. The anachronism of his world view proves both his authenticity and his lack of hidden baggage as a candidate. For young voters, who approach the booth with shallow political memories, this “open” attitude toward Sanders’s past can come as reassurance: they don’t have to worry about being pinioned by a history that they don’t know, because history, for Sanders, is a backward projection of the behavior that they saw last week. The approach is striking in an era when even personal life is preconceived, polished, performed. Sanders is exceptional because he seems, demonstrably, the same guy who he was before the iPhone cameras first appeared.","816","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"
"The nature of that lineage may play a role in Sanders’s youthful popularity, too. He speaks often of “revolution,” as in: “Today, we begin a political revolution to transform our country economically, politically, socially, and environmentally.” Revolution is a term that’s rarely heard now, but it recalls the period when Sanders landed on his political cause. Radicalism nostalgia—the Boomer-propagated idea that the sixties were a halcyon age in American culture—survives today even among people born decades later. For the uninitiated, Sanders is a link back to that heady time. “Neil Young playing at the end of #BernieSanders SC speech is making me hippie fangirl out,” someone far below the hippie age cutoff tweeted this past weekend. Now that American youth culture is increasingly business-oriented—there are shopping recommendations based on your exact location, parties with playlists picked by subscription algorithm, and privatized mobile transportation apps to ferry you between—Sanders’s tinge of hippiedom, his seeming lack of calculation, lets members of the smartphone generation embrace the political sixties trip they never had.","817","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"
"Hillary Clinton, an establishment figure whose very breath seems mediated by design and process, is curiously at odds with this moment in liberal life. Sanders is closer. The outrages of the past year—Ferguson, Baltimore, Staten Island—have inaugurated a new era of direct action for progressives. The grassroots radicalism that, for years, relegated Sanders to the wingnutty sidelines of the field now bind him to the liberal zeitgeist. When the kids laud Sanders for being “logical” or “clever,” they are speaking of the logic of his activism—his cause-and-direct-effect rationale for stepping in, his eagerness to revamp the entire system—more than his adeptness as a political strategist. For people to whom statecraft seems mandarin and unknowable, Sanders offers a point of entry from the outside.","818","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"
"Is “Feel the Bern” Howard Dean 2.0? It’s hard not to think about the last Vermonter who summoned the youth vote, churned the Internet, and seemed to threaten the establishment’s preferred nominee.But there are differences. For one thing, Dean reached beyond Vermont parochialism with a hard-edged foreign policy: he made strong opposition to the invasion of Iraq a central point of his campaign. Though Sanders’s foreign-policy stances have been reported, his platform tends to double back to the domestic. (Since global affairs are Clinton’s home field, it’s a reasonable strategy.) On the other hand, Sanders enters the contest at a moment when it’s possible to be taken seriously—very seriously—as a liberal with a youthful following. It was young people who famously helped lead Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012, when voter participation among those eligible under thirty jumped to about fifty per cent and secured him victories in four crucial states. Today’s Millennials, who will make up thirty-six per cent of eligible voters in 2016, have no such candidate to call their own, except for Sanders. If they were to vote at their capacity, they’d be the country’s largest voting bloc. As it is, they may be compelled to wave back the Clintons, their parents’ regime, into the White House.","819","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"
"The “trustworthy” quality that Sanders’s young supporters find in him, then, is an accountability to process rather than to results—beginning with his campaign-finance practices. Trust in American politics has alternately carried two related but separate meanings. There’s the trust you feel in honesty of character, the old ideal of frank speech and lucid motives. And there’s the trust you place in your leader to get the job done. Often, these two trusts are at odds. We want our politicians transparent, yet we want them powerful as well, and power, even in the best of circumstances, means the management of information and the mastery of process. Direct action, in executive office, is demagoguery. For Sanders’s campaign to succeed in taking over the White House would, in some sense, be for its precepts to fail; the campaign is less about about wielding power than about guiding the Presidency from outside. “It’s not a political campaign to elect the man, but a campaign to change how American politics operate,” one young admirer wrote. In an era of gridlock and systemic abuse, trust in the sanctity of the political process may be the most valuable gift a young voter can get. Sanders shows the kids what’s possible, even if, strictly speaking, it’s not feasible yet.","820","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"

But Sanders, the junior senator/senior citizen from Vermont, does have an astonishingly good idea: interparty campaign debates during the primary season.","July 14, 2015","827","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"

"Emphasis mine, but Sanders’s, too. The day after his “Meet the Press” appearance, he upped the idea from offhand suggestion to formal proposal. In a letter to Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, he observed that “having debates between Democratic and Republican candidates during the primary process” would “engage large numbers of voters who typically do not pay attention to the process until much later, when the general election begins to come into focus.” This, he said, would “get people to participate at higher levels.”","829","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"

"I’m sure you can think of a million reasons this is extremely unlikely to happen. I certainly can. Just for fun, though, let’s imagine that it’s a few months from now. Things have begun to settle down. The five Democrats—Clinton, Sanders, Martin O’Malley, Lincoln Chafee, James Webb—are still in the running. The Republican clown car is still full, but it has become obvious which of its occupants are remotely imaginable nominees and which are not. Put the five top plausible Republicans—Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, for sure, Scott Walker, maybe, plus two or three from the Paul/Kasich/Cruz/Perry/etc. grab bag—on one side of a New Hampshire stage. Put the D-5 on the other. And ring the starting bell.","832","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"

"A typical debate among, say, five Republicans or five Democrats is a five-sided free-for-all, and the game is zero-sum. A debate with five Republicans and five Democrats would have ten players, each with his or her own individual interest, but, in important ways, each player would be on a side—a team, if you like. This might encourage a certain discipline. The members of each side would be reminded that what distinguishes them from one another is less important than what distinguishes them from the members of the other side. Nobody would want to be the one whose jab at a teammate provides an opportunity for real-time gloating by the other side. (“I have to agree with Mr. Chafee about Secretary Clinton’s scandalous speech fees.” “Senator Rubio said it better than I could about Jeb Bush’s mediocre record in Florida.”) Everyone on the stage would have to be conscious of an electorate beyond his or her own party’s base. All would have to demonstrate an ability to handle challenges from those who differ from them in ways that go beyond the details of their own party’s ideological orthodoxy. The narcissism of small differences might give way to a clash of larger visions.","834","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"

But the television audience would be huge—a lot bigger, I suspect, than for any of the Republican-only or Democrat-only debates. The sheer novelty would be a magnet for eyeballs.

And, while Hillary Clinton, as an undisputed front-runner, doesn’t have a lot to gain from lots and lots of sparring sessions with her four Democratic rivals, a debate with Republicans in the mix might be a different story. It’s hard to imagine her fellow Democrats trashing her under those conditions, especially on so-called “character” issues.

"Hillary Clinton’s big speech about the economy on Monday generated a wide range of reactions from the punditocracy. The Times’s David Brooks thought it was politically clever: “She’s cleared the first political hurdle of the campaign,” he wrote. Vox’s Matthew Yglesias said that Clinton’s policy agenda amounted to a rebuke of neoliberalism and indicated a “paleoliberal revival.” Politico’s Ben White reckoned that the speech was a non-event. “The snap reaction among Wall Street investors, economists and ardent financial reformers who thrill to the soak-the-rich rhetoric of Bernie Sanders was a collective: ‘Meh. What’s next?’ ” he reported.","July 14, 2015","842","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"My reaction was that the speech suggested serious intentions to tackle the problem of wage stagnation and to boost middle-class incomes (“That will be my mission from the first day I’m President to the last,” Clinton said), while still seeking to hold the center ground of today’s Democratic Party, which has shifted to the left since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, in 2008, and the later rise of Occupy Wall Street. Compared to the starry-eyed supply-side revivalism of Jeb Bush and the relentless labor-bashing of Scott Walker, though, her speech was on a different plane completely.","843","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"In terms of policy details, it was pretty much as expected. Many of the proposals that Clinton outlined were part of a lengthy report on “inclusive prosperity” that was published, earlier this year, by the Center for American Progress, which was founded by John Podesta, her campaign manager. The C.A.P.’s panel of experts, led by Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, and Ed Balls, the Labour Party’s top spokesman on economic issues, proposed boosting the minimum wage, investing in child care and education, setting up an infrastructure bank, changing the tax code to eliminate loopholes enjoyed by the rich, expanding tax breaks for profit-sharing and employee share ownership, and strengthening collective bargaining.","844","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"Clinton proposed all of these things. She also embraced President Obama’s recent move to expand overtime pay, called for more paid sick days and family leave, and promised to prosecute individuals and firms on Wall Street. (On my Twitter stream, that last pledge sparked some skepticism. One person sent me a link to an OpenSecrets.org page showing that three of Clinton’s top four campaign donors, in the course of her career, are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase.)","845","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"One thing Clinton didn’t do was utter the “R-word”—redistribution—which would surely be a central element of any serious revival of old-fashioned American liberalism. Instead, she talked about encouraging “fair growth,” which is another term for inclusive prosperity. Speaking on this theme, she said, for example, “We have to get serious about supporting workers,” and, referring to the need for tax reform, “Those at the top have to pay their fair share.”","846","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"Clinton didn’t spell out how she’d revive labor unions, which now represent less than seven per cent of workers in the private sector. The only specific tax changes she proposed that would affect the very rich were eliminating the carried-interest deduction enjoyed by hedge-fund managers and private-equity managers, and enacting the “Buffett rule,” which would apply a minimum federal tax rate of thirty per cent to people earning more than a million dollars a year. These are two eminently worthwhile proposals, ones that President Obama has also endorsed. By themselves, however, they wouldn’t do very much to address the remarkable concentration of income and wealth at the very top of the income distribution.","847","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"To be fair to Clinton, nobody is quite sure how to tackle that problem. At the very least, it would require a three-pronged approach: far-reaching changes to the tax code aimed at taxing wealth and restoring the progressivity that was part of the code until Ronald Reagan came to power; reining in the financial sector, which is responsible for much of the rise in inequality over the past thirty years; and challenging the social norms and corporate-governance structures that facilitate the outlandish pay packages received by senior corporate executives.","848","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"Clearly, Clinton isn’t willing to go that far, although she did say that she’d get back to us with some proposals to encourage long-term investing over short-term trading. “The speech revealed a woman who does not have her heart in class conflict,” Brooks rightly noted. Like many centrist Democrats, she prefers to talk about expanding opportunity while proposing individual measures with a redistributive aspect, such as providing child care for working mothers and expanding financial aid for students from modest backgrounds. Over the past twenty-five years, this pragmatic approach has produced some major advances for Americans of modest means, such as the repeated expansion of earned-income-tax credits and the Affordable Care Act.","849","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"It is an eminently defensible philosophy, and Brooks may also be right when he argues that it’s more politically palatable to the American public at large than the fire-and-brimstone stuff that Clinton’s competitor Bernie Sanders is offering up. You have to wonder, though. Over the holiday weekend, I ran into a retired businessman who used to own a firm that employed more than a hundred people. I’ve never been an extremist of any sort, he said, but I’ve come to the conclusion that America, at this stage, would benefit from a modest dose of socialism.","850","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"

"Forty years ago, when Jimmy Carter, a former one-term Georgia governor, was running for President, a headline in the Atlanta Constitution said, “Jimmy Who Is Running for What!?” Carter got little respect from the Democratic Party establishment, from the inhabitants of Georgetown, or from the influential Times columnist James Reston, who referred to the five-feet-nine candidate as “Wee Jimmy.” But Carter and his so-called Peanut Brigade had a plan: to spend a lot of time in Iowa, a state with a curious tradition—voting in highly personal caucuses—where George McGovern had, four years earlier, almost defeated the front-runner, Edmund Muskie. Although he finished ten points behind “uncommitted,” Carter won the state. Assessing Carter’s talent and endurance, a few political journalists guessed the future, and may have “invented” the Iowa caucuses by focussing on Carter and treating his victory as one of primary importance.","May 1, 2015","852","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"","853","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"What has since become clear is that participants and observers at the time, in an unacknowledged, unplanned collaboration, were conducting a political experiment: to discover whether it was possible for a “Jimmy Who?” to run for President with little money (Carter and his volunteers often slept in the homes of supporters), no major backers, and a mostly skeptical press, and to do so while facing big-league talent, which then included the senators Henry (Scoop) Jackson, of Washington, and Birch Bayh, of Indiana; the former Vice-President Hubert Humphrey; and the thirty-eight-year-old governor of California, Jerry Brown. I met Carter at about that time, in upstate New York; he was there to meet local Party officials and, accompanied by an entourage of about two people, worked the room, saying again and again, “I’m Jimmy Carter, from Georgia!”","854","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"So far this year, only one big-league Democrat, Hillary Clinton, has declared her candidacy, and she promptly set out for Iowa. Her visit lasted three days, taking her to “small” events, including a fast-food meal, and she brought along dozens of campaign workers, who will stay behind and keep working there. In an op-ed published in the Des Moines Register, she talked about the “great ideas” she got from her trip: “I will carry the stories and wisdom of the Iowans I met with me throughout the campaign and hopefully onto the White House.” According to the Washington Post, Clinton’s op-ed mentioned five Iowans, all of whom happened to be among the thirteen selected for one of her carefully organized roundtables. Not much was being left to chance.","855","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"Clinton is some forty points ahead of other Democrats in Iowa, so it’s easy to write off her potential competitors, among them the former Maryland governor (and, ahem, former Baltimore mayor) Martin O’Malley and the former Virginia senator Jim Webb, both of whom are “exploring” possible runs; and the independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who calls himself a Democratic Socialist, and who has skipped the exploration step. Sanders’s appeal is close to that of the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who seems to mean it when she says she’s not running, although, as Ryan Lizza reported, she intends to make her influence felt.","856","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"But for all that, perhaps it’s too early to declare the race over. Webb is a particularly interesting case. Like Jimmy Carter, he’s a Southerner, a veteran (in Webb’s case, a decorated combat veteran), and out of step with the Party on some issues (he strongly supports gun ownership). Yet, like Warren and Sanders, he has little sympathy for Wall Street (for years, he’s made an issue of income inequality), and he showed an early willingness to take on such issues as mass incarceration—“courageously stepping into the void, calling for a national commission to re-assess criminal justice policy,” as a Times editorial put it in 2008. (Clinton, in the wake of the rioting in Baltimore, just made it one of her issues, too.)","857","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"The candidacies of O’Malley, Sanders, and Webb, and probably others, might be seen as an updated version of the Carter experiment—to discover, as Webb recently told George Stephanopoulos, whether it’s “possible to conduct a viable campaign” in conditions that, in 2016, seem to make the venture preposterously out of reach. The former Florida governor Jeb Bush, one of the Republican front-runners, referred to those conditions the other day when he said that a candidate shouldn’t need a billion dollars to run (this is the obscene amount that Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, give or take a few million, each spent in 2012) while announcing that he’d already set a record for fund-raising in the first hundred days. (Bush didn’t reveal figures, but the Wall Street Journal noted that the previous record was held by Hillary Clinton, who raised thirty-six million dollars in her first hundred days, in 2008.)","858","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"Unlike the Republicans, who have already scheduled at least six debates before the Iowa caucuses, the Democratic schedule is T.B.D., and it’s possible that voters won’t even get a chance to see the Democratic candidates side by side. Clinton was often formidable in debates in 2008, when she competed with Barack Obama, as was Webb in 2007, when Democrats picked him to respond to George W. Bush’s State of the Union message. He addressed income disparity (“When one looks at the health of our economy, it’s almost as if we are living in two different countries”) and, with devastating accuracy, Iraq: “The President took us into this war recklessly. He disregarded warnings from the National Security Advisor during the first Gulf War, the chief of staff of the Army, two former commanding generals of the Central Command … and many, many others with great integrity and long experience in national-security affairs. We are now, as a nation, held hostage to the predictable ­ and predicted ­ disarray that has followed.” Webb, though, didn’t seek reëlection in 2012, in large part because he deeply disliked the business, and the politicking, of politics, a real drawback if he is serious about running for President. And if he is serious, he will no doubt have to revisit some earlier statements, such as in a 1979 magazine article in which he argued against a combat role for women in the military, and his complicated view of affirmative action. Yet he appears able to change his mind; like many others, he has been “evolving” on the question of same-sex marriage, and on “Meet the Press” said, “I think this has been a good thing for the country.”","859","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has weaknesses that won’t simply vanish—most recently, the bad publicity surrounding the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, a charitable enterprise vulnerable to charges of mismanagement and conflicts of interest, which, as the New York columnist Jonathan Chait wrote, was “a kind of quasi-government run by themselves, which was staffed by their own loyalists and made up the rules as it went along.” All that is only increasing the appetite of the Republican contenders. There are many on that side, some of them unnervingly weird, all of them ravenous for the Presidency, and all wanting nothing more than to face a candidate who, like Jeb Bush, will have a hard time exciting voters looking for nondynastic faces and fresh ideas.","860","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"In 1976, the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War were still fresh, and the pollster Patrick Caddell could say, “If it weren’t for the country looking for something in 1976, Carter could never have gotten elected. He would never have been allowed out of the box. No one would have paid attention to him.” That was in a time before techno-consultants and bottomless wells of money, when it still seemed possible for a Jim or Martin or Bernie “Who?” to alter a race whose outcome appeared predetermined. Possible or not, it was once a valuable, even essential, experiment, and one well worth conducting again.","861","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"

"If you’re following the 2016 Presidential campaign closely (and, at this early stage, I’m not suggesting that’s necessary), you’ll find an interesting subplot. While much of the media is focussing on the rise of Donald Trump and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders, the two pre-race favorites, Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, are continuing to focus on each other. At the start of this week, the Clinton campaign put out a video highlighting what it said were Bush’s “extreme ideas about immigration” and claiming that he was following Trump’s lead. On Thursday, the Bush campaign released a video highlighting Clinton’s e-mail travails and promoting Bush’s upcoming e-book, ”Reply All,” which will contain some of the e-mail exchanges he had when he was the governor of Florida.","August 27, 2015","864","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"It’s pretty clear what’s going on here. The seasoned operatives running both campaigns are operating on the assumption that, six or seven months from now, Jeb and Hillary will both be on their way to securing the nominations of their respective parties, after which they will face each other in a general election. The Trump tornado will have blown itself out. Sanders will have maxed out his support among progressive Democrats. Order will have been restored, and it will be Bush versus Clinton, after all.","865","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"On the Democratic side, arguably, this strategy of playing a long game makes sense. Clinton, despite recent slippages—notably in New Hampshire, where two successive surveys have shown Sanders ahead of her—retains a big lead in the national polls. For example, a Quinnipiac University survey of likely Democratic voters released on Thursday showed Clinton at forty-five per cent and Sanders at twenty-two per cent.","866","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"As my colleague Ryan Lizza pointed out in a post arguing that Vice-President Joe Biden can’t win the nomination, Clinton also has the support of a majority of elected Democrats, which, in the past, has been a good predictor of success. I’m a bit less convinced than Ryan that a Biden campaign would be a no-hoper. In the Quinnipiac poll, he came in third, at eighteen per cent—not bad for someone who isn’t even a candidate yet. But there is no doubt that, right now, Clinton is the strong favorite. Most British bookmakers, where people wager real money on these things, have the odds of her getting the nomination at one to three or one to four. This implies that bettors put the probability that Clinton will prevail at seventy-five or eighty per cent.","867","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Bush’s campaign, on the other hand, appears to be in free fall. His poll numbers are tanking, his message is blurred, his verbal stumbles are multiplying, and his money men are reportedly getting nervous. In the betting market, he remains the favorite to get the G.O.P. nomination, but at some of the sites his odds have slipped to seven to four, which implies that the probability of his winning is about a third. Rather than worrying about Clinton, Bush and his strategists desperately need to find a way for him to counter his Republican rivals—not just Trump, whose whirlwind campaign would be difficult for any regular politician to deal with, but Marco Rubio, John Kasich, and Carly Fiorina, any of whom could conceivably end up supplanting him as the moderate conservative candidate. (I use “moderate” in a relative sense. All of the G.O.P. candidates, Bush included, are solidly on the right.)","868","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Until Memorial Day, when Trump wasn’t yet in the race, Bush was polling in the mid-teens—enough to keep him in or close to the lead. The new Quinnipiac poll has him at seven per cent, sharing third place with Rubio and Cruz. That’s just one survey, of course, but the Real Clear Politics poll average also shows him dropping into single figures, at 9.8 per cent. And it’s not just the national polls that are bringing bad tidings. In Iowa, Bush is tied, with Rubio, for sixth place—yes, sixth—behind Trump, Ben Carson, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, and Fiorina. In New Hampshire, he is in third place: Kasich, who is making a big effort there, has moved ahead of him (with both of them well behind Trump). In South Carolina, too, Bush is in third place, behind Trump and Carson. Based on these numbers, it appears that he could fail to win any of the first three primaries, leaving him acutely vulnerable going into the Nevada caucus and Super Tuesday.","869","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Of course, these numbers will change over the next few months. But they are unlikely to move in Bush’s favor unless he hones his message and stops tripping over himself. What does he stand for? Going into the campaign, it seemed pretty straightforward: competence, conservative economics, and a shift toward the center on immigration and other social issues. But in none of these areas has he really delivered. His verbal clangers have made him look like a gentleman amateur, rather than a seasoned politician capable of taking down a Clinton or a Biden. Beyond some sunny rhetoric about boosting the G.D.P. growth rate to four per cent a year, his economic plan remains largely undefined.","870","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Perhaps most alarming of all, Bush seems unsure whether he truly represents a break with the xenophobic, homophobic, modernity-loathing wing of the Republican Party. He has allowed Kasich, in particular, to position himself as a plausible, electable alternative. (One telling example: while Bush is running away from the Common Core education standards, which he previously backed, and which many conservative Republican activists hate, Kasich is still supporting them.)","871","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Meanwhile, the gaffes keep coming. Every week, it seems, Bush or a member of his staff has to try to walk back one of his public comments. Most recently, he suggested, after using the term “anchor babies,” that he was referring not to children born in the United States to Hispanic parents but to those born to Asian parents. That hop from the frying pan into the fire allowed Trump, of all people, to accuse him of being offensive. And it’s not merely that Bush appears to have inherited the family weakness for malapropisms. He seems incapable of saying anything snappy or memorable. With Trump regularly tearing him to shreds in interviews and on Twitter, the best he can manage in response are statements like “Mr. Trump doesn’t have a proven conservative record.”","872","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"As long as Trump’s campaign seemed likely to fade quickly, staying above the fray was a defensible strategy. It jibed with the old edict “Never wrestle with a pig. You get dirty and, besides, the pig likes it.” But things have moved on, and it’s clear that Trump isn’t going away anytime soon. Moreover, Trump is a typical bully, and so, as long as he senses weakness on Bush’s part, he will continue to torment him with comments like “Jeb Bush is a low-energy person,” or, as he put it in Alabama last weekend, “a very, very low-energy person.”","873","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"

"If there was ever any doubt that Hillary Clinton was going to run a populist Presidential campaign, she dispelled it on Saturday with her speech on Roosevelt Island.

"The best part of the speech came toward the end, when Clinton said, “Well, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I will be the youngest woman President in the history of the United States!” According to her staff, it was a line she picked up from someone at a campaign event in South Carolina a couple of weeks ago, and it brought loud cheers from her supporters, some of whom had traveled from as far as California to attend the rally.","877","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-goes-populist-up-to-a-point"
"But the guts of the address, delivered from a H-shaped stage erected in Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park, which opened in 2012, came earlier. “You see corporations making record profits, with C.E.O.s making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged,” Clinton said. “While many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top twenty-five hedge-fund managers making more than all of America’s kindergarten teachers combined. And often paying a lower tax rate. So, you have to wonder, ‘When does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead? When?’ ”","878","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-goes-populist-up-to-a-point"

The line about twenty-five hedge-fund managers making more than all the kindergarten teachers in the country was actually delivered by President Obama a few weeks ago. But, in placing C.E.O.s and hedge-fund managers center stage, and comparing their outsized remuneration and avarice to the tribulations of ordinary working people, Clinton was acknowledging not just the economic realities of modern America but the fact that the center of gravity in her party has shifted.","880","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-goes-populist-up-to-a-point"

"In promising, prior to Saturday’s speech, to end mass incarceration, expand voting rights, and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented workers, Clinton had already shifted to the left on issues that are major concerns to key elements of the modern Democratic coalition. Until now, though, she hadn’t said very much about the issues of wage stagnation, inequality, and corporate piggery, which progressives like Sanders, Warren, and Mayor Bill de Blasio (a conspicuous absentee from Saturday’s rally) have seized upon. Rhetorically, at least, Clinton answered calls for her to make clear where she stood on these issues: the middle of an article by Robert Reich or Joseph Stiglitz, or so it seemed.","882","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-goes-populist-up-to-a-point"

"There remains, of course, the question of what Clinton intends to do about these evils. She said that she would encourage companies to invest for the long term, change the tax code so that it “rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas,” and “give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.” All of these may be worthwhile policies, but it’s hard to see them having much impact on the great divide she had just identified, particularly the dramatic concentration of income and wealth at the very top of the earnings distribution.","884","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-goes-populist-up-to-a-point"
"Clinton didn’t talk about the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, the free-trade treaty on which Obama has just suffered an embarrassing defeat.

"On the night of October 11, 2012, Barack Obama loped across the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base, looking as if he were trying hard not to grin. It was a change of mood; eight days earlier, he had done poorly in his first Presidential debate with Mitt Romney, and the feeling in his campaign was gloomy. But, that evening, Vice-President Joe Biden had had his first debate with Paul Ryan, during which he called out the Romney campaign on its “malarkey.” Some commentators thought that he had looked foolish—he’d laughed a lot, and when Biden laughs, he throws back his head. (Mark Salter, the Republican operative, called the Obama-Biden debate combination “sleepy cop/crystal-meth cop.”) But even many of the critics thought that he’d won. He had reminded a lot of people of why they wanted a Democrat in the White House, particularly on questions like income inequality. One of those people seems to have been Obama himself. He’d watched the debate on Air Force One and, though there wasn’t a plan for him to speak to reporters, he swung over to where they were standing.","June 12, 2015","887","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"

So I’m very proud of him.”","888","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"Obama also seemed, in the days to come, more proud of himself. Having Biden with him on the ticket in 2012 helped him win and, it seemed, helped make him a better President when he did. That was the case when what was scoffed at as yet another instance of Bidenic indiscipline—getting ahead of his boss by saying that he was “absolutely comfortable” with full legal recognition of same-sex marriage—led Obama, too, to say what he actually believed, and arrive at a place where he felt proud to be.","889","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"The idea that a person could make those around him better came up again this past weekend, when Obama delivered the eulogy for Biden’s son, Beau, who had died of brain cancer, at the age of forty-six. The Vice-President, by all accounts, was hit hard by his son’s death. In 1973, he had taken his Senate oath next to the hospital bed where Beau lay, at age three, after surviving the car crash that had killed Biden’s wife and daughter. He was also the son who had served in the reserves in Iraq, been elected as the attorney general of Delaware, and one day, perhaps, could go even further in politics than his father had. “He even looked and sounded like Joe, although I think Joe would be first to acknowledge that Beau was an upgrade—Joe 2.0,” Obama said. He added, “That’s who Beau was. Someone who cared. Someone who charmed you, and disarmed you, and put you at ease. When he’d have to attend a fancy fund-raiser with people who took themselves way too seriously, he’d walk over to you and whisper something wildly inappropriate in your ear.” (Joe Biden, for his part, has been known to whisper wildly inappropriate things, but when he was, for example, caught on an open mic telling Obama that the passage of the Affordable Care Act was “a big fucking deal,” he was reminding Obama that he should take something seriously.) At the funeral, Obama said that he loved Biden. The two have a weekly lunch; the most recent one was on Wednesday, Biden’s first day back at work since Beau’s death.","890","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"But Obama is almost done being President. Who else can Biden make better? Put another way, why doesn’t Biden run for President in 2016? Hillary Clinton may not want him to.

And it can only make the Democratic Party better.","891","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"Last year, Evan Osnos spoke to the Vice-President for a New Yorker Profile, and, Osnos wrote, “I asked Biden how he will respond if opponents say he is too old to be President. ‘I think it’s totally legitimate for people to raise it,’ he said. ‘And I’ll just say, Look at me. Decide.’ ’’ Biden is seventy-two. Hillary Clinton is sixty-seven. More tellingly, Biden added, “I watched my father. I made a mistake in encouraging him to retire. I just think as long as you think you can do it and you’re physically healthy….”","892","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"The Clintons have become very wealthy as a result of their book deals, speaking fees, and other endeavors—they have made thirty million dollars just since Hillary left the State Department. (Bill Clinton recently said that he would consider giving up paid speeches—after Hillary wins.) Joe Biden is not a very wealthy man. By one estimate, his net worth is between thirty-nine thousand and eight hundred thousand dollars; by another, with his mortgage figured in, it is a negative number. (Biden: “But I got a great pension and I got a good salary!”) Which way does that cut, for each of them? Perhaps it makes a Biden campaign less feasible, in that he has less flexibility; it might also make it more desirable, depending on one’s definition of independence.","893","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"Last week, Hillary Clinton almost lost to Bernie Sanders in a Wisconsin straw poll (the tally was forty-nine per cent to forty-one), but Sanders, who can reasonably be called a socialist, is not likely to be the one who makes clear what her real general-election vulnerabilities are, or how to overcome them. Biden would. He may have no chance of winning. But he is a more plausible candidate than anyone Clinton is facing now, and perhaps the best answer to the fear that, as the Republicans fight it out among themselves, she will drift through until the convention, with a stray glance at Martin O’Malley, and enter the general election unprepared for the fight. Obama was right about Biden’s debate with Ryan: rewatching it is a good reminder of his ability to speak plainly and in detail about Democratic economic policies—something that involves more than just throwing out lines about level playing fields. (Republicans have been doing that, too.) Maybe Hillary Clinton, in a speech she’s scheduled to give on Saturday, will find a way to make those themes work for her. She hasn’t yet.","894","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"And, although she served four years as Secretary of State, Biden has a deeper background in foreign policy, with years as a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a skepticism about things like troop deployments that might appeal to noninterventionists—who can be found across the spectrum. His 2006 proposal for Iraq—reshaping the country into a loose three-part federation—also much derided, does not, in light of recent events, look all that bad. (As it is, a sectarian Shiite-dominated central government unwilling to give a voice or commit resources to Sunni and Kurdish regions has contributed to the rise of ISIS.)","895","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"But how, might one ask, could Biden win in a general election when Obama, his boss, is so unpopular? That question points to what may be one of the most interesting results of having Biden in the race. Hillary Clinton would have to decide where she really stands on the Obama Presidency, in all its aspects, and say what she thinks about it. (He was her boss, too.) Her advisers have made it clear that she’s counting on the Obama coalition; how tied are their votes to the Obama legacy? Clinton needs a response that doesn’t just involve hinting that everything would have been better if she’d been elected in 2008. She tried out some jabs at Obama, in an interview with the Atlantic last August, in which, quoting one of his mantras, she said, “Great nations need organizing principles, and ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle,” and called his choices on Syria a “failure.” Her spokesman said afterward that she hadn’t meant to criticize the President, and looked forward “to hugging it out.” The message there, whatever it was, got muddled. Biden’s presence might clarify it, and present some interesting choices to Democratic primary voters—and to Obama, who might not endorse anyone before the nomination, but could give a few hints of his preference along the way.","896","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"

"On the evening of August 6th, when the news broke that Senator Charles Schumer would vote against the Iran accord, the Democratic Senate leader, Harry Reid, was as stunned as the rest of his caucus. The two men are close friends. When Reid became the leader, in 2005, Schumer was a backbencher, who mused about running for governor of New York. Reid took an interest in him, came to rely on both his fund-raising prowess with Wall Street and his counsel on a range of matters, and always advised his ambitious protégé, “Be patient, be patient.” Last March, when Reid announced that he would retire at the end of 2016, he endorsed Schumer to succeed him and announced that another contender, Richard Durbin, the Democratic whip (and Schumer’s former roommate), would stand down. For those progressives who questioned whether Schumer should be leader, Reid said that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders would keep the caucus honest. Now, because of Schumer’s position as presumptive leader, Reid felt that Schumer should have informed him of his decision on the Iran deal, given its importance, according to a Senate aide. Still, when a White House official called Reid that night to ask if he would announce his support of the deal to counter Schumer’s opposition, Reid refused, saying he wasn’t ready, a close associate said. (A spokesman for Senator Reid later issued a statement denying that Reid was surprised by Schumer’s announcement. “Their relationship is as close as ever. On Iran, Senator Reid respects the decision of conscience Senator Schumer made and he did not raise concerns with the announcement or the timing.”)*","August 17, 2015","898","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"
"More than a week has passed, and Reid still wonders why Schumer decided to announce his opposition when he did. Schumer was the first Democratic senator to oppose the deal. And it was his timing, perhaps even more than the substance of his decision, that has upset his pro-deal colleagues and, most unmistakably, the White House. Josh Earnest, the President’s press secretary, said he wouldn’t be surprised if some members of the Senate Democratic caucus “consider the voting record of those who say they would like to lead the caucus,” and he went on to liken Schumer’s decision to oppose the Iran deal to his support for the Iraq War, in 2003. It always seemed implausible that Schumer—an AIPAC stalwart who boasted that he is Benjamin Netanyahu’s best friend on Capitol Hill—would oppose AIPAC and Netanyahu on a deal they both claim is an existential threat to Israel. (I have written about AIPAC’s influence on politicians for the magazine.) “Chuck was always among the least likely Democrats to support the deal,” a longtime close friend of Schumer’s told me. And, after Schumer’s announcement, Durbin said, “I always expected him to be against the agreement.”","899","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"
"But the White House and some of Schumer’s Democratic colleagues strongly urged him not to announce his opposition until late August or early September. Republican leaders have set a vote in mid-September on a resolution to disapprove of the deal. Should that resolution pass, Obama has vowed to veto it. In a move that also surprised his colleagues, Schumer said that he would vote to override Obama’s veto as well. As another Senate staff member told me, “It is protocol, if you’re a member of the leadership who is going to oppose your President on a major issue like this, that you not do so in a way that is going to undercut the President and give the President’s opponents fodder to use against him.” Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, responded in an e-mail, “Senator Schumer was pressed both on the right and the left on the timing of his decision, but said from the very beginning that after careful deliberation, when he made up his mind, he would announce his decision publicly and explain the reasoning. He finished deliberating on that Wednesday afternoon, wrote his statement that evening, and published it soon after.”","900","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"
"In the days before Schumer’s announcement, momentum for the accord’s approval appeared to be building in the Senate. On Tuesday, August 4th, Barbara Boxer, Tim Kaine, and Bill Nelson announced their support. Two days later, Jeanne Shaheen and Kirsten Gillibrand came out in favor. Opposition to the deal is especially strong in New York and Florida, which have large numbers of Jewish voters, many of them conservative or right-wing on matters related to the Middle East, so Nelson, from Florida, and Gillibrand, from New York, were two senators whom AIPAC and other anti-deal forces were hoping to win. But two days before Gillibrand announced her decision, she attended a meeting with senior diplomats of America’s P5+1 negotiating partners on the deal: China, Russia, France, Britain, and Germany. The meeting, organized by Durbin, who is whipping his colleagues to vote for the deal, was attended by about thirty Democratic senators; Schumer skipped it. “Gillibrand asked each ambassador, If we reject this, what would your government do, in terms of going back for a better deal?” someone at the meeting recalled. “And they each said their government was not interested in any further negotiation with Iran on this subject. That’s the reality. Nonetheless, the basic line that’s been taken by AIPAC is, Go back for a better deal.” That has now become Schumer’s position as well. Gillibrand later said that the meeting helped convince her to support the deal.","901","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"
"After Gillibrand’s announcement, pro-deal forces were ebullient. The tide was strong. Some enjoyed imagining a panic at AIPAC. According to several Senate aides, they believed they were close to having enough votes to block Republicans on the resolution of disapproval itself, so that it would never reach the President and he wouldn’t have to exercise his veto. But hours later Schumer posted his decision online, in the form of a sixteen-hundred-word essay. “What Schumer has done now, unfortunately, is that he has made what was within realistic reach super-difficult,” the first Senate aide said. “By coming out so early, before recess, it’s been really detrimental to the cause of the President and other Senate Democrats who want to be in favor of this deal, because now he’s given a lot of time for senators on the fence to be hit with political attacks like, ‘Why aren’t you where Schumer is? He’s leading; why are you so weak?’ ” The aide continued, “If he wanted to be helpful, as future leader of the caucus, he could have waited. He personally would have had to withstand pressure back home, in exchange for helping out his colleagues. Instead, he said, I’m going to take the pressure off myself and put the pressure on my colleagues.”","902","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"
"On Saturday, that dynamic played out in a full-page ad in the Times—the first, but surely not the last. Featuring side-by-side images of Schumer and Senator Cory Booker, the ad demanded, “Senator Cory Booker: Will you join Senator Schumer and reject the catastrophic Iran deal?” It implored Booker to do so “before Iranian nukes kill millions of Americans.” Among those who funded the ad was the World Values Network, whose executive director, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, is a longtime close friend of Booker but, evidently, not loath to exert intense public pressure. Booker is viewed as undecided.","903","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"
"As of today, twenty Democratic senators have come out in favor of the deal; a total of thirty-four are needed to sustain the President’s veto. “It’s still very much an open question whether we can sustain a veto,” a third Senate aide said. “It will depend on how hard the deal is whipped against within the caucus.” Schumer, by nature an aggressive whip, known for his “full Chuck Schumer” style, is working against Durbin, who chose not to try to contest Reid’s endorsement of Schumer for leader. Schumer’s statements on the subject of his whipping, or not, have been ambiguous. A relentless phone canvasser, he has acknowledged he is making calls to members. “I will certainly share my view and try to persuade them that the vote to disapprove is the right one,” he said, in what might constitute a definition of whipping, but he added that, in the Senate, members make up their own minds—“especially in matters of conscience and great consequence, like this.”","904","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"
"Schumer is a strong tactician. Before making his decision to oppose the accord at the time he did, he almost certainly calculated how it would affect his prospects in the leadership election, in 2016. He must also have given thought to the long-term ramifications of this vote, and how it will affect the fortunes of the Party he plans to lead. At this point, what no one but Schumer (and perhaps AIPAC) seems to know is whether he wants to do all he can, albeit quietly, to kill the deal. If he does, will he try to persuade Harry Reid to join him in opposing it? And what effect might that have on senators, perhaps up for reëlection, facing threats, who are wavering?","905","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-schumers-iran-decision-played-with-senate-democrats"

"The Times report that Vice-President Joe Biden is seriously considering entering the 2016 Presidential race isn’t exactly news. He’s been mulling such a move for at least a couple of years. “It’s as likely I run as I don’t run,” Biden said on the talk show “The View” in February, 2014. In an interview with Politico’s Glenn Thrush that month, he laid out the sort of campaign he could conduct, focussing on rising inequality and the wage squeeze. “It’s either going to be me or someone else who is going to make this argument in the Democratic Party.” As I wrote at the time, “He’s still full of energy, he’s served President Obama loyally, he loves the game, and he thinks—pundits and pollsters be damned—that this might be the moment for an old-school, shit-kicking, hand-grasping, mouth-running, stick-up-for-the-working-stiff pol like himself.”","August 3, 2015","926","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"During the year and a half after those stories appeared, Hillary Clinton cemented her position as a prohibitive favorite for the Democratic nomination, and most pundits assumed Biden was out. That was premature. In January of this year, he told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos that he still hadn’t made up his mind, noting, “There’s plenty of time.” Now, however, the clock is ticking. In recent weeks, as Amy Chozick, of the Times, reported on Saturday, some of Biden’s aides have been meeting with potential donors and campaign staffers who have not yet committed to Clinton. The report said that confidants of Biden expect him to make a final decision one way or the other by early September.","927","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Two things appear to have prompted Biden to get serious. The first was the death, in May, of his forty-six-year-old son Beau, who had urged his father to take a third and final tilt at the Presidency. (Biden’s previous campaigns were in 1988 and 2008.) The other factor was the growing perception among political professionals that Clinton could be vulnerable in a general election, which is partly based on polling data showing that many voters distrust her. “The No. 1 thing voters want is a candidate who is honest and trustworthy, and the veep is leading in those polls,” William Pierce, the executive director of the Draft Biden 2016 super PAC, told Chozick.","928","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"The poll that Pierce was referring to was carried out by Quinnipiac University and released late last week. It found that just thirty-seven per cent of likely voters find Clinton “honest and trustworthy,” and that fifty-seven per cent don’t. For Biden, the figures were reversed. Fifty-eight per cent of the respondents said that they found him honest and trustworthy; thirty-four per cent said they didn’t. The Vice-President also led the former Secretary of State on the issue of empathy. Asked whether he “cares about the needs and problems of people like you or not,” fifty-seven per cent said yes, and thirty-five per cent said no. When the pollsters asked the same question about Clinton, forty-five per cent of people said yes, and fifty-two per cent said no.","929","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"This was just one poll, and its results didn’t all come out in Biden’s favor. Fifty-eight per cent of respondents said that Clinton had “strong leadership qualities,” compared to fifty-two per cent for Biden. Still, the survey found that in head-to-head contests with the Republican candidates, Biden did at least as well as Clinton. In a matchup with Jeb Bush, Clinton trailed by one percentage point, and Biden led by one point; in a matchup with Donald Trump, they both led by twelve percentage points.","930","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"If these figures are taken at face value, they suggest that Biden could be a viable candidate in the general election. But in order to get there, he would have to overcome Clinton’s enormous lead in money, organization, and electoral support. The Clinton campaign has already raised well over fifty million dollars, and it is aiming to raise a hundred million by the end of the year. (That doesn’t count all the money that will be raised by super PACs and other organizations allied with Hillary.) Clinton already has big political operations in the early voting states. And, according to the Huffington Post’s poll average, she is leading Bernie Sanders by 56.9 per cent to 18.9 per cent among likely Democratic voters.","931","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Although he’s not currently a candidate, Biden is in third place, with twelve per cent of the vote. If he were to enter the race, that figure would almost certainly rise, at least for a while. But he would still be a long-shot candidate. Positioning himself to the left of Clinton, he would be competing with Bernie Sanders for the votes of progressive Democrats, some of whom wouldn’t welcome his late entry. He would also need to pick up support from moderates who have doubts about the Clintons.","932","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"At seventy-two, Biden potentially faces an age issue. (Clinton is five years his junior; Sanders is a year older.) A bigger challenge, however, might be demonstrating that he has what it takes to be President. Despite his long history as a senator and Vice-President, many members of the political and media establishment have long seen him as lacking the necessary gravitas and depth for the highest office. Doubts about Biden’s seriousness date back to his 1988 Presidential bid, which was derailed by allegations that he had exaggerated his college record and plagiarized part of a speech.","933","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Nineteen eighty-eight is a long time ago, and Biden has achieved a lot since then, including serving as Vice-President for the past six and a half years. An eminently decent and likable man, he has never had the stench of corruption that attaches itself to many people who stay in Washington for a long time. About the worst that you hear said about him is that he is a blowhard who occasionally blurts out embarrassing things.","934","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"In an era of scripted politicians and carefully orchestrated campaigns, some Democrats may see Biden’s spontaneity as a plus. And the issues of the moment play to his strengths. As long ago as 1988, he was talking about increasing social mobility, defending the middle class, and challenging the notion that you can’t buck the market. “For too long in this society, we have celebrated unrestrained individualism over common community,” he said in his first announcement speech. “For too long as a nation, we have been lulled by the anthem of self-interest. . . . We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference.”","935","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Back then, Biden was a youngish Roman Catholic pol on the up, and, doubtless, the echoes of John F. Kennedy in his speech were deliberate. Today, he is older and more grizzled (as are many of the rest of us). Taking on the Clintons and the Republicans is a task that would give anyone pause, let alone a seventy-two-year-old who has just lost his son. Even after the latest round of speculation, it is perfectly possible, indeed likely, that he will stay out of the race. But if he decides to give it a go, he might surprise a few people.","936","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"It’s been more than twenty years since the United States entered its last big trade agreement, with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It has been more than ten years since Barack Obama stood up at the 2004 Democratic Convention, in Boston, and said, “We have more work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that’s moving to Mexico, and now they’re having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour.”","May 14, 2015","937","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"The impact of trade and trade deals on American workers remains a huge issue, even as President Obama seeks to persuade skeptical Democrats on Capitol Hill to give him the power to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership (T.P.P.), a new agreement with eleven other Pacific Rim countries, including Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Australia, and Peru. Earlier this week, the President suffered an embarrassing setback in the Senate, where forty-five Democrats voted to prevent a debate on so-called trade promotion authority for the deal. The White House and its allies are hoping to get things back on track by offering dissident Democrats a series of votes on different aspects of the T.P.P. If this plan works, it would allow Democrats to register their concerns on such issues as alleged currency manipulation by America’s trading partners, but would leave in place the essential elements of the proposed agreement. (On Thursday, the Senate voted, sixty-five to thirty-three, to move ahead and consider giving Obama trade promotion authority, which would enable him to negotiate a trade deal in its entirety and present it to Congress for a single yes-or-no vote.)","938","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"About the only surprising thing in the Democratic rebellion is that it appears to have taken the White House by surprise. Anybody who was following the issue knew that the T.P.P. was becoming increasingly unpopular in Democratic circles. It wasn’t just labor unions and progressive crusaders, such as senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who were questioning whether it was a good idea to give the President the power he wanted.","939","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"Many moderate Democratic senators have been put off by the secrecy surrounding the putative agreement, which has been in negotiations since 2010 and whose provisional text is classified, and they are also concerned that it would exert more pressure on the jobs and wages of American workers. On top of this, several prominent Democratic-leaning economists who supported previous trade deals, such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman, have expressed concerns about this one, noting that some of the biggest beneficiaries would likely be big multinational companies with large intellectual-property holdings, such as pharmaceutical corporations and Hollywood film studios. (The T.P.P. would strengthen protections for trademarks, copyrights, and patents.)","940","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"In responding to this opposition, Obama took on Senator Warren and other critics last month, telling MSNBC, “I would not be doing this trade deal if I did not think it was good for the middle class. And when you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is, when you dig into the facts, they are wrong.”","941","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"On one of the specific issues Warren raised, about whether the trade deal could be used to undermine the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, Obama might be right, although we’ll have to take it on trust; the text of the provisional agreement is classified. (When Senator Barbara Boxer went to inspect it in a secure room at the Capitol, a guard told her she couldn’t take notes.) A number of legal experts, however, including Yale’s Judith Resnik and Harvard’s Laurence Tribe, have raised similar concerns to the ones Warren expressed, warning that the T.P.P. could allow corporations and investors to challenge the laws and policies of member countries, including the United States, outside the scope of their existing legal system. In a recent letter to congressional leaders, the experts referred to a known provision of the T.P.P., which would see disputes resolved not by the courts but by a new conflict-resolution panel, the prospective makeup of which is far from clear. This panel “risks undermining democratic norms because laws and regulations enacted by democratically elected officials are put at risk in a process insulated from democratic input,” they warned.","942","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"President Obama hasn’t addressed all of these concerns, and he has also failed to provide much backing for his assertion that the T.P.P. would be beneficial to the middle class. The most widely quoted study of the deal’s likely effect, which was carried out by three economists associated with the pro-free-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics, found that its impact would be modest. By 2025, the study said, the deal would boost over-all U.S. income by about 0.4 per cent of G.D.P. If this is accurate, the new trade deal won’t have much effect either way on American incomes.","943","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"But that isn’t the full story. In an important recent paper, Josh Bivens, of the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute, pointed out that estimates like the one produced by the Peterson Institute don’t take into account the distributional aspects of trade agreements. The traditional argument for free trade is that it reallocates resources, workers included, to their most productive uses, and that this causes over-all income and output to rise. But this churning process doesn’t only create winners, such as consumers who can buy lower-cost imported goods. It also creates losers, such as the Maytag-plant workers in Illinois and many others who make things that poorer countries can produce more cheaply because they have lower wages.","944","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"To be sure, some Americans might see their wages rise if the T.P.P. is signed, especially if they find jobs in U.S. export industries that retain a competitive advantage, like airline manufacturing and film production. (A recent report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers stresses this point.) But since businesses that are vulnerable to cheap foreign competition, such as textile factories and customer call centers, tend to be more labor intensive than export industries, the over-all impact will be negative. Or, as Bivens, puts it, “If expanded trade does lead to a reshuffling of domestic production from importables to exportables, then it will increase inequality and drag on wages for a large majority of American workers.”","945","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"There is a strong counter to this depressing scenario, but it’s a long-term one, and making it would involve acknowledging the sacrifices that American workers are being asked to make, not pretending they don’t exist. Over time—decades, rather than the next few years—the integration into the world economy of countries like Vietnam and Malaysia should generate higher rates of growth and prosperity for everybody, American workers included. As the global market gets bigger and global trade continues to expand, living standards will gradually rise in developing countries, and the sons and daughters of today’s sweatshop workers will become big consumers of American-made and American-designed products. Indeed, we can already see this happening. China is now the biggest auto market in the world, and General Motors sells as many vehicles there as it does in the United States. Apple sells more iPhones in China than it sells in the United States.","946","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"Guaranteeing American firms access to fast-growing Asian markets makes sense, but nobody should pretend that it is cost-free. As long as wages in developing countries remain a fraction of U.S. wages, multinational companies will have a significant incentive to incorporate workers from these nations into their global supply chains and, where necessary, to substitute them for American workers. Even where firms don’t end up shuttering their U.S. plants and offices, the threat of offshoring and outsourcing will continue to exert downward pressure on the wages of many American workers.","947","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"
"That is the reality of the world we live in. When President Obama says we can’t close our eyes to it, or turn our backs on it, he is correct. But his arguments would be more persuasive if he did what he did in 2004, and also spoke about the downsides of free trade and globalization.","948","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-cognitive-dissonance-on-trade"

"For observers of Joe Biden—and anyone who wonders whether he will challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Presidential nomination—there was a small, telling moment in April, 2014, during a routine interview with “CBS This Morning.” Vice-President Biden and President Barack Obama were side by side when the reporter, Major Garrett, asked about the 2016 race. Biden gave the ritual denials (“If I decide to run, this is the first guy I’d talk to, but that decision hasn’t been made”) before Obama lavished praise upon him as “a great partner in everything I do.” Then Obama began to talk about someone else: “I suspect that there may be other potential candidates for 2016 who have been great friends and allies. We’ve got an extraordinary Secretary of State who did great service for us, for me and Joe.” Biden looked away, then back to the President, with a strained smile. It was no endorsement of Hillary Clinton. It was nothing—unless you want to know how Joe Biden makes decisions.","August 4, 2015","950","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"Over the weekend, Biden supporters sent up a trial balloon to see what the world would think of the Vice-President joining the race. Maureen Dowd reported that, shortly before Beau Biden, the Vice-President’s eldest son, died of a brain tumor, in May, he encouraged his father to run. Some of Biden’s advisers have been contacting uncommitted Democratic donors, seeking to test their ability to marshal a campaign in a hurry, to measure Clinton’s vulnerability, and to see whether Biden might tap the evident desire for a non-Clinton option, which has fuelled the surprising early success of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.","951","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"Reaction to the Biden prospect has been polite but practical. My colleague Ryan Lizza asked where Biden’s advantage over Clinton was in various areas—youth, gender, broad party support, “lefty cred,” money, and campaign strength—and found none. There was a time when Biden (who is almost five years older than Clinton) thought he had an angle, at least on lefty cred. Early last year, he began to stake out a populist economic appeal, telling a United Auto Workers audience, “You guys are the only guys keeping the barbarians at the gates, man.” He warned that conservatives have launched “a concerted, full-throated, well-organized, well-financed, well-thought-out effort waging war on labor’s house.” Since then, Sanders has staked out that territory, leaving Biden less room to maneuver.","952","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"But another factor that, for the moment, weighs against a Biden run has more to do with his chemistry than with his competition. While reporting a Profile last year, I heard him return over and over to matters of respect. His father, Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr., was a car salesman who quit a stable job because his boss was imperious. One of Biden’s old-world, Scranton sensibilities is that he never forgets who afforded him respect and who withheld it; he still talks about the grade-school students who humiliated him for a childhood stutter, and his aides learn quickly that Biden hates nothing more than embarrassment. A former adviser recalled prepping Biden to ask a European leader for a favor; when the leader unexpectedly said no, Biden froze: “He hangs up the phone, and he’s like, ‘Don’t ever set me up like that again. It’s O.K. if we can’t move the ball; I’ll still make the call, but you’ve got to tell me.’”","953","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"As a candidate, Biden would have to contend, once again, with the plagiarism scandal that drove him out of the 1988 race, and, given the choice between spending the next year as a trusted Vice-President or a third-time candidate trailing Hillary Clinton, Biden would likely be reluctant to subject himself to it. Then again, if that changes—if Clinton’s favorability drops sharply, or if she looks wounded, don’t expect Biden to defer to her (or to Bernie).","954","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"If Biden doesn’t run, his greatest assist to his party will be if he can help Clinton find a way to leverage his most enduring asset: his willingness to express the kind of authentic emotion that is rare in American politics. It is a cliché to note that Clinton’s strongest moment as a candidate came in 2007, when she choked up before voters in New Hampshire, but it’s still true. Biden generates that kind of connection with people more frequently—often outside of public view. In “Hope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland,” two women who were kidnapped by the school-bus driver Ariel Castro and later escaped recalled meeting Biden at the White House. Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus thought that they were there for a quick grip-and-grin. He sat with them for forty-five minutes, and then invited them to lunch—while he pushed off other meetings and told them about the car accident, in 1972, that killed his wife and daughter. In their memoir, written with the journalists Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan, Berry recalled the encounter:","955","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"

"The twenty-first-century boom in new translations of the great nineteenth-century Russian novels has not encompassed one significant work: the last of Leo Tolstoy’s three full-length novels, “Resurrection,” originally published in 1899.

"It’s easy to see why this is so. Both “War and Peace” and “Anna Karenina” have Tolstoy-like characters—Pierre Bezukhov and Konstantin Levin—who chafe at the self-satisfaction, relentless social striving, and oppressive economic underpinnings of the Russian aristocracy into which they were born. Both are drawn to reformist spiritual and political ideas. But in “Resurrection” the main character, Dmitri Nekhlyudov, another landowning aristocrat, goes a step further, into what appears to be full-bore rejection of his world and its values. He institutes land reform on his estates, and leaves the Russia of cities and country homes to undertake a long eastward journey to Siberia, where a household servant he seduced and abandoned years earlier has been unjustly imprisoned. Where “War and Peace” and “Anna Karenina” presented the life of a corrupt society with astonishing richness and subtlety, “Resurrection” is relentlessly preachy, prudish, and joyless.","958","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection"
"There is a strain of American liberalism that offers government as a sensible, useful way to make society function better than it does now—as a problem-solving instrument that conservatives are too stubbornly prejudiced to employ. That is Bill Clinton’s liberalism. And then there’s the Tolstoyan strain, in which it’s evident that society works well only for a fortunate minority, whose elaborately enjoyed well-being may even have come at the expense of the majority. Tolstoyan liberalism is, like its namesake, élite liberalism—more Franklin Roosevelt (who grew up on an American inherited dacha farmed by peasants) than Eugene Debs, or for that matter Elizabeth Warren. Tolstoy offers a harsh critique, but from an insider’s perspective; it treats the system as deeply flawed, but not as utterly alien. In her 2016 Presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton has been publicly flirting with Tolstoyan liberalism.","959","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection"
"Long before she announced her candidacy, Clinton surrounded herself with advisers from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, and banished the centrists who controlled her last campaign. Her April announcement video and first campaign speech last month hinted at a left-populist direction that continued, with more bite, in her first big economic-policy address this week. This wasn’t where her husband had ever gone, or where she had been in 2008.","960","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection"

Does she finally feel free to express what have always been her opinions?","961","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection"
"This week’s speech left the answers to such questions where they usually are with Clinton—tantalizingly uncertain. She left all but a few specifics of her economic policies to be unveiled in speeches to come, and she made sure to praise small business, entrepreneurship, and investment. But she criticized Wall Street by name and by specific practices (her Web site has a section called “Rein in Wall Street”), and criticized Uber and AirbnB, sacred causes in Silicon Valley, without naming them, by saying that their advent is “raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future.” This demonstrates a willingness to risk alienating the subcultures where some of the Democratic Party’s biggest donors dwell. (On Friday, President Obama will appear at a fund-raiser at the San Francisco home of Shervin Pishevar, one of Uber’s founding investors.) And there was no commensurate implicit challenge to organized labor, which both Clintons and Obama have tangled with in the past.","962","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection"
"It felt as if Clinton were crossing a line, policy specifics or no, in the way she was choosing to frame economic questions. First, she made it clear that the traditionally safe zone for American political discourse about the economy—calling for equality of opportunity, not equality of result—was no longer sufficient for her. Her target is “strong and steady income growth” for ordinary working people, which can presumably be measured only by how much money people wind up with, not how fair a chance they had to make it. And second, she at least toyed with the theme of resentment of the rich—another area Democratic politicians of the past generation, including Clinton herself, have generally avoided—as when she responded to Jeb Bush’s exhortation to Americans to work longer hours by saying, “Let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day or the trucker who drives all night. Let him tell that to the fast-food workers marching in the streets for better pay. They don’t need a lecture—they need a raise.”","963","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection"
"Tolstoy, even though he was deep into his final holy-moralist phrase, didn’t quite know what to do with Nekhlyudov at the end of “Resurrection.” Having set out on his Siberian journey resolved to give everything away and to marry his wronged former mistress, the hero is perhaps relieved to learn that she refuses to marry him. He’s free, and it seems possible that he might return to some version of the former life he had been determined to reject. He still seems more comfortable at a dinner party than in the company of the political prisoners he encounters in the proto-gulag.","964","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection"
"Hillary Clinton wasn’t born an aristocrat, but she functions as one now, and, assuming she becomes a major-party nominee, she can only take her new and rather profound critique of how well American society functions so far. She won’t, and can’t, run, or live, as a radical. So it’s a question of finding the right equipoise. The practice of American politics almost always requires rhetorical optimism; the practice of liberal American politics now seems also to require just the right measure of opprobrium directed at the way our country is run. What’s interesting about Clinton’s struggle to find the balance is that she is struggling to find it, as she hasn’t in the past. And it will be even more interesting to see what she does with it, if she gets the chance to govern.","965","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection"

At the time, he had yet to announce his bid for the Republican Presidential nomination. He was a bit gruff, slightly leathery, stoutly devoted to the free market but unexpectedly far-ranging in his reference points and curiosities. He lamented the packed schedule of the hustling politician, which meant too many days away from his beloved home in Ohio. He mentioned one gripe in particular: “It’s killing me I’m not going to see Linkin Park in a couple weeks.”","August 21, 2015","966","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/when-politicians-make-playlists"
"I was taken aback, not only because I didn’t realize that such a sentiment was still possible, least of all from a person who wasn’t sixteen in the year 2001. I wondered why he, soon to be, as we all already knew, a candidate for leader of the free world, would offer this specific glance into his private mind-garden. Every verb and pause had had the feeling of careful, precise stage management. What was his affection for Linkin Park meant to signal? Is this how a contemporary politician unwinds, to the easy bipartisanship of the Southern California band’s rap-rock fusion? Do Linkin Park fans comprise a secret swing constituency nobody knows about? Had their breakthrough début, “Hybrid Theory,” become some talisman for traditional values and can-do neoliberalism? As I wondered all these things, Kasich breezed through his views on the safety net and health insurance, faith and job creation, his close friendship with Eric Schmidt and Ohio’s numerous partnerships with Google. He was offering his vision for a better America and I couldn’t move past the fact that he probably knew who Chester Bennington was.","967","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/when-politicians-make-playlists"
"Then again, maybe that was the point. These kinds of details always acquire more purchase during campaign season, when politicians try and relate to normal people with a kind of surgical vigor, eating at regional fast-food chains, sipping carefully screened beers, dropping off-the-cuff references to favorite movies. This game became freighted with new meaning during the culture wars, when high-level disapproval of a sitcom or a song became a referendum on national values. Kasich has spoken of his fondness for Linkin Park elsewhere, and he famously tried to get on stage at a Grateful Dead show in the early nineties. But no politician has been able to spin personal taste into political zeal quite like President Barack Obama. Last week, the White House announced that Obama had joined Spotify, posting two of his personal playlists, one for summer days and the other for nighttime.","968","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/when-politicians-make-playlists"

But the playlists were a reminder of Obama’s influence on American culture and of the way he has become a sort of lifestyle brand thanks to his Administration’s indefatigable efforts to put him wherever young people might see him, from the late-night establishment and ESPN to the comparatively niche audiences of Vice News, “Between Two Ferns,” and “WTF.” Once, Bill Clinton pantomimed cool by playing the sax on the “Arsenio Hall Show”; now, we have a President who seems intent on proving that he’s not too cool for the occasional Coldplay song.","969","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/when-politicians-make-playlists"
"There’s an intriguing blandness in these playlists, which come off like eager attempts to soften and humanize our Commander-in-Chief. They’re filled with ubiquitous classics by baby-boomer icons: Aretha Franklin, the Rolling Stones, the Temptations, Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell. There are the obvious artists represented by less-obvious songs: Bob Dylan’s “Tombstone Blues,” Bob Marley’s “So Much Trouble in the World,” selections that seem to telegraph a sense of idiosyncratic deliberation. There are song titles that passive-aggressively nudge-wink toward the remains of the President’s political vision: Frank Sinatra’s “The Best is Yet to Come,” Otis Redding’s “I’ve Got Dreams to Remember.” There’s John Coltrane (“My Favorite Things”) and Miles Davis (“Flamenco Sketches”) approaching the crossroads, as each was transitioning from squarely cool to transcendently wild.","970","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/when-politicians-make-playlists"
"My favorite detail from the Obama backstory involves his first date with the future First Lady, when they went to see Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing.” (A close second: his circa-college affection for the Flying Lizards.) But perhaps that was a different projection of persona for a different political moment. The past is well represented on Obama’s playlists, albeit in a “Big Chill” kind of way. It’s not that I expected to see “Fight the Power” on here. But this is a version of the past that largely sidesteps the anti-establishment edge of post-punk or hip-hop, though Obama has expressed his fondness for these genres. Instead, there are defiant artists captured in their cheeriest, most uplifting poses: Nina Simone’s “Feeling Good,” Mos Def’s “UMI Says.” There’s the Spanish hip-hop of Mala Rodriguez, a salsa workout by Sonora Carruseles. There’s no hat-tip to country music, which almost, in this context, reads as a gesture of micro-defiance.","971","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/when-politicians-make-playlists"
"At a time when so many of our everyday choices get gussied up in the language of “curation,” playlists and d.j.s (particularly celebrity d.j.s) have taken on an elevated role. The playlist has become a kind of biographical shorthand, a way of communicating something essential about ourselves through the performance of taste. Of course, taste and relatability mean something different when they involve someone with drones at his disposal. These are playlists meant to convey a set of values: knowledge of the past, an open ear, an interest in the future. There are the safe, modern-day crowd-pleasers like the Lumineers and Florence and the Machine alongside relative obscurities like Low Cut Connie and Aoife O’Donovan. There is no Linkin Park. And of course there is Beyoncé’s “Superpower,” because even the most powerful leader in the world wouldn’t dare snub the most beloved human on the planet.","972","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/when-politicians-make-playlists"
"The two times I have called Philip Glass at home, I have interrupted his composing. In 2012, during the same week that the début recording of his Symphony No. 9 was on the front page of the iTunes store, Glass told me that he had recently finished Symphony No. 10, and that he was already moving onto a new opera project. (He was also about to turn seventy-five.) This week, when a documentary crew took to Kickstarter to find funds to finish a movie about Glass’s first opera with the director Robert Wilson—the four-hour-plus, non-narrative stage extravaganza “Einstein on the Beach”—I found Glass at work once again, just before 9 A.M. “I’m doing something now, and I’d like to continue doing it,” he said, congenially. We agreed that I’d call again in a few hours.","June 4, 2015","973","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"Philip Glass never stops writing, it seems, though public opportunities to absorb his work aren’t always as steady. With “Einstein on the Beach,” specifically, Glass distinguishes between recordings of his score and the experience of the live opera, full productions of which are hard to come by. Speaking of the opera’s popular legacy, Glass told me that “the whole visual element of the piece [was] simply neglected for practical reasons. We could record it, no problem, but we couldn’t film it.” And yet the opera is co-credited to both Glass and Wilson for good reason: the director’s stage designs predated and influenced Glass’s music. “You could look at images of it,” Glass said when I called him back at our appointed time, before adding that something would inevitably be missing for those who hadn’t caught the original production, in 1976, or else its revivals in 1984, 1992, and 2012.","974","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"Enter the documentarian John Walter, who followed the 2012 world-tour revival of “Einstein on the Beach.” Glass told me that both he and Wilson had long doubted the ability of a video crew to capture the manic, all-over-the-stage density of Wilson’s “Einstein” staging. But an eight-camera shoot of a performance in Paris “bowled me over,” Glass said. “It was far better than what we thought was possible.” In the years since, Walter has been working on “The Earth Moves,” his documentary about the opera and what is likely to be its last revival under the supervision of the original creative team.","975","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"“He invited me down to see different parts of it, and I have to say, he is an extraordinarily good filmmaker,” Glass said. A look at the trailer for the film, hosted on the Kickstarter page, shows that Walter has indeed done his homework. While he’s had access to Glass, Wilson, and their collaborators, “The Earth Moves” also surveys the impressions of other key artists from the New York of that moment, such as John Lurie and Laurie Anderson. Though one prior documentary about “Einstein” exists—1985’s one-hour “Einstein on the Beach: The Changing Image of Opera”—Walter’s project has the benefit of a longer and deeper artistic legacy on which to report.","976","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"“In context of the expenses, it’s probably not very much,” Glass said of the hundred-thousand-dollar fundraising goal that Walter set on Kickstarter. “But in terms of the real world, it’s not pocket money. It’s serious money; it had to be found.” To that end, he’s offering up the first page of the “Einstein” score, written in his own hand, for the price of $10,000. “We have to do it,” Glass said. “We’re short!”","977","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"With Glass still on the phone, I took the opportunity to ask what he had been writing when I called him earlier. “I’m working on one of the last scenes of ‘Appomattox,’ which is an opera that’s being done at the Kennedy Center in November. I’m at the end of the writing process; we’re five months before opening night.”","978","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"This was a surprising answer, given that Glass’s opera about Lee’s surrender to Grant premièred at the San Francisco Opera in 2007. “What’s happened since then is that the Supreme Court did its best to get rid of the affirmative right to vote,” Glass explained, in a reference to the Court’s recent decision in Shelby County v. Holder. “And then when the Washington Opera said they would like to do ‘Appomattox’ as part of the 150th anniversary of the Civil War … I said, ‘Well now I have to rewrite the second act,’ because I can’t end it where I ended it. … Now in the opera we have L.B.J. and Martin Luther King and George Wallace and J. Edgar Hoover. They’re there now in Act II—they were not at all in the other version. Which actually was quite O.K. until we discovered that the Civil War isn’t over yet.”","979","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"During a longer conversation about politics that followed, we talked about Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders (the composer likes the Vermont senator’s focus on inequality) and the possibility of “quasi-anarchy” in America’s future. “But, at any rate, now we’re getting back to ‘Einstein,’ which is supposed to be what we’re talking about,” Glass eventually said, steering us back on course. “When I look back on it, I see that there is a borderline chaos in ‘Einstein,’ which we like about it. Which many of us in America like. It gets you up in the morning. It gets you going! Maybe that’s too irreverent, but I think you get the gist.” And since he has only five months left to revise an opera before it hits the Kennedy Center stage, it’s here that I realize that I’ve taken enough of the composer’s time, and that he needs to get back to work.","980","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"Hillary Clinton, in her memoir “Living History,” recounts her struggle to defend her privacy while residing in the White House. Some of her stories have a gothic tone. After Bill Clinton’s first inauguration, Harry and Linda Thomason, friends from Hollywood, found a jocular note under a pillow in the Lincoln Bedroom. It was from Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host. How did the note get there? “I don’t believe in ghosts, but we did sometimes feel that the White House was haunted by more temporal entities,” Clinton writes.","981","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"A few months later, as she grieved over the death of her father, she noticed that furniture in the living quarters had been disturbed. She discovered that security officers had searched for bugging devices, without consulting her. “I suddenly remembered the Rush Limbaugh note,” she writes. “I was undone by the invasion of privacy. Yes, we were living in a house that belongs to our nation. But there’s an understanding that individuals who occupy it are allowed some rooms of their own.”","982","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"That sensibility partly explains this summer’s Clinton non-scandal or mini-scandal or proto-scandal, as it may be. The matter arose from a decision by Clinton when she was the Secretary of State to eschew the government’s e-mail system for a private one. In this hot summer of Donald Trump’s smash reality show and excited crowds for Clinton’s Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders, the e-mail imbroglio is giving her supporters indigestion. The headlines recall the bewildering, partisan-inflamed, and largely inconsequential controversies that surfaced during her husband’s Presidency—Whitewater, Travelgate, the Paula Jones case, the Monica Lewinsky matter, and, finally, President Clinton’s impeachment hearings. It was an era in Washington about which only white-collar defense lawyers may feel nostalgic.","983","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"Now the Clintons again confront a scrum of Republican congressmen and conservative activists who are clearly out to get them. Yet the tenacity of Republican opposition researchers does not by itself explain why Clinton and her husband are so often beset by accusation. Both of them too often co-author their dramas by obfuscating and tolerating conflicts of interest, such as when, between 2009 and 2013, with Hillary Clinton guiding American foreign policy, the Clinton Foundation accepted large donations from foreign governments, including several that abuse human rights.","984","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"The e-mail case is, so far, a more ambiguous tangle. In late 2008 or early 2009, the incoming Secretary installed a private server at her New York home. She has said that she wanted to avoid carrying multiple e-mail devices, something that using the State Department system might have required. “What was supposed to be convenient has turned out to be anything but convenient,” Clinton remarked last week. Late last year, Clinton turned over to the State Department about thirty thousand e-mails from her home system. But, before doing so, she and her attorneys singled out more than thirty thousand other e-mails, which they deemed to be “private,” and, as far as is known, deleted them permanently. Clinton has said that the deleted notes concerned only “yoga routines, family vacations,” and the like. Her unilateral culling raised eyebrows, but her lawyers approved her action, and her assertion of privacy rights seems to have resonated with Democratic voters.","985","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"Now, however, the F.B.I. is involved. This is because an inspector general for U.S. intelligence agencies, and another for the State Department, reviewed a sample of Clinton’s e-mails and identified classified information in some of them. By near-automatic protocol, that finding was referred to the Justice Department. One of the F.B.I.’s tasks in the weeks ahead will be to look into whether, amid all the e-mailing to and from Secretary Clinton, any crime may have been committed, by anyone. There is no indication that Clinton is the target of a criminal inquiry.","986","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"Unfortunately for the candidate, though, the law around handling classified information can resemble a house of mirrors. The federal government routinely classifies many more documents than it needs to, including ones containing publicly known or harmless information. Consequently, government employees must treat subjects widely covered in the media, such as the fact that the U.S. carries out lethal drone strikes, as if they were super-secret. And even the most innocuous discussions with foreign government officials may be judged classified. This is often silly, yet the F.B.I. goes by the book. If Clinton and her aides swapped classified information over an unsecured e-mail system, they could be questioned about mishandling state secrets.","987","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"That misdemeanor has ensnared several high office-holders in the recent past. In 2001, John Deutch, President Clinton’s second C.I.A. director, admitted to a single count of mishandling classified material, because he kept top-secret files at home on a Macintosh connected to the open Internet. (Bill Clinton pardoned him.) In 2005, Samuel Berger, a former Clinton Administration national-security adviser, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, because, after leaving office—for reasons that remain unclear—he removed classified documents from the National Archives and destroyed them. Earlier this year, General David Petraeus pleaded to a misdemeanor after allowing his mistress and biographer to read sensitive notebooks that he kept when he ran the C.I.A.","988","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"In each of those cases, the evidence of serious or willful neglect was much clearer than anything that has emerged about Hillary Clinton’s e-mailing. It has not yet been independently determined whether any of the classified information in her correspondence was marked as such, for example, or how sensitive the secrets discussed might have been. Still, it is conceivable that more striking evidence of deception or serious neglect may eventually surface, and, in any event, the investigations will go on—and on and on, if past inquiries of this type are any guide.","989","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"Hillary Clinton’s vulnerabilities as a Presidential candidate are visible and often remarked upon—conspicuous wealth, a self-protecting style, and the baggage accumulated during three decades in public life. Her strengths are less often acknowledged. For one thing, she is a formidable campaigner—always on message, gaffe-free in debates and town halls, encyclopedic on policy, and comfortable with confrontation and competition. News cycles about faltering front-runners are as much a ritual of early primary seasons as eating pork on a stick at the Iowa State Fair. Hillary Clinton’s campaign is only starting. It will likely be another August before anyone can rate her chances to return to the temporally haunted living quarters she knew as a spouse, to take up rooms of her own. ♦","990","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"On Thursday, some of Hillary Clinton’s top campaign officials held a briefing for about three dozen members of the 2016 hack pack. Their message was a positive one. “The view inside the campaign is that voters are concerned about kitchen-table issues Clinton wants to talk about, rather than media reports and Republican attacks on the [Clinton] foundation, the officials said,” Vox’s Jonathan Allen reported. “There’s no conflict between her promise to represent ‘everyday Americans’ and the access big donors have had to Clinton and her husband over the years, they said, arguing that voters will trust her to represent them in the White House.”","May 29, 2015","991","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"That was partly spin, of course. There is no end in sight to the stories about the finances of the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton e-mails, or the activities of some of the Clintons’ associates. But as spring rolls into summer, Team Brooklyn has successfully accomplished its two initial goals: heading off the possibility of a serious challenge for the Democratic nomination and surviving a barrage of negative publicity that was inevitable at some stage, and which was, therefore, best confronted early on.","992","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"The entry into the Democratic contest by Bernie Sanders was welcome from a Clintonite perspective, because it filled a potentially dangerous vacuum. With his long record of service to progressive causes, Sanders is popular enough to garner a decent-sized following among liberal Democrats, but he’s almost certainly too far to the left to represent a serious threat to Hillary. So far, at least, his presence has been more of a problem for Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who is set to officially announce his candidacy on Saturday. As I noted back in March, O’Malley is a serious figure who demands some respect. As governor, he eliminated the death penalty, legalized gay marriage, and championed various good-government initiatives. But with Sanders already out there on the stump, O’Malley has struggled to gain traction.","993","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"A new poll of likely Democratic voters conducted by Quinnipiac University illustrates the scale of the task that is facing Clinton’s challengers. The survey, which was carried out from May 19th to May 26th, showed her getting fifty-seven per cent of the vote. Sanders was in second place, with fifteen per cent. O’Malley got just one per cent, and so did two other possible candidates, Jim Webb, a former U.S. senator from Virginia, and Lincoln Chafee, a former governor and U.S. senator from Rhode Island. Of course, it is early in the process, and anything could happen between now and the end of the primaries. At this stage, though, Clinton is sitting pretty.","994","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"Something similar, if somewhat less definitive, could be said of her position vis-à-vis her potential Republican opponents. Opinion polls positing head-to-head matchups with likely G.O.P. candidates have consistently shown Clinton winning, and the Quinnipiac survey was no exception. It showed her with double-digit leads over Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, two of the Republican front-runners. Interestingly, the closest hypothetical contests were with Rand Paul, the libertarian senator from Kentucky, and Florida senator Marco Rubio, whom some in the Clinton camp have reportedly identified as her biggest potential threat. Clinton’s leads over both Paul and Rubio were four points.","995","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"The Quinnipiac poll also contained some valuable clues as to how Clinton has been able, so far, to navigate all of the negative media coverage she has received while sustaining relatively little damage to her overall polling numbers. In terms of the level of personal trust that voters have in Clinton, the drip-drip-drip of stories does seem to be having an effect. Fifty-three per cent of respondents to the Quinnipiac survey said that they do not consider her to be “honest and trustworthy,” while only thirty-nine per cent said that they did. Among self-identified Independents, the numbers were even more lopsided: sixty-one per cent to thirty-one per cent.","996","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"The number of people who question Clinton’s trustworthiness must be of concern to her team, and it’s a figure that Republican ad-makers and opposition-research shops will be seeking to increase. But this issue needs to be weighed against the fact that Presidential elections are about leadership—and most Americans think of Clinton as an experienced and strong leader. One of the survey questions asked, “Would you say that Hillary Clinton has strong leadership qualities or not?” Sixty per cent of respondents said yes, and thirty-seven per cent said no. Among Independents, fifty-eight per cent answered yes, and thirty-eight per cent said no.","997","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"These findings suggest that voters are more sophisticated than they are sometimes given credit for. Rather than looking at politicians in black-and-white terms, they are able to size up candidates’ strengths and weaknesses, and to reach an over-all view based on what they are looking for in a leader. At a time when the world seems like an increasingly dangerous place and a majority of Americans believe that the country is on the wrong track, perceived strength and decisiveness may well count for a great deal. “Can you get low marks on honesty and still be a strong leader?” said Tim Malloy, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll, in a news release. “Sure you can. Hillary Clinton crushes her democratic rivals and keeps the GOP hoard [sic] at arm’s length.”","998","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"For Clinton’s campaign team in Brooklyn Heights, that means things are on track. Of course, they won’t necessarily stay that way. The campaign is just getting started, the country is more or less equally divided, and winning a third term of office isn’t easy for any party.

"If the 2016 Presidential campaign seems unusually gloomy, it’s not hard to see why, starting with the cowardice revealed by those Republicans who, after the sickening murders in Charleston, were, for too long, unable to utter a declarative sentence when asked whether the Confederate flag flying over the South Carolina statehouse (the one that went up in 1962, to protest the civil-rights movement) should come down and whether the flag had a proper place in any public building. Other Republicans took a break from that line of thought to promise to “resist” marriage equality, now legal in fifty states.

"Otherwise, seventeen months before the general election, and despite the welcome offstage diversions of those Supreme Court decisions—affirming same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act—the language of the 2016 race has been unnervingly free of thought. It’s as if a politically themed Pandora has been supplying the words and phrases most likely to please each constituency. On Roosevelt Island earlier this month, for instance, when Hillary Clinton tried to explain why she’s running, she promised to be in just about everyone’s corner: “For the successful and the struggling. For the innovators and inventors. For those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases. For the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day. For the nurses who work the night shift. For the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us. For the veterans who served our country. For the small business owners who took a risk.

"Gore also got there first with the “everyday Americans” whom Clinton intends to keep meeting and to “champion.” He spoke, he said, for “those who need a voice, those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up, so they are never left behind,” and he promised “to go out to you, the people, because I want to stay in touch with your hopes, with the quiet everyday heroism of working families.”","1004","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"When Senator Marco Rubio launched his campaign, in mid-April, he said, “If we reform our tax code, reduce regulations, control spending, modernize our immigration laws, and repeal and replace Obamacare”—still the required Republican cri de coeur—“the American people will create millions of better-paying modern jobs.” Clinton said, “We will restore America to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments. And we will make America the clean-energy superpower of the twenty-first century …. Now, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable America to lead the global fight against climate change.” Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush accompanied dreamy projections of economic growth with an actual number: “There is not a reason in the world why we cannot grow at a rate of four per cent a year.

Rather, as John Cassidy has pointed out, she’s still explaining her 2002 vote to authorize the disaster in Iraq as well as her interventionist impulses that arguably contributed to making the situations in Syria and Libya worse.

The office, constitutionally ill-defined and so humbling that there’s an HBO comedy series about the indignities of the position, offers only a single reward to its occupant: the chance to one day be President.","August 27, 2015","1016","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"All of the Democratic Vice-Presidents that Biden grew up watching eventually became Democratic nominees for President: Lyndon Johnson, Hubert Humphrey, Walter Mondale, and Al Gore. If Biden decides to forego a run for the Oval Office, he will be the first Democratic Vice-President unable to secure his party’s nomination in sixty-three years. (In 1952, the seventy-four-year-old Alben Barkley, Harry Truman’s veep, was pushed out of contention by party leaders who considered him too old. Biden is seventy-two.)","1017","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"Biden is reported to be currently considering a run against Hillary Clinton. And yet, while history seems to be in his favor, for Biden to enter the race would be a monumental mistake.","1018","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"Previous Vice-Presidents joined nominating contests with the widespread support of the Democratic Party’s establishment. But this year, the Party’s fundraising networks, interest groups, and elected officials are backing Hillary Clinton. In fact, her support is unprecedented in the modern era. The single best predictor of who will win a party’s nomination is support from other elected officials. Clinton has more endorsements from governors and members of the House and Senate than any previous nominee at this stage of the process. Joe Biden has garnered endorsements from two elected officials, both of them from his home state of Delaware. If there is even a single elected official outside of Delaware pining for a Biden candidacy, he or she is being very quiet.","1019","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"Elite party support is enormously important for a sitting Vice-President because there are many disadvantages to running while serving. The Vice-Presidential entourage is large and cumbersome, not suited to the kind of retail politics that the spoiled voters of Iowa and New Hampshire demand. While Clinton is free to stray from Obama’s policies, the Vice-President’s every utterance would be judged against Obama’s official pronouncements. Each time there was a difference of opinion, commentators would wonder why he couldn’t convince the President of his ideas.","1020","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"Even if Biden had a greater share of party support, a campaign against Clinton would be challenging. Running as an insurgent, he would quickly run into the same demographic wall that has haunted the campaigns of previous Democrats who took on party front-runners. Candidates like Gary Hart, in 1984, Bill Bradley, in 2000, and Howard Dean, in 2004, found that they could gain an edge by engineering a spirited campaign as an outsider from the left—just as Bernie Sanders is doing now. These candidates often did well with white progressives, but they could never expand their appeal to other Democratic base groups. Only Barack Obama was able to succeed by winning African-American voters away from Hillary Clinton, who was the establishment front-runner in 2008. But Biden, who is white and male and older than Clinton, offers no obvious advantage when it comes to winning over Democratic voting groups like women, minorities, labor, and younger voters.","1021","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"Even if Biden had a lead over Clinton with particular groups, it would be unusually difficult for him to campaign to her left. He has recently courted Senator Elizabeth Warren, but many Warren fans have moved into the Sanders camp. More awkwardly, as a senator from Delaware, which is home to the credit-card industry, Biden was the leading champion of the bankruptcy legislation that Warren spent a decade fighting against in the late nineteen-nineties and early two thousands. Biden’s record on criminal-justice reform is similarly out of step with the current Democratic Party: he was the author of the 1994 crime bill, from which many experts trace the record level of mass incarceration for nonviolent crimes, especially in minority communities.","1022","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"On foreign policy, Clinton and Biden were often on different sides of important debates within the Obama Administration, with Biden more often taking the non-interventionist course and Clinton being more comfortable with the use of force. But on the great foreign-policy issue of modern times—the Iraq war—Biden, like Clinton, voted in favor of it while in the Senate.","1023","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"But isn’t Hillary Clinton’s campaign losing air? Isn’t she hobbled by scandal and suffering from dire approval ratings? Not really. Her approval rating with the overall electorate is fifty per cent unfavorable, forty-two per cent favorable. That’s not great, to be sure, but it is far better than most of the top Republican candidates for President. Biden’s numbers are only marginally better than hers: forty-two per cent unfavorable, forty-five per cent favorable. If he stepped into the race, and inevitably became the target of regular political attacks, his numbers would likely start to sink, just as hers have.","1024","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"But at this stage, favorability ratings that include all voters are much less important than polls that only include Democrats. And Clinton remains dominant with that group. An aggregation of recent polls shows her with forty-nine per cent of the vote, to Biden’s thirteen per cent.","1025","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"It must be maddening for Biden, who has served Obama for six and a half years with loyalty to find himself so utterly frozen out of his party’s race for the nomination. It must sting to know that by sitting out this race he will go down in history as the only Democratic Vice-President in modern times who couldn’t win his party’s nomination. Yet it would be far more humiliating if he jumped into the race and was soundly defeated.","1026","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"Biden surely knows all of this. It’s much more likely that the Vice-President is not actually preparing a campaign against Clinton, but rather readying himself as a replacement if something wildly unexpected destroys her candidacy. In that sense, Biden is being shrewd. He can’t beat Clinton, but he can set himself up as the Party’s insurance policy in case of her collapse.","1027","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-plays-backup"
"A remarkable thing almost happened to the two-party system in the summer of ’44: Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic President, about to be nominated for a fourth term, began a political flirtation with Wendell Willkie, the businessman Republican he’d defeated four years earlier, with the idea of forming a joint venture. No matter that, in 1940, Willkie had criticized the slowness of the economic recovery and, as Hitler’s Germany overran Europe, what he saw as American unreadiness. The two candidates had mostly agreed on big questions—above all, on sending military aid to Great Britain. Willkie’s sharpest criticism of F.D.R. focussed on his quest for a third term, a break with a two-term tradition that dated back to George Washington. “The doctrine of one man’s indispensability is a new doctrine for this country,” the Times editorial page noted, not approvingly, when the newspaper endorsed Willkie.","July 28, 2015","1028","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"As is still true today, party labels did not always mean what they seemed to mean. Willkie, a former Democrat, was never completely trusted by his party, though he had more in common with his 1944 primary competitors—Thomas E. Dewey, the New York governor; Harold Stassen, the former “boy governor” of Minnesota; even General Douglas MacArthur, the Pacific commander, whose vanity overcame his soldierly responsibilities—than many Republicans in this year’s free-for-all have with each other. Willkie quit the race in April, after Dewey won the Wisconsin primary, and Roosevelt was soon informed that Willkie was unhappy about being beaten by conservatives. More than that, F.D.R. told his special counsel, Samuel I. Rosenman, Willkie had been mulling “the possibility of a new setup in American politics.” Roosevelt, as Rosenman wrote in a memoir of his years at the White House, added that some Democrats “are out for my scalp, too”—referring to anti-New Deal sentiment in Texas and the South. “I think the time has come for the Democratic Party to get rid of its reactionary elements. … and to attract the liberals in the Republican Party. Willkie is the leader of those liberals.” It would have to be a long-term project, the President continued, “But we can do it in 1948, and we can start building it up right after the election this fall.” Roosevelt said that “Willkie and I together” could form this new party.","1029","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"Roosevelt dispatched Rosenman to New York, where, secret-agent-style, he visited Willkie’s hotel suite and told him that Roosevelt “wants to team up with you.” Willkie was receptive and, on July 13th, even as F.D.R. was getting ready to ask Senator Harry Truman to be his running mate, he dictated a letter to Willkie saying, “I want to talk to you about the future, even the somewhat distant future, and in regard to the foreign relations problems of the immediate future.” This was a hard-to-keep secret. A headline reading “Willkie Asked by Roosevelt to Meet with Him” appeared in the August 11th edition of the New York Herald Tribune, followed by more stories, all suggesting that one topic would be the direction of the postwar world. Willkie’s initial reaction was “No comment,” while Roosevelt was at his most evasive, at first denying that the letter existed—which prompted an August 21st apology to Willkie—and then admitting that it was genuine. Willkie wrote, but never mailed, a letter to F.D.R. saying, “If it is agreeable with you, I would prefer postponement of any such talk until after the November election.” (Willkie was feeling pressure to support Dewey, his party’s nominee.)","1030","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"But this political serial ended abruptly when Willkie, on October 8th, died of a strep infection that spread to his heart. He was fifty-two. Six months later, Roosevelt, too, was dead, and so was his hybrid-party plot.","1031","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"It’s hard, though, to resist the thought that a new political force—a fusion party—might have been born that summer, that a Roosevelt-Willkie alliance, drawing on the moderate impulses of the major parties, might have planted roots and become a counterweight to an era like the present, when men and women professing all sorts of highly personal beliefs keep leaping into the Presidential race. Forget Donald Trump; just consider the “mainstream” Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, who announced his candidacy by saying, “We defunded Planned Parenthood and enacted pro-life legislation. We passed castle doctrine and concealed carry.” That sounded like a man running as a divider, not a uniter.","1032","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"A fusion party would accentuate coöperation, an urge present in 2004, when the Democrat John Kerry apparently asked the Republican John McCain to be his running mate. McCain said no, but the race would have been enthralling. President Eisenhower, in private, sometimes sounded off about breaking away from his party, and, when he contemplated dropping Richard Nixon from the ticket, in 1956, he considered asking the Ohio governor, Frank Lausche, a Catholic Democrat, to take his place. (Under very different circumstances, Abraham Lincoln, in 1864, took the border-state Democrat Andrew Johnson as a running mate.) Some possible alliances have gone unrealized—or unrecognized—because of party labels. On foreign policy, for instance, Hillary Clinton has often had more in common with the Republican Senator Lindsey Graham than with the Democrats Bernie Sanders or Jim Webb or, for that matter, Barack Obama.","1033","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"And, if it would have been too much to hope that, after the 2012 election, President Obama and a restless Mitt Romney could have discussed a centrist coalition, odd pairings can still happen. Obama and the Koch brothers, David and Charles, have managed to break through party barriers and ideology in the cause of criminal-justice reform.","1034","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"Certainly, if Willkie and Roosevelt had lived and followed through, their venture might have seemed far-fetched. But a short-lived alliance might have demonstrated that in a divided nation—even one with sixteen Republican Presidential contenders running wild—there might be a path to that calmer center, where, polls suggest, most people still want to live.","1035","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"As you probably saw, Jeb Bush gave a big speech a couple of days ago, in which he formally entered the Republican primary, vowing to “take command of our future” and “get events in the world moving our way again.” It wasn’t the greatest piece of oratory, but Bush is still the strong favorite to be the G.O.P. candidate, and he finally showed a bit of vim and vigor, bounding onto a stage in Miami like the late Chris Farley doing an impression of an eager, over-amped preppy. Forty-eight hours later, the Republican Party and its media supporters are busy debating Bush’s proposals, which included pledges to boost the economy’s growth rate to four per cent, simplify the tax code, and “clean up the mess in Washington.”","June 17, 2015","1036","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/will-the-trump-circus-hurt-the-g-o-p"
"That last sentence is largely fiction, of course. When I turned on Rush Limbaugh’s show on Tuesday, he was busy playing clips from Donald Trump’s nutty announcement speech at Trump Tower, in which he reminded everyone how rich he is, pledged to build a wall across the southern border at Mexico’s expense, and said, “We need a leader that wrote ‘The Art of the Deal.’ ” A chortling Limbaugh wasn’t hiding his enthusiasm for Trump’s entry into the race. On Tuesday night, Trump was on “The O’Reilly Factor,” which is still the most popular show on the Fox News network. On Wednesday morning, his picture was on the front page of the New York Post, next to the headline “Trump: I’ll Make White House Mine.” (The background image depicted the White House with a large gold “TRUMP” sign protruding from the roof.) Thursday night, Trump is slated to be back on Fox, this time on “Hannity,” for a full hour.","1037","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/will-the-trump-circus-hurt-the-g-o-p"
"That’s Limbaugh and the Murdoch press, you might say. What do you expect from them? My answer is that Limbaugh, Fox, and many other actors in the G.O.P. circus are commercial enterprises, and I would expect them to pursue the highest ratings. Obviously, they are supportive of the Republican Party’s broader aims, too, but if they are forced to choose between the long-term health of the Party and an immediate jump in audience figures, they will go with the ratings every time.","1038","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/will-the-trump-circus-hurt-the-g-o-p"
"Trump, for all his narcissism and offensiveness, has shown that he can deliver mass audiences. For that reason alone, he is guaranteed plenty of attention from the media outlets that serve as primary news sources for many Republican-primary voters. Bush, the Republican National Committee, and the rest of the party establishment would love to ignore Trump and his antics, but the demands of “free enterprise”—the same free enterprise that Bush lauded in his announcement speech—won’t allow it.","1039","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/will-the-trump-circus-hurt-the-g-o-p"
"In the more serious parts of the Republican media, the attitude toward this great irony appears to be one of resigned acceptance, and, in some cases, gallows optimism. I heard several commentators saying that Trump would make the other G.O.P. candidates look good by comparison. Some conservative commentators appear to understand the dangers, however. “I’m not laughing. I’ll be honest with you, I’m crying,” Michael Graham, the host of the Weekly Standard’s political podcast, said. “I was so hoping he would not get in, just because of the clown show of 2004 and 2008, and how delightful it was going to be that the biggest clowns in the race were going to be Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. And now this TV-show fiasco throws himself into this otherwise energetic, spirited, and worthwhile G.O.P. primary.”","1040","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/will-the-trump-circus-hurt-the-g-o-p"
"The immediate question is whether Trump will gain admission to the upcoming television debates, which start in August. If he is onstage, his presence will be a huge distraction. If he is excluded, he’ll be on the sidelines, crying bloody murder. At the moment, it looks like he will be present. Fox, the host of the first debate, has said that it will invite the top ten candidates in surveys of likely Republican voters. According to the Real Clear Politics poll average, Trump currently sits in ninth place, with 3.6 per cent of the vote. And it seems likely that the publicity surrounding his announcement will give him a bump.","1041","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/will-the-trump-circus-hurt-the-g-o-p"
"To be sure, Trump could blow up and withdraw at any time. In 2012, he flirted with running for months and then decided against it. This time, he’s gone further—although, according to reports on Tuesday, he still hasn’t filed the necessary papers with the Federal Election Commission. Once the media starts delving into his financial records and business dealings, which include numerous bankruptcy filings by Trump-branded hotels and casinos, he might well have second thoughts.","1042","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/will-the-trump-circus-hurt-the-g-o-p"

"How many Republicans are running for President? It’s a trick question. Some of those who are clearly running—Jeb Bush, for example—are still pretending that they aren’t, mostly because declaring would change the fund-raising rules. And if you counted everyone who, against all evidence, takes himself (or herself) seriously as a candidate, the locker room depicted in Mark Ulriksen’s “Suiting Up,” this week’s cover, would look as crowded as the departures hall at Penn Station, and almost as disconcerting. As it is, Ulriksen presents seven contenders with seven varieties of preening. Maybe it’s hard to tell a vision for America from a delusion of grandeur, at least until the debates and primaries get under way. Until then, Marco Rubio’s got his phone, Rand Paul his comb, and Huckabee his Bible. Ted Cruz’s eyes flit between his copy of the Constitution and his mirror, while Scott Walker seems on the lookout for unionized gym attendants. Bush is wearing his dynasty-logo boxers and Chris Christie his put-me-in-now pout. And yet, somehow, one of these seven men is almost certainly right about his chances for the nomination.

"Nathan Hornes, a twenty-five-year-old musician from Southern California, recently had a run of bad luck that changed his life. In 2010, after his mother insisted he pursue a higher degree, he chose a campus of Everest College, run by the for-profit Corinthian Colleges. “I thought I could go to school and be a pop star on the side,” he told me. Everest had a reputation among students for misleading marketing pitches and awful teachers, but the scope of the college’s problems didn’t become apparent until 2013, when the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosed that they were investigating Corinthian.","August 11, 2015","1054","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"By then, Hornes was almost done getting his degree in management. He worked hard and did well at Everest, but by the time he graduated, in 2014, with tens of thousands of dollars in student loans, Corinthian’s legal problems had mounted. Later that year, the C.F.P.B. sued Corinthian, alleging that it had deceived students into taking on debt and then aggressively pursued them for repayment. Within months, Corinthian had shut down all of its campuses and declared itself bankrupt; at once, a degree from a Corinthian school became worthless. Hornes found work as a manager at the fast-food chain Smashburger—an accomplishment that he’s certain had nothing to do with his degree—and helped to start a protest movement in which former Corinthian students are refusing to repay their student loans. (After some commentators suggested that the students were acting like entitled children, Hornes posted a song to iTunes called “Confessions of a Spoiled Brat.”)","1055","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"Hornes told me that he wishes he could return to school, but doesn’t see himself doing so. The federal government is discharging some former Corinthian students’ loans, and Hornes has filed for consideration. In the meantime, he has surpassed the cap the government places on the amount a student can borrow for school. “At this point, I can barely afford to even live,” he said.","1056","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"Around the time that Hornes was discovering the worthlessness of his degree, Hillary Clinton was preparing to launch her campaign for President. Corinthian was often in the headlines, bringing attention to the broader student-debt crisis, in which student loans had, in just a couple of years, come to surpass car loans and credit-card bills to become the second-biggest form of debt, after mortgages. A senior policy adviser to the Clinton campaign, who didn’t want to be named, told me, “Last fall, when she was thinking about running for President, she called me and a couple of other people in to help her think about domestic-policy issues. When we began the process, the issue of college affordability and student debt was certainly on our radar screens and was a very big issue.” Clinton’s interest in the topic deepened as she toured the country and began to develop a platform focussed in large part on the economic conditions of the middle class. “She began to think, What does it mean to really make sure that we’re helping the middle class?” the adviser told me. Clinton came to feel that fixing the higher-education system was central to that goal, so she enlisted advice from several experts—among them a former education official, Robert Shireman, and a former student-loan ombudsman at the C.F.P.B., Rohit Chopra—to come up with a comprehensive plan.","1057","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"On Monday, Clinton presented her proposal, which would have the federal government spend three hundred and fifty billion dollars over ten years to make colleges more affordable and accountable to their students. More than half of that total would go toward grants to states and colleges. Clinton would reward states that stop disinvesting in higher education—and eventually spend more on public universities—and make it possible for students to graduate without debt; she would also keep the Obama Administration’s promise to make community colleges free. (Under Clinton’s plan, students would contribute to their tuition based on the wages from ten hours of work a week, while their families would give an amount based on their means.) A third of the three hundred and fifty billion would be spent to relieve students of some of their existing debt, partly by letting students refinance their loans at the current low interest rates. The rest—some fifteen to twenty per cent of the total—would be put to other uses, including investing in new forms of education and supporting student parents.","1058","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"In coverage of Clinton’s plans, the three-hundred-and-fifty-billion-dollar price tag, along with the candidate’s populist proposal to fund it by getting rid of some tax loopholes for the rich, have received a lot of attention. But just as noteworthy is the message Clinton is sending about structural problems with the higher-education system. For example, during and after the recession, states slashed their higher-education budgets, often raising public-university tuition rates to make up for it. Clinton’s proposal wouldn’t simply funnel money into public universities to make up for the decline in state funding; she would give the money only to those states that stabilize and increase their spending—essentially creating a new federal incentive to encourage states to change their policies.","1059","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"The decline in state budgets for higher education is one reason student debt has increased, but it’s not the only one, nor even, arguably, the most important one. For-profit colleges like Corinthian are responsible for a disproportionate number of student-debt defaults; according to a Senate report, students at for-profit colleges make up thirteen per cent of student-loan borrowers but forty-seven per cent of defaults. Truly dealing with the student-debt crisis, therefore, requires examining the for-profit sector. Clinton appears to recognize this. In a post she published on Monday on Medium, she wrote, “There are students who take out loans to pay for an expensive degree from a for-profit institution—only to find little support once they actually enroll, or they graduate and discover that, when it comes to finding a job, their degree isn’t worth what they thought.”","1060","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"The statistics are startling. Ninety-six per cent of students at for-profit colleges take on debt to attend school, compared with fifty-seven per cent at four-year private colleges, forty-eight per cent at four-year public colleges, and only thirteen per cent at community colleges. One reason students at for-profit colleges take out a lot of debt is because their schools have encouraged them to do so. In academic circles, this has inspired conversation about how to incentivize for-profit colleges to behave differently. One favored approach is to force colleges to share the risk that students take when they go into debt, by fining them if a high proportion of their students default on their loans. Clinton seems to support something like this—a fact sheet provided by her campaign says that she “will embrace bipartisan efforts for schools to share in the risk”—but the adviser I spoke with said she is still working out the details. Chopra, the former C.F.P.B. official, who has also advised the Clinton campaign, said that he isn’t familiar with the details of the candidate’s plan as it relates to risk-sharing by for-profit colleges, but he said that any higher-education reform plan has to deal with the structural problems in that sector. “The student-loan system works quite well for industry executives, but not so well for students,” he said.","1061","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"On Monday, I called Hornes, who had read about Clinton’s proposal with interest and felt it stood a chance of helping future students avoid getting into a mess like his. But he and other student activists envision a more radical future for higher education. Hornes feels that public U.S. universities should be free, as they are in Germany and some other countries; he also thinks the federal government should discharge the loans of all former Corinthian students. (Bernie Sanders, for his part, has proposed making public universities tuition-free and funding this with a tax on Wall Street trades, while Martin O’Malley, like Clinton, has put forth a plan to instead make college “debt-free.”)","1062","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"Ann Larson, an organizer with the student-debt protesters, suggested that for-profit colleges should be abolished altogether. Clinton’s campaign believes there is room for for-profit institutions in a functioning higher-education system; she is particularly intrigued by online-education startups like Coursera and Udacity, the adviser told me. I asked Larson to explain her position, pointing out that some people felt that the problems might be solved if for-profit colleges were just better regulated. She strenuously disagreed. “I think the idea of providing quality education to people in a democratic society is in contradiction to the idea of providing for-profit education,” she told me. “Look at the case of Corinthian. In order to maximize their profit—which is what corporations do—they took federal money to the tune of many billions of dollars from the student-loan program, and they funnelled it into these institutions where they provided very cheap, very substandard education, they overcharged students, and then they put students out of the street with worthless debt and pocketed the money. This is what happens when the profit motive supersedes the educational motive.”","1063","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"On Friday night, Donald Trump and his red “Make America Great Again” baseball cap headed down to the Ladd-Peebles football stadium in Mobile, Alabama, where, in a long and rambling address, he regaled a crowd estimated by police and fire officials at around twenty thousand people. Among other subjects, he spoke about his big lead in the polls and joked about holding the 2016 election early. “I’d like to have the election tomorrow,” Trump said. “I don’t want to wait.” In another sign of the progress he is making, one of Alabama’s two Republican senators, Jeff Sessions, greeted Trump onstage and praised his tough stance on immigration.","August 22, 2015","1064","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"To say that Trump is flying high would be an understatement. Not only is he crushing his Republican opponents in the polls, many of his critics in the media have thrown in the towel. Having dismissed his candidacy, poked fun at him, and portrayed him (with every justification) as a draft-dodging, racist, sexist huckster, the campaign press is now paying him the ultimate compliment and taking him seriously.","1065","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"On the day of the rally, USA Today reported, with no evident irony, that Trump and his allies were plotting “a path to victory” in the G.O.P. primaries. The Washington Post said that Trump’s Republican rivals were being forced to adopt new strategies to ride out the “Trump tornado.” And a front-page story in the Boston Globe quoted Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, who said, “What is happening with Trump is not a fluke. Yes, he is a great entertainer, but he is able to take advantage of a number of dynamics in American politics as they exist right now. This is an important moment.”","1066","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"We shall see. Perhaps Skocpol is right, and Trump’s rise in the polls represents a deep and lasting political phenomenon. Perhaps, as I suggested a couple of weeks ago, it will wither away, like the candidacies of previous G.O.P. candidates who tickled the party’s base at roughly this stage of the campaign, such as Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain. In any case, setting aside Trump’s ultimate fate, his current position demands explanation. How is he doing it? Here are five vaguely plausible theories that I have seen put forward recently.","1067","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"1. He’s a rich celebrity. “Trump is the personification of a 21st-century America fascinated by the super rich and obsessed with celebrity,” James Pindell wrote in the Globe’s Friday story, citing interviews that he’d conducted with a number of historians. It’s not just that Trump’s ceaseless self-promotion and his role on “The Apprentice” have created a level of name recognition that his rivals can’t hope to match. With his status as a bona-fide celebrity, he can get his message out without having to worry about how it is intermediated by the political press, or about whether he is winning the “invisible primary” for the support of moneyed élites. Indeed, rather than being tested by the media, Trump is exploiting it mercilessly, especially the broadcast media.","1068","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Virtually everywhere you look on cable television there is an “exclusive” Trump interview. Since he draws much higher ratings than any other candidate, he knows the cable networks will keep inviting him on and giving him lengthy prime-time interviews, regardless of what he actually says. (This, surely, was the message of the Megyn Kelly dust-up.) The other candidates are forced to rely on occasional onscreen appearances (the debates, especially) and paid media (that is, advertising)—if they can afford it. The celebrity gulf puts them at an enormous disadvantage, which, for now at least, they are failing to surmount.","1069","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"2. He can’t be bought. As the political success of Michael Bloomberg showed, the idea of a billionaire candidate who doesn’t need to kowtow to vested interests can have considerable appeal to American voters. Trump is a populist version of Bloomberg, and he has no compunctions about pointing out how beholden his opponents are to rich donors—who are largely guys like him. During the first televised G.O.P. debate, he was eager to say that he had contributed to the past campaigns of many of his rivals in the full expectation of receiving something in return. He also claimed, effectively, to have paid Hillary Clinton to appear at his wedding. This wasn’t just boasting: it was exploiting his unique position to the maximum.","1070","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Given the widespread belief among voters that most politicians have been hopelessly corrupted by the demands of fund-raising, Trump’s appeal isn’t necessarily confined to ultra-conservatives. Appearing on the Fox Business Network recently, Ralph Nader, the longtime crusader against money in politics, who has mounted two Presidential campaigns as an independent and two as the Green Party nominee, called Trump “a breath of fresh air.” “The two-party tyranny that blocks voter choices and dominates the political scene on behalf of big business needs to be broken up and Trump is the one to do it. It takes a billionaire,” he said. When even someone with Nader’s progressive credentials is making this argument, is it any wonder many other Americans find it attractive?","1071","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"3. G.O.P. voters like his policies. When Trump accuses the Mexican government of sending its criminals to the United States and talks about deporting millions of undocumented workers en masse, many commentators, myself included, see him as engaging in misleading, impractical rabble-rousing. But, as I pointed out earlier this week, the demagoguery is working. Trump isn’t merely matching the more conservative Republican candidates on the immigration issue: he’s beating them. In arecent CNN poll, forty-four per cent of likely Republican voters picked Trump as the candidate who could best handle illegal immigration. (Jeb Bush came in second, with just twelve per cent.)","1072","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"And immigration isn’t the sole issue on which Trump’s views are striking a chord. His tough-on-trade rhetoric resonates with G.O.P. voters, particularly middle-income and low-income white men. Indeed, a recent survey by Pew Research suggested that Republicans, as a group, are now more skeptical of trade agreements, such as the new Trans-Pacific Partnership, than the Democrats are. As Newsweek’s Matt Cooper pointed out in a prescient piece back in June, Trump largely has this issue to himself. Dependent as they are on corporate money, most Republican candidates—from Jeb Bush to Marco Rubio to Scott Walker to Ted Cruz—support trade agreements. Trump, by contrast, is free to take a populist line, which he is doing with great enthusiasm.","1073","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"4. He’s the rider on a white horse. On the radio a while back, I heard Pat Buchanan, who ran for President as a conservative insurgent twice in the nineteen-nineties, and again in 2000, compare Trump to Huey Long, the legendary Louisiana populist who assailed the rich, the corporations, and the metropolitan élites during the twenties and thirties. Like Long, Trump could speak to ordinary folk in a language that they could understand and relate to, Buchanan said. Long was a Democrat, of course, who espoused some policies—such as expanded public services, stricter regulation of business, and higher taxes on the rich—that Trump, in his current incarnation, might well dismiss as socialism. But there still might be something to the comparison. Long “spoke so directly to the people, and that is Donald Trump’s appeal,” Richard D. White, the author of “Kingfish: The Reign of Huey P. Long,” told the Boston Globe. “It is a purely personal relationship with his listeners. It is not based on factual issues.”","1074","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Of course, the divide between populism and demagoguery is often in the eye of the beholder. White, who is now the dean of E.J. Ourso College of Business, at Louisiana State University, highlighted Trump and Long’s penchants for dressing in fancy suits and using incendiary language toward minorities. “The oversimplification of issues is very dangerous, and when you combine that with negativity and fear, the combination is classic populism,” he said. At least one Republican, Frank Luntz, the pollster and strategist, has also suggested that Trump’s candidacy could be dangerous. “There’s something happening out there that is profound, but you gotta be careful; when you tap into it you better have a way to direct it,” Luntz told Politico. “Trump has tapped into it. Bernie Sanders has tapped into it and they’re doing well, but you’re tapping into fire—that’s how hot the anger is. We are in a dangerous political environment that requires a higher standard for the candidates running. It requires them not just to stoke the anger, it’s already there. It requires them to provide the balm of solutions.”","1075","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"5. He’s just a summer diversion. Asked about Trump’s performance in the televised debate and his subsequent comments about Megyn Kelly, Hillary Clinton said, “It’s all entertainment. I think he’s having the time of his life, being up on that stage, saying whatever he wants to say.” Despite Trump’s comments about why she attended his wedding, Clinton is doubtless enjoying the sight of him toying with his Republican rivals, one of whom she may well end up running against. But she also raised a serious point. These days, Presidential campaigns are ludicrously long and bloated. Is there anyone, faced with the prospect of another year and a half of focus-group-tested politicking, who wasn’t secretly (or not so secretly) a bit relieved that Trump entered the fray and provided a diversion?","1076","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"In a column published on the Cook Political Report earlier this week, Amy Walter compared the G.O.P. electorate’s embrace of Trump to a post-college summer fling. “The summer before a presidential election year is a lot like dating in your early 20s. You are unattached and care-free. You want to connect with someone passionately and fall hopelessly in love,” she wrote. “Meanwhile, your parents want you to meet a guy like Jeb Bush.” No wonder G.O.P. voters are dallying with Trump, Walters added. He’s “everything your parents hate. He’s loud. He’s disrespectful. He probably smokes and drives a motorcycle. But, you don’t care.” Eventually, though, you settle down with the responsible guy.","1077","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Which explanation is the most persuasive? Obviously, there is a bit of truth in all of them. I still tend to think his appeal will fade, but it could take a while. In the meantime, Hillary Clinton is right about him enjoying himself. “It’s been wild,” he told the crowd in Mobile, adding, “The reason I am leading is because I know the game. . . . You people are looking for somebody who knows what he is doing.”","1078","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"

"The eyes are bolder than the ears: cultural consumers more readily embrace the visual avant-garde than they do the musical equivalent. The audience for Kandinsky and Picasso greatly exceeds the one for Schoenberg and Bartók. Tellingly, contemporary composers have often found a warm welcome within the walls of museums and galleries, as if the visual arena prompted a more adventurous mode of listening. Since the nineteen-sixties, the Whitney Museum has hosted events for Harry Partch, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Steve Reich, and Meredith Monk, among dozens of others. Reich’s 1968 essay “Music as a Gradual Process,” a seminal contribution to twentieth-century music history, was first published not in a music journal but in a Whitney catalogue.","1083","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/seeing-music-classical-alex-ross"
"Yet the old Whitney, on the Upper East Side, lacked a dedicated space for music. The new Whitney, in the meatpacking district, has an excellent one: a high-ceilinged, gray-walled, clean-lined room that can accommodate up to two hundred and four people. Plate-glass windows give a striking view of the Hudson; soundproofing stills the roar of the West Side Highway. In the coming months, Jay Sanders, the curator of the Whitney’s performance series, plans to present an array of classical, jazz, and electronic artists, and in some cases will invite them to respond to art on display. Performers will also venture into the gallery spaces and, weather permitting, onto the outdoor terraces. Few venues in New York offer such a dramatic sense of the surrounding cityscape.","1084","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/seeing-music-classical-alex-ross"
"This month, the Whitney will host a two-week festival (June 17-28), curated by Sanders and Dominic Murcott, in honor of the American experimental composer Conlon Nancarrow (1912-1997)—possibly the most ambitious survey of his work yet attempted. Nancarrow, who went into exile in Mexico in 1940, after encountering resistance to his leftist politics, is most famous for a library of some fifty studies that he composed for player piano, in which rhythmic complexity is carried to fabulous extremes. Punching holes into player-piano rolls, Nancarrow created delirious simultaneities of activity, with notes exploding in all registers. He favored arcane relationships: in Study No. 33, the ratio of tempos is 2 against √2, while the ratios for Study No. 41 resemble an equation scrawled on a blackboard in a mad-scientist movie. Yet the music seldom sounds mathematical: it is visceral in impact and playful in mood, its melodic material often recalling ragtime, jazz, and blues.","1085","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/seeing-music-classical-alex-ross"
"In the early and final phases of his career, Nancarrow also wrote for conventional instruments. The ensemble Alarm Will Sound will sample that repertory as well as play live-action arrangements of the studies. Steve Coleman, Henry Kaiser, and Lukas Ligeti are to perform Nancarrow-influenced pieces; dancers from the Merce Cunningham Trust Fellowship Program will revive Cunningham’s 1960 dance “Crises,” which had a Nancarrow score; and the composer and Nancarrow scholar Kyle Gann will be on hand to supply context. The festival concludes with a marathon presentation of all the studies, on a vintage player piano. Some may be tempted to dance along, in an irregular frenzy. ♦","1086","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/seeing-music-classical-alex-ross"
"It’s obvious that jail isn’t good for the jailed. It may be particularly bad for people accused of minor crimes, who are confined not because they are likely to be dangerous but because, under our cash-bail system, they can’t afford to get out. Think of the appalling case of Kalief Browder, the Bronx teenager who was profiled by my colleague Jennifer Gonnerman, in 2014. He was charged with stealing a backpack and spent three years at Rikers Island awaiting trial. Two years after the trial was dismissed and he was released, Browder killed himself.","August 25, 2015","1087","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-case-against-cash-bail"
"Now, there’s a study that quantifies some of the harm of keeping low-risk offenders in jail. Three criminal-justice researchers—Christopher Lowenkamp, Marie VanNostrand, and Alexander Holsinger—with backing from the Arnold Foundation, were able to track more than a hundred and fifty-three thousand arrests and bookings into Kentucky jails, between 2009 and 2010. They published their results in November, 2013, but the study hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves. The researchers found that the longer low-risk defendants were held in jail the more likely they were to engage in criminal activity. “When held 2–3 days, low-risk defendants are almost 40% more likely to commit new crimes before trial than equivalent defendants held no more than 24 hours,” they wrote. Low-risk defendants were even more likely to be re-arrested when they were held eight to fourteen days, and this remained true two years after the conclusion of the original case. Defendants who had been held in jail for eight to fourteen days were fifty-one per cent more likely to commit a crime two years later than demographically similar defendants charged with equivalent crimes who were held no more than twenty-four hours.","1088","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-case-against-cash-bail"
"How could it be that as few as two additional days in jail could do such damage? It might be that when a low-risk person is crammed in with a more dangerous one—the turnstile jumper with the armed robber—proximity exerts a bad influence on the former without improving the latter. But the researchers say that the real problem is that jail destabilizes lives that are often, and almost by definition, already unstable. It tends to quickly undermine the three mainstays of steady employment, housing, and family attachments. Holsinger, a professor at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, told me: “These are people who might well be working, but in a low-level job, let’s say in the fast-food industry, where they are very easy to replace. If you or I didn’t show up to work for three days without an explanation, it would certainly create problems but we probably wouldn’t get fired.” If you miss three days as a fast-food worker, you’re fired. Low-risk offenders are also more likely to have precarious living situations. “They might be flopping on their sister’s couch, or their friend’s. Their name’s not on the lease. Maybe they’re one argument away from being kicked out on the street,” Holsinger said. Or maybe they’re in a drug-rehab program where not showing up one night means they lose their bed. If they are parents, like one of the subjects of a Times Magazine article this month about the pitfalls of cash bail, they may lose their children while they are behind bars and be consumed with worry about who is taking care of them.","1089","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-case-against-cash-bail"

"At the moment, everyone from Bernie Sanders to the Koch brothers is decrying our incarceration rates and calling for criminal-justice reform. Cash bail has been getting particular scrutiny, since it clearly burdens the poor disproportionately, without any greater assurance of public safety. Only a few jurisdictions have replaced bail money with risk assessment, which helps judges decide whether defendants should be let free pending trial or not. But Cherise Fanno Burdeen, the director of the Pretrial Justice Institute, thinks the end of monetized bail is closer than ever thanks to “a giant wave of support” for reducing the number of people behind bars in the United States. (In recent months, the Black Lives Matter movement has had a lot to do with that momentum.) The City of Milwaukee and the State of Kentucky are among a handful of jurisdictions that have cut back on paid bail. Last year, New Jersey voters passed a bail-reform measure that allows judges to release nonviolent offenders on their own recognizance. (It has not escaped voters and legislators that such reforms will potentially save taxpayers’ money.) In June, Jonathan Lippman, New York State’s chief judge, told the Observer that the bail system is “totally ass-backwards in every respect.” Lippman elaborated, “You have people who can’t make $500 bail who end up rotting in jails or prison, losing their jobs, being separated from their families, while they are absolutely no threat to anyone.” Last month, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a new initiative that allows judges to release some low-level defendants, keeping them under court supervision until trial.","1091","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-case-against-cash-bail"
"The bail-bond industry and commercial surety interests almost certainly will resist reform. As U.S. District Court judge James Carr, a critic of cash bail, said at a congressional briefing in April, it’s “a thriving industry, a very powerful industry, and a very difficult opponent to challenge.” In this conflict, it will be enormously useful to have more studies like Lowenkamp, VanNostrand, and Holsinger’s. “We’re always going to need jails,” Holsinger said. But when we’re thinking about holding people who aren’t dangerous, who may not have committed the crime that they’re charged with, and who may already be in precarious situations, “you have to remember how quickly everything good in their lives can evaporate.”","1092","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-case-against-cash-bail"

"And yet this is an old story. To study the history of the black freedom movement is to be astonished by its collective capacity for forbearance. The litany of its great leaders—Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and Fannie Lou Hamer among them—is vastly outnumbered by the anonymous millions who encountered the noose, the lash, the cattle prod, the attack dog, the laws of Jim Crow, and answered it all, so often, in the spirit reflected by the survivors and the congregation at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Those soldiers of the movement were clear-eyed about their oppressors. They were the least naïve people imaginable and they were hardly weak. But they answered most often not to the understandable urge to vengeance but to the call of a preternaturally elevated form of justice and mercy. Within the black freedom movement, there was always a debate about the tension between nonviolent resistance and the need for resistance and rebellion, between the tactics and rhetoric of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X, between the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Black Power movement.

But he derives his hatreds and obsessions from a history of American racism and a still-existing cultural seedbed of white supremacism. On Saturday, some persistent amateur investigators on Twitter uncovered what appears to be Roof’s Web site. It is called lastrhodesian.com. The F.B.I. and other law-enforcement agencies have not yet authenticated the site’s grotesque manifesto or its cache of sixty photographs.

It is drenched in white-separatist racial solidarity; mordant self-pity; and conspiracy thinking. The text moves from blunt hatred (“Niggers are stupid and violent”) to a kind of lunatic auto-didacticism: “In a modern history class it is always emphasized that, when talking about ‘bad’ things Whites have done in history, they were White. But when we lern about the numerous, almost countless wonderful things Whites have done, it is never pointed out that these people were White. Yet when we learn about anything important done by a black person in history, it is always pointed out repeatedly that they were black.

In some pictures, he displays the numerals 1488 and 88, a set of code numbers well known in white-supremacist circles. The number 14 stands for a fourteen-word separatist slogan: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White Children.” George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party, used 88 as a code for “HH”—“Heil Hitler.” “H” is the eighth letter of the alphabet.","1099","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mercy-and-a-manifesto-in-charleston"

The C.C.C.’s Web site calls African-Americans “a retrograde species of humanity,” and it has published caricatures of Michael Jackson as an ape. Its newspaper has encouraged whites to vacation in South Carolina in order to “enjoy a civil liberty that has been denied to them for many years at hotels, restaurants and beaches: the freedom to associate with just one’s own people.” The C.C.C. has tried to position itself as more respectable than the Ku Klux Klan.

"When Tolu Komolafe and Jesmine Omonori, both twenty-five, started working for Everplans, a tech startup in the Flatiron district, earlier this year, they faced the additional complication of living five thousand miles away, in Lagos, Nigeria. Everplans is a digital platform for end-of-life planning. Komolafe and Omonori had been hired as programmers through Andela, an organization that pays talented Nigerians to learn computer programming, then puts them to work, remotely, for international companies. Unlike most offshore firms, Andela encourages its people to forge close relationships with their new colleagues. Because Komolafe and Omonori couldn’t meet the Americans in person, Komolafe said, “we went online and read everything about them.” They hit Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn. For months, they lived, virtually, in the Everplans office: joining meetings via teleconference, hanging out in Slack chat rooms, even contributing the occasional office in-joke—such as when Komolafe circulated a video of Omonori moonwalking.","1108","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/new-guys"
"The extra effort helped. “The video of Jesmine dancing is amazing!” Bernie Kravitz, the company’s V.P. of technology, said the other day, in Everplans’ Manhattan office. Abby Schneiderman, a co-C.E.O., added, “We consider them part of the team.” The office has the kindergartenish look of many tech startups: whiteboard walls covered with scribbled code, a conference table piled with Legos.","1109","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/new-guys"
"After months of working remotely, Komolafe and Omonori had just been flown in for an orientation. Neither had left Nigeria before. Komolafe is petite and peppy. She had her hair in long braids, and she wore a pink polo shirt and little diamond hoop earrings. Omonori is more reserved. He wore an orange T-shirt that said “Head to Toe Rock n Roll.” They said that their favorite thing about New York was the variety of food. The night before, they’d joined colleagues for happy hour at Rosa Mexicano, where they ordered virgin mango margaritas. Komolafe said, “We actually loved guacamole!”","1110","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/new-guys"

"The Republican Convention is fifty-one weeks away, but, earlier this week, Politico published its first post-mortem of the campaign season. The subject was Senator Rand Paul, who last fall was hailed by Time as “The Most Interesting Man in Politics,” but now seems, in the estimation of Politico, to be the most interesting man who’s struggling to stay in the Republican primary. A recent CNN/ORC poll found him tied with Ted Cruz for fifth place in the field, with support from only six per cent of those polled, behind Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio. An NBC/Marist poll found him in sixth place in Iowa, and in ninth place in New Hampshire.","July 31, 2015","1130","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"Last fall, Rand Paul seemed like a less quirky—and therefore, perhaps, more electable—version of his father, the former Congressman Ron Paul, whose 2008 and 2012 campaigns for the Republican Presidential nomination were grand cultural phenomena. Ron Paul toured the country, telling Republican voters things you might think they wouldn’t want to hear. In the 2012 primary, he finished in second place, behind Mitt Romney, in New Hampshire, with 22.8 per cent of the vote. Four years later, one poll has Ron Paul’s less recalcitrant son at only four per cent. The Web site FiveThirtyEight points out that, nationwide, Rand Paul’s support is currently lower than his father’s was at this point in 2012.","1131","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"What went wrong? There is no shortage of explanations, partly because contemporary politics has no shortage of professional explainers. The Politico story claimed that Paul is “allergic” to buttering up big donors, and suggested that his campaign is chaotic. (It included a particularly vivid anecdote about a near-physical altercation between Paul’s campaign manager and a member of his security staff, who was described as a “a 280-pound retired New York police detective and Paul family loyalist.”) Paul himself told a reporter for the Boston Globe that one of the obstacles he faced was a crowded Republican field. “Obviously, everybody’s numbers come down when you divide it many different ways,” he said.","1132","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"None of this quite explains Paul’s collapse, especially considering that some polls from last summer put him in the lead. Writing in this magazine last year, Ryan Lizza traced Paul’s incomplete journey from an idea-driven libertarian—he once supported the legalization of all drugs, and argued that a free society should tolerate “unofficial, private discrimination”—to an elected politician more willing to consider the exigencies of party loyalty. After Mitt Romney lost to Obama in 2012, many voices in the Republican Party were calling for a change, and the official G.O.P. post-election report warned that “public perception of the Party is at record lows.” This seemed like an opening for a nonconformist such as Paul.","1133","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"In 2012, Paul opposed the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, a government corporation that loans money to foreign customers of U.S. companies. He said it was absurd for the government to borrow money from overseas while also loaning money to foreign companies, and he was one of twenty Senators who voted against its reauthorization. Since then, the anti-Ex-Im movement has grown, and what was once considered a fringe movement celebrated a triumph when the Bank’s charter expired on the last day of June this year. Then, this past Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved to revive the Bank, angering many of his fellow Republicans. Senator Ted Cruz, another Presidential candidate, accused McConnell of having told a “flat-out lie” by denying, at a lunch meeting, that he had a secret plan to revive the Ex-Im Bank. Cruz, canny as always, probably calculated that his blunt language would get him plenty of press, and he was right. (The effort to revive the bank seems to have failed.)","1134","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"Paul, by contrast, has forged a strategic relationship with McConnell, who also happens to be Kentucky’s other Senator, and his eagerness to argue against the Ex-Im Bank suddenly seemed to have cooled. Late on Friday afternoon, during a radio interview, Sean Hannity asked Paul about Cruz’s claims. “I wasn’t at that lunch,” Paul said, executing a rather inelegant pivot. “But what I can tell you is that there’s a disconnect—conservatives want to vote on defunding Planned Parenthood.” Paul often wants to talk about defunding Planned Parenthood, these days, and while primary voters surely agree with his position, it doesn’t much distinguish him from the rest of his Republican competitors. (Bush, Rubio, and Walker also support defunding.)","1135","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"So what makes Paul stand out? For a time, one of his signature issues was opposition to the National Security Agency’s bulk data-collection practices, but the issue grew muddier in June, with the passage of the USA Freedom Act, which ruled that data would be collected by telecommunications companies, instead of by the government; Paul considered this a very partial victory, and he delivered a long and equivocal speech expressing his mixed feelings. Paul’s interest in criminal-justice reform once marked him as an unorthodox Republican, but an increasing number of Republicans are now talking about changing the way we fight crime. On national security, Paul used to be skeptical about the need to confront regimes deemed hostile—last fall, he parted company with many Republicans by calling for “an effective diplomatic solution for limiting the Iranian enrichment program.” But when the Obama Administration announced its nuclear deal with Iran, Paul joined his Republican rivals in calling it “unacceptable.” Finally, Paul has failed to establish himself as the candidate of Silicon Valley, which is often described as a libertarian-friendly community. The Politico story explained how Paul has failed, so far, to cultivate fruitful relationships there. And when Hillary Clinton suggested we ask “hard questions” about the “gig economy” typified by companies such as Uber, Paul responded with acerbic tweets—only to be upstaged by Bush, a few days later, who used Uber to visit a start-up in San Francisco.","1136","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"Some of the people who should be most enthusiastic about Paul’s Presidential campaign have found themselves disheartened by it. Last week, Nick Gillespie, the editor-in-chief of the libertarian site reason.com, laid out the many un-libertarian things Paul has done and said. He called his campaign “doubly frustrating”—that is, neither principled nor successful. Maybe Paul would always have struggled to win over Republican primary voters. And maybe, during the gruelling months to come, he will rebound and, like a number of candidates in 2012, have a moment near the front of the pack.","1137","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"But whatever happens, potential supporters like Gillespie shouldn’t be so disappointed. Even as his campaign struggles, many of his issues are doing surprisingly well—in fact, that’s a big part of the reason why Paul has struggled to define himself. The formerly indomitable Ex-Im bank has been vanquished, though perhaps it will return in another form; the N.S.A. has been reformed, though lightly; a “diplomatic solution” seems imminent in Iran, though of course people disagree about its effectiveness; criminal-justice reform has bipartisan momentum, though it may yet meet with resistance; politicians wishing to hamper companies like Uber are meeting stiff resistance, though they will keep trying. These are all tentative, partial, and temporary victories—but then, politics rarely offers any other kind. Rand Paul is struggling in the polls, but Paulism looks pretty healthy. That’s not good news for the Presidential candidate, but it’s also not such bad news for the guy who may still be, come 2017, a Senator from Kentucky.","1138","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"

Warren, who, as we all know, isn’t running for President, went on to outline a number of proposals for reform that would go beyond the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which was Washington’s response to the 2008 financial crisis. “Let’s get real. Dodd-Frank did not end too-big-to-fail,” she noted, correctly.

"When I say that it sounded like a stump speech, I’m not criticizing. To the contrary. The Massachusetts senator brings an infectious passion and energy to her issues. She is also able to cut to the essence of complicated subjects, and to expand the political debate to include proposals that many other politicians regard as verboten, such as cutting the megabanks down to size, extending the remit of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (which was her baby), and introducing a transactions tax on short-term trades. Some of her ideas may be questionable. For example, quite a few people who sympathize with her over-all approach aren’t convinced that bringing back the Glass-Steagall Act—which separated commercial banks from investment banks, among other things—is the right solution to Wall Street’s excesses. But, in a town that is still largely beholden to financial-industry lobbyists, she is an essential presence.","1154","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/elizabeth-warrens-challenge-to-hillary-clinton"
"After listening to Warren speak, I have no reason to doubt that she was being sincere when she said, just over a month ago, that Hillary Clinton deserves a chance to lay out her program. But I’m pretty sure that Warren also meant it when she told my colleague Ryan Lizza that she expects to have an impact on the political debate and the 2016 election. If Clinton doesn’t demonstrate, with some detailed proposals, that she has left behind for good the light-handed approach to financial regulation associated with her husband’s Administration, she can certainly expect Warren to make her displeasure public.","1155","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/elizabeth-warrens-challenge-to-hillary-clinton"

Does she support the idea of breaking up the likes of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America? Is imposing transaction taxes on high-frequency traders and other short-term speculators a good idea? Should the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have the power to regulate the auto-loan industry?

"The first announcement is that the “big-government crisis” is over. What big-government crisis? you may ask. The one that the Republicans cooked up in the aftermath of the Great Recession, when, partly owing to a slump in output, and partly owing to the Obama stimulus and other recession-related outlays, federal spending as a proportion of G.D.P. rose by about four percentage points—from 19.1 per cent in 2007 to 23.4 per cent in 2010. On the back of these figures, some G.O.P. scaremongers portrayed the President as a crypto-socialist intent on strangling the private sector and turning the United States into Sweden, Norway, or some other bloated welfare state where living standards are considerably higher than they are in the United States.","1169","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"Of course, none of the Republicans mentioned the last bit, but you get my drift. With federal expenditures rising sharply, the critics demanded big cutbacks, and they are still demanding them. At last week’s G.O.P. debate, virtually all of the candidates talked about lifting the oppressive yoke of government, and Jeb Bush repeated his pledge to cut the federal work force by ten per cent.","1170","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"What the Republicans don’t seem to have noticed is that their demand for a substantial downsizing has already been met. Thanks to a prolonged, if unspectacular, recovery in G.D.P., and to budget cuts endorsed by both parties at the local and national levels, the size of the government has been steadily falling relative to the rest of the economy. You can see this in the official statistics for federal outlays, which in 2014 fell back to 20.4 per cent of G.D.P. And you can see it even more clearly in the figures for government spending of all types, which includes spending at the local and state levels, as well as transfer payments and interest on the national debt.","1171","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"At the start of 2008, according to a valuable new analysis by David Beckwith, an economist at Western Kentucky University who formerly worked at the Department of the Treasury, this broader measure of government spending came to about thirty-five per cent of G.D.P. By the start of 2012, the figure had risen to close to forty-two per cent of G.D.P. That’s not quite at Scandinavian levels of spending, but it represented a significant jump. Since then, however, there has been a big drop, and over-all spending is back close to thirty-five per cent of G.D.P. In Beckwith’s words, “The huge run up in total government expenditures during the crisis is largely gone.”","1172","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"My second announcement is that Obamacare—the G.O.P.’s primary exhibit in its case that the Democrats are leading the country to rack and ruin—is doing what it was designed to do, which was to bring down the number of uninsured.","1173","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"The source here is a new set of figures published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday. They show that the number of Americans without any health coverage has fallen from sixteen per cent of the population in 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was passed, to 9.2 per cent in the first three months of this year. For the first time in recent memory, the percentage of uninsured people is in the single figures. “The health law remains controversial, and that will likely continue to be the case,” Larry Levitt, a senior vice-president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which focusses on health care, told the Huffington Post’s Jonathan Cohn. “But we now have facts that can be used to judge the A.C.A. rather than hypothetical arguments, and there’s no doubt at this point that more people are getting insured and it’s making a difference in their lives.”","1174","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"If any of the G.O.P. hopefuls, or anybody at the Republican National Committee, have publicly acknowledged either of these developments, I must have missed their statements. Rather than dealing with what’s actually happening, most of the G.O.P. candidates are still trying to outdo each other in their animus toward the federal government and its works, particularly the Affordable Care Act.","1175","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"A reasoned conservative response to the experience of Obamacare would be to accept the fact that it has done much of what it set out to do without bankrupting the country or destroying jobs, while also pointing out that it has had some nasty unintended consequences, such as a lack of competition among insurers in some areas and, in others, an increase in deductibles so large it may discourage people from seeking the care they need. But, rather than go down this route, almost all of the Republicans continue to demand an outright repeal of the law, without giving a coherent explanation of what they would replace it with.","1176","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"Which, in a way, isn’t surprising. Given how far to the right the Party’s base has shifted, adopting such a stance may be the only way to win the nomination.","1177","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"There’s probably more to it than that, though. If you take away from the G.O.P. its claims that government is running amok, the economy is in the tank, and Obamacare is a disaster, what issues does it have left? A possible list would include immigration, Planned Parenthood, ISIS, and Hillary Clinton’s e-mail server. Maybe I’m missing something, but that hardly sounds like a recipe for victory in the general election.

"If, a few years ago, you ever passed by the Statue of Liberty ferry dock and wondered about the huge white wooden building on the Battery Park pier—long abandoned, as eerie and old-world as the nearby Merchant Mariners’ memorial—you can now investigate its mysteries yourself. After extensive big-budget renovations, Peter Poulakakos and his team (Le District; the forthcoming Nammos) have converted the landmarked former municipal building, which once housed the city’s docks department, into a twenty-eight-thousand-square-foot nautical-themed megavenue. The top floor is a private-event space and the second is a fancy-dining zone, but ground level is for everybody: a polished-wood bar, with Lusitania memorabilia and gauges galore, and the pier outside, where the real action is. On a recent Monday evening, tourists and locals sat under umbrellas at picnic tables, ate fish and chips, drank rosé, and gazed out at the splendiferous harbor views: ferries, birds, barges, clouds, water taxis, sailboats, schooners, flags, Castle Clinton, speedboats, the Statue of Liberty, the Verrazano-Narrows. Several house cocktails, such as the Clock Tower Sour and the Lazarus, were punch-bowl sweet, but the gingery Dark and Stormy on tap had some razzmatazz. The setting sun cast a rosy glow from the west; the refurbished clocktower bong-bong-ed every hour.

"Were it not for Edward Snowden or someone like him, the N.S.A. would likely still be collecting the records of almost every phone call made in the United States, and no one outside of government would know it. A handful of civil-liberties-minded representatives and senators might drop hints in hearings and ask more pointed questions in classified settings. Members of the public would continue making phone calls, unaware that they were contributing to a massive government database that was supposedly intended to make their lives safer but had not prevented a single terrorist attack. And, on Monday, the government’s Section 215 powers, used to acquire records from hundred of billions of phone calls, among other “tangible things,” would be quietly renewed.","1205","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/who-needs-edward-snowden"
"Snowden shouldn’t have been necessary. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (or FISA Court), which evaluates Section 215 requests, is supposed to be interpreting the law to make sure that government surveillance doesn’t go outside of it. Congressional intelligence committees, which review the activities of the N.S.A., are supposed to be providing some oversight. The N.S.A. itself reports to the Department of Defense, which reports to the White House, all of which have dozens of lawyers, who are all supposed to apply the law. The government, in other words, is supposed to be watching itself, especially in matters of national security, which are, by necessity, shielded from daylight. The fact that it took thirteen years, and one whistle-blower, to expose a program that is conclusively ineffective and, according to one federal appeals court, illegal, points to a problem much larger than any one program. It suggests that claims about what is necessary to prevent the next terrorist attack are too sacrosanct to require evidence. As the debate over Section 215 has played out over the past two years, it has become clear that the punishments for exaggerating the efficacy of surveillance programs and downplaying their privacy implications are just about nonexistent.","1206","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/who-needs-edward-snowden"
"The government enshrouds the details of its surveillance programs in a technical vocabulary (“reasonable articulable suspicion,” “seeds,” “queries,” “identifiers”) that renders them too dull and opaque for substantive discussion by civilians. As one Pentagon handbook put it, “one can be led astray by relying on the generic or commonly understood definition of a particular word.” There is a kind of legal subversion at work here. Broad and clearly worded laws, including the Fourth Amendment, are being undermined by a raft of quasi-legal documents, most of them too long, narrow, and boring to read—that is, if anyone were allowed to read them in full. Instead of being named for what they actually do, programs are named for the subsections of the laws that are supposed to authorize them, whether or not that authority is actually present in the language of the law. With all the attention being paid to Section 215, named for a part of the Patriot Act, which does not contain the words “bulk,” “phone,” or “metadata,” it’s easy to forget that the program is just one piece of the intelligence community’s legal armory. Little is known about how other authorities, including Executive Order 12333, which some consider the intelligence community’s most essential charter, are being interpreted to permit spying on Americans. And a redacted report, released last week by the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General, hints at how much we still don’t know about Section 215. Nearly two years into the congressional debate over the use and legality of Section 215, the report provides the first official confirmation that the “tangible things” obtained by the F.B.I. through Section 215 include not just phone metadata but “email transactional records” and two full lines of other uses, all of which the F.B.I. saw fit to redact.","1207","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/who-needs-edward-snowden"
"Some have argued that the current surveillance regime isn’t as bad as the activities of Henry Kissinger, who ordered wiretaps on his rivals during the Vietnam era, or of J. Edgar Hoover, who used the F.B.I. to authorize the covert infiltration of left-wing groups and terrorized Martin Luther King, Jr., with anonymous threats. Those abuses led to the lengthy investigations of the Church Committee, and the current system of judicial and congressional oversight. It’s true that the modern surveillance regime is less about the passions of individuals and more about the tendencies of institutions. But those tendencies—especially the belief that national security can trump the plain English of the law—will likely make it hard for this generation to achieve meaningful surveillance reform. This week’s debate over Section 215 should be the beginning of a much larger conversation.","1208","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/who-needs-edward-snowden"

So the campaign reached out to the activists and arranged a time for a meeting after the event. Last week, video of the sixteen-minute, behind-closed-doors conversation was released. Clinton appeared measured and tense at times, holding her hands tightly in front of her. She listened carefully to the activists and gave thoughtful, unscripted, and sometimes impassioned answers to questions about her past support for policies that have harmed communities of color.","August 27, 2015","1232","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"One activist, Daunasia Yancey, pressed Clinton on her role in creating a system that continues to be unfairly punitive to African-Americans. Black Lives Matter activists have good reason to scrutinize Clinton’s previous endorsement of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, signed by President Bill Clinton. The U.S. prison system became the largest in the world during the Clinton Administration, with more people in prison or jail than ever before in American history. It was her husband’s bill, but, as First Lady, Hillary Clinton lobbied for its passage. Speaking at the annual conference of the National Center for Women and Policing, in 1994, for example, she said, “We need more police; we need more and tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders.”","1233","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"During the backstage meeting after her campaign event, Clinton made an honest, candid effort to explain to the activists that the crime bill—one of the most comprehensive pieces of criminal-justice legislation in U.S. history—was a sincere attempt to address a particular set of problems that emerged during the nineteen-eighties and nineties. At three hundred and fifty-six pages, the bill included provisions that aimed to protect vulnerable populations and reduce crime, such as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, the establishment of registries for sex offenders, the Violence Against Women Act, and penalty enhancements for hate crimes.","1234","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"Returning to the subject of the Clintons’ role in creating the current mass-incarceration problem, another activist, Julius Jones, posed a pointed and personal question: “I genuinely want to know…you and your family have been in no uncertain way partially responsible…. Now that you understand the consequences, what in your heart has changed that’s going to change the direction of this country? How do you actually feel that is different than how you felt before?”","1235","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"A month ago, Bill Clinton expressed remorse for the repercussions of the bill, admitting at an N.A.A.C.P. convention that the crime bill “made the problem worse.” But if the Black Lives Matter activists expected contrition or a telling anecdote from Hillary Clinton, they must have been disappointed.","1236","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"“I don’t believe you change hearts,” she said. Then, tempering her initial comment, she continued, “You may actually change some hearts. But, if that’s all that happens, we’ll be back here in ten years having the same conversation.”","1237","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"At this moment, the respectful, cordial tenor of the meeting took a noticeably different and more contentious tone. Clinton seemed irked, and there was a testy exchange about whose responsibility it is to effect social change. The Black Lives Matter activists looked for her to show some heartfelt introspection about her role in spawning our current “era of mass incarceration.” Clinton was unyielding: social change comes about when laws, not hearts, change.","1238","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"History tells us a different story about the larger question of social change. Hearts change all the time, and when hearts change, policy changes often follow. Not all hearts change, and not at an even or steady pace. Change comes in fits and starts, but our past suggests that our hearts are constantly evolving. The abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison used fiery and fervid lectures to change the hearts of his pro-slavery detractors, and reformers including Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, and many other ex-slaves penned autobiographies to change the hearts of Northern readers by enabling them to catch sight of the unspeakable horrors endured by enslaved people. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” published in 1852, sold three hundred thousand copies in its first year. “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” made its readers acutely aware of the brutal violence, the painful family separations, and the inhumane buying and selling of children that were all commonplace under the slave regime.","1239","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"By 1960, almost ninety per cent of households had televisions, which brought racial injustice, police brutality, and violent clashes between civil-rights activists and white Southern segregationists in Selma, Montgomery, and Birmingham into American living rooms. Civil-rights protests changed hearts and inspired many Americans—black and white—to join the movement. Approximately fifty thousand young people became part of the movement in 1960, when sit-ins and other protests swept through sixty-five cities in twelve Southern states.","1240","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"As Clinton noted, we are witnessing, in our own moment, a clear and resonant declaration that hearts have changed as more Americans accept same-sex marriage. According to a June, 2015, Pew Research Center report, support for same-sex marriage is currently at a record high: fifty-seven per cent of Americans support it—the highest rate in twenty years of polling—while, just five years ago, fewer Americans supported (forty-two per cent) than opposed it (forty-eight per cent).","1241","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"At the core of the Black Lives Matter movement is an urgent and vehement cry for hearts to change. It is a call for Americans to look at images of police brutality—including the recent footage of the fatal shooting of Samuel DuBose, who was pulled over for missing a front license plate and shot in the head at point-blank range—and not only see violence but feel as though that senseless violence could happen to their sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, husbands, wives, or friends.","1242","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"Hope and change are common foundational themes in Presidential campaigns, regardless of political party, from Ronald Reagan’s “It’s Morning Again in America,” in 1984, to Bill Clinton’s “I Still Believe in a Place Called Hope,” in 1992, to Barack Obama’s “Yes We Can,” in 2008.","1243","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"Hillary hit her own most hopeful notes in her last speech as a Presidential candidate during the 2008 primary. In her concession, Hillary’s message soared: “Although we weren’t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it’s got about eighteen million cracks in it. And the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time.”","1244","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"

"One of the questions that the Allied command had to resolve before undertaking the liberation of Europe from the Nazis, seventy-one years ago this summer, was whether the sandy beaches of Normandy would support the weight of amphibious landing vehicles and tanks. A map dating back to the Roman era suggested that the area might be underlain by soft, squishy peat bogs, in which the vehicles would surely sink. So, in early 1943, the Allies dispatched a team of engineers to perform a geological survey of the area. They came at night in a so-called midget submarine, swimming the final distance with their cumbersome gear—sidearms, sample tubes, augur screws, waterproof writing pads, flasks of brandy. When they ran out of containers to hold the sand samples, they used condoms, dodging German sentries and spotlights all the while.","July 8, 2015","1246","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/slide-show-donald-weber-war-sands"
"As it turned out, of course, the ground was firm enough to support the D Day landings of June 6th, 1944. But the operation itself changed the geological character of five stretches of beach—those code-named Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. As part of his ongoing project “War Sand,” the photographer Donald Weber, in partnership with a Queen’s University physics professor named Kevin Robbie, has been making microscopic images of the soil from each place. Like the Allied engineers, Weber began his study by taking samples.","1247","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/slide-show-donald-weber-war-sands"
"There are clear traces of the landings still in the sand, including tiny pieces of shrapnel and nearly perfect spheres of iron and glass, flash-melted in explosions and quickly hardened again. In some parts of the Normandy coast, they are the only physical reminders of the war. In another hundred years, they will likely be gone.","1248","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/slide-show-donald-weber-war-sands"
"On the face of it, a comparison between the composers Richard Wagner and Harry Partch would seem absurd. Wagner, the German operatic titan, enjoyed royal patronage, lived in comfort, and became the most influential cultural figure of the late nineteenth century. Partch (1901-74), the most extreme of American mavericks, lived much of his life in obscurity and near-poverty, patching together an existence with short-term academic gigs, foundation grants, and private gifts. But both men were driven by the need to control their own artistic worlds: Wagner by building a theatre where his “total works of art” would be most perfectly presented, and Partch by creating his own set of instruments (magnificently eccentric objects, mostly struck, plucked, and slapped, with names like Marimba Eroica, Cry-Chord, Chromelodeon, and Spoils of War), which employed exotic scales that divided the octave into forty-three degrees. Wagner’s reputation is indomitable, Partch’s worryingly fragile.","1249","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/beautiful-dreamer-classical-music-russell-platt"
"When Partch’s “Delusion of the Fury,” arguably the finest and most representative of his later works, was last performed in New York (at the Japan Society, in 2007), the production made use of the composer’s original instruments, which were then housed at Montclair State University, in New Jersey. Seven years later, an adventurous group from Cologne, Ensemble Musikfabrik, oversaw the creation of an entirely new set for the Ruhr Triennial’s production of “Delusion,” directed by Heiner Goebbels, which the Lincoln Center Festival will present at City Center on July 23-24. Goebbels, who has achieved wonders in radical adaptations of music and words by such figures as Hanns Eisler and Gertrude Stein, has restrained himself a bit here, letting Partch’s piece—its two acts inspired, respectively, by Japanese Noh drama and an Ethiopian folktale—speak largely for itself. (Rather innocently, he likens Partch’s music to that of the Beach Boys.) But the instruments (which, Partch maintained, “are the set”) are fantastical, the costumes outrageous, and the music, simultaneously primitive and elusively complex, weaves a strange and dreamy spell. ♦","1250","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/beautiful-dreamer-classical-music-russell-platt"

"The highest form of cinematic invention, running from Charlie Chaplin and Erich von Stroheim to Orson Welles and John Cassavetes, involves directors filming themselves as the stars of their own movies.

"Starting in the nineteen-seventies, the director Tony Buba made documentaries about his home town of Braddock, Pennsylvania, which was struggling with the closing of its steel mills. In “Lightning Over Braddock,” from 1988 (screening July 28), Buba set out to make a dramatic feature starring one of his former documentary subjects, Sal Caru, a colorful local character who boasted of gangland connections. What resulted instead is a grandly orchestrated, grimly comical, multilayered fantasy in which Buba, playing himself, both documents and dramatizes his own failed efforts to make that film.","1257","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/in-person-movies-richard-brody"
"Buba retraces his steps, delivering an autobiographical self-portrait with voice-overs, archival images, and clips from his earlier documentaries, which form a multifaceted visual history of the decline of Braddock, a formerly thriving town on the verge of ruin. Meanwhile, Buba directs Caru in wry, scrappy parodies of Hollywood films, including a martial-arts thriller, a Braddock-centered take on “Gandhi,” and a goofy gangster drama—and adds a techno-pop protest musical staged on location at a shuttered steel mill.","1258","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/in-person-movies-richard-brody"
"A Catholic, Buba offers spiritual justifications for his artistic choices and political commitments—yet films a self-mocking parody of confession. He documents grassroots political resistance in Braddock, including protests and rallies, discussions with the unemployed, confrontations with executives responsible for plant closings, and a visit by the Presidential candidate Jesse Jackson. Buba also films himself coping with Caru’s blustery demands and working in the editing room to salvage the plethora of loose-ended footage. With this comic, tender, self-revealing, and self-deprecating collage, Buba radically reimagines political cinema to enfold its advocacy into a deeply personal, deeply rooted sense of vocation.","1259","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/in-person-movies-richard-brody"
"The only feature to date by Wendell B. Harris, Jr., “Chameleon Street,” from 1989 (screening Aug. 27), is an exuberantly comic drama that’s adapted from the true stories of two con men—and includes as actors some of the people involved in their lives. Harris plays a composite of the two, who finagles his way into a medical residency in Michigan and a dorm room at Yale. The director mines the picaresque action for grand ideas, including the intimate conflicts arising from his artistic ambitions and, above all, the self-denying performances that a black person must stage in his daily life for the sake of mere survival, as when, fearing his own arrest, he absorbs, with a grand rhetorical flourish, a white racist’s aggressions. The core of the story is the difficulty faced by a black man in developing and asserting his identity.

"Of the roughly fifty-six thousand people who live in Greenland, the world’s largest island, the vast majority are Inuit, and almost a quarter live in the capital city, Nuuk. The rest of the country is made up of smaller towns and isolated coastal settlements in which people still rely on traditional methods of hunting and fishing for fish, seal, and whale meat. Inspired by the work of the mid-twentieth-century Danish photographer Jette Bang, who devoted her career to documenting Inuit life in Greenland, which then was a colony of Denmark, a new joint project by the Danish photographers Dennis Lehmann and Lasse Bak Mejlvang presents two very different sides of modern life in the country. Lehmann focussed his work in Tasiusaq, a settlement of only several hundred people, in the central-western part of the country. Mejlvang documented life further south along the coast, in Sisimiut, a fast-growing town of around six thousand, the second-largest in Greenland. Lehmann’s photos, shot in color, show a community built around family units and subsistence hunting. Mejlvang’s, shot in black-and-white, show a vibrant youth culture of dance parties, skateboarding, and “penguin” soccer. The resulting series, which is collected in a forthcoming book entitled “Inuit Now,” is a dialogue between outskirts and center, between Denmark and Greenland, and between the work of two young photographers. In the book’s introduction, they write, “To examine life and identity in the Arctic today, one has to look at the world from multiple angles.”","July 19, 2015","1261","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/two-sides-of-life-in-greenland"

Alan Gilbert, another gifted advocate, conducts a world première from Magnus Lindberg—one of a raft of works commissioned in celebration of Carnegie’s hundred-and-twenty-fifth anniversary—in the opening-night concert with the New York Philharmonic, with Kissin on hand as soloist in Tchaikovsky’s First Piano Concerto (Oct. 7).","1262","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/fall-preview-classical-music-evgeny-kissin"

"Americans have, at this juncture in our history, become accustomed to conducting our most painful reckonings in public. The balcony of the Lorraine Motel, Dealey Plaza, the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel, and a forsaken driveway in Mississippi occupy a profane corner in the minds of a generation of Americans. Yet the geography of conflict extends well beyond the locales where Martin Luther King, Jr., John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Medgar Evers perished. There are lesser-known addresses: the street corner where residents are routinely stopped and frisked, the side of the road where a driver is detained for a minor violation. These are the less visible conflicts that cumulatively become something volatile. Fifty years ago this week, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, a piece of legislation that was hailed as a hallmark of racial progress. Five days later, a police traffic stop in Watts, California, detonated five days of riots that left thirty-four dead and cleaved the city’s history into the era before the fires and the years that succeeded it.","1266","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/flash-points-ferguson-baltimore-newark"

These new photos capture recent events in Baltimore, Maryland, in Ferguson, Missouri, and in Newark, New Jersey, where Montgomery shadowed police officers in order to study the department’s use of stop-and-frisk. But his images from these three cities feel interchangeable, not just geographically but temporally as well. Canfield Drive in Ferguson and Presbury Street in Baltimore are reference points in a much longer lineage.

A young man stands in the middle of the street during a storm, his gaze focussed somewhere far behind the lens. What fear animates the expression he wears?

"The chef Marcus Samuelsson, who was born in Ethiopia, raised by an adoptive family in Sweden, and made famous as the executive chef at Aquavit, in midtown, is madly in love with Harlem. He moved there in 2005, “from a swanky but soulless place in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle to a swanky and soulful brownstone apartment,” he wrote in his 2012 memoir, “Yes, Chef.” The neighborhood, he was delighted to realize, “was not just black U.S.A. in a snow globe; it was one of the last bastions of New York City as creative people long for it to be.” In 2010, he opened Red Rooster, a swanky and soulful restaurant on Lenox Avenue, and began to establish himself as Harlem’s veritable mayor, enticing local regulars—including, especially, the creative élite—plus visiting V.I.P.s and celebrity-chasing tourists, with an elegantly global menu, effortlessly combining the flavors of the American South, Ethiopia, Sweden, and beyond.","1271","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/08/tables-for-two-streetbird"
"This spring, Samuelsson doubled down on his community outreach and introduced Streetbird, a more casual venture with an emphasis on rotisserie chicken, eaten in or taken out. If, with Red Rooster, Samuelsson tread gingerly as he sought acceptance from the object of his affection, he’s confident enough now to shout his adoration from the rooftops. The new place is a lively, endearing but painfully unsubtle homage to Harlem through the decades, from the graffiti on the rafters to the sneakers dangling from the sprinkler system and the booths upholstered in Louis Vuitton and Gucci leather.","1272","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/08/tables-for-two-streetbird"

The glossy-skinned rotisserie chicken is proficient but ultimately unspecial. The Sho’ Nuff Noodles are an overly faithful ode to take-out lo mein, and the crispy chicken in another vaguely Chinese dish called Mama Said Wok You Out is less exciting than your average General Tso’s. Two salads—the Fly Girl and the Grace Jonezz—turn out to be indistinguishable heaps of shredded and underdressed lettuce. If the lesson seems to be that Harlem can’t be bottled, there’s a certain irony to the fact that Streetbird’s condiments are a bright spot, particularly the sweet and spicy Jamerican sauce and the Bird Funk Spread, an oily paste of Chinese sausage, dried shrimp, and fermented black bean, which comes with Auntie’s Cornbread. The best dish—the Swediopian, a sort of boat made from spongy Ethiopian injera bread filled with tender, vinegary collards, the hearty Ethiopian chicken stew known as doro wat, creamy curds of fresh cheese, and crumbles of hard-boiled egg—is the most creative.

"Nicola Lo Calzo is a thirty-six-year-old Italian artist who now makes his home in Paris. He began his professional life as an architect, but buildings and landscapes proved less interesting—less inspiring—to him than the terrain of the face. In 2008, he began to travel in Africa, where he immersed himself in various societies that opened windows not only onto present-day life in Africa but onto the African diaspora. I first became aware of his work last year, when this magazine’s Web site published a portfolio of images that he had produced in the American South. There he recorded (in color) a black-and-white world in which antebellum mores were not so much acted out as displayed; everything had changed, and nothing had changed. For his 2010 project “The Promising Baby,” Lo Calzo went to Cameroon, where he photographed albino children, whose skin marked them as different: blacks who were shunned by blacks. In Cameroon, as in some other African countries, he explained in an interview, “to be albino means being condemned to a life of exclusion. Not only from the society but also from the family.” The children in the series confront Lo Calzo’s lens with indignation and defiance and not a little sadness. Who hasn’t witnessed or felt the ridicule and scorn that these children have suffered because of forces beyond their control? That’s one of the points that Lo Calzo raises in all his work, or not a point so much as a question: what does it look like to be both part of something and not? How do accidents of birth and history separate people and make them different? Are there links between American blacks and the citizens of, say, Niger? Subjugation, slavery, survival: we see all of these in Lo Calzo’s art, and something else, too—an unfetishistic relationship to a race that is not his own. He achieves this, in part, because his images are less about the look of things than about their legacy.","1324","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/08/exiles-portfolio-lo-calzo"
"In his most recent project, “Obia” (now showing at the Dominique Fiat Gallery, in Paris), Lo Calzo balances his heart with his historical curiosity. In the eighteenth century, a number of Africans—from the Saamaka, Ndyuka, Aluku, Paamaka, Matawai, and Kwinti peoples—who had been enslaved on plantations in French Guiana and Suriname escaped their forced labor and gathered in groups in the forests between colonial settlements. There these rebels, called Maroons, built their own communities, while periodically fighting off troops sent to reclaim the plantation owners’ property. In 1760, Dutch colonists signed the first treaty recognizing their former slaves’ will to freedom. Today, Maroons are still living where their ancestors literally cleared paths, but they are economically, and thus socially, marginalized. Yet another legion of black outcasts, many of them lead impoverished, unfocussed lives amid a rich and focussed history. How to survive it?","1325","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/08/exiles-portfolio-lo-calzo"
"Like his fellow-artists Dawoud Bey and Carrie Mae Weems, Lo Calzo takes as his great subject the meaning that a photographer’s eye can draw from the African diaspora, all those disappeared bodies brought back to life by their living and breathing descendants. ♦","1326","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/08/exiles-portfolio-lo-calzo"
"When I was very young, my family went on frequent Sunday trips to Coney Island to visit my great-grandmother. A tough-minded woman in her nineties, she had emigrated from Europe, married a fabric salesman who was surely among the last of the Jewish Adolphs, and raised ten children in various cramped apartments in Brooklyn. Now she lived in a modest, well-kept high-rise overlooking the factory where they made Bonomo Turkish Taffy. The reward for passable behavior during these visits was the promise of a ride on the Cyclone (this occurred precisely zero times) or a warning-laden “stroll” on the beach: “Careful! You’ll step on a syringe!” The building in which my great-grandmother lived was named for its developer, a master builder of the outer boroughs: Frederick Christ Trump.","July 8, 2015","1327","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Fred Trump was an old-school promoter, who, in summer, set loose colored balloons near the beach; each balloon contained a fifty-dollar discount coupon for one of his apartments. At his office, on Avenue Z, Fred Trump taught the business to his sons. Fred Trump died in 1999. One son, Donald Trump, took up his father’s example, slathered it in gold leaf and topped it with world-class cubic zirconia, cultivated a head of pumpkiny, multidirectional hair, accumulated billions of dollars (though likely fewer billions than he’s claimed), and, by the eighties, became the P. T. Barnum of his generation. My colleague Mark Singer once called Trump’s ascent a form of “performance art—an opera-buffa parody of wealth.”","1328","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"For decades, the many institutions of the press—high and low, left and right—have fed off Trump’s unapologetic vulgarity, his willingness to say absolutely anything. What did it matter to Trump if Jon Stewart used him as nightly cannon fodder? It was, as we now say, good for the brand. And what is the Trump brand? Over the years, we have been treated to Trump hotels, Trump magazine, Trump Airlines, Trump apartment buildings, Trump golf courses, Trump reality shows, Trump University, Trump the Game, Trump Chocolate, Trump the Fragrance, Trump Model Management, Trump Ice, Trump Steaks, Trump Vodka.","1329","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"The personal brand is, depending on your inclinations, a gilded jackass or an up-from-nothing tell-it-like-it-is-type-a-guy (without the up-from-nothing part). But it’s always been more than buffoonish entertainment. The sheer number of people and peoples who Trump has managed to insult, bully, and mistreat is, in its way, awe-inspiring. He congratulated Alejandro González Iñárritu for winning numerous Oscars for “Birdman” with this gracious remark: “Well, it was a great night for Mexico, as usual in this country.” He once told Bryant Gumbel, in an interview for an NBC program on race, what he thought about affirmative action: “If I was starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black, because I really do believe they have the actual advantage today.” In the seventies, the Trump real-estate company was sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in its rental practices in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Queens. After settling the case with Trump, the Justice Department sued yet again for non-compliance. In 1989, Trump took out an ad in the Daily News, and three other newspapers, about the Central Park jogger rape case, in which he declared that the “criminals of every age” who had been arrested twelve days earlier—five African-American and Hispanic teen-agers—were “crazed misfits,” part of “roving bands.” “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY,” the ad read. “BRING BACK OUR POLICE!” Years after it turned out that someone else had committed the crime, and the young men had finally been released from prison, Trump wrote an unapologetic op-ed for the paper in which he called the city’s push for restitution payments to the men “a disgrace.” He made it plain that, to him, their lives were nothing, and, besides, “These young men do not exactly have the pasts of angels.”","1330","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Trump’s blithe moral contempt has many targets. Women? He once told Esquire, “You know, it doesn’t really matter what [the media] write as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.” Climate change? Here’s a tweet, circa 2012: “It’s freezing and snowing in New York—we need global warming!” Trump has been among the country’s foremost (i.e., loudest) “birthers,” constantly prompting the idea, against all evidence, that Barack Obama was born in some other country and, therefore, is constitutionally unable to hold the office.","1331","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Trump is now running for President of the United States. His platform appears, in the early stages, to be a smelly soup of billionaire populism and yahoo nationalism—all flavored with a tangy dollop of old-timey racism. On Mexicans: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” (When challenged that a report he cited concerned immigrants who had been raped, he said, “Somebody’s doing the raping!”) Donald Trump is currently polling second among Republican primary voters in New Hampshire, Iowa, and nationally.","1332","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Trump has polled impressively, and fleetingly, before. His name recognition is high (thanks to his frenetically cultivated “brand”). His moment will pass, the experts say. And it probably will—or, at least, the current moment will. His miserable comments about Mexican immigrants have already cost him business. NBC, which came under heavy pressure from a Hispanic media-watchdog group and many viewers, severed ties with him, as has Macy’s, which carried his clothing line. Trump’s political and ideological forays have generally been promotional brand extensions, lasting only as long as they were, in his view, good for business; the whole con might end well before the first snows in Sioux City and Manchester.","1333","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard and an ideologist of the neoconservatives, is quick to say that he does not support Trump, but counsels the Republican Party to learn from his blunt political themes: pro-toughness, pro-winning, anti-Obamacare, etc. Kristol’s goal is to avoid the nomination of a mumbly centrist who refuses to attack head on the Obama legacy and, presumably, Hillary Clinton. If the Party fails to find an aggressively conservative candidate, he believes, Trump or someone like him might play the role of Ross Perot, siphoning away right-wing populist voters from the G.O.P.","1334","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Trump’s Republican opponents seem wary of calling him out in anything like harsh terms. They handle him as they would a live grenade. Jeb Bush, the one Republican in the mobbed field who is running ahead of Trump in New Hampshire, waited a few weeks before commenting on the latest outrage about Mexican rapist-immigrants storming our southern borders. Bush, who is married to a Mexican-American woman, did say the comments were “ugly,” and added that he was “absolutely” offended on a personal level. And yet his remarks, like those of other candidates, were calibrated to assure the public that Trump’s comments were “not reflective of the Republican Party.” As if this had been a misstep, an aberration, and not typical Trump. Some are unwilling to go even that far. Chris Christie distanced himself from Trump’s rant, too, but he was quick to add, “I like Donald. He’s a good guy.”","1335","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Christie is not alone in his affection. Recently, on “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart gave Bill Clinton plenty of room to tee off on Trump. Clinton declined. Trump, he said, with a wily smile, “has been, believe it or not, uncommonly nice to Hillary and me.” Perhaps. Not long ago, on MSNBC, Trump said that Clinton was “probably” the best of the four most recent Presidents. Then he added, “Frankly, had he not met Monica, had he not met Paula, had he not met various and sundry semi-beautiful women, he would have had a much better deal going.” That “sundry semi-beautiful” bit was an especially, even uncommonly, nice Trumpism. Hillary Clinton, for her part, could not bring herself to do anything more than tap Trump on the wrist. She told CNN that she was “very disappointed” in Trump’s remarks about Mexican immigrants—which, considering the fact that the Clintons attended one of Trump’s weddings, seems quite polite. But very disappointing.","1336","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"It’s a wonder, though, that Kristol is so concerned. In large measure, when it comes to issues like marriage equality and Obamacare, the Republicans have come through with Spenglerian stir-the-base rhetoric. After the announcement of the Supreme Court decision on marriage equality, Ted Cruz declared, “Today is some of the darkest twenty-four hours in our nation’s history.” Rick Santorum said that the Court’s decision “put the nail in the coffin” of the institution of marriage itself. “The climate is changing,” the milder Jeb Bush has allowed, but adds, against nearly absolute scientific consensus, “whether men are doing it or not.”","1337","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"History is replete with joke candidates for high office. Will Rogers ran for President, in 1928, as the standard-bearer of the Anti-Bunk Party, and wrote a book about his experience: “He Chews to Run.” One Yetta Bronstein, an (imaginary) citizen of the Bronx and the creation of a hoax artist named Alan Abel, was on Presidential campaign posters, in 1964 and 1968, promoting fluoridation, sex education, and, oddly, bingo. (“Vote for Yetta and watch things get better.”) At the 1968 Democratic Convention, in Chicago, the Yippies put forward their candidate: Pigasus. And, for a brief time in 2007, Stephen Colbert entered the race, promising “truthiness” for all.","1338","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Donald Trump is a joke, too, but of a different sort. His intention is not to inspire laughter or relief; his targets are not the powerful. He doesn’t punch up. He spews forth ugliness everywhere he goes. It would be nice, and maybe wise, simply to ignore him, in the hope that he will, after all these many years, just go away. But he never really does, and the most immediate concern is not that he will win the office he pursues but that he will get in the heads of the candidates around him. Trump’s father was a self-promoter who dispersed discounts in his balloons. The son offers only toxic gas.","1339","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"When Martin O’Malley, one of the back-running Democratic Presidential candidates, accused “party bosses” of fixing the nomination process, it was enough to bring on a wave of nostalgia. Party bosses! The concept is as distant as a time when there really were party bosses, people like Thomas Pendergast, whose machine ran Kansas City when Harry Truman was a senator (bosses often came with “machines”), or Chicago bosses like Edward Kelly, in the Roosevelt era, or Richard J. Daley, in the Eisenhower-Kennedy-Johnson-Nixon era. But, despite O’Malley’s complaint, it is hard to make a case that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman who heads the Democratic National Committee, is a boss or controls a machine, even if the debate schedule—four “authorized” debates before the Iowa caucuses, on February 1st, and just six in all—does skew suspiciously toward the already widely known Hillary Clinton.

Priebus can seem like the dad in an old-time situation comedy, the ineffectual, slightly comic figure who accidentally switches shopping lists with a shady neighbor. Priebus aside, the Republican Party may nonetheless have acquired a new sort of boss, or perhaps anti-boss—Fox News Channel’s Megyn Kelly, who is politically alert, unflinching, and, to judge from the evidence of recent years, attuned to reality. That’s what so annoyed the onetime “mastermind” Karl Rove when, on the night of the 2012 election, he refused to accept the arithmetic of the decisive Ohio vote. Kelly tried to help him with the math, and their curious dialogue continued two days later, when Rove insisted several times that Obama’s victory wasn’t all that impressive and Kelly said, “You keep saying that, but he won, Karl, he won … and that’s what the Republicans care about, what the Democrats care about.”","1341","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-the-g-o-p-need-a-new-machine"

During last week’s first Republican debate, her unnerving presence might have been enough to make Bush say (in response to a question from Bret Baier about family dynasties), “In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it,” a bit of self-congratulation that made no sense at all.","1342","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-the-g-o-p-need-a-new-machine"
"Priebus has been trying for more than a month to get Donald Trump, still the party’s unlikely front-runner, to “tone it down,” beginning with Trump’s comments about immigrants, and continuing with his mystifyingly offensive comments about Kelly, who, during the Republican debate, was ready to take her shot and bag her trophy by quoting Trump to Trump: “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals,’ ” which sounded like dialogue from a Neil LaBute play, and asking if that showed a Presidential temperament.","1343","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-the-g-o-p-need-a-new-machine"
"If Priebus really were a sitcom dad, he would be shaking his head and saying, “That dratted Donald!” But, in the real world, there is not much that Priebus can do. He has tried, like Schultz, to limit the number of debates (to nine), the better to escape the twenty-debate “clown car” stigma of 2012, and both parties are prepared to ban “unsanctioned debates,” though it’s hard to imagine how this could be effectively enforced.","1344","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-the-g-o-p-need-a-new-machine"
"Priebus can shake his head, but he can’t affect the momentum of the nomination contest. For that, the party needs someone who can act the way party professionals did when bosses were bosses, when Democrats like the Bronx boss Edward Flynn, recognizing that President Roosevelt was a dying man, were determined to dump the suspiciously flaky Russophile Vice-President, Henry Wallace, from the national ticket. (Dwight Macdonald, in a short, cheerfully biased Wallace biography, emphasized the Vice-President’s attraction to spiritualism, numerology, and astrology, as well as his intriguing friendship with a Russian mystic.)

Rather, the beginning of the slow-motion end for Trump, if indeed it is the end, won’t have come from a private conversation among city bosses or a shove from Reince Priebus—or from the other Republican candidates, who are either ineffectual or have shied away. It may take years to understand what it means to give a cable anchor the power, and authority, to try to push a leading candidate off the bus.

The strategy is one of triangulation, of giving dimensions to a metropolis that, in the popular imagination, has long been said to resist them, although every Angeleno knows they’re there.

"If you’re confused by what’s been happening to China’s currency over the past few days, don’t feel bad. The wild ride that the yuan has taken has left plenty of people perplexed, including, perhaps, China’s very own policymakers. The turmoil started on Tuesday, when China’s central bank announced that it was effectively devaluing the yuan. China has historically kept very tight control over the value of its currency. It’s done so by announcing a daily target value for the yuan, one that is designed to keep the exchange rate between the yuan and the dollar stable. (In theory, the yuan is pegged to a larger basket of currencies, but in practice, it’s been pegged to the dollar.) And it’s backed up that commitment by being willing to buy or sell as much currency as necessary to maintain the peg. Typically, the value of the yuan has moved only a tiny bit from day to day. On Tuesday, though, the central bank announced a value that was roughly two per cent lower than the day before, and the yuan quickly traded down to that level.","August 14, 2015","1367","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/china-gambles-with-the-yuan"
"On its own, this would not have been all that big a deal. It could plausibly have been seen as China just trying to moderate the value of its currency, which has been rising steadily this year (because it’s followed the value of the dollar, which has soared). But the story didn’t end there. The central bank also announced that henceforth it would let the yuan’s value be determined, in part, by where it had ended trading the day before, rather than by government decree. This suggested that China was loosening the peg and would tolerate wider swings in the yuan than it once did. Investors took the cue—the currency’s value against the dollar tumbled another 2.6 per cent over the next couple days, bringing its over-all decline to 4.4 per cent. Now people are wondering how much further, if at all, China’s government will allow the currency to fall.","1368","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/china-gambles-with-the-yuan"
"The confusion stems, in part, from the mixed messages that the Chinese government has been sending. On the one hand, many observers believe China is trying to drive the value of the yuan down, which would help its flagging export sector by making Chinese-made goods cheaper to buy. On the other hand, if a serious devaluation is the government’s goal, it’s going about it in a strangely bumpy and haphazard way. In late trading on Wednesday, for instance, the value of the yuan actually spiked higher, which sparked stories that the government had intervened in the market to drive the yuan up. And on Thursday evening, after the currency had fallen once again, the central bank said that it had “withdrawn from the normal mode of intervention,” but also said that there was no reason for the yuan to fall further. What that means, in policy terms, is anyone’s guess.","1369","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/china-gambles-with-the-yuan"
"If there’s a coherent story to be told here, it may be this: because China’s economy has been struggling, and its exports in particular have been weak (they fell eight per cent in July), policymakers wanted to devalue the yuan in order to make the nation’s products more competitive in the global marketplace. They also wanted to give the market more say over the value of the yuan, because ultimately that’s the only way that China’s currency can become a global one like the dollar or the euro. So Chinese officials announced a small devaluation, and have then allowed the market to send the yuan lower. Exports will get a boost, and the government, which has been criticized in the past for manipulating the currency to give China an unfair trade advantage, can say that it is investors who are determining how much the yuan is worth.","1370","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/china-gambles-with-the-yuan"
"The problem with this strategy is twofold. First, ceding at least some control over the value of your currency to the market means ceding more control over your economy as well. Just about every country in the world already does this, but it’s very different from the path that China has followed in the past—and it requires accepting more uncertainty than Chinese policymakers have been used to. It’s not surprising, in that sense, that China’s actions over the past few days have seemed erratic, appearing to oscillate between a hands-off and a hands-on approach. (A similar dynamic, arguably, has been at work in the way China has tried to manage its stock market in recent months.)","1371","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/china-gambles-with-the-yuan"
"The other problem for China is practical: devaluation is not a silver bullet for the country’s economy. It will raise inflation. It will create problems for many Chinese companies, which have piles of dollar-denominated debt that becomes harder to pay off as the value of the yuan sinks. And it’s also politically toxic—U.S. lawmakers are already blasting China for starting a currency war. So even if the Chinese wanted the yuan to fall, that doesn’t mean they want it to keep tumbling, especially not at a rapid pace. And that means they may need to intervene to prop the yuan’s value up, even as they’re allowing the market to drive it down.","1372","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/china-gambles-with-the-yuan"
"These problems are hardly unmanageable. But the real question that the turmoil over the yuan raises, especially when coupled with what’s been happening to the Chinese stock market, is whether policymakers actually have a real plan for the economy, or whether they’re just winging it. For many years, the abiding assumption about China has been that the people in charge of the country can be counted on to keep its economy on an even keel, and that they’re up to meeting whatever new challenges that the country faces as its economy matures and slows. And certainly anyone betting against that assumption in the past has been proven wrong. But as we watch China’s leadership struggle to deal with myriad problems (some of which are self-inflicted), it might be worth keeping a fundamental rule of investing in mind: past performance is no guarantee of future results.","1373","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/china-gambles-with-the-yuan"
"Well, that was fast. After months of being stuck in a comfortable trading range, the U.S. stock market suddenly cracked, with the S&P 500 tumbling more than five per cent in two days, leaving the market, at close on Friday, 7.5 per cent below the all-time high it set back in May. The short-term reasons for the sell-off are easy to enumerate: the continued decline in oil prices; worries about a possible interest-rate hike by the Fed in September; and concerns about the struggles of emerging-market economies like Brazil, Malaysia, and, above all, China. And the selling frenzy on Friday was also undoubtedly exacerbated by traders’ obsession with so-called technical factors, like the fact that the S&P 500 had fallen below its two-hundred-day moving average on Thursday and hadn’t recovered by the end of the day. (Yes, this is the kind of thing that makes some people buy or sell stocks.) But behind all of these issues was something more fundamental: when stock valuations are high, even small changes in investors’ expectations about the future can have a big influence on stock prices in the present.","August 23, 2015","1374","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-method-in-the-markets-current-madness"
"At first glance, it’s not obvious that the things investors are worried about will, in the short term, put a sizable dent in either the U.S. economy (which is doing as well as it has in a long time) or in corporate profits. Low oil prices are bad for the energy sector, but they’re great for U.S. consumers and the companies that serve them. Developing economies like Brazil’s and Mexico’s are certainly important markets for many American companies, but they still account for a relatively small percentage of corporate sales. And while China’s troubles are certainly a bigger deal, an economic slowdown there would, in the short run, have a devastating effect mainly on commodity sellers. The stock sell-off on Thursday and Friday, though, engulfed companies across the board, including firms that would seem to be relatively insulated from emerging-market trouble. It’s hard to see, for instance, how recession in Brazil or stagnation in China is going to materially damage next year’s earnings for companies like Amazon and Netflix. But Amazon’s stock fell seven per cent last week, while Netflix’s fell a remarkable seventeen per cent.","1375","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-method-in-the-markets-current-madness"
"You could see this as evidence of the market’s irrationality—once investors panic, they dump everything overboard. And this undoubtedly explains some of what happened (as does investors’ desire to cash in on stocks that had been on a strong run). But in fact it makes sense that high fliers like Netflix and Amazon would be among the biggest victims of the sell-off, because their stock prices depend almost entirely on investors’ expectations about their performance over the very long term—a phenomenon I described in the magazine last week.","1376","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-method-in-the-markets-current-madness"
"Amazon, for instance, isn’t worth two hundred and thirty billion dollars because of how much money investors think it will make over the next five years, but because of how much money investors think it will make over the next thirty, forty, or even fifty years. And over that long a stretch of time, even small changes in how fast a company grows can have very big economic consequences. The difference between growing, say, ten per cent a year and growing twelve per cent a year is trivial over a one-year span. But over a thirty-year span, it becomes surprisingly important. (A company that grows at an annual rate of twelve per cent will end up seventy per cent bigger than one that grows at an annual rate of ten per cent.) So when investor expectations shift even a little bit, or simply become more uncertain, highly priced stocks are often severely punished.","1377","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-method-in-the-markets-current-madness"
"You can apply this same logic to today’s market as a whole. While the market is not, by any stretch of the imagination, outrageously priced, it is carrying a pretty rich valuation. Depending on whose numbers you trust, the S&P 500’s price-to-earnings ratio is somewhere between nineteen and twenty-one. In the simplest terms, that means investors are counting on companies to deliver steady earnings growth for many years to come. So anything that makes companies’ long-term earnings prospects look even a little bit shaky—like signs that China’s economy will never grow at seven per cent annually again—can lead to a sharp sell-off.","1378","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-method-in-the-markets-current-madness"
"This is the real paradox of big market moves like the one we saw on Thursday and Friday: while they’re often seen as evidence of investors reacting to short-term news, they’re more likely to happen when the market has a very long time horizon. The price of a long-term perspective, in that sense, is sometimes short-term turmoil. And while it’s undoubtedly nerve-wracking to watch billions of dollars in stock-market wealth vanish in a matter of minutes, it’s actually a good thing that investors are testing their expectations against reality and re-setting prices accordingly. The danger going forward is that the sell-off will start to feed on itself, leading the market to overshoot on the downside. But at the moment, this looks like the kind of healthy correction we should periodically expect in a richly valued market.","1379","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-method-in-the-markets-current-madness"

In 2010, The Lancet retracted the article, and Wakefield became a pariah in the medical world.

One called “Obama The Bad,” perhaps, or “Modern America Sucks.” Based upon what we saw in New Hampshire on Monday night, where fourteen of the Republican candidates appeared together, we can assume there will be frequent fulminations about undocumented immigrants, rote pledges to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and outraged attacks on Planned Parenthood.","1389","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"

You don’t know whether or not the three folks that are asking the questions are trying to trick you up.” Although Fox is generally supportive of the Republican Party, Baier, Kelly, and Wallace are all experienced journalists who will probably be looking to force the candidates to deviate from their prepared messages. “I’ve got some doozies in there,” Wallace told the Washington Post’s Krissah Thompson, patting his pre-debate binder.","1391","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"The debate will last two hours. Since each candidate will be allotted roughly equal time, the moderators won’t get many chances to interrogate Trump. If they confine their questions to his favorite subjects—immigration and the incompetence of career politicians—he will probably sail through. As he said to O’Reilly, he’s been talking about these things for years, and he’s amply prepared to do so again. But if he’s asked about less familiar topics, or is subjected to awkward questions about his own record, such as a history of associations with companies that filed for bankruptcy, or his unsubstantiated claims about President Obama’s birthplace, he might find things trickier.","1392","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"

Appearing on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” on Wednesday, he repeated this message, saying he was hoping for a “civil” debate. This suggests that Trump won’t repeat his criticisms of Jeb Bush—including that Bush can’t win, and describing him as “out of touch with the American people.” Plus, since former Texas governor Rick Perry has failed to make the cut for the prime-time debate, the target of some of Trump’s harshest comments will be absent.","1393","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"

Quoting George Bernard Shaw, one New Hampshire Republican told Politico, “The old maxim applies: Never wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it.” That seems like sound advice. If Trump’s candidacy endures, his principal rivals will eventually have to confront him head-on. But, for now, their primary aim should be to expound on their own platforms, appear to be plausible occupants of the Oval Office, and reinforce their position as the leading orthodox candidates.","1395","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"

None of these candidates is enjoying a great campaign, and a couple of them—Christie and Paul—are floundering in the polls. This gives them an incentive to lob a few grenades. Since Christie is friendly with Trump, however, it seems unlikely that he will seek to play the role of assassin. Paul has no such ties, and he’s already made dismissive remarks about Trump. Last week, he attributed Trump’s rise in the polls to a “loss of sanity,” adding, “We’re going to come back to our senses and look for someone serious to lead the country at some point.”","1396","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"In addition to a possible set-to between Paul and Trump, political professionals will be monitoring the other second-tier candidates, to see if any of them shows signs of breaking out. Cruz and Huckabee, who are both accomplished public speakers, will be seeking to position themselves as conservative tribunes, as will Carson, the former surgeon, who will be making his début on the national political stage. Rubio, whose poll ratings don’t match his perceived status as one of the leading candidates, needs to make a good impression. Kasich, the governor of Ohio, will also be worth watching.

(The Constellation, it was called—“The cleaner that walks on air.”) Neither machine sucked with much conviction, and the flotation edge of the Constellation was always exasperatingly tripping over its own cord and nudging itself under the frayed edges of oriental carpets.","1400","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/innovation-suction"
"It wasn’t until I got married, in 1985, that a truly well-designed cleaning device came into my world: the Panasonic three-wheeled bagless vacuum cleaner. You could walk it by the hose like a puppy, and it had a plastic piece fitted onto its removable filter that clacked over the filter’s vanes to dislodge the finest, cakiest dust. I liked the Panasonic so much that I had to mention it in my first novel. But it got old and I didn’t want to wear it out, so I put it away in the attic, and for the past twenty years we’ve had a series of not-very-good vacuums—two uprights with moaning roller brushes, and several sleek, tasteful Mini Cooperesque appliances that should have been better than they were. We thought of buying a Dyson at one point, because it was supposed to be a cyclonic triumph of industrial design, but when we used it as guests in a vacation house we found that it was made of lots of gray and yellow rattly plastic pieces and fitted with buttons that did the wrong thing. And it just didn’t suck properly—all it did was leave wheelmarks on a fluffed-up carpet, evidence that we’d used it. Maybe it was an early model.","1401","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/innovation-suction"
"Our biggest disappointment came a year ago, when we bought an eighty-dollar bagless Dirt Devil EZ Lite. It worked well for a half hour at a time. The so-called dirt cup had several finicky components, perhaps in imitation of the Dyson; to restore the machine to full suction you had to dig around in the curved whisps of dog and cat fur that collected in a tub, like cotton candy in a floss bowl, and twist to release a central perforated tube, then pry out a sandwich-sized filter and thumb it manually, as if you were strumming a zither, sending plumes of superfine filth back out into the kitchen. Behind the filter was a square piece of gray foam from which you scraped more residual dark matter with your fingernails. Then you did your best to reassemble what you had just taken apart. You practically had to strap on a surgical mask to make the thing work the way it was supposed to. In midwinter despair, we contemplated buying a German-made Miele canister vac for three or four or five hundred dollars. But this seemed like madness for something that was essentially a fan on wheels attached to a flexible hose.","1402","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/innovation-suction"
"Then, last month, we found something great. It cost fifty dollars and it’s maroon and it has three wheels and a cord that actually retracts the way it’s supposed to, and raw suction like I’d never dreamed was possible in something that weighs about as much as a briefcase. And it has a bag, which is a very good thing when you have an old house full of all kinds of things that you don’t want exploding out over the trash can. It’s called the Bissell Zing (bagged model). So strong is the Zing’s suction that it has a volume dial in its forehead that you can adjust on the fly from gentle to area-rug-ravaging. I vacuumed several rooms before a dinner party last week and found myself singing Irish drinking songs loudly as I worked. The Zing even inhaled the deep grit packed between the floorboards of the kitchen floor. Later, it sucked up too many twigs and paper scraps and began making an unearthly whistle, but the wand came apart for unclogging, and once again the pennies and the dust-bunnied to-do lists and the unpopped popcorn kernels flew up the hose. My God, this Zing thing a marvel. Fifty dollars! Who knows how long it will last, but for now we finally have true suction back in our life.","1403","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/innovation-suction"

"It continues to be a golden age of men’s tennis, though the lustre may be fading, or beginning to, or is, perhaps, soon to begin to. Rafael Nadal is not the Rafael Nadal of two years ago, Roger Federer is approaching middle age, and the rivalry between Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray—the likely marquee matchup for the remainder of the decade—produces remarkable defense, but also a fair amount of rally monotony; their styles are too similar.","August 31, 2015","1406","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-man-to-watch-as-the-u-s-open-begins"
"The strength of the men’s side, though, has never been just the top guys. The best way to delight in men’s tennis during the first week of the U.S. Open, which begins today, in Flushing Meadows, is to avoid the cavernous confines of Arthur Ashe Stadium—if you need to see Fed or Nole, watch them practice—and get to whichever side court the tournament officials have assigned to the Ukrainian journeyman Alexandr Dolgopolov. (His first-round match, scheduled for Monday afternoon on Court 4, is against the Australian Sam Groth.)","1407","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-man-to-watch-as-the-u-s-open-begins"
"He is as quick as any player on the tour. He has more power than anyone under six feet and weighing less than a hundred and sixty pounds has a right to. He has a lovely backhand slice, can hit a drop shot from anywhere on the court, is not afraid of employing a low-arcing top-spin lob, and is entertained by the idea of being entertaining: attempting a trick shot or kibitzing with fans, opponents, and especially himself. (Alas, his off-court antics are not so charming; he took to his Instagram account last year to make fun of the Austrian drag singer Conchita Wurst, who won the Eurovision Song Contest.) He has everything—except patience and consistency, the lack of which can be engaging, too, in its way. It’s a reminder of how hard tennis is, and of the greatness of the truly great.","1408","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-man-to-watch-as-the-u-s-open-begins"
"As it happens, Dolgopolov—at age twenty-six, after nine years as a pro—is playing some of the best tennis of his life. A couple of weeks ago, at the Western & Southern Open, in Cincinnati, he dispatched sixth-ranked Tomáš Berdych and reached the semifinals, where he went up a set against Djokovic before losing a grueling second-set tiebreak and then, deflated, a lopsided third set and the match. The Dog, as he’s affectionately known, has never beaten Djokovic in five tries, but, four years ago, at the U.S. Open, in windblown Louis Armstrong Stadium, I got to watch them play each other for the first time; their first set—more than seventy-five minutes, ending with Djokovic, in the midst of his most dominant season, winning a 16-14 tiebreak—appeared at times like something composed by Twyla Tharp. I’d never seen Dolgopolov before, and I was instantly hooked.","1409","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-man-to-watch-as-the-u-s-open-begins"
"In London earlier this summer, at the Queen’s Club tuneup for Wimbledon, I saw him play Nadal in an opening-round match. Dolgopolov served first and quickly went up 30-0: two slice serves, two desperately stabbed backhand returns from Rafa, then two flattened-out forehand winners in response. My seat was just three rows behind Nadal’s coaching box, so I got an intimate glimpse of the what-the-fuck look Rafa shot his longtime coach, his uncle Toni, after the second of those winners. It was a look that said that the Dog’s confident, and on, and “Why me?” By afternoon’s end, Nadal would be crashing out of the tourney, but not before three sets of all-court, full-sprint tennis, both players sweat-soaked from chasing lobs and all manner of backspin and sidespin droppers. In each of the last two sets, Dolgopolov went on one of his typical walkabouts, losing focus and carrying on extensive conversations with himself. He doesn’t self-berate in the sour, sunken-cheeked way of Andy Murray; he goes on calmly and at length, gesturing with his hands, rolling his eyes, shrugging here and there. He looks, for all the world, like a guy waiting for his train at Grand Central while trying to coax one last client via his hands-free Bluetooth.","1410","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-man-to-watch-as-the-u-s-open-begins"
"Dolgopolov’s father, Oleksandr, was a pro player who went on to coach Andrei Medvedev, Ukraine’s first post-Soviet tennis star. Dolgopolov and his mother, a gymnast, went on tour with them, and, as a toddler, he was already hitting with the likes of Jim Courier and Boris Becker. There remains something childlike, something unschooled and ungainly, about aspects of the Dog’s tennis—his serve, for starters, which he not only hits on the rise, as the tossed ball is still ascending, but in a manner at once rushed and herky-jerky, as if some Geppetto is yanking strings attached to his knees and elbows. His father coached him at first, but they had a falling-out. He spent a few years with the Australian maverick Jack Reader, but that relationship succeeded to the extent it did only because, as Dolgopolov has said, “he wasn’t really pushing me or trying to change a lot in my game.” That’s an outlook to keep a player at a comfortable distance from the Top Ten.","1411","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-man-to-watch-as-the-u-s-open-begins"
"On those days, though, when Dolgopolov has it together, even for a set, you are treated to the pleasures of childlike play. His presence on the court is effervescent; his shots, often enough, wondrous. You shake your head. You smile. Tennis, his game reminds you, is a game.","1412","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-man-to-watch-as-the-u-s-open-begins"
"Supporters of the Affordable Care Act, starting with President Barack Obama, have generally taken the high road in response to Thursday’s decision by the Supreme Court to uphold the heart of the law. Graciousness in victory is, perhaps, its own reward. But it may also be appropriate, on the occasion of the 6–3 decision in King v. Burwell, to observe that this lawsuit was from its inception a shameful and cynical exercise, which illustrated the debasement of the contemporary conservative legal movement.","June 25, 2015","1413","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doom-for-a-cynical-assault-on-obamacare"
"The facts of the case are by now well known. The core goal of the Affordable Care Act was to provide health insurance to as many Americans as possible. States were encouraged to set up exchanges, or marketplaces, where individuals could buy insurance, and there would be subsidies from the federal government for people who needed them. Before it passed, in 2010, the A.C.A. was subject to one of the longest and most contentious congressional debates in recent history. The law was attacked and analyzed from every conceivable perspective. The law may have been wise, or it may have been foolish, but it was universally understood.","1414","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doom-for-a-cynical-assault-on-obamacare"
"Months after the law went into effect, a group of conservative lawyers discovered what was, at most, a drafting error in the law. A section of the law suggested that the subsidies should only go to individuals who bought insurance on exchanges “established by the State.” This discovery prompted the lawyers to argue that the subsidies would not be available to people who bought insurance on the federal exchange, which is the only exchange in thirty-four states. Notably—crucially—not one member of Congress who debated the law suggested that subsidies were to be denied to purchasers on the federal exchange. Still, these lawyers recruited plaintiffs and argued that more than six million people who bought insurance on the federal exchange should be denied their subsidies.","1415","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doom-for-a-cynical-assault-on-obamacare"
"What principle was at stake in this lawsuit? The correct answer is none. This is a contrast to National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, which was the first challenge to the A.C.A. In that case, the plaintiffs argued that Congress lacked the constitutional authority to pass the law in the first place. The case made a respectable (if ultimately unsuccessful) argument for a narrow conception of the government’s ability to regulate health care under the Constitution. King v. Burwell did not implicate the Constitution at all. It was, rather, based on a claim that the Obama Administration violated the A.C.A. itself by offering subsidies to purchasers on the federal exchange. The case was, in other words, a sophisticated game of gotcha, based on what was, again, essentially a typographical error. The case was only about trying to destroy the law by denying insurance to millions and setting in motion a death spiral of raised premiums, cancelled policies, and more rate hikes until the system collapsed. (The sheer callousness of the plaintiffs’ lawyers in King was something to behold. Millions tossed off health insurance? Hey, deal with it.)","1416","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doom-for-a-cynical-assault-on-obamacare"
"For writing the opinion upholding the law, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., is being hailed (and denounced) as a latter-day Earl Warren—a Republican appointee who turns out to be a secret liberal. This is hardly accurate. Roberts is still the author of the Shelby County case, which gutted the Voting Rights Act, and an eager member of the court majority in Citizens United and all the other cases that undermined our system of regulating political campaigns. But as his restrained and cogent opinion in King demonstrated, he is not a partisan ideologue. Quoting liberally from opinions by Justice Antonin Scalia, Roberts made the commonsensical observation that a law must be interpreted as a whole, not by the analysis of a few stray words here and there. And the context of the full A.C.A. compelled the obvious conclusion that the subsidies were intended to go to individuals on both the federal as well as state exchanges. The law would otherwise make no sense. As Roberts wrote, “The statutory scheme compels us to reject [the plaintiffs’] interpretation because it would destabilize the individual insurance market in any State with a Federal Exchange, and likely create the very ‘death spirals’ that Congress designed the Act to avoid.” Recognition of this obvious fact does not make Roberts a liberal; it makes him a judge.","1417","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doom-for-a-cynical-assault-on-obamacare"
"In dissent, Scalia cranked up his increasingly tired act as the Court’s sound-bite generator. According to Scalia, the Court engaged in “interpretive jiggery-pokery,” spouted “pure applesauce,” and should prompt Obamacare to be renamed “SCOTUScare.” The problem with Scalia’s dissent is the problem with the lawsuit as a whole. It’s a transparent attempt to undermine the law by whatever means happen to be available rather than by any consistent jurisprudential principle. Back in the nineteen-sixties and seventies, judicial conservatives believed in restraint—in deference to the elected branches of government. That led them to oppose such decisions as Roe v. Wade, which overturned state laws banning abortion, and to support broad exercises of executive power. The King case shows that some conservatives have abandoned their old idea of deference to the executive branch and are simply filing lawsuits against the laws they don’t like—and coming up with whatever reasons they can to support them.","1418","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doom-for-a-cynical-assault-on-obamacare"

If Republicans can win the Presidency and extend their control of Congress, they may well have the chance to undo the law, and they will have every right to do so. But today the Court said that the future of the law should be decided in that political process and not in response to litigation stunts like King v. Burwell.","1419","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doom-for-a-cynical-assault-on-obamacare"

On Monday, European stock markets fell sharply, and one widely respected analyst, Mohamed El-Erian, put the odds of drachmas returning to circulation at eighty-five per cent.","1421","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-the-united-states-prevent-a-grexit"

However, one thing we’ve learned from this story is that it’s not over until it’s over. The referendum is six days away. There is still time for a face-saving agreement to be put together—and the United States appears to be trying to mediate between the two sides, or, at least, to persuade them to restart the negotiations.","1422","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-the-united-states-prevent-a-grexit"
"Over the weekend, President Obama spoke with Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany. On Monday, he spoke with François Hollande, the French President. A Reuters report quoted an aide to Hollande saying that the two leaders “have agreed to pool their efforts to facilitate a resumption of the talks so as to find a solution to the crisis as soon as possible and ensure Greece’s financial stability.” Meanwhile, Jacob Lew, the American Treasury Secretary, called Alexis Tsipras, Greece’s Prime Minister, and he has also spoken to Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, and Wolfgang Schäuble, the hard-line finance minister of Germany.","1423","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-the-united-states-prevent-a-grexit"
"Of course, for a deal to be put together, both sides would have to be willing to make some concessions, and at this stage it’s by no means clear that they are. Over the weekend, I spoke to a couple of knowledgeable observers who both expressed the view that the European Union, and Germany in particular, had deliberately instigated a confrontation to bring about regime change in Athens.","1424","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-the-united-states-prevent-a-grexit"
"Last week, after prevaricating for months, Tsipras’s Syriza Party government put a detailed offer on the table that went some way toward meeting its creditors’ demands for a continuation of austerity policies, but that also requested recognition that Greece urgently needs some debt relief. Rather than accepting this offer as the basis for an agreement, Greece’s partners demanded further cuts in pensions and other government programs, and they rejected outright the idea of considering debt relief, saying that it should be left to a future deal. This placed Tsipras in an invidious position. If he made more concessions, he would almost certainly have faced an internal revolt. If he refused to bend, he would be opening up the possibility of Greece crashing out of the eurozone, which most Greeks don’t want to see happen, and which, too, could have spelled the end of the Syriza government.","1425","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-the-united-states-prevent-a-grexit"
"Of course, every story has two sides. European officials claim that the negotiations were actually going pretty well last week, with the gap between the two sides narrowing in a number of different areas, including the budget targets that Greece would adopt and how changes would be made to various programs, such as when the country’s retirement age would be raised. According to this version of events, there was a realistic chance of an agreement before Tuesday, when the bailout was due to expire. But Tsipras, either because he couldn’t sell such a deal domestically, or because he thought that, by raising the prospect of a Grexit, he could frighten the other European countries into making him a better offer, decided to upend the talks and announce a referendum.","1426","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-the-united-states-prevent-a-grexit"
"Whatever Tsipras’s motivations were, the announcement of the referendum prompted the creditors to harden their position. On Saturday, European finance ministers refused to extend the existing Greek bailout beyond Tuesday’s deadline, as Tsipras had requested. And on Sunday, the European Central Bank, which has been propping up Greece’s banks with emergency loans, refused to increase the amount of money it is extending through these programs. In keeping the existing programs in operation, the E.C.B. prevented an immediate collapse in the Greek banking system. But the announcement that no new credit would be forthcoming raised the possibility that Greek banks would run out of money this week. That prompted the Greek government to announce a bank holiday, which will last until after Sunday’s referendum, and to impose restrictions on moving money in and out of Greece, which could last a lot longer.","1427","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-the-united-states-prevent-a-grexit"
"On Tuesday, Greece will miss a loan payment of 1.6 billion euros to the I.M.F., thus placing the country in default and moving the crisis into another phase. Unless Greece’s other debtors trigger cross-default clauses in their loan contracts, which seems unlikely, the default shouldn’t have much immediate impact on other financial institutions, experts said on Monday. It looks like the current “time out” in Greece’s financial system will be extended until after Sunday’s referendum.","1428","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-the-united-states-prevent-a-grexit"
"Theoretically, that should aid the Obama Administration with its efforts to organize one more round of negotiations before the referendum, in the hope that talks will produce an agreement that the Greek government will endorse. But if there is to be a last-minute compromise, the Europeans will have to offer Tsipras something that will justify a u-turn. One option, which the U.S. government appears to be pursuing, is a promise of at least some debt relief. But that seems to be a distant possibility. At a press conference in Berlin on Monday, Merkel appeared alongside her Vice-Chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, who reiterated that Greece had to follow the same rules as everyone else in the eurozone. Debt relief would be considered only in a follow-up agreement, he indicated, and even then it would be limited to extending maturities and lowering interest rates—it would not entail outright cancellation. The Greek Prime Minister wanted a very different euro zone, which was a dangerous idea, Gabriel added.","1429","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-the-united-states-prevent-a-grexit"

"The only sensible answer to the first question is: “I don’t know.” As the late Paul Samuelson once observed, when a financial market starts falling sharply we move into the realm of the physics of landslides: things become complicated and unpredictable. In some cases, the market’s fall can feed on itself, as it did on Monday, October 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.6 per cent. A computer-trading strategy known as “portfolio insurance”—which was originally designed to limit investors’ losses—generated huge sell orders in the futures market, which led to further losses on the New York Stock Exchange, which led to more selling in the futures market. And so on.","1432","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-stock-markets-dive-is-global-and-rational"
"In other cases, the falling market reaches a resistance level, and buyers emerge to limit the losses. So far, this swoon, which began last week, looks to be of the benign type, with few signs of outright panic. On Friday, following sharp falls in overseas markets, the Dow fell more than five hundred points, or about 3.1 per cent. On Monday, it fell about a thousand points as soon as it opened, then regained about half of its losses and held on from there. It closed at 15,871.35, a fall of 3.6 per cent. In the course of the past week, it is down 9.5 per cent. That’s a big tumble, to be sure. But the market hasn’t seen a significant correction since 2011, and we were due for one.","1433","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-stock-markets-dive-is-global-and-rational"
"Obviously, things could get worse. Whether they do or not depends on whether, in the next few days, the turmoil in the Chinese market continues and signs of financial distress emerge here at home—for example a big hedge fund or financial institution getting into trouble. Bull markets, such as the one Wall Street has enjoyed for the past six years, generate a great deal of risk-taking, which often involves using some hidden type of leverage to enhance returns.

In a sharp post on Sunday, my colleague James Surowiecki pointed out that stock prices have been rising steadily in relation to earnings. For a quite a while now, analysts who take seriously such valuation ratios as the price-to-earnings ratio and Tobin’s “q” ratio (which measures the price of investment assets relative to their replacement cost) have been warning about a crack in the market. Back in February, Andrew Smithers, a London-based analyst, warned that the U.S. market was trading seventy per cent above its fair value. In May, Bob Shiller, a well-known economist who teaches at Yale, said that there was a “bubble element” to the valuations present in the market.","1435","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-stock-markets-dive-is-global-and-rational"

Sometimes, the precipitating event is the prospect or reality of the Federal Reserve deciding to raise interest rates. (That’s what happened in 1987 and 2000.) On other occasions, it takes some sort of shock, such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers, to set things off.","1436","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-stock-markets-dive-is-global-and-rational"
"On this occasion, there was a surfeit of proximate causes. For one thing, the era of zero-per-cent interest rates and ultra-cheap money appears to be coming to an end. With G.D.P. growth picking up a bit after another slow start to the year, Wall Street expects the Fed to start raising rates either next month or in December. Then there is what’s happening in the developing world. It’s not just that the Chinese economy is slowing down and prompting the government in Beijing to take countervailing measures, such as trying (and so far failing) to prevent a stock-market bubble from bursting. Brazil is in terrible shape and may be headed for a financial crisis. The Russian economy, hit by sanctions and a collapsing oil price, is also in a slump. Of the original BRIC countries, only India looks to be in good shape.","1437","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-stock-markets-dive-is-global-and-rational"
"Even in a country such as the United States, which has a relatively small trade sector compared to many other nations, a “hard landing” for the world economy would negatively impact G.D.P. growth. (Although the big fall in the oil price should offset this somewhat, by boosting consumers’ spending power.) And for U.S.-based multinational companies, which make up the bulk of the Dow and S&P 500, a sustained global slowdown could have a very large impact on revenues and profits. That alone probably justifies the trim applied to stock-market valuations in the past few days.","1438","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-stock-markets-dive-is-global-and-rational"

Second, there are people who are up to no good—dealers in drugs or other illicit goods, money launderers, or tax evaders, for the most part. There’s little controversy that people involved in unlawful activities should be prosecuted if they structure their transactions to avoid the filing of C.T.R.s. The twist in the Hastert case is that he appears to have removed large amounts of cash for a legal, if distasteful, purpose—to pay off a person upon whom, according to the indictment, he had inflicted some unspecified misconduct many years earlier. The indictment identifies the person only as Individual A; according to subsequent press reports, which cite unnamed officials, Individual A is a man and the allegation is that Hastert sexually abused him when he was a high-school student and Hastert was a teacher and wrestling coach. Hastert held that job, in Yorkville, Illinois, from 1965 to 1981, and so it seems likely that the statute of limitations has run out on any crime Hastert committed in his underlying relationship with Individual A. (Many details about the case are unclear at this point; Hastert has not yet responded.) According to the indictment, Hastert agreed to pay Individual A three and a half million dollars, and had already paid him about $1.7 million in installments. To make the payments, Hastert first took out fifty thousand dollars at a time and then, when his bank questioned him, began making many cash withdrawals, from multiple accounts, just under the ten-thousand-dollar mark. To put it another way, if Hastert had paid any or all of the $3.5 million to Individual A by check, instead of cash, there would be no crime.","1443","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-legal-logic-of-the-case-against-hastert"
"Why should Hastert be prosecuted just because he paid Individual A in cash? The answer lies in the proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Some people are genuinely unaware of the C.T.R. requirement, and their cases might be ripe for an exercise of leniency. But Hastert was not ignorant of the law, as he proved when he allegedly began structuring his withdrawals to get around the requirement. And while the payments to Individual A are probably legal, no prosecutor in the world is going to give the benefit of the doubt to someone who is making a payoff based on an apparent gross abuse of trust by a teacher against a student. It is exactly this kind of underlying fact that would—and should—motivate a prosecutor to proceed in a close case.","1444","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-legal-logic-of-the-case-against-hastert"
"And if there were any doubt about the prosecutor’s decision, Hastert’s alleged lies to the F.B.I. would certainly seal the case against him. When confronted with his structured transactions, he told F.B.I. agents two preposterous lies, according to the indictment. First, he said that he was withdrawing the money to keep for his own use, even though he was passing it to Individual A. And second, Hastert said that he removed the cash from the bank because he did not feel safe with the American banking system—which is just absurd, especially for a former Speaker of the House. When questioned, Hastert could have instead explained accurately what he was doing, or he could have declined to talk, or he could have summoned a lawyer. Instead, he did something that often guarantees a criminal charge: lying to agents’ faces.","1445","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-legal-logic-of-the-case-against-hastert"
"In short, the prosecution of Hastert shows that the fundamental purposes of the C.T.R. requirement are being served. Law-abiding individuals who work with large amounts of cash accommodate the requirement without any problems. Others who are using cash for suspicious, if not exactly illegal, purposes are legitimate targets for inquiry and, if they’ve deliberately tried to avoid the law’s requirements, for prosecution—especially if they then lie to the FBI about it. The precise contours of Hastert’s relationship with Individual A remain mysterious, but his legal ordeal is easily understood and, it seems, richly deserved.","1446","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-legal-logic-of-the-case-against-hastert"
"Sometime next month, the Supreme Court will decide King v. Burwell, and the conventional wisdom about the stakes in the case appears to have shifted. The case represents a challenge to the core of the Affordable Care Act. The plaintiffs charge that, based on a strict reading of single sentence (actually, four words), federal health-insurance subsidies should be available only in the sixteen states (and the District of Columbia) that set up their own health exchanges, or marketplaces. This means, they argue, that there should be no subsidies for people who now buy insurance on the federal exchange in the other thirty-four states. At the moment, about thirteen million people receive those subsidies.","May 21, 2015","1447","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"
"The people with the most riding on the outcome, of course, are those thirteen million. Without subsidies, it’s likely that most of them will no longer be able to afford their insurance. Until recently, the perception has also been that the Democrats had the largest political stake in the case. After all, the A.C.A. is the signature achievement of the Democratic President. Suddenly, though, and paradoxically, it has come to seem that Obamacare’s Republican opponents are most at risk if the decision goes their way. They have the most to lose by winning. As Jonathan Chait wrote recently, “The chaos their lawsuit would unleash might blow back in a way few Republicans had considered until recently, and now, on the eve of a possible triumph, they find themselves scrambling to contain the damage.” In this view, the peril is especially great for Republicans, because, as Jonathan Cohn recently pointed out, the G.O.P. has failed to propose any kind of plan to address the loss of insurance for so many millions of people.","1448","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"
"So that’s the theory: millions will suddenly be uninsured, and will blame Republicans. As Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, put it recently, “I don’t think they will [win the case]. If they do, that’s a problem that the Republicans have.”","1449","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"
"No, it’s not. If the Obama Administration loses in the Supreme Court, the political pain will fall almost exclusively on the President and his Party. To paraphrase Colin Powell and the Pottery Barn rule, President Obama will have broken health care, so he owns it. To the vast mass of Americans who follow politics casually or not at all, Obamacare and the American system of health care have become virtually synonymous. This may not be exactly right or fair, but it’s a reasonable perception on the part of most people. The scope of the Affordable Care Act is so vast, and its effects so pervasive, that there is scarcely a corner of health care, especially with regard to insurance, that is unaffected by it. So if millions lose insurance, they will hold it against Obamacare, and against Obama. Blaming the President in these circumstances may be unfair, but it’s the way American politics works.","1450","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"
"Republicans, of course, will encourage this sentiment. The precise legal claim in King v. Burwell is an esoteric one. It is not based on a claim that Obamacare is unconstitutional. (The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law three years ago.) Rather, the central assertion by the plaintiffs is that the Obama Administration violated the law itself. In any event, the subtlety of the issue at the heart of the case will surely be lost in its aftermath. The headlines will read, correctly, “Court rules against Obamacare,” and this will be all that matters. The Republicans will argue that the Supreme Court showed that the law was flawed from the start, that the Obama Administration is lawless, that a full repeal of the law is the only appropriate response to the Court’s decision—and that the millions who lose their subsides should blame the sponsor of the law. Watch for references to a “failed Presidency.” There’ll be plenty of them.","1451","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"
"Understandably, perhaps, the Administration has courted this kind of reaction. Better than anyone, Administration officials know the scale of the problems that would be created by a loss in the Supreme Court. Advertising this possibility makes sense as a litigation strategy; Obama officials don’t want to make it easy for the Supreme Court to rule against them. In testimony before Congress and elsewhere, Sylvia Burwell, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (and the defendant in the case), said that the Administration has no contingency plan for an adverse ruling in the Supreme Court. But playing chicken with the Justices only works if it works. If the Supreme Court strikes down the subsidies, the Administration will also have to answer for why it didn’t prepare for this possibility.","1452","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"
"For many people, the President of the United States is the government of the United States. It’s why he gets the credit and blame for so many things, like the economy, where his influence can be hard to discern. This is particularly true for a subject in which the President has invested so much of his personal and political capital. If the Supreme Court rules against him, the President can blame the Justices or the Republicans or anyone he likes, and he may even be correct.

"Chris Christie can yak; we all know that. At one point during the Bridgegate scandal, which derailed his Presidential hopes, he stood at the podium for what seemed like an entire morning answering questions, until, finally, the Trenton press corps ran out of things to ask. He didn’t say much, of course, except to repeat his denial that he knew anything about the Nixonian shenanigans his chief of staff and top political adviser had apparently been up to in Fort Lee, where his administration stood accused of reducing the number of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in order to punish the town’s mayor for opposing the governor’s reëlection. But at a moment when many politicians would have stayed out of view, Christie stood there and talked, and talked, and talked, his very presence indicating that, however bad things got, he intended to tough it out.","July 1, 2015","1454","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-planet-is-chris-christie-living-on"

Christie returned to the gymnasium of the high school he’d attended, in Livingston, New Jersey, and announced that despite everything—criminal charges in the Bridgegate scandal, a record low approval rating in his own state, and a near-universal consensus among pundits that he’s finished as a national figure—he is, indeed, running for President in 2016. Without a teleprompter or any notes, he spoke for about half an hour, casting himself as a working-class hero, a pragmatic problem solver, and, above all else, a teller of truths.","1455","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-planet-is-chris-christie-living-on"

When I stand up on a stage like this in front of all of you, there is one thing you will know for sure: I mean what I say and I say what I mean.

Rather than simply criticizing President Obama and the Democrats, he said that both parties had failed the country by turning compromise into a dirty word. “If Washington and Adams and Jefferson believed compromise was a dirty word, we’d still be under the crown of England,” he said. When he did get around to attacking the current Commander-in-Chief, he accused him of running a “weak and feckless” foreign policy, adding, “President Obama lives in his own world, not in our world.”","1457","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-planet-is-chris-christie-living-on"
"Of course, the same thing could be said of Christie; indeed, his otherworldliness might be his greatest strength.

"When he gets there, he will find that his poll numbers are somewhere between bad and disastrous. A year ago, opinion surveys indicated that he was leading the G.O.P. pack in the Granite State.

"And that’s the good news for Christie. On the national level, his position is even more fraught. It’s not just the fact that he’s running ninth in the G.O.P. field, or that fifty-five per cent of likely Republican voters questioned by pollsters for an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey said that they couldn’t even imagine voting for him, or that many of the wealthy Republicans who supported him in 2012 have moved on to other candidates.

But in a poll released last week by Fairleigh Dickinson University, Christie’s approval rating was just thirty per cent, roughly half what it was two years ago.

Another twenty-three per cent said that they like him but dislike his policies.","1461","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-planet-is-chris-christie-living-on"
"Obviously, the Bridgegate scandal played a big part in undermining Christie’s popularity. But he has also been plagued by economic problems, particularly in Atlantic City; questions about the use of Hurricane Sandy relief funds; and renewed problems with the state’s public-employee pension system, which he claimed to have fixed. “The bad news is that he is the governor in a state where a sizable majority give a thumbs down to his leadership,” Krista Jenkins, the Fairleigh Dickinson professor who directed the poll, said.","1462","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-planet-is-chris-christie-living-on"
"Even some of Christie’s admirers have pretty much written him off. “His moment was four years ago, when he was fresh, brash—there was just something about him,” Charles Krauthammer, the conservative commentator, said on Fox News. “He was the candidate everybody wanted, the anti-Mitt Romney. And he decided he wanted to wait, and now the buzz is gone and that excitement is gone. . . .

Ever confident of his own abilities, Christie will be looking for a strong showing in the televised debates, which start in August, and which will showcase his articulacy and his everyman persona.

"Few phrases are duller than “corporate restructuring.” So you can be forgiven if your eyes glazed over when, two weeks ago, Jeff Immelt, G.E.’s C.E.O., announced that the company was going to sell off most of G.E. Capital, its financial-services arm, and concentrate on the company’s industrial businesses (which range from aircraft engines and locomotives to medical devices and power generation). But this is a genuinely momentous move. Not only is G.E. reinventing itself; the move from financial services back to industry could herald the close of an entire chapter of American capitalism.","1465","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/back-to-basics-why-g-e-ditched-finance"
"In the public imagination, G.E. never stopped being an industrial company, but for the past three decades it’s also been, essentially, a huge bank. Its finance division got started during the Great Depression, as a way of helping consumers pay for washing machines and refrigerators. But Jack Welch, who took over in 1981, was obsessed with “growing fast in a slow-growth economy.” G.E.’s traditional businesses, like appliances and lighting, were no longer growing quickly, so Welch needed a new profit engine. Enter G.E. Capital. It became a key source of profits, growing almost twice as fast as the company as a whole and expanding into every conceivable market: consumer lending, credit cards, equipment leasing, commercial real estate, auto loans, leveraged buyouts, even subprime mortgages.","1466","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/back-to-basics-why-g-e-ditched-finance"
"G.E. Capital had a couple of advantages. Because it was not officially a bank, it faced less regulatory supervision. And, because G.E.’s industrial businesses still generated steady profits, the financial arm operated with a pristine triple-A credit rating. (Most big banks are a notch or two lower.) That meant that it could borrow money more cheaply than its competitors, which made its lending highly profitable. Indeed, the sharp ascent of G.E.’s share price during Welch’s tenure arguably owed as much to G.E. Capital as to Welch’s famous management style (Fortune called him “the most widely admired, studied, and imitated CEO of his time”). By 2000, financial services accounted for more than half of G.E.’s revenue. Even after Welch retired, in 2001, finance remained crucial. By the middle of the decade, it was responsible for about half of G.E.’s profits.","1467","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/back-to-basics-why-g-e-ditched-finance"
"But finance entailed problems that weren’t apparent until after Welch left. G.E. Capital sucked up more and more of the company’s resources. In the course of Welch’s tenure, G.E.’s in-house R. & D. spending fell as a percentage of sales by nearly half. Vijay Govindarajan, a management professor at Dartmouth who worked as chief innovation consultant to Immelt from 2008 to 2009, told me that “financial engineering became the big thing, and industrial engineering became secondary.” This was symptomatic of what was happening across corporate America: as Mark Muro, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, put it to me, “The distended shape of G.E. really reflected twenty-five years of financialization and a corporate model that hobbled companies’ ability to make investments in capital equipment and R. & D.”","1468","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/back-to-basics-why-g-e-ditched-finance"
"Finance is also inherently risky. Admirers claimed that cunning risk management enabled G.E. Capital to “eliminate—or at least reduce—all risks that do not carry a big potential payoff.” As if. When the financial crisis hit, G.E. Capital’s earnings plummeted, and the division’s dependence on borrowed money jeopardized the company as a whole. Keeping it afloat required the support of the Federal Reserve and an F.D.I.C. guarantee of more than fifty billion dollars in unsecured debt.","1469","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/back-to-basics-why-g-e-ditched-finance"
"Govindarajan told me that Immelt had wanted to move G.E. back to its industrial roots even before the crash, and, indeed, since 2001 G.E. has more than doubled its R. & D. spending. But dependence on finance was a hard habit to break in the bubble years, with G.E. Capital rolling in cash. The crisis made the decision easier. Shareholders are now wary of finance—G.E.’s stock rose more than ten per cent after Immelt’s announcement—and post-crisis legislation reined in G.E. Capital’s freewheeling ways. The business, which had lost its triple-A rating, was designated a “systemically important financial institution,” and that limits the amount of leverage it can use and subjects it to tougher regulations.","1470","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/back-to-basics-why-g-e-ditched-finance"
"Meanwhile, the outlook for industry is better than it’s been in a long time. American manufacturing was decimated during the first decade of this century, with six million jobs gone, and it was easy to believe that manufacturing was a lost cause. Yet it still accounts for more than two trillion dollars in output, and American factories are still among the most productive in the world. What’s more, energy costs here are falling, and labor costs abroad are rising. Suddenly, the U.S. seems like a reasonably affordable place to make high-end products, like G.E.’s jet engines and gas and wind turbines. There’s a growing market for such products, too. As developing countries get richer, they’re spending more on power, transportation infrastructure, and health care. The energy sector, even with the recent drop in oil prices, has a voracious appetite for exploration and drilling. These are all industries that G.E. specializes in.","1471","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/back-to-basics-why-g-e-ditched-finance"
"This kind of manufacturing, with its automated, high-tech factories, doesn’t create as many jobs as old-fashioned heavy industry, but the gains are still significant. In the past six years, G.E. has opened more than twenty new plants and added more than sixteen thousand new workers in the U.S. “We’re not talking about some nostalgic, morally attractive American folkway,” Muro said. “Advanced manufacturing is a major driver of innovative activity, exports, and economic growth. So it’s good to see a hallmark company refocussing on it.” After twenty-five years of the financial tail wagging the industrial dog, it’s time to try something new. ♦","1472","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/back-to-basics-why-g-e-ditched-finance"

Then there are Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, two front-runners who have all but announced that they are in.

"The number turns out to be too high for Roger Ailes, Hannity’s boss at Fox News. The network (along with Facebook) is set to host the first televised G.O.P. debate, in Cleveland, on August 6th, and it has said that it intends to limit participation to the top ten candidates in the polls, plus those who are tied. “It was a difficult call based on political necessity,” Howard Kurtz, the veteran media reporter, who now works for Fox, explained in a post on Tuesday. “With 17 or 18 Republicans gearing up to run, you simply can’t have a viable debate with all of them. Each candidate would receive a miniscule amount of time. No sustained questioning would be possible.

"Not everyone associated with the Republican Party is happy about Fox’s decision. Appearing on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Wednesday, Bill Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard, accused Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, of colluding with Fox to cull the field prematurely. “There are fourteen candidates who are serious people,” Kristol said (doubtless prompting a protest call from Trump). “I think they all deserve to be on the stage.” He proposed that they have two debates, with the candidates split up randomly. “Republicans would be interested. They wouldn’t turn off the TV halfway through.”","1477","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"Kristol raises a good point. If Fox applied its proposed criteria on the basis of current polling data collated by Real Clear Politics, Santorum, who won eleven state primaries in 2012, would barely make the cut. Fiorina, the only female candidate, who has reportedly impressed Republican audiences in Iowa and New Hampshire, would miss out. So would Graham, Jindal, and Kasich, all experienced elected officials. That doesn’t seem fair, or even particularly democratic.

"Here’s how it could work. Following Kristol’s suggestion, Fox and Facebook would hold two debates on August 6th, with the candidates drawing lots to decide whether they appeared on the first or the second one. Each would receive the same amount of airtime, and the questions in the two debates would be broadly similar.","1480","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"For the second debate, which CNN is scheduled to host from the Reagan Library, in Simi Valley, on September 16th, things would be different. A limit of twelve candidates would be imposed. Rather than follow the “Survivor” template literally, and have the candidates themselves decide who gets to appear at the debate and who doesn’t, it would be best to rely on surveys of likely Republican voters. The top dozen candidates in the poll of polls on September 9th, a week before the debate, would make the cut; everybody else would miss out. I’d leave it to the network executives and the R.N.C. to decide whether this debate would need to be split in two, like the first one. (CNN has suggested an alternative format for its event, using the full slate of candidates, in which the top ten candidates appear in one debate and the rest in another.)","1481","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"

Amid the calls last week to lower the Confederate battle flag at the state capitol, the defenders of the flag averred that it represents “heritage, not hate.” The great sleight of hand is the notion that these things were mutually exclusive.","1487","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/the-confederacys-final-retreat"
"Americans, both in the South and beyond, attach a particular brand of exceptionalism to the region. This is the reason that there is a Southern Historical Association but not a Northern one; a genre known as Southern literature but no Northern corollary; and a concept of Southern politics as something distinct from the national variety. The notion of the Confederate flag as a benign tribute to that exceptionalism rests upon another premise that illustrated, long before our present concerns with climate change and vaccination did, the political usefulness of denial: the idea that the Civil War was not fought over slavery—a claim that would have bewildered those who served in it—allowed Southerners to memorialize the leaders of an armed insurrection without the sticky moral baggage of bondage attached.","1488","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/the-confederacys-final-retreat"
"That interpretation held that the war was sparked by a conflict over tariffs that penalized Southern agriculture to the benefit of Northern industry. Or, more vaguely, that the war was fought over “states’ rights.” This evasion proved amazingly effective. Monuments to the valor of the Confederate ideal dot the South like matériel left on a battlefield. But none of these arguments bear scrutiny. Were the Southerners who erected those monuments concerned primarily about the valor of men, there would be many more dedicated to the former slaves who fought for the Union and risked death or, arguably worse, reënslavement. Were the war mainly about tariffs, we would be left to think that these fugitives fled farms and plantations to join the Union Army because of their abiding belief in trade protectionism. Or that the nearly forty thousand of them who died did so defending their views on Federalism. The Confederates themselves did not believe this. Here is the South Carolina convention in 1860, explaining the rationale for secession:","1489","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/the-confederacys-final-retreat"
"The South is exceptional not primarily because of its literature or its food or its politics but because, as historians have pointed out, it is the only region of the United States that has lived for the majority of its history with the experience of military defeat. Four decades after the U.S. withdrawal from Saigon, Vietnam remains a spectral presence in American foreign policy and military strategy. But when the Vietnam War began the South had already been familiar with that kind of recrimination and self-doubt for a hundred years. It not only fought tenaciously for the right to own human beings; it did so unsuccessfully. Neither of these facts can be easily accepted, but only one of them can be easily denied. So detached from slavery is the conception of the war that the controversial Memorial Day tradition of sending a Presidential wreath to the Confederate Memorial, in Arlington National Cemetery, which began with Woodrow Wilson, continued into the present. (President Obama amended the tradition by also sending a wreath to the African American Civil War Memorial, in Washington, D.C.)","1490","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/the-confederacys-final-retreat"
"Such denialism has governed an important portion of our national affairs and distorted our self-image, but it collapsed in the hail of fire in the sanctuary of Emanuel A.M.E. Church. As is often the case, tragedy was the burden we shouldered for a moment of square introspection. This is probably why the eulogy that Barack Obama delivered for the Reverend Clementa Pinckney on Friday was sober and self-reflective in a way that we seldom hear. “The flag,” the President said, “has always represented more than just ancestral pride. For many, black and white, that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation. We see that now. Removing the flag from this state’s capitol would not be an act of political correctness.” He added, in reference to the Confederate soldiers, that “it would simply be an acknowledgment that the cause for which they fought, the cause of slavery, was wrong.”","1491","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/the-confederacys-final-retreat"
"It may seem odd, decades after the civil-rights movement, to note that for a sitting President to say that the Confederacy fought for the institution of slavery—and that doing so was a moral wrong—is a radical statement. Yet it is, and shortly after making it the President fell silent. It appeared that perhaps he had lost his way, but then, in a remarkable moment, he began to sing “Amazing Grace,” a hymn that is at once a lament, a prayer, and a hope—written by John Newton, a onetime slave trader who became an abolitionist. Immediately after the speech, people began debating whether the song had been part of the prepared text or whether the President sang it out of an impromptu spiritual imperative. In either case, he was likely hoping to see in the national culture precisely the transformation that Newton had experienced in himself, one that facilitated his first truthful accounting of the evil of slavery. ♦","1492","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/the-confederacys-final-retreat"
"For more than fifty years, John E. Reid & Associates, Inc., has represented itself as providing the gold standard in interrogation training for police. The company’s technique, developed by Reid himself, a polygraph expert and former cop, in the late nineteen-forties, involves exerting psychological pressure to encourage confession. It is nonviolent and, according to the company, extremely effective. But, as I discussed in an article for the magazine in 2013, the past few decades have seen a growing number of psychologists and advocates question whether the technique isn’t coercive and prone to producing false confessions. Now a twenty-million-dollar wrongful-conviction settlement has provided fuel to Reid’s detractors.","May 22, 2015","1493","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/juan-rivera-and-the-dangers-of-coercive-interrogation"
"In 1993, Juan Rivera, a resident of Waukegan, Illinois, was sentenced to life in prison for the rape and murder, a year earlier, of an eleven-year-old girl named Holly Staker. For more than two months after Staker’s body was found, the police failed to produce a credible suspect. Following up on a tip from a jailhouse informant, they focussed on Rivera, a nineteen-year-old native of Puerto Rico with a history of psychological problems. No physical evidence linked him to the attack, and readings from an ankle monitor that Rivera was wearing at the time, while awaiting trial for a nonviolent burglary, showed that he had been nowhere near the scene of the crime. Nevertheless, in late October of 1992, he was brought to Lake County Jail, in Waukegan, and interrogated intermittently for four days. Twice during that time, Rivera was taken to Reid headquarters, in Chicago, where a Reid employee named Michael Masokas administered polygraph tests. The results were mixed, but Masokas told Rivera that the evidence demonstrated his guilt. Eventually, after more round-robin interrogation, he signed a confession.","1494","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/juan-rivera-and-the-dangers-of-coercive-interrogation"
"Rivera’s conviction was affirmed three times in the course of the next sixteen years: in 1998, by a jury; in 2001, by the Illinois Appellate Court; and in 2009, by another jury. The last trial was, in many ways, the most astonishing, because it came four years after new DNA evidence had exculpated Rivera. Nevertheless, he was found guilty again, based partly on the strength of his original confession. Rivera’s attorneys appealed, and he was released in 2012. Later that year, he filed a civil suit for false arrest and malicious prosecution, naming a handful of people and government entities as defendants, including the Lake County Major Crimes Task Force, which helped investigate his case.","1495","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/juan-rivera-and-the-dangers-of-coercive-interrogation"
"The settlement was announced in March, but only recently have some of the financial details been made public. The City of Waukegan, which has since withdrawn from the task force, will pay the highest amount—seven and a half million dollars. The State of Illinois and Lake County will each pay three and a half million dollars, with lesser amounts coming from other towns. John E. Reid & Associates will pay two million dollars, which appears to be the largest settlement in its history. Joseph Buckley, the company’s president, did not respond to my requests for comment. When I spoke with him in 2013, however, he distanced Reid from any cases of false confession, arguing that they were the result of improper implementation of the technique. Such distancing will be more difficult in this case, since several of the police officers testified that they were trained in interrogation by Reid, and since one of the company’s employees was apparently directly involved.","1496","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/juan-rivera-and-the-dangers-of-coercive-interrogation"
"In a report to Rivera’s attorneys, the psychologist Saul Kassin, who has studied false confessions for decades, called the interrogation “one of the worst, if not the worst, I have ever seen.” He told me that the settlement reinforces two important points: that the Reid technique can be coercive, and that lying to a suspect during a police interview can be enormously damaging. Steve Art, an attorney for Loevy & Loevy, the firm that represented Rivera, said he hopes that the settlement will serve as a deterrent—that police nationwide “will take a hard look at whether going to a couple of Reid classes is really what they need to know about interrogation, or whether there’s something more.”","1497","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/juan-rivera-and-the-dangers-of-coercive-interrogation"
"If you attended a Bernie Sanders rally this summer, when his seemingly quixotic Presidential campaign began gathering force, you might have noticed a few surprising things about the crowd. One was the scarcity of nonwhite faces—a problem that the campaign would soon be confronted by, very publicly. Another was how many young people were turning out to see an irascible seventy-four-year-old senator from Vermont. But that’s a little like being surprised that some millennials appreciate Neil Young or Joni Mitchell at a time when it’s easy to find songs from different decades in a promiscuous jumble online. Young people who like Bernie Sanders like him because he sounds like an old record. He’s been talking about the injustices done to working people by unequal income distribution for more than forty years. His voice, often hoarse from his habitually loud and impassioned speeches, even has the crackle of worn vinyl.","1498","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In Portland, Maine, on an evening in July, the line to see Sanders looped around the Cross Insurance Arena. Sanders’s popularity had clearly been exceeding his own expectations. In a conversation this summer, he recalled an event in Minneapolis: “I was blown away. We were driving in, we saw these lines of people snaking down the sidewalk. ‘Jesus, what is that? There’s a ballgame going on?’ ”","1499","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"At the Portland rally, I met a group of five friends who were drawn to Sanders because of his commitment to banish money from politics: he has sharply criticized the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision, in Citizens United, to permit unlimited campaign spending by corporations, and has lamented the outsize influence exerted by billionaires. Several of the friends praised Sanders’s pledge to raise the federal minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour. One member of the group, Erin Kiley, a millennial who owns Portland Flea-for-All, a marketplace of vintage and artisanal goods, said that she developed “a huge political crush on Bernie” in 2010, after Sanders delivered an eight-and-a-half-hour speech on the Senate floor to protest the extension of tax cuts instituted during the Presidency of George W. Bush. Sanders’s gruffness, didacticism, and indifference to appearances—both he and his wife, Jane, told me how much he loathes shopping—are central to his appeal. All the friends described Sanders as “authentic,” a word that many people would be hesitant to apply to Hillary Clinton. Kiley acknowledged that Sanders’s unvarnished qualities might turn off some voters, but noted that in the current election cycle “the whole spectrum of candidates is less schmoozy, polished, and warm.” She went on, “Everyone seems a little off the wall. Howard Dean was thrown off the national stage for being angry. But people like Trump because he’s an asshole and says whatever he wants.” Kiley’s friend Dawn York, who runs a vintage-clothing shop, said, “Most candidates are robotic and rehearsed.” She saw “a real person in Bernie.”","1500","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders has been known as a democratic socialist for decades. This didn’t matter much to Kiley or York, or to most other Sanders supporters I met during the next few weeks; mainly, they were impressed that he hadn’t shed the term. York thought that, because of Sanders and his “social-media-driven fans,” socialism was “getting a bit of a P.R. makeover.” She noted that sites like Reddit and Twitter were circulating videos of “Bernie explaining why he identifies as a socialist, and what it means to him, in a really positive light.” She added, “The word had a retro connection to Communism and was originally thrown at him as a damning label by his opponents. But for his supporters it isn’t a deterrent.”","1501","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"A 2011 Pew Research Center survey found that, among voters under the age of thirty, forty-nine per cent had a positive view of socialism. (Only forty-six per cent had a positive view of capitalism.) Peter Dreier, a professor of politics at Occidental College, who has written about Sanders, says that younger voters “may not be willing to entertain a whole new system, but they are open to a pretty profound critique of the current one. They’re not as naïve as Americans used to be during the Cold War—they know that there are varieties of capitalism, that there is social democracy in Scandinavia and Canada, where the government plays a bigger role in regulating corporations and in expanding the safety net.”","1502","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"At a recent San Francisco gathering for Sanders, I met Derek Zender, a twenty-three-year-old marketing student. He told me that his parents, who live in Orange County, dismissed Sanders as “a decrepit old socialist who means well but doesn’t understand how the world works.” Zender thought they were overlooking the fact that “many American institutions—Social Security, unions, Medicare, the postal service—have elements of socialism.”","1503","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In Portland, Sanders took the stage, a little hunched in a gray suit jacket. His flyaway white hair was largely subdued, but his face turned pink with exertion as he delivered an hour-long speech, during which he did not use a teleprompter and barely consulted a sheaf of loose yellow papers on the lectern. “America today is the wealthiest country in the history of the world,” he declared. “But most people don’t know that, most people don’t feel that, most people don’t see that—because almost all of the wealth rests in the hands of a tiny few.” Sanders signals his moral ferocity by choosing words like “horrific” and “abysmal” and sonically italicizing them, as in “This grotesque level of income and wealth inequality is immoral.” He was born in Brooklyn, and his unreconstructed borough growl reminds voters that he stands apart from the “oligarchy.” His hand gestures are as emphatic as a traffic cop’s. When he delivers speeches, he’ll often jab his finger at the lectern, as though he were enumerating the plagues at Passover.","1504","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Most of his policy proposals have to do with helping working people and reducing the influence of the wealthy. He would like to break up the big banks, create jobs by rebuilding infrastructure, and move toward public funding of elections—and provide free tuition at public universities. (This program would be subsidized, in part, by a tax on Wall Street speculation.) He wants to end the “international embarrassment of being the only major country on Earth which does not guarantee workers paid medical and family leave.” In the speeches I heard, Sanders rarely discussed foreign policy, though he spoke with conviction about climate change and the need for the U.S. to set an example for Russia, India, and China by using fewer fossil fuels. He tends to sound both doleful and optimistic, like a doctor who has a grave diagnosis to deliver—and no time for small talk—but is convinced that he can help his patient heal.","1505","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Huck Gutman, one of Sanders’s close friends, is an English professor at the University of Vermont; from 2008 to 2012, he served as Sanders’s chief of staff in the Senate. “It doesn’t matter what issue comes up—Bernie understands that the fundamental issue for Americans is economic,” Gutman said. “His record on abortion, on gay marriage, on a great number of things has been very good and very liberal, but he never sees those as the central issues. The central issue is: Are people doing O.K., or are a small number of people ripping them off?”","1506","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Despite this abiding interest, Sanders does not seem to have immersed himself that deeply in the extensive literature on inequality. When I spoke with him in his Senate office, I asked him how his ideas on economic fairness were formed. “No one can answer that,” he replied. “How were your ideas formed?” He did not particularly warm to discussing the theories of such economists as Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Piketty. (Gutman told me, “I read a third of Piketty’s book. I don’t think Bernie would read a page of it.” Sanders was interested less in academic arguments, Gutman said, than in hard numbers that “exemplify the disparities he sees and feels and hears about from people.”) Sanders dutifully mentioned that the economist Stephanie Kelton is an adviser to the Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, of which he is the ranking member, but he was ardent in his admiration for Pope Francis, who has condemned the “economy of exclusion.” Sanders called the Pope “an extraordinary figure,” adding, “My God, he came along right at the time we need him!”","1507","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"After speeches, Sanders spars about issues with voters or reporters. Garrison Nelson, a political scientist at the University of Vermont, who has known him for decades, says that if Sanders is walking down the street in Burlington “and somebody yells at him Bernie will talk to him—‘What’s the matter? Whadd’ya mean?’ ” He also understands the necessity of the selfie dance, maneuvering quickly into place and smiling briefly. Sanders does not excel, however, at the middle ground of casual, friendly conversation. He has no gift for anecdote. When talking to voters, Hillary Clinton has perfected the head-cocked semblance of keen interest; it’s clear when Sanders becomes bored. Nelson told me, “Bernie’s the last person you’d want to be stuck on a desert island with. Two weeks of lectures about health care, and you’d look for a shark and dive in.” Nelson has voted for him many times.","1508","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"

In 2012, she hosted a gathering of alternative-newspaper publishers, and tried to show them Vermont at its most distinctive. One evening, Jerry, of Ben & Jerry’s, scooped ice cream; on another, Senator Sanders stopped by a group dinner. As Routly recalls, “There were no niceties or glad-handing before he launched into a brief but impassioned rant, tailored specifically for our group. He told us we were doing a great job of covering the arts but a lousy one reporting on economic issues. Message delivered—he didn’t want to meet anyone or eat anything or answer any questions. He was out of there.” Everyone loved it. “He only talks to people in one register, but it’s a very effective one,” Routly said.","1509","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Though Sanders is steadfastly earnest, the youthful enthusiasm for him often partakes of irony. Whimsical buttons feature the slogan “Feel the Bern,” and Tumblr is full of memes that play up the contrast between Sanders’s age and his popularity with hipsters. It’s similar to the way that some admirers of Ruth Bader Ginsburg have taken to calling her the Notorious R.B.G. Both fandoms combine admiration for progressive conviction with a slightly condescending fondness for cranky senior citizens. Rich Yeselson, a contributing editor at the left-wing journal Dissent, told me, “The sort of detached, post-Jon Stewart generation—they’re the ones putting inverted commas around what Bernie stands for. ‘Look at this grumpy old Jewish socialist from Brooklyn!’ It’s not cynical, though—they really believe in what he’s saying.”","1510","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s message is particularly potent for young people who are struggling financially. Several weeks after the rally, I wrote to Dawn York, and she said that she had been thinking about “how refreshing it was to have someone point out to us that, as hardworking Americans, some things aren’t a privilege, they are a right. . . . I’m self-employed, I started my own business three and a half years ago, and my husband works full-time for Whole Foods—and we barely get by. We own a home, we both graduated from college, and we work more than forty hours a week, and we can barely put oil in our heating tanks in the winter. We have no savings and no way to financially handle any hiccups that may come our way. And I had to be reminded that it shouldn’t be that way.”","1511","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Garrison Nelson describes Sanders as being “more from the nineteen-thirties left than the sixties one.” In June, when NPR’s David Greene pressed Sanders on whether he embraced the phrase “Black Lives Matter,” the Senator got irritated. “It’s too easy for quote-unquote liberals to be saying, ‘Well, let’s use this phrase,’ ” he said. “We need a massive jobs program to put black kids to work and white kids to work and Hispanic kids to work. So my point is, is that it’s sometimes easy to worry about which phrase you’re going to use. It’s a lot harder to stand up to the billionaire class.”","1512","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders does not argue that greater economic equality would end racism, but for most of his career he has subsumed discussions of race under class. Van Jones, a criminal-justice reformer and a former Obama adviser, derides that approach as “trickle-down justice”—and told Salon in August that he had been “warning the white populists in the Party, behind the scenes, for several months, that their continued insistence on advancing a color-blind, race-neutral populism was going to blow up in their faces.”","1513","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"

"After taking the stage, Sanders told the moderator, “Whoa, let me talk about what I want to talk about for a moment!” A few minutes later, when protesters again interrupted the proceedings, he addressed them directly: “Black lives, of course, matter. I spent fifty years of my life fighting for civil rights and for dignity! But if you don’t want me to be here that’s O.K. I don’t want to outscream people.”","1515","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"A week later, in his Senate office, Sanders sounded chastened. “The issues these young people raised are enormously important,” he said. The video showing the arrest of Sandra Bland, the African-American woman who died in a Texas jail, had just been released, and Sanders seemed shaken. “It impacted my night’s sleep,” he said. “I don’t sleep that great, and it made it even worse.” He went on, “It’s hard to imagine if Sandra Bland was white she would have been thrown to the ground and assaulted and insulted.” Sanders, speaking more broadly about police violence directed at black people, said, “I plead guilty—I should have been more sensitive at the beginning of this campaign to talk about this issue.”","1516","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"

His tone was friendlier than usual, and he even made a joke: “I was the best and worst congressman Vermont had.” (Vermont has only one.) One of the convention’s listed sponsors was Koch Industries, and it was the first time I saw Sanders give a speech in which he did not inveigh against the company’s billionaire owners, who lavishly support conservative causes. He had folded in a quote from Martin Luther King, Jr., though, which worked well for him: “Now our struggle is for genuine equality, which means economic equality. For we know that it isn’t enough to integrate lunch counters. What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn’t earn enough money to buy a hamburger and a cup of coffee?”","1517","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In August, Sanders’s campaign issued a racial-justice platform that recommended police reform, federal funding for police body cameras, a ban on for-profit prisons, and the elimination of mandatory-minimum jail sentences. The platform also included a broad defense of voting rights. (Among other things, Sanders proposes making Election Day a federal holiday.) The document is divided into sections called “Physical Violence,” “Political Violence,” “Legal Violence,” and “Economic Violence,” strongly echoing the language and priorities of Black Lives Matter. At the same time, the platform reasserted Sanders’s core philosophy: “We must simultaneously address the structural and institutional racism which exists in this country, while at the same time we vigorously attack the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which is making the very rich much richer while everyone else—especially those in our minority communities—are becoming poorer.”","1518","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Van Jones said of Sanders, “He’s shown tremendous character in his willingness to engage and grow and change.” But Vermont is ninety-five per cent white, and Sanders needed to establish stronger bonds with black voters. No African-American leader, Jones observed, would be surprised to get a call from the Clintons. Sanders was “a reliable civil-rights vote, but not somebody who has been connected to these communities, to these kids and their neighborhoods. He’s not showing up to the funerals.”","1519","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"

Across a plaza, I saw a girl. She spoke little English, and my Spanish was a work in progress. But for me, it was love at first sight.” Hillary Clinton’s official online biography sounds like one of those books about great Americans aimed at young readers: her father’s drapery business and “rock-ribbed” Republicanism, her family’s Methodism, and her youthful turn as a Girl Scout all get their due. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator whose critiques of income inequality presaged Sanders’s Presidential campaign, often speaks of her parents’ economic hardship to help explain her values today.","1520","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"

"There’s something admirable about Sanders’s reluctance to attribute his political beliefs to autobiography: he doesn’t want voters thinking that his commitment to redistributive economics stems from anything other than a deep-seated sense of fairness. He has neither the conventional politician’s instinct for sharing relatable details nor the contemporary left’s reverence for personal testimony. Still, he’s running for President, and so he has reluctantly cracked open the door to his private life, even if his supporters are drawn to him, in part, because of that reluctance.","1522","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"

For people to elect a President, you’ve got to know that person—you’ve got to trust them.” He insisted that he was happy to talk about his life. But he couldn’t resist sermonizing first: “When I talk about a political revolution, what I’m talking about is how we create millions of decent-paying jobs, how we reduce youth unemployment, how we join the rest of the world, major countries, in having paid family and sick leave. I know those issues are not quite as important as my personal life.” And then, unnecessarily: “I’m being facetious.”","1523","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders did say that two aspects of his upbringing had exerted a lasting influence. One was coming from a family that never had much money. And the other was growing up Jewish—less for the religious content than for the sense it imbued in him that politics mattered. Sanders’s father was a Polish Jew who, at the age of seventeen, came to America shortly after his brother, and struggled through the Depression in Brooklyn. By the time Sanders was born, in 1941, his father was working as a paint salesman. Sanders had an older brother, Larry, and their mother stayed home, like most of the women in their lower-middle-class corner of Flatbush. He went to public schools, including James Madison High School, an incubator of civic talent, from which Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Senator Chuck Schumer also graduated. He didn’t make the school’s championship basketball team—a deep disappointment—but he ran cross-country, and feels that this activity accounts for some of his formidable stamina today.","1524","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"“There was tension about money,” Sanders said of his family. They lived in a three-and-a-half-room rent-controlled apartment, and his mother pined for a house. “It wasn’t a question of putting food on the table. It was a question of arguing about whether you buy this or whether you buy that. You know, families do this. I remember a great argument about drapes—whether we could afford them. And I remember going with my mother when we had to buy a jacket. We went to literally fifteen different stores to buy the damned cheapest—I mean, the best deal.” He went on, “I do know what it’s like when the electric company shuts off the electricity and the phone company shuts off the phone—all that stuff. So, for me, to talk to working-class people is not very hard.”","1525","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"I spoke with a few of Sanders’s contemporaries who had grown up in the same neighborhood, and their memories were rosier: they recalled kids playing stickball on safe, familiar streets until their parents called them home for dinner. But Sanders rarely communicates in the key of nostalgia. He’ll talk about how the “great American middle class” is being hollowed out, but unlike some populists he doesn’t dwell lovingly on the nineteen-fifties, when high-paying manufacturing jobs, union membership, and the G.I. Bill allowed single-earner families to prosper. That’s a political strength, because there are many people—African-Americans, above all—for whom the fifties cannot be recalled as an idyll.","1526","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sid Ganis, a Hollywood producer who grew up in the same building as Sanders, described their neighborhood as an enclave of “ordinary secular Jews,” adding, “Some of us went to Hebrew school, but mainly it was an identity in that it got us out of school on Jewish holidays.” Sanders told me that, in the aftermath of the Second World War, his family “got a call in the middle of the night about some relative of my father’s, who was in a displaced-persons camp in Europe someplace.” Sanders learned that many of his father’s other relatives had perished. Sanders’s parents had been fundamentally apolitical, but he took away a lesson: “An election in 1932 ended up killing fifty million people around the world.”","1527","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s close friend Richard Sugarman, an Orthodox Jew who teaches religious studies at the University of Vermont, said, “He’s not what you would call rule-observant.” But, Sugarman added, “if you talk about his Jewish identity, it’s strong. It’s certainly more ethnic and cultural than religious—except for his devotion to the ethical part of public life in Judaism, the moral part. He does have a prophetic sensibility.” Sugarman and Sanders were housemates for a while in the seventies, and Sugarman says that his friend would often greet him in the morning by saying, “We’re not crazy, you know,” referring to the anger they felt about social injustices. Sugarman would respond, “Could you say good morning first?”","1528","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders attended Brooklyn College for a year, then transferred to the University of Chicago, where he joined the Young People’s Socialist League and the Congress on Racial Equality. He also took part in protests for the desegregation of the Chicago public schools and of university-owned housing. Jim Rader, a friend who first met him in Chicago, recalls that Sanders was a “leader of the civil-rights movement on campus.” Sanders, who received a political-science degree in 1964, has said that he was a mediocre student because he found the classroom boring and irrelevant—and that he learned “infinitely more on the streets and in the community.”","1529","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"By the time Sanders graduated, both his parents had died, and his brother had moved to England. (Larry Sanders, who became a social worker and a Green Party councillor, lives in Oxford.) Jane Sanders told me that it had taken her a long time to realize quite how “alone in the world” her future husband had been during his late teens and early twenties. He did a stint on a kibbutz in Israel, worked as an aide at a psychiatric hospital, taught in a Head Start program, and had a carpentry business with a few other guys in New York. It was called Creative Carpentry, and Rader says that it was accurately named: “They advertised in the Village Voice, but didn’t know much about carpentry. They’d go to the hardware store to buy supplies, and ask the clerk how to do the repairs they’d been hired to do.”","1530","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders got married for the first time, to a woman named Deborah Shiling, just after college, and they took a road trip from New York to Vermont, where Sanders had never been. The couple ended up buying eighty-five acres of wooded land near Montpelier, for twenty-five hundred dollars. They had preceded the waves of back-to-the-land hippies. Sanders told me, convincingly, “I wasn’t a hippie.” He’d been enchanted by the thought of living in lush, green Vermont ever since he and his brother had collected some travel brochures touting the state’s farms.","1531","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders and Shiling soon divorced. (She eventually became a wine and cheese buyer for a Vermont food co-op.) In 1969, he had a son, Levi, with Susan Campbell Mott, a girlfriend. In July, Politico reported that Levi was not the product of his first marriage, as many people had assumed, in an article titled “Bernie Sanders Has a Secret.” It came as a surprise to reporters who’d covered Sanders for years in Vermont, but it wasn’t the sort of revelation likely to scandalize his supporters in 2015.","1532","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders wore his social conscience on his sleeve, but few people who knew him in the sixties and seventies would have predicted that he would become a leading candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination. In those days, he occupied himself by writing freelance articles—critiques of the stultifying effects of office work or the social-control mechanism of television—and by making very low-budget educational filmstrips. It’s safe to say that had Sanders stuck with that career he would not have given Ken Burns a run for his money. One filmstrip, a portrait of Sanders’s hero, the socialist Eugene V. Debs, was rendered with static images that remained on the screen for a good long while. Sanders himself voiced Debs, an Indiana native, making him sound like a guy from Flatbush. A narrator chided viewers that if they were like the average American “who watches television forty hours a week” they would know “such important people as Kojak and Wonder Woman” and “have heard about dozens of different kinds of underarm spray deodorants” but would likely never have heard of Debs. (Another cultural foray of Sanders’s that makes you glad he stuck with politics: a 1987 cassette tape in which he talk-sings folk songs, William Shatner style. Imagine “This Land Is Your Land” recited, in stentorian tones, over reggae-style guitar.)","1533","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"People who knew Sanders when he was in his thirties tend to share stories about how broke and frugal he was. Rader told me that when Sanders first bought land in Vermont, and was still living part time in New York, he sometimes camped out in the new property’s only shelter: a maple-sugar shack. He had devised his own equivalent of Sterno, which his friends dubbed Berno. “It was a roll of toilet paper soaked in lighter fluid inside a coffee can,” Rader said. “He’d cook over that.”","1534","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In 1971, Rader invited Sanders to a meeting of Vermont’s left-wing Liberty Union Party, in Plainfield. Sanders brought his son along, and there’s a photograph of them at the meeting: Sanders is skinny, serious, with a luxuriant head of curls, uninhibited sideburns, and Buddy Holly glasses; his towheaded toddler sits in his lap. The organizers asked if anyone would run for the Senate, and Sanders, one of the willing few, got the nod. It was the beginning of his political career, though he shared the fate of most Liberty Union candidates: he lost by an enormous margin. During the next ten years, he ran twice for senator and twice for governor, and never got more than six per cent of the vote. Nevertheless, he discovered that he had an appetite for campaigning—and a keen desire to hold elected office. “The difference between Bernie and most of the lefties is Bernie wants to win,” Garrison Nelson said. “Most lefties don’t want to win, because if you win you sell out your purity.”","1535","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In 1980, Sanders’s friend Richard Sugarman suggested that he try for mayor of Burlington. Locals were disenchanted with the five-term incumbent, a Democrat named Gordon Paquette. Sanders ran as an Independent, and won by ten votes. Even in Vermont, it was unusual to elect a socialist in the time of Ronald Reagan; Sanders was a thirty-nine-year-old man who didn’t own a suit. As Paula Routly told me, “Monied interests were shaking in their boots at first.”","1536","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Yet Sanders turned out to be a popular and effective mayor, and more pragmatic than some might have predicted. True, he travelled to Nicaragua, where he met with Daniel Ortega and found a sister city for Burlington. (Vermont reporters dubbed the mayor and his coalition the Sandernistas.) But he also presided over economic development that transformed the city into a hipper, more forward-looking place—one of those small cities that appear on lists of the most livable. And he did so without the kind of wrenching gentrification that he abhorred. His administration devised creative solutions for preserving affordable housing, including a community land trust that enabled low-income residents to buy homes. It became a model for other cities. Sanders also resisted a developer’s plan to turn the derelict Lake Champlain waterfront into a cluster of high-rises, promising instead public access and open space. Today, the waterfront has a park, a bike trail, a science center, a community boathouse, and limited commercial development. He created a youth office, an arts council, and a women’s commission, and during his tenure minor-league baseball came to Burlington. Business leaders learned, Nelson said, “not to fear him.” Jim Condon, a Vermont state legislator and a former reporter who used to cover Mayor Sanders, wrote of him recently, “He got a lot done, but not through the art of gentle persuasion. Bernie’s style was top-down and confrontational.” Still, he was reëlected three times.","1537","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders met Jane O’Meara Driscoll, a community organizer nine years his junior and a divorced mother of three young children, when she invited him to a debate during his first mayoral campaign. After he was elected, he named her the director of a new office dedicated to improving the lives of kids and teen-agers in Burlington. They were married in 1988, and spent what even Sanders admits was “a strange honeymoon,” in the Soviet Union, finalizing a sister-city relationship with the city of Yaroslavl. Jane has worked closely with him ever since, on a volunteer basis—she was his chief of staff for a year in the House, and has handled his press relations at various times. Along the way, she had served as the provost of Goddard College, in Plainfield, where she had earned a bachelor’s degree in social work, and, later, the president of Burlington College. All four children in the Sanders family are now grown. Levi Sanders works as a paralegal at Boston Legal Services; Heather directs the Sedona Yoga Festival with her husband; Carina started a woodworking school, and has served as a state legislator in Vermont; Dave is a senior executive at a quintessential Vermont company, Burton Snowboards.","1538","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Jane typically accompanies her husband on the Presidential campaign trail. She smiles more easily than he does, and looks approachable in her slacks and patterned tunic tops. In August, we met in Burlington, and though Jane was nursing a campaign-trail cough, she was animated about her husband: “I feel more, every day, that he can win. My kids find it really frustrating that they always say in the media, ‘But, of course, he can’t win.’” She went on, “I just tell them, ‘They have said he can’t do this until we prove we can. They’re gonna say he can’t until we can. And that’s what’s always happened with Bernie.’” She mentioned a Quinnipiac University poll showing that, in a general-election contest against Donald Trump, Sanders would win by eight percentage points. (The same poll indicated that Vice-President Joe Biden, who is considering entering the race, would win by twelve points.) “Bernie can defeat Republicans—he’s done it here,” Jane said. “And he’s had them join him on certain things. He’s a democratic socialist, but he’ll work with Republicans to get things done.”","1539","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"When Sanders first ran for the House of Representatives, in 1988, he lost to a Republican named Peter Smith, the scion of a banking family. During Smith’s first term, he co-sponsored an assault-rifle ban. In 1990, Sanders ran again, and the N.R.A. went after Smith, sending letters to its Vermont members describing Sanders as the lesser of two evils, since he wasn’t publicly supporting the ban. Sanders won. This is the origin of the critique that Sanders has weak gun-control credentials for a progressive. Vermont is a gun-friendly state: twenty-eight per cent of its residents own firearms, according to a recent survey, and it has some of the nation’s most permissive gun laws.","1540","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In national office, Sanders has not been a vocal proponent of strict gun control. In 1993, he voted against the Brady Bill, objecting to its imposition of a five-day waiting period to buy a handgun. And in 2009 he voted to allow guns in national parks and on Amtrak trains. Over the years, he has also voted for some restrictions, including a semi-automatic-assault-weapons ban and instant criminal-background checks. The N.R.A. has given him grades ranging from C- to F. (It’s a tough grader.) But he has never been out front on the issue, partly because it doesn’t seem to engage him deeply, and partly because he wants to retain the loyalty of voters in northeast Vermont, where hunting is popular. Sanders tends to present guns as an urban problem that Vermonters can afford not to worry about, though mass shootings can happen anywhere and suicides by gun are as much a problem in Vermont as they are in other states. He told me, “I’m proud of my state, and I think I’m in a good position to try to bridge the gap between urban America—where guns mean one thing, where guns mean guns in the hands of kids who are shooting each other or shooting at police officers—and rural America, where significant majorities of people are gun owners, and ninety-nine per cent of them are lawful.”","1541","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s congressional career did not get off to a promising start. As an Independent, he had a hard time landing committee assignments. Garrison Nelson recalls, “Bernie shows up in Washington in 1991, there’s still a chunk of Southerners in the Democratic caucus, and they do not want Bernie in the caucus.” Sanders didn’t help matters by giving more than one interview denouncing Congress. “This place is not working,” he told the Associated Press. “It is failing. Change is not going to take place until many hundreds of these people are thrown out of their offices.” He went on, “Congress does not have the courage to stand up to the powerful interests. I have the freedom to speak my mind.”","1542","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Some of his colleagues returned the favor. Joe Moakley, a Massachusetts Democrat who was the chairman of the influential House Rules Committee, told the A.P. reporter, “He screams and hollers, but he is all alone.” Another Democrat from the Massachusetts delegation, Barney Frank, was even more blunt. “Bernie alienates his natural allies,” he said. “His holier-than-thou attitude—saying, in a very loud voice, he is smarter than everyone else and purer than everyone else—really undercuts his effectiveness.”","1543","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Nelson told me that, when he ran into Sanders in Burlington, he warned him not to keep “pissing in the soup,” adding, “You’re our only representative!” According to Nelson, Sanders said, “Gary, you have no idea how totally corrupt it is.” Nelson responded, “Bernie, I’m a historian of Congress. Give me a year, I’ll give you a scandal.”","1544","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In time, Sanders became slightly more discriminating in his criticism, and made some allies. He was one of the founding members and the first chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which has grown steadily over the years, from six members in 1991 to seventy-one today. The C.P.C. produces an annual progressive budget as an alternative to the one that actually passes; it tends to operate mainly as a conscience of the left. He worked hard with Democrats to keep jobs in his state and campaigned to strengthen federal regulation of milk prices, because it helped Vermont dairy farmers. (He once wrote that he’d developed “an almost emotional attachment” to these farmers, despite not knowing “one end of a cow from the other” when he arrived in the state.) In national matters such as curbing the excesses of the Patriot Act, Sanders found that he could at least try to make incremental changes through the amendment process; in 2005, a Rolling Stone profile dubbed him “the amendment king.”","1545","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"At home, Sanders became a symbol of Vermont’s cussed uniqueness, as affectionately regarded as a scoop of Chunky Monkey. He was reëlected to the House seven times. And his ascent to the Senate, in 2006, was stunning: he trounced the Republican candidate, Richard Tarrant, one of the wealthiest men in the state, by thirty-three percentage points. But when Sanders has run for the Vermont governorship he hasn’t done well. Jim Condon, the state legislator and former reporter, notes, “That’s telling. People here like him making a lot of noise in Washington for a little state—they’re happy to send a human hand grenade down there.” But they don’t necessarily want Sanders running the state.","1546","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Since joining the Senate, Sanders has received the most attention for his gestures of defiance—such as his marathon oration against tax cuts for the wealthiest, which was published in book form as “The Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class.” Still, he has been a very active legislator. An analysis by the nonpartisan Web site GovTrack shows him tied for sixth place among senators who introduced the most bills in the 2013-14 session of Congress, and in tenth place for the number of bills that made it out of committee. The site also noted that he tends to gather co-sponsors for his bills only among Democrats.","1547","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Yet Sanders has proved himself capable of bipartisan dealmaking. In the 2013-14 session, he was the chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and though he did not serve in the military—and typically opposes military interventions—he has been a strong advocate for veterans. Last year, he worked with an unlikely ally, the Arizona Republican John McCain, to hammer out a compromise to reform the ailing V.A. health system. The bill provided five billion dollars in additional funding to hire and train new medical staff, made it easier to dismiss V.A. officials for incompetence, and allowed veterans to go outside the system if the wait for a doctor was too long. Sanders explained to reporters that it was far from the bill he would have devised on his own: “It opens up a fear of privatization, which I strongly, strongly am opposed to.” But he sounded pleased with his ball-passing skills: “When you become chairman, you can’t just say, ‘This is the way I want it.’ ”","1548","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"McCain, in turn, expressed respect for his unlikely partner, telling the Huffington Post, “Negotiating with Bernie was not a usual experience, because he is very passionate and he and I are both very strong-willed people, and we spend a lot of time banging our fists on the table and having the occasional four-letter word. But at the end of the day Bernie was result-oriented.”","1549","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders is proud of a few other Senate deals. He successfully made an amendment to the Affordable Care Act which allotted eleven billion dollars for community-health centers to provide primary care regardless of patients’ ability to pay. And, he said, he had done “everything I could do to stop the Republicans—and, sadly, the President and a few Democrats—from cutting Social Security, through the chained C.P.I.” The chained C.P.I., a different way of calculating the annual cost-of-living increases in Social Security, would likely have lowered the increases for most people, and Obama proposed adopting it in his 2014 budget. Sanders helped lead the opposition, and the President recently stopped pushing for the proposal. “It was a tough fight,” Sanders said. “But now, as a result of a lot of grassroots activism, the debate is about expanding Social Security rather than about cutting it.”","1550","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Could Bernie Sanders win the Democratic nomination, let alone the Presidency? It is unlikely, for one of the reasons that he’s running for President: money dominates the electoral system. By October 1st, Clinton had raised more than a hundred million dollars, much of it from Super pacs and big donors. Sanders, who refuses to take money from Super PACs, had raised forty-one million dollars, mostly in donations of less than two hundred dollars each. These totals leave him at a major disadvantage. Still, his haul is impressive, and in the most recent fund-raising cycle donations to his campaign were neck and neck with Clinton’s: between July and October, he raised twenty-six million dollars to her twenty-eight million.","1551","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"It’s impressive, too, that in a recent YouGov/CBS News poll Sanders is leading Clinton by twenty-two percentage points in New Hampshire and ten in Iowa. But the picture in South Carolina is quite different: there Clinton is twenty-three points ahead. That comparison highlights a key distinction between white and nonwhite Democrats. The New Hampshire and Iowa Democratic samples included too few nonwhite voters to break out. But among black Democrats in South Carolina Clinton leads, at fifty-two per cent; Sanders is at four per cent. Nationally, the comparable figures are fifty-seven per cent to ten per cent. And though Sanders quickly modified his platform to accommodate Black Lives Matter activists, he still has a long way to go to win over African-American voters. Latino voters are similarly unfamiliar with him: a Gallup poll released in late August showed that only twenty-five per cent knew of him, and those who did were almost evenly divided between favorable and unfavorable impressions. A Washington Post/ABC News poll released in September shows that, if Biden were in the race, he would attract more nonwhite voters than Sanders (though substantially fewer than Clinton).","1552","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Nor is Sanders’s trajectory likely to mirror that of Obama in 2008. Sanders supporters like to point out that, in the summer of 2007, Obama was polling behind Hillary Clinton among black Democrats. But, as Michael Tesler, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine, recently noted in the Washington Post, Obama enjoyed much higher favorability ratings among black Democrats than Sanders does now.","1553","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s commitment to recapturing some of the white working-class males that the Democratic Party lost in the Reagan years won’t necessarily help his candidacy; indeed, it could hurt his quest to connect with minority voters. As he’s found, emphasizing class over race can get a progressive in trouble. Although he’s committed to immigration reform and creating a path to citizenship, he sees an ulterior motive in some approaches to the former. “There is a reason why Wall Street and all of corporate America likes immigration reform,” he said at an event held by the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in July. “It is not, in my view, that they are staying up nights worrying about undocumented workers in this country. What I think they are interested in is seeing a process by which we can bring low-wage labor of all levels into this country, to depress wages in America.”","1554","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Angelica Salas, an immigration-rights organizer in Los Angeles, whose group was represented onstage at a Sanders rally there in August, told me that she finds the immigration platform of one of his rivals—Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland—to be more “detailed, robust, and impressive.” Latino voters, she said, had been disappointed in Obama’s immigration policy and were looking for candidates who were committed to reform: “For a long time, it was almost like having an affair with the Democratic Party—they say they love you, but they don’t want to be seen with you in public.”","1555","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Yet Sanders is doing well enough to concern the Clinton team, and that creates its own challenges. Garrison Nelson said of Clinton, “She’s not worried about Bernie. But she is worried about the Bernie effect—which is to demonstrate her relative weaknesses as a candidate. He hits at her Achilles’ heel, which is authenticity.”","1556","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"On the trail, Clinton has avoided mention of him; Sanders, for his part, emphasizes their policy differences. He voted against the war in Iraq; she voted for it. He has opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership; she has voiced support for those pacts. But he has rebuked reporters for pressing him to say more about Clinton herself. In a video made backstage at a rally in Iowa, he complained, “Time after time, I’m being asked to criticize Hillary Clinton. That’s the sport that you guys like. . . . I’ve known Hillary Clinton for twenty-five years. I like her. I respect her. I disagree with her on a number of issues. No great secret.”","1557","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders appears to be sticking with that approach. But the Clinton campaign may be testing out a more aggressive strategy. Correct the Record, a Super PAC backing Clinton, recently sent an e-mail to the Huffington Post suggesting that Sanders shared many views with the controversial new British Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, then noting that Corbyn had called the death of Osama bin Laden a tragedy. Correct the Record has also sent trackers—operatives who tape rival candidates, looking for gaffes—to Sanders events.","1558","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders has promised not to run for President as an Independent in the general election, saying that he doesn’t want to have any role in handing victory to a Republican. But, even if he fails to secure the Democratic nomination, he has exposed a deep indignation about the distribution of wealth which other candidates cannot ignore. Sanders often says that he is not that far outside the mainstream—that a majority of Americans agree with him on many of his tenets. According to a recent CBS News/New York Times poll, sixty-six per cent of Americans feel that “money and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed”; seventy-one per cent favor raising the minimum wage, at least slightly; and seventy-four per cent believe that corporations exert too much influence on American politics and life. Other recent surveys show that strong majorities oppose any cuts in Social Security and support workers’ rights to unionize. A Gallup poll in May concluded that nearly half of Americans are “strong redistributionists, in the sense that they believe the distribution of wealth and income is not fair, and endorse heavy taxes on the rich as a way of redistributing wealth.”","1559","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"It’s hard to see, though, how these sentiments could be translated into policy in the U.S. Many, if not most, voters would likely resist paying more taxes to make such sweeping reforms possible. The American electorate seems to respond simultaneously to calls for redistributive justice and the rejection of the entity most likely to accomplish it: the federal government. And many voters might feel that matters of economic fairness are trumped by such social issues as abortion and guns.","1560","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In mid-September, Sanders spoke before the weekly convocation attended by the student body at Liberty University, the evangelical school in Lynchburg, Virginia, founded by the Reverend Jerry Falwell. Unlike many liberal élites, Sanders does not seem to prefer talking to people who share his views; because he is not an especially convivial person, he does not require conviviality from others. Sanders relishes the opportunity to enter enemy territory, where he believes that he can find secret allies.","1561","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"At Liberty, he began by acknowledging that his positions on women’s reproductive rights and gay marriage are strongly at odds with the views of many evangelical Christians. He did not make knowing jokes about these differences: as usual, Sanders was dead serious. The students were poker-faced but polite. He sought common ground by adding new valences to one or two of his standard arguments. When he called for federally mandated, paid family leave to bring America in line with the rest of the world, he dwelled a little on the preciousness of the bond between mother and baby. He was rewarded with applause. But the occasion also played to the prophetic side of Sanders—the register in which he can sound like an Old Testament preacher. Unlike his slicker rivals, Sanders is most at ease talking about the moral and ethical dimensions of politics. “We are living in a nation and in a world—the Bible speaks to this issue—in a nation and in a world which worships not love of brothers and sisters, not love of the poor and the sick, but worships the acquisition of money and great wealth.” His voice broke—all those stump speeches had been leaving deep scratches on the record. But his outrage was unmuffled. Staring at the crowd, he quoted the Hebrew Bible, his fist punctuating nearly every word: “Let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream.” ♦","1562","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"From the beginning of Saturday night’s Democratic debate, Senator Bernie Sanders was very clear on what he wanted to talk about. He began with two sentences about the terrorist attacks in Paris, expressing his horror and disgust, then he moved onto his main message: “I’m running for President, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people. And what I hear is people’s concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.”","November 15, 2015","1563","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"It was an awkward transition, and not one most politicians would have made. Rather they would have devoted, as Hillary Clinton and Martin O’Malley did, their entire opening statements to the attacks, seeking to come across as empathetic, resolute, and ready to take over as Commander-in-Chief. But Sanders isn’t like most politicians, and he sometimes doesn’t abide by the often stultifying conventions of modern Presidential elections.","1564","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"Congenitally averse to political theatrics, he reportedly didn’t practice much before the first debate, and it showed. This time, according to a Times article published on Friday, he agreed to do some real prep work, taking part in serious and lengthy rehearsals, with a staff member playing the role of Hillary Clinton. Perhaps as a result, he looked sharper. His answers were more direct and, unlike in the first debate, he didn’t make any off-the-cuff remarks that risked diverting attention from his message that America’s economic and political systems are broken. In a debate that was inevitably somewhat overshadowed by the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, what he was saying came through loud and clear.","1565","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"The first question put to him on domestic issues was about taxation and how far he would go in raising the top rate of income tax on well-to-do Americans. “In the last thirty years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth,” Sanders said. “And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous. The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction. Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one per cent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own.”","1566","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"It was a timely history lesson, but it didn’t answer the question. Nancy Cordes, CBS News’s congressional correspondent, pressed Sanders, saying, “Let’s get specific. How high would you go?” Sanders paused for a moment and replied, “We haven’t come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was ninety per cent.” Laughter and applause rang out around the arena. “I’m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” Sanders went on.","1567","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"Perhaps the seventy-four-year-old Larry David look-alike from Vermont had prepared this answer; perhaps he hadn’t. In any case, it was a brilliant response, and it also had the virtue of being true, or almost true. (Actually, the top rate under Eisenhower was ninety-two per cent, even higher than Sanders said.) In addition to serving up a timely reminder of what the tax system looked like during a period now widely regarded as a golden one for America’s economy, Sanders threw into sharp relief Clinton’s tax proposals, which would eliminate tax breaks and loopholes for people earning more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year, but wouldn’t raise the top rate.","1568","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"The next topic of discussion was health care. Clinton said she wanted to “build on and improve the Affordable Care Act,” a position she described as “a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders.” Sanders, who supports a single-payer system modelled along Canadian or European lines, agreed that the A.C.A. was a step forward, saying, “We have made some good progress.” Then he added, “I believe we’ve got to go further. I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.” Under the private-insurance system, he went on, “We end up spending—and I think the secretary knows this—far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health-care outcomes are not necessarily that good.”","1569","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"This was another strong answer, which combined an appeal to fairness and egalitarianism with a practical point. Defending his proposal to raise the federal minimum wage from seven dollars and twenty-five cents an hour to fifteen dollars, Sanders repeated the trick. Making the moral case for a living wage, he said, “It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works forty hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.” Then, seeking to counter the claim that setting a much higher minimum wage could cost a lot of jobs, he pivoted to a macroeconomic argument that harks back to Henry Ford. “When we put money into the hands of working people, they’re going to go out and buy goods, they’re going to buy services, and they’re going to create jobs in doing that,” he said. “That is the kind of economy I believe in. Put money in the hands of working people. Raise the minimum wage to fifteen bucks an hour.”","1570","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"All across the country, Sanders supporters, and many others, I suspect, were surely saying, “Go Bernie!” Even O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who also had a pretty good night, seemed impressed. Backing up Sanders’s point about tax rates, he pointed out that the top rate at the start of the Reagan Administration was seventy per cent. And seizing on Sanders’s argument about introducing a living wage, he referred to Maryland under his governorship. “We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it,” he said.","1571","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"As the debate moved on to Wall Street regulation, Sanders sought to exploit what has always been one of Clinton’s biggest vulnerabilities: her ties to the financial industry. Asked by the moderator, John Dickerson, why he had described some of the donations to Clinton’s campaign as compromising, Sanders said: “Let’s not be naive about it. … Why, over her political career, has Wall Street been a major—the major—campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? You know, maybe they’re dumb and they don’t know what they’re going to get, but I don’t think so.”","1572","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"After Sanders repeated the insinuation in response to a follow-up question, Clinton made a slip: she cited her work rebuilding Ground Zero as a senator from New York, appearing to invoke the 9/11 attack on Lower Manhattan as a justification for accepting campaign donations from Wall Street. Or, at least, that was how a viewer who sent in a tweet (and Reince Preibus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee) interpreted her statement.","1573","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"Sanders isn’t really cut out for the role of attack dog, though. Later on, when Cordes read out the accusatory tweet and Clinton sought to defend herself, Sanders rallied to her side, saying, “She worked—and many of us supported you—in trying to rebuild that devastation.” Unlike in the first debate, however, when Sanders came to Clinton’s aid on the issue of her State Department e-mails, he did, on this occasion, combine his friendly gesture with a statement distancing himself from her on policy. “But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power,” he said. “Their business model is greed and fraud. And for the sake of our economy … the major banks must be broken up.”","1574","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"Just how effective was Sanders? We’ll have to wait a few days to see whether his performance makes much difference in the opinion polls, which show him trailing Clinton by more than twenty points. What can’t be disputed, regardless of how the horse race evolves, is that he is now making the case for progressive policies in a manner that the United States hasn’t seen in decades. Rather than apologizing for liberal economic policies or seeking to make them more palatable to moderates and independents, he trumpets them at every opportunity.","1575","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"One of Sanders’s strengths is that he represents a movement and not just a political campaign. As I’ve noted before, his campaign is giving voice to a populist insurgency that emerged from decades of wage stagnation and rising inequality, and that was given form by the 2008–09 financial crisis and the Great Recession. In many ways, this movement represents a more coherent, left-wing counterpart to the Tea Party, but there is also something reassuringly old-fashioned about Sanders himself. In responding to Republican efforts to denigrate him as a European-style socialist, or even as a Communist, he stresses the American roots of his platform—correctly pointing out how many of his proposals have roots in the Progressive Era, the New Deal, and the period of postwar prosperity. He did this when he brought up Eisenhower, and he did it again when he was talking about the big banks. “If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he’d say?” Sanders said. “ ‘Break them up. Re-establish Glass-Steagall.’ And Teddy Roosevelt is right.”","1576","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"Can Sanders defy the skeptics and go further? The betting and prediction markets are saying probably not. On Sunday morning, the online British bookmakers were showing Clinton as the one-to-ten favorite to get the nomination (to win a dollar, you have to bet ten), with Sanders a five-to-one or six-to-one outsider. PredictWise, an online site that combines data from the bookies and the opinion polls, estimates the probability of a Clinton victory at ninety-one per cent.","1577","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"The Iowa caucus is more than two months away, and these numbers might change. Clinton has stumbled before; she could stumble again. But even if she doesn’t, Sanders’s contribution shouldn’t be underestimated. “In order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution,” he said in his closing statement. “Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process, and tell the big-money interests that we are taking back our country. Please go to berniesanders.com. Please become part of the political revolution.”","1578","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"When Sanders uses words like “revolution,” he isn’t talking about deposing a dictator or storming Congress. He is talking growing a mass, democratic movement that can reverse the direction that the American polity has taken over the past few decades. From the days of Chartism and Progressivism to the civil-rights era, such movements have rarely triumphed in national elections. But when the history books came to be written, that turned out not to matter so much. The movements changed the terms of the political debate. Sanders, in his own irascible way, is trying to do the same thing.","1579","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"You can think of the three minor candidates who were onstage at last night’s Democratic Presidential debate as ghosts, who, in addition to whatever other qualities doomed them to insignificance, represent vanished political types. Lincoln Chafee, as he noted, was the liberal Republican, a once influential, though maybe not numerous, group that was long ago expelled from its original party but has not been fully accepted by its new one. Jim Webb was the Reagan Democrat—the military-culture white Southerner who leans conservative on social issues. Martin O’Malley was the urban Catholic white-ethnic liberal, representing what’s left of the old political machines that produced the Kennedys. None of these groups could be written off in late-twentieth-century presidential politics; now, evidently, they can.","October 14, 2015","1580","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, was the undead: a representative of an ideology, socialism, that was buried with the Eugene Debs campaign of 1912, but now, unaccountably, has been resurrected, with “middle class” replacing “workingmen” in the rhetoric. Yes, Hillary Clinton won the debate, and yes, she will be the Democratic nominee, but the big surprise of the Democratic campaign so far has been voters’ response to Sanders. A year ago, nobody would have predicted that of the other Democratic presidential candidates, Sanders would be the one who mattered.","1581","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"There seems to be more going on here than Sanders’s ability to take advantage of the atypicality of Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two voting states in the campaign for the nomination. More than the other candidates, he has a simple, clear, strong message, which he repeats constantly. The packaging—Brooklyn accent, bad hair—reinforces the sense of angry authenticity. And it’s worth noting that he’s obviously uncomfortable when forced outside the tight box of economic populism. That’s why he has trouble talking about Black Lives Matter and gun control. (Margaret Talbot wrote about Sanders’s campaign for the magazine last week.)","1582","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"One aspect of Clinton’s adept performance last night was that at every opportunity, she tried to change the subject from her Democratic opponents to the Republicans. She knows they’re her real opponents, and a far more significant obstacle to her becoming President. So, on the evidence of the debate, how do her prospects look? Merely being prepared, assured, and on-message doesn’t guarantee victory. You also have to connect.","1583","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"The big, obvious gap between the two parties at this moment is on non-economic issues. In the Republican debates, it has been interesting to see how difficult a time the more moderate candidates have had creating any general-election breathing room for themselves on issues like abortion, gun control, marriage equality, and immigration. Conversely, it was interesting to see last night how completely comfortable Clinton has become with what not long ago were dangerously liberal positions, even for a Democrat, on these issues. This year Clinton and her party are obviously betting that social issues will break strongly their way. If they turn out to be wrong, that will be an unpleasant surprise for Clinton.","1584","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"The strong feelings that Sanders has tapped into present a greater challenge for Clinton. For one thing, the voters this year, in both parties, are in an anti-Establishment mood—that explains not just Sanders’s popularity, but also Donald Trump’s and Ben Carson’s. Clinton is part of the Establishment, and there’s no way around it. She was also the least anti-Wall Street candidate on the stage last night. It was almost surreal to see Anderson Cooper, the moderator, have to define Glass-Steagall—a Depression-era piece of financial regulation that Bill Clinton effectively repealed when he was President—because the candidates were so eager to talk about it that they forgot the first rule of debate training, which is never to get technical. Clinton noted that as a senator, she represented Wall Street, and her attempts to distance herself from it were obviously well rehearsed, but not even in Sanders’s range, emotionally.","1585","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"In the Times last week, Thomas Edsall wrote a counterintuitive column arguing that the Democrats have become, if not the party of the rich, the party that has the loyalty of most rich people. Clinton would never sign on to that sentiment, but Sanders’s challenge has forced her into speaking supportively about “capitalism” and “business”—not traditionally Democratic terms—onstage. And on the Republican side, though almost everyone’s rhetoric is anti-government, we have not heard defenses of Wall Street in response to the Democrats’ attacks. The Democrats don’t automatically own economic populism in this election.","1586","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"There is no chance that the Republican nominee, whoever it is, will talk like Bernie Sanders. But it’s almost certain that he will argue that, more than Clinton, he understands the behind-the-eight-ball feeling that pervades the American middle class, and propose to do a better job of fixing it than she would. Such an argument won’t necessarily come across as hollow just because it’s coming from a Republican. Bernie Sanders is getting at something powerful, which matters to a lot more people than socialists. Clinton’s biggest challenge is finding her way to a more powerful, and perhaps less prepared, way of persuading the disempowered middle class that she can be its champion.","1587","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"Now we finally know what Bernie Sanders means by “democratic socialism.” Speaking on his political philosophy at Georgetown yesterday, the Vermont senator and Democratic Presidential candidate opened with a long invocation of Franklin Roosevelt and the social protections that the New Deal created: minimum wages, retirement benefits, banking regulation, the forty-hour workweek. Roosevelt’s opponents attacked all these good things as “socialism,” Sanders reminded his listeners.","November 20, 2015","1588","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"Curiously, Sanders seemed to agree with them, taking his definition of “socialism” from its nineteen-thirties opponents, the people Roosevelt called “economic royalists.” “Let me define for you, simply and straightforwardly, what democratic socialism means to me,” Sanders said. “It builds on what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all Americans.”","1589","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"This isn’t the first time Sanders has defined his position from the right flank of history. Pressed in the most recent Democratic debate to say how high he would take the marginal income tax, Sanders answered that it would be less than the ninety (actually ninety-two) per-cent level under the Eisenhower Administration. He added, to cheers and laughter, “I’m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.”","1590","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"But, of course, both Roosevelt and Eisenhower distinguished themselves vigorously from “socialism,” which they understood to be a revolutionary program of extreme equality, committed to centralized control of the economy, and a cat’s paw of Soviet power. Accusations of “socialism” trailed liberals for decades after Roosevelt parried his opponents, from Ronald Reagan’s attacks on Medicare to the Republicans’ refrain against Obamacare. Democrats, like Roosevelt, have furiously defended themselves against the charges. But now a candidate whose ideal American economy does in fact look a lot like Eisenhower’s—strong unions, secure employment, affordable college—is waving the red flag, and finding favor with large numbers of Democratic voters.","1591","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"The new eagerness to embrace the word reflects the climate that a Pew poll captured, in 2011, when more respondents between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine reported a positive view of “socialism” (forty-nine per cent) than “capitalism” (forty-six per cent). (Gallup polls regularly find that a slim majority of Democrats express a positive view of socialism, but an overwhelming majority supports “free enterprise,” suggesting, charitably, some ideological flexibility.) Those under-thirty respondents are, of course, the first voters of the post-Soviet era, whose formative experiences are of a not very heroic unipolar world of American power and market-oriented ideas. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet empire put the word “socialism” up for grabs again: it may have landed in the dustbin of history at first, but that left it free for scavenging and repurposing.","1592","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"A decade before the Wall fell, the United States saw the quieter but also momentous collapse of the pro-government consensus that dominated the middle of the twentieth century. The Eisenhower paradox—that he was a big-government, welfarist conservative—is no paradox at all: he led the center-right at a time when the center was deeply welfarist and big-government. American politics after the Second World War was founded on the core idea of the earlier Progressive movement, which both F.D.R. and his cousin Theodore championed: the old ideals of personal liberty, economic opportunity, and civic equality could not survive in a laissez-faire industrial economy. Values once associated with small government now needed big government—the regulatory state—to preserve them. So, in 1937, F.D.R. urged that government should “solve for the individual the ever-rising problems of a complex civilization,” and, in 1965, L.B.J. echoed him, warning that “change and growth seem to tower beyond the control and even the judgment of men.” Strong government was the answer: a counter-power to wealth and to economic crisis. Their world was also Dwight Eisenhower’s.","1593","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"Ronald Reagan’s declaration, in his 1981 inaugural address, that “government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem” announced a new era. Government did not in fact shrink, thanks largely to military spending and retirement benefits, but the willingness to say that it could provide what F.D.R. had called “a permanently safe order of things,” let alone F.D.R.’s economic “Second Bill of Rights,” was almost forgotten. The market was the new all-purpose solution, even before the Soviet collapse and the subsequent elevation of disruption, innovation, and self-branding as the language of emancipation.","1594","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"So, between roughly 1979 and 1989, two figures went into the wilderness: the long-dominant American idea that strong government was necessary to humanize a market economy, and the word “socialism” as a name for a different kind of society. Exiled as opponents, they returned as friends. Bernie Sanders’s socialism is Eisenhower’s and F.D.R.’s world if Reagan had never happened: economic security updated by the continuing revolutions in gender, cultural pluralism, and the struggle for racial justice. In a word, Denmark; but also America with a counterfactual history of the last forty years.","1595","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"The mid-century political settlement between government and markets that Eisenhower took for granted never really had a name. It was not a fighting faith. “Welfare capitalism,” which is a pretty accurate name for a market system that redistributes for common benefit, sounds like the worst of both worlds. “Socialism” is historically inaccurate, and using it to name Eisenhower-era welfarism may come at the cost of further burying its other, more radical meanings. But some of the term’s appeal, as a name for Sanders’s program, is that it sounds more radical than it is. The radical label accentuates the feeling that something has gone wrong in economic life. It marks the intensity of dissent.","1596","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"In this way, Sanders’s use of the word harkens back to pre-Soviet, even pre-Marxist socialism. Then the term named a clutch of objections to industrial capitalism: the physical toll of the jobs, the equal and opposite toll of unemployment and economic crisis, widespread poverty and insecurity in a world where some lived in almost miraculous luxury. Assessing the socialists of the nineteenth century, whose programs ranged from the nationalization of industry to the creation of village coöperatives, John Stuart Mill doubted that they understood how markets worked, but he admitted their moral claims unreservedly: “The restraints of Communism would be freedom in comparison with the present condition of the majority of the human race.”","1597","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"Mill predicted that capitalism would burn out its fuel of cupidity and become a realistic version of what socialists (and communists) wanted. Worker-owned co-ops would out-compete traditional enterprises by aligning workers’ motives with the company’s success. At the same time, with poverty overcome, people would care less about getting richer, and spend their time in what Mill felt made life worthwhile in the first place: conversation, friendship, appreciation of poetry and painting. His optimism came from faith that, once people had less to fear from material want and from one another, they would find new ways to coöperate without the narrowness and cruelty of old hierarchies. He applied exactly the same premises to the relations between men and women, insisting that absolute legal equality would spur new discoveries about how to live and who to be—new creativity in gender identity (not his term but certainly his thought) and new experiments in how equals could care for one another. This humanistic faith in gender equality was one of the most accurate social prophecies in modern thought, but the same faith in egalitarian coöperation was a nonstarter in economic life.","1598","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"Mill was hardly alone in expecting capitalism to work out its kinks. Eisenhower’s world lacked a name for its settlement between government and markets partly because that settlement was the new normal, and the normal doesn’t need a name. Mature capitalism was supposed to produce only a moderate level of inequality. A strong government, staffed by public-minded experts, would iron out economic wrinkles. The remaining problems for reformers were remedial: bringing in previously excluded populations, especially African-Americans and isolated Appalachians. For those already on the inside, the challenges were those of what the liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith called “the affluent society”: how to want less, enjoy life more, and help build a post-materialist paradise of humanism. It is no coincidence that L.B.J., who supported the civil-rights movement and launched the War on Poverty, also promoted the National Endowment for the Humanities to enrich the lives of those whose historical labors were over. He described his Great Society program as seeking an economy that satisfied “the desire for beauty and the hunger for community,” where “the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.”","1599","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"That is the lost world to which Sanders’s “socialism” points back. The return of the label, though, doesn’t mean that anyone knows how to get more radical than tacking toward Scandinavian social democracy, with its socialized health care and higher education and generous family leave. Sanders isn’t much of a socialist compared to F.D.R., either. At the heart of Roosevelt’s program was the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which greatly strengthened the hand of unions, essential parts of every welfare-capitalist order in the twentieth century, from Scandinavia to Canada. Sanders, astonishingly, didn’t once mention unions in his Georgetown speech. Roosevelt proposed a maximum income of twenty-five thousand dollars (the equivalent of about four hundred thousand dollars today), which we won’t be hearing from Sanders. Sanders’s socialism is a national living wage, free higher education, increased taxes on the wealthy, campaign-finance reform, and strong environmental and racial-justice policies.","1600","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"This is not a program for a different kind of economy, based on coöperation and deepened democracy— what socialism used to stand for, which powered it as both a threat and a hope. The heart of Sanders’s program, like F.D.R.’s, is economic security: like F.D.R., he argues that “true freedom does not occur” without it. In the same way, he sees a strong government as protecting individualism from an economy that bats people around like the gods in Greek dramas. Calling this once mainstream idea socialism is a way of saying how far it feels from where we find ourselves now, how radical a step it would be to get back to it.","1601","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"

"“I chalk it up to pressure,” the political strategist Harland Dorrinson said. “Sanders has never been on such a big stage before, and in the heat of the moment he cracked and behaved with nobility.”","1619","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/in-serious-gaffe-sanders-treats-opponent-with-dignity-and-respect"
"“It was one of those moments where everyone in politics was like, ‘What was he thinking?’ ” Dorrinson added.","1620","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/in-serious-gaffe-sanders-treats-opponent-with-dignity-and-respect"

"In the media coverage of Tuesday’s Democratic debate, there was almost universal agreement that Hillary Clinton came out on top. In online polls, several focus groups, and much of social media, though, the story was rather different. Many people insisted that Bernie Sanders was the victor, and that the lame “M.S.M.” had gotten it wrong again.","October 15, 2015","1623","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"I experienced this difference of opinion firsthand. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, I pronounced Clinton the big winner, saying that she had been “sharp, personable, and assured.” I also said that Sanders “gave a good account of himself,” but that didn’t satisfy some readers. Within hours, the complaints were raining in—on Twitter, on Facebook, and elsewhere. Had I been coöpted by the Clinton campaign? Was I watching the same debate as everybody else? Did I have a clue what I was writing about?","1624","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"For the record, my answers are no, yes, and I hope so.","1625","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"It’s certainly possible that I, and many other commentators, got it wrong. The media has erred before, plenty of times. Back in April, when Sanders announced his candidacy, many observers wrote him off as a fringe candidate who wouldn’t have much of an impact. I didn’t make that particular error: indeed, I welcomed Sanders to the race, pointing out that he would “provide a voice to those Democrats who agree with him that the U.S. political system has been bought, lock, stock, and barrel.” That one I got right. But on the Republican side, after Donald Trump jumped in, I underestimated his staying power, as did many other members of the media. Did we get the Democratic debate wrong, too?","1626","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"Let’s look, briefly, at the case for the prosecution. At AlterNet, the alternative-news site, Adam Johnson pointed out, “Sanders won the CNN focus group, the Fusion focus group, and the Fox News focus group; in the latter, he even converted several Hillary supporters. He won the Slate online poll, CNN/Time online poll, 9News Colorado, The Street online poll, Fox5 poll, the conservative Drudge online poll and the liberal Daily Kos online poll. There wasn’t, to this writer’s knowledge, a poll he didn’t win by at least an 18-point margin.”","1627","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"At the other end of the ideological spectrum, Dick Morris, the Republican political strategist and Clinton antagonist, suggested that the media no longer understands a Democratic electorate that has moved to the left and is now highly issues-oriented. “Sanders identified and successfully focused on his two main issues: First, income inequality and the need to break up the big banks and second, the need for more restraint in committing military forces abroad,” Morris wrote on his Web site. “These two positions, clearly articulated in the debate will impel Sanders to a steep rise in the polls.”","1628","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The ultimate arbiter of who won the debate will, of course, be the public, not the pundits. But we won’t get a reliable reading of public opinion until we see some scientifically conducted surveys based on random samples of Democratic voters. The post-debate online polls weren’t of this type: their samples were self-selecting, and you would expect their results to be skewed toward the candidate with the most-committed supporters. In this race, without a doubt, that is Sanders.","1629","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The only post-debate poll I’ve seen that employed orthodox surveying techniques was carried out by the research firm Gravis Marketing, and it showed Clinton as the clear victor. Researchers for Gravis asked a random sample of seven hundred and sixty registered Democrats across the United States this question: “Who do you think won the debate?” Sixty-two per cent of respondents said Clinton, thirty per cent said Sanders, and six per cent said Martin O’Malley. It’s just one poll and its results aren’t definitive, but if most Democratic voters, in fact, believe that Sanders won, it is an enormous outlier.","1630","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The findings of the media focus groups deserve to be taken more seriously than the online polls, but here, too, representativeness is an issue. For the first G.O.P. debate, Frank Luntz, who runs focus groups for Fox News, organized a panel of Republican voters, which said that Donald Trump had performed poorly. Subsequently, Trump’s lead in the polls increased (and he excoriated Luntz on Twitter). Still, the fact that all three of the focus groups mentioned in Johnson’s article identified Sanders as the winner shouldn’t be dismissed; nor should the participants’ responses. When Luntz asked some members of his group, which consisted of Democratic voters from Florida, for a one- or two-word description of Sanders’s performance, these were some of the responses he received: “for the people,” “strong,” “straightforward,” “confident,” “direct,” “sincere,” “powerful,” “educator,” and “smart.”","1631","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"As I noted in my post-debate post, Sanders certainly “got his message through.” As Morris pointed out, it’s a message that resonates with many Democratic voters and is forcing other candidates, Clinton very much included, to adapt to it. It may also be true that Sanders benefitted from the fact that many viewers were seeing him for the first time on the national stage, and that the media underestimated this factor. “Beforehand, a third of Democrats said they didn’t yet know enough about Sanders to have an opinion on him,” Andrew Prokop pointed out in a post at Vox. “Even many of those who did know about him likely hadn’t been exposed to him all that much. So when Sanders makes the case at length for why he’s a democratic socialist, many of these voters might not have heard that before—and might like it.”","1632","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"But just because Sanders did well doesn’t mean he did best of all. In judging the winner of any debate, it’s probably wise to consider at least three questions. Who did the best onstage? Who came out on top in the polls? Who gave his or her campaign the biggest boost?","1633","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The second question I’ve already covered. The answer to the first one is subjective, though anybody who was on a high-school or college debate team knows that it’s not entirely so. Based on Clinton’s manner, her ability to react to what others were saying, and her deftness in evading awkward questions, I think she delivered the best performance, even though, as I wrote yesterday, I strongly disagreed with some of her answers, particularly those relating to Edward Snowden. Some of Clinton’s Republican critics agreed with my assessment of her manner. Trump said that she “did what she had to do.” Scott Walker, who dropped out of the race last month, said, “She came across as surprisingly very confident and I thought relatively pleasant.”","1634","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"So much for technique. The main reason that I think Clinton emerged as the winner relates to the third question: she gave her campaign a huge and much-needed boost. Of all the debate participants, she had the most to lose. After six months in which Clinton struggled to deal with the issue of her use of a private e-mail server while she was secretary of state, Democratic élites and donors were starting to question her abilities as a candidate. A poor performance on Tuesday could well have engendered outright panic. Clinton not only reassured the elected politicians, interest groups, and donors who have thrown in with her; she dealt a big blow to the “draft Biden” movement, which probably, in hindsight, needed its man to be onstage in Las Vegas.","1635","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The Clinton campaign believes that it can ultimately deal with a buoyant Sanders, even one who raises more money after the debate or gains a few more points in the polls. A panicking Democratic establishment and a swift entry into the race by Joe Biden would have presented a much more alarming scenario—one that now appears to be receding as a possibility. The Vice-President may still decide to run, but it will be harder for him to portray himself as a savior for the Party.","1636","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"

"Thomas E. Watson, the populist from Georgia who had a long and increasingly demagogic career in American politics, wrote in 1910:","1638","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"The objects of Watson’s bile were the Italians, Poles, Jews, and other European immigrants then pouring into the United States. A century later, in the populist summer of 2015, some of their great-grandchildren have been cheering Donald Trump as he denounces the latest generation of immigrants, in remarkably similar terms.","1639","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"American populism has a complicated history, and Watson embodied its paradoxes. He ended his career, as a U.S. senator, whipping up white-Protestant enmity against blacks, Catholics, and Jews; but at the outset, as a leader of the People’s Party in the eighteen-nineties, he urged poor whites and blacks to join together and upend an economic order dominated by “the money power.” Watson wound up as Trump, but he started out closer to Bernie Sanders, and his hostility to the one per cent of the Gilded Age would do Sanders proud. Some of Watson’s early ideas—rural free delivery of mail, for example—eventually came to fruition.","1640","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"That’s the volatile nature of populism: it can ignite reform or reaction, idealism or scapegoating. It flourishes in periods like Watson’s, and like our own, when large numbers of citizens who see themselves as the backbone of America (“producers” then, “the middle class” now) feel that the game is rigged against them. They aren’t the wretched of the earth—Sanders attracts educated urbanites, Trump small-town businessmen. They’re people with a sense of violated ownership, holding a vision of an earlier, better America that has come under threat.","1641","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"Populism is a stance and a rhetoric more than an ideology or a set of positions. It speaks of a battle of good against evil, demanding simple answers to difficult problems. (Trump: “Trade? We’re gonna fix it. Health care? We’re gonna fix it.”) It’s suspicious of the normal bargaining and compromise that constitute democratic governance. (On the stump, Sanders seldom touts his bipartisan successes as chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee.) Populism can have a conspiratorial and apocalyptic bent—the belief that the country, or at least its decent majority, is facing imminent ruin at the hands of a particular group of malefactors (Mexicans, billionaires, Jews, politicians).","1642","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"Above all, populism seeks and thrills to the authentic voice of the people. Followers of both Sanders and Trump prize their man’s willingness to articulate what ordinary people feel but politicians fear to say. “I might not agree with Bernie on everything, but I believe he has values, and he’s going to stick to those and he will not lie to us,” a supporter named Liam Dewey told ABC News. The fact that Sanders has a tendency to drone on like a speaker at the Socialist Scholars Conference circa 1986—one who happens to have an audience of twenty-seven thousand—only enhances his bona fides. He’s the improbable beneficiary of a deeply disenchanted public. As for Trump, his rhetoric is so crude and from-the-hip that his fans are continually reassured about its authenticity.","1643","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"Responding to the same political moment, the phenomena of Trump and Sanders bear a superficial resemblance. Both men have no history of party loyalty, which only enhances their street cred—their authority comes from a direct bond with their supporters, free of institutional interference. They both rail against foreign-trade deals, decry the unofficial jobless rate, and express disdain for the political class and the dirty money it raises to stay in office. Last week, Trump even denounced the carried-interest tax loophole for investment managers (a favorite target of the left). “These hedge-fund guys are getting away with murder,” he told CBS News. “These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.”","1644","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"But the difference between Sanders and Trump is large, and more fundamental than the difference between their personal styles or their places on the political spectrum. Sanders, who has spent most of his career as an outsider on the inside, believes ardently in politics. He views the political arena as a battle of opposing classes (even more than Elizabeth Warren, he really does seem to hate the rich), but believes that their conflicts can be managed through elections and legislation. What Sanders calls a political revolution is closer to a campaign of far-reaching but plausible reforms. He proposes a financial-transactions tax and the breakup of the biggest banks; he doesn’t demand the nationalization of banking. His views might appall Wall Street, but they exist within the realm of rational persuasion.","1645","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"Trump (whatever he really believes) is playing the game of anti-politics. From George Wallace to Ross Perot, anti-politics has been a constant in recent American history; candidates as diverse as Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama have won the Presidency by seeming to reject or rise above the unlovely business of politics and government. Trump takes it to a demagogic extreme. There’s no dirtier word in the lexicon of his stump speech than “politician.” He incites his audiences’ contempt for the very notion of solving problems through political means. China, the Islamic State, immigrants, unemployment, Wall Street: just let him handle it—he’ll build the wall, deport the eleven million, rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment, create the jobs, kill the terrorists. He offers no idea beyond himself, the leader who can reverse the country’s decline by sheer force of personality. Speaking in Mobile, Alabama, recently, he paused to wonder whether representative government was even necessary. After ticking off his leads in various polls, Trump asked the crowd of thirty thousand, “Why do we need an election? We don’t need an election.” When Trump narrows his eyes and juts out his lip, he’s a showman pretending to be a strongman.","1646","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"There aren’t many examples of the populist strongman in American history (Huey Long comes to mind). Our attachment to democracy, if not to its institutions and professionals, has been too firm for that. There are more examples of populists who, while failing to win national election, extend the parameters of discourse and ultimately bring about important reforms (think of Robert M. La Follette, Sr.). Though populists seldom get elected President, they can—like the young Tom Watson and the old—cleanse or foul the political air. ♦","1647","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"

"Last week was a good one for Hillary Clinton. It started with her appearance on “Saturday Night Live.” Kate McKinnon did her customary Clinton impression, this time sitting in a bar, trying to forget about Donald Trump. Clinton played Val the bartender, who seemed to embody how the former Secretary of State would like to be seen: as a hardworking, wryly funny older friend, whose earned wisdom you can turn to at the end of a long day. They sang “Lean On Me,” and, after Clinton left, McKinnon pronounced, “She was real and smart and really nice in person!”","1650","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Two days later, the “Today” show found Clinton flipping pancakes for voters in New Hampshire. When she was asked yet again about her e-mail accounts, she dismissed the question and cited the extraordinarily impolitic boast made a few days earlier by the House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, who had told Fox’s Sean Hannity, “Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today?” The Republicans were embarrassed, and Clinton benefitted. Last Thursday, McCarthy was forced to drop out of the race to succeed John Boehner as Speaker of the House.","1651","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Clinton is still scheduled to testify before the Benghazi committee a week after the first Democratic Presidential debate, which will be sponsored by CNN and held on October 13th, in Las Vegas. The Benghazi hearings would seem to have little credibility left, but both events will mark a new stage of the campaign for Clinton, one in which she will have to relinquish the tight control she has maintained over her appearances. At the debate, she will be joined onstage by Bernie Sanders, who has launched a strong challenge and is now favored by twenty-five per cent of likely Democratic voters, to her forty-two per cent, and by Martin O’Malley, Lincoln Chafee, and Jim Webb, all of whom are polling in the one-per-cent range. Vice-President Biden, because he is polling at around eighteen per cent, is eligible to take part, even if he declares at the last minute.","1652","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Biden’s role has been a big open question. Another is why this first debate is so late in coming. The Republicans have already had two, each of which attracted more than twenty million television viewers, and will stage ten more. The Democratic National Committee has authorized only six. One is the Saturday night before Christmas; another is the Sunday night before Martin Luther King, Jr., Day—not times likely to attract large audiences. Given the concerns about the Presidency being passed between a couple of families, why set up a schedule that seems designed to squelch lesser-known candidates’ chances?","1653","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"The lesser-knowns have objected, but Clinton doesn’t seem to mind. One reason for that might be gleaned by looking back to October 30, 2007, when the Democrats debated in Philadelphia. Clinton was the front-runner then, too, and it was the thirteenth time the candidates had met. But it was also, arguably, the first time that her opponents—Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson, John Edwards, Christopher Dodd, Joe Biden, and, most improbably, Barack Obama—seriously challenged her, on all fronts. Edwards accused her of “doubletalk.” Obama called her out for “changing positions whenever it’s politically convenient”—she was “for NAFTA previously, now she’s against it”—and for not being “truthful.” A lot of the time was taken up asking why records of her official work in her husband’s White House were sealed in the Clinton Presidential library. She responded with what must have been intended as judiciousness but came across as obfuscation. When Tim Russert, one of the moderators, tried to determine whether she was in favor of issuing driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants—she had indicated both yes and no—she called his question a “gotcha.”","1654","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"In the days that followed, Clinton and her campaign tried to frame the debate as a Hillary-against-the-world moment, a “pile-on,” orchestrated by what she called, in a speech at Wellesley College, “the all-boys’ club.” Clinton had been considered the winner in most of the previous debates, and even many of her supporters acknowledged that this one marked a turning point. A week before, she was at 48.5 per cent in an average of polls, the highest she had ever been. (Obama registered 21.2.) Immediately afterward, she began a decline and, despite some rebounds, never matched that number again.","1655","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"From her perspective, there may have been something broken about the 2008 debates. A remarkable eighteen million people voted for her during the primary season, and she and her supporters may feel that a process that derailed her then is not one to follow now. But, if Clinton has concluded that the lesson of 2008 is to avoid debates, she does not yet understand why she lost that night in Philadelphia. Polls still show that a perception of dishonesty is her greatest problem among voters. (“They don’t trust you. They might not like you,” Savannah Guthrie told her last week.) Often, that perception is the product of unfair partisan attacks, but, as in 2008, it is also sometimes the result of her decisions. Last Wednesday, Clinton announced that she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that is a high priority for President Obama, even though she had praised the negotiations when she was Secretary of State (“the gold standard in trade agreements”) and referred to them proudly after she left office.","1656","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"The thinking appears to be that she’ll score points with Sanders voters and with organized labor, while Biden, as a loyal member of the Administration, will have to support the T.P.P.—a classic triangulation. But it echoes Obama’s nafta comment from the Philadelphia debate, just as the questions about her White House records now sound like a prelude to the e-mail issue. Fair or not, she needs to push herself to a greater level of openness, and figure out how to have a good week based on a real-world confrontation, not a comedy-sketch encounter. Clinton stayed in the 2008 race for eight months after her loss in Philadelphia. By the end, Barack Obama was a palpably stronger candidate. So, for that matter, was Hillary Clinton. A few weeks after Philadelphia, she had picked herself up and gone to the next debate, in Las Vegas—the site of this week’s meeting—where she performed well. The last question, from a young woman, was a “fun” one: “Do you prefer diamonds or pearls?” Clinton laughed. “Now, I know I’m sometimes accused of not being able to make a choice,” she said. Then she added, “I want both.” ♦","1657","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Fifteen years ago, as Philip Roth was reading the galleys of a memoir by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., he came to a passage about the political fevers of 1939-40, when reactionaries like Father Charles Coughlin, Henry Ford, and Charles Lindbergh brandished the twin banners of nativism and isolation. Moderate Republicans, including Wendell Willkie, a corporate lawyer who eventually won the Party’s Presidential nomination, were never likely to topple F.D.R., and some Party grandees wanted Lindbergh to run. Lindbergh was known by then not only as the daring aviator who crossed the Atlantic in the Spirit of St. Louis but also as a bigot so vile that F.D.R., upon reading one of his speeches, remarked that “it could not have been better put if it had been written by Goebbels himself.”","1658","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Next to a passage where Schlesinger raised the question of whether Republicans would put Lindbergh forward at the head of a new Know-Nothing Party, Roth wrote, “What if they had?” That marginal note became the germ for “The Plot Against America,” a counter-factual novel in which Lindbergh is elected President. “Fear presides over these memories,” Roth’s novel begins, “perpetual fear.” Anyone who dares to look past the comedy of Donald Trump’s surreal tweets and Ben Carson’s end-times ruminations will notice that the politics of perpetual fear is, in our times, the stuff of nonfiction.","1659","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Last week, the Democrats held their first debate, a five-candidate affair in Las Vegas—an unlikely place to hear denunciations of “the casino-capitalist process.” Still, it was a relatively civil and sober discussion compared with the Republican rodeos. After a year of floundering, Hillary Clinton, cool, well-schooled, forensically skilled, had her best hours as a candidate. Her performance provided relief for her supporters and a potential lure for the undecided. She was, contrary to previous reports, conspicuously human-seeming—funny, passionate, even, at times, rueful of past mistakes—a development that might have robbed her potential rival, Vice-President Joe Biden, of the rationale he needed to make a run. Bernie Sanders, the seventy-four-year-old junior senator from Vermont and unapologetic democratic socialist, spoke in a voice that suggested Larry David, on “Seinfeld,” imitating George Steinbrenner. And yet although Clinton handily won the debate, Sanders largely set the terms, pushing her toward a more full-throated progressive view of income inequality and other issues. (From offstage, the Black Lives Matter movement had an equally serious influence on the discussion of race.)","1660","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Sanders also paused for an act of clever generosity, declaring, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails!” Beaming and extending her hand, Clinton thanked him but did not reciprocate the kindness, swatting him on his weak record on gun control, citing his multiple votes against the Brady bill. And while Clinton totted up her own list of Scandinavian-style domestic goals, such as paid parental leave, she raised a brow at Sanders when he talked of “revolution” and the systemic rot of late capitalism. In case we hadn’t figured it out, Hillary Clinton wants to win.","1661","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"History may look back on the Las Vegas debate as the event that elevated Clinton the way that Barack Obama’s eloquent victory speech after the Iowa caucuses elevated him, nearly eight years ago. It might even be regarded as the moment when she boxed out Biden, raked away the underbrush of Mssrs. Chafee, Webb, and O’Malley, and made Sanders look less like a plausible contender than like a protest candidate who forced his opponent to grapple with a political system poisoned by the outsized influence of an American oligarchy comprising, as the Times has reported, a hundred and fifty-eight families.","1662","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"One debate will not erase all of what many voters see as Clinton’s complications: the lingering perception of her sense of moneyed entitlement, her lawyerly slipperiness under questioning, the walled garden of her political circle, her interventionist reflexes, her belatedness on gay marriage, comprehensive immigration, and Wall Street reforms. But if Clinton was not flawless she and her debating partners managed one distinct achievement: they accentuated the chaos, the intellectual barrenness, and the general collapse of their rivals in the Republican Party.","1663","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Consider the political spectacle on Capitol Hill, in which Speaker John Boehner, hardly a Rockefeller Republican, could no longer deal with his caucus and, with little more than a chorus of “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah,” announced his early retirement. Members of the caucus stepped forward to admit that the hearings on Benghazi were aimed less at uncovering the truth than at burying Hillary Clinton. An ambitious Party loyalist, Paul Ryan, is reluctant to run for Boehner’s chair because the House Republicans are the new Wild Bunch and, as a friend of Ryan’s put it to Politico, “he’s not a f—ing moron.”","1664","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Consider, too, the G.O.P. candidates for the White House. Donald Trump and Ben Carson, the only Republicans polling in double digits, daily clear their throats with that ritual preface of modern self-satisfaction—“I am not politically correct”—and then unleash statements, positions, and postures so willfully detached from fact that they embarrass the political culture that harbors them. Trump is willing to say anything—anything racist, anything false, anything “funny”—to terrify voters, or rile them, or amuse them, depending on the moment. The worst of his demagogic arousals are reminiscent of Lindbergh’s speeches at America First rallies and his fear, as he wrote in Reader’s Digest, of a “pressing sea of Yellow, Black and Brown.” Carson, who seems as historically confused as he is surgically skilled, has said that Obamacare is worse than 9/11, “because 9/11 is an isolated incident.” What’s more, the two men’s rivals either fall into line or lack the persuasive powers and the courage to marginalize candidates they know to be dangerous.","1665","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"In electoral terms, Democrats had to view the week’s events with confidence. But there is pathos and foreboding here for the republic. In the debate, Clinton was clear who her enemies were: “the Republicans.” Reports of the death of the radical right are premature. In 2016, the G.O.P. is likely, at a minimum, to hold its majority in the House. If there is a campaign promise in 2016 that is almost sure to be fulfilled, it is that obstructionism and political war will continue, for within the G.O.P. the politics of perpetual fear goes on corroding not just a party but a nation. ♦","1666","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"

"Since Tuesday night’s Democratic debate was held in a Las Vegas hotel, let’s start with the money question: Who won and who lost?","October 14, 2015","1679","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Undoubtedly, Hillary Clinton was the biggest winner, partly because she was playing for the highest stakes. She flew into Nevada as a wounded favorite, whose stumbling performance during the past six months, much of it provoked by the issue of her personal e-mail server, had left many Democrats wondering whether she could get it together in time to win a nomination that was supposed to have been hers for the taking, let alone to win the general election. If she had come across as tetchy and defensive, as she has so often this year, or if she had committed an embarrassing verbal gaffe, the pressure on her would have increased still further, and the chances of Vice-President Joe Biden entering the race would have gone up.","1680","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Instead, Clinton delivered a performance that no doubt reminded establishment Democrats why they had rallied behind her in the first place, and reminded Republicans why she could prove to be a most formidable opponent come November, 2016. Sharp, personable, and assured, she batted off an early question from the moderator, Anderson Cooper, about her flip-flops on various issues, breezed through most of the subsequent exchanges, and received a big assist from her closest rival, Bernie Sanders, who, in perhaps the most memorable moment of the evening, declared, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails…. Enough of the e-mails. Let’s talk about the real issues facing America.”","1681","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Those comments earned the Vermont senator a warm handshake from Clinton and the biggest cheer of the night from a Democratic audience that was all too willing to believe her claim that the Republicans’ pursuit of the e-mail matter is a political vendetta. Even Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who in August said that the Republicans had raised legitimate issues about the e-mails, backed off, saying that he, too, was delighted to be discussing other issues.","1682","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Clinton, of course, would have been more than happy to talk about issues all night. As it became clear that none of the other candidates was going to take her down, she turned her fire on the Republicans, portraying them as dangerous extremists and saying, “They don’t mind having big government to interfere with a woman’s right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood. They’re fine with big government when it comes to that. I’m sick of it.” That line earned Clinton her biggest cheers of the night.","1683","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"The horse race apart, it was a substantive debate, with the candidates going into a level of detail that was rarely broached in the first two Republican debates. (Of course, there were many more candidates on stage at those events.) The matters raised ran the gamut, covering gun control, Syria, climate change, Black Lives Matter, Wall Street regulation, college funding, and paid leave for workers. On many of these issues, Clinton, Sanders, and O’Malley showed themselves to be in general agreement about what was needed, but also, in some cases, divided on how to achieve their shared goals.","1684","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"That much we knew going in. Still, it was instructive to watch Sanders say, in response to a question from Cooper about whether he considers himself a capitalist, “Do I consider myself part of the casino-capitalist process, by which so few have so much and so many have so little, by which Wall Street’s greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don’t.” And it was equally instructive, moments later, when Clinton said, “Well, let me just follow up on that, Anderson, because, when I think about capitalism, I think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families.”","1685","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"On foreign policy, too, the differences between the two front-runners came through clearly, despite the respectful attitude they adopted toward each other. Defending the Obama Administration’s decision to provide military assistance to the Libyan rebels seeking to overthrow Muammar Qaddafi, Clinton described it as “smart power at its best.” Unlike Jim Webb, the former senator from Virginia, Sanders didn’t criticize the Libya decision, but he did express skepticism about U.S. military interventions generally, describing the Iraq invasion, which Clinton voted for, as “the worst foreign-policy blunder in the history of this country.” He also said that he opposed the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria, an idea that Clinton has supported.","1686","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"All in all, the seventy-four-year-old senator from Vermont gave a good account of himself. In one sense, indeed, he made history. Not since Eugene Debs has a self-avowed socialist made such an impression in a Presidential race, in terms of the language he has invoked, the support he has garnered, and the impact his rise has had on the other candidates. Sanders’s Brooklyn accent became more pronounced as the night went on, as he railed against the “oligawky” and denied having left anyone at the “altuh.” (The latter statement was in reference to his refusal to support a 2007 immigration bill.) Afterward, he said that he wished he’d had more time to talk about rising inequality and the challenges it presents to democracy. In reality, though, he got his message through. “Here is the truth that very few candidates will say,” he said in his closing statement. “Nobody up here—certainly no Republican—can address the major crises facing our country unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class that has so much power over our economy and our political life.”","1687","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Of the second-string contenders, O’Malley fared by far the best. An articulate policy wonk, he held his own while debating the issues, and delivered the strongest closing statement, saying to those Americans who have become disillusioned about politics, “Talk to our young people under thirty, because you’ll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples. That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country.”","1688","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"By contrast, Webb and Lincoln Chafee, the former senator from Rhode Island, both looked and sounded terribly out of place. Webb started out by becoming possibly the first Democratic candidate in recent memory to boast of his service in the Reagan Administration (he worked in the Pentagon). Thereafter, he spent a lot of time grouching about how little time he was being allotted. Chafee stumbled badly in trying to explain why he voted, in 1999, to repeal the Glass–Steagall Act, which separated commercial banking from investment banking. Neither man looked like he would be around for long, though Webb did get off one good line: “Bernie, I don’t think the revolution’s going to come. And I don’t think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff.”","1689","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Clinton didn’t have the passion of Sanders or the poetry of O’Malley’s sign-off, but she had something else: the self-confidence and killer instinct of a politician who has been down this route before. Early on, before Sanders helped her out with his comment about her e-mails, she stuck it to him in his most vulnerable area: his record on gun control. She pointed out that he voted five times against the Brady Bill, which required a federal background check and a five-day waiting period for gun purchases. She also ridiculed his answer to a question from Cooper about why he had supported an immunity provision for the manufacturers of guns used to commit violent crimes. “It wasn’t that complicated to me,” Clinton said, after Sanders called the bill a complicated one. “It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity.”","1690","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"The Democratic front-runner also demonstrated the hawkish streak that infuriates some progressives and sometimes earns her grudging respect from Republicans. Asked about Edward Snowden, she repeated the discredited argument that he could have invoked whistle-blower status, and said that he had stolen a lot of information that had fallen into enemy hands. “So I don’t think he should be brought home without facing the music,” she concluded. (Ari Fleischer, a former spokesman for President George W. Bush, tweeted, “Good for Hillary on Snowden.”)","1691","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"In her closing statement, Clinton said that she wanted to get back to “the basic bargain I was raised with: if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead.” That, of course, is an entirely familiar Democratic trope. When Bill Clinton was running for President, it was dubbed the “New Covenant.” President Obama often expressed it in terms of rewarding “hardworking folks” who “play by the rules.” In this case, though, familiarity is unlikely to breed contempt—at least among the moderate and loyal Democrats whom Clinton needs to support her. Bill Clinton and President Obama won four elections between them. For one night, at least, Hillary Clinton gave Democrats reason to believe that she might be ready to follow their example.","1692","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"

"Americans love to talk about hairdos. There are at least six hair-themed reality shows airing right now, including “Shear Genius” (“Hell Breaks Loose Over Hedge Clippers”), “Hair Battle Spectacular” (“The Final Hairdown”), and “Cutting It: In the ATL” (“The Tale of Two Weaves”). “Hair is a language,” Penny Howell Jolly, a professor of art history at Skidmore, wrote in a 2010 Times piece, comparing the coiffures of U.S. Presidents. “It announces our gender, class and even our politics.”","1694","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"A Baltimore hairdresser named Janet Stephens has taken the national preoccupation farther—certainly farther back—than anyone. Stephens is fifty-seven and has red-violet hair with a metallic sheen (“I was born dishwater blond”) that she wears shoulder length, with short bangs. “I’ve pretty much invented the field of ancient Roman hair-style re-creation,” she said last week, before heading over to Studio 921 Salon & Day Spa, where she is a stylist. “I’m a hairdressing archeologist.”","1695","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"Stephens earned a B.A. in dramatic arts from Whitman College but has studied ancient hair styles on her own for fifteen years. A statue of the Roman empress Julia Domna, at a Baltimore museum, initially piqued her interest: the statue is crowned with a complex bun that, as Stephens tried to replicate it on mannequins, led her down a rabbit hole of scholarship.","1696","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"Her sources: “surviving ancient literary and material evidence, including Roman portraiture, hairdressing artifacts, and epigraphy.” Most of the texts are in translation. “I’m halfway through first-year Latin on CD,” she said. Nevertheless, Stephens has published an article in the Journal of Roman Archaeology and was recently asked to write an entry on ancient hair styles for a forthcoming encyclopedia. “Intimidating,” she said.","1697","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"Lately, she has been getting inquiries about the provenance of Donald Trump’s hair style. “The comb-over goes back to ancient Rome, at least,” she said. “Roman comb-overs were not based on the side part, as they are today. To part the hair was an exclusively feminine practice avoided by ‘manly’ Roman men. If a Roman man’s hair was thinning, but still present, he allowed the hair at the crown to grow longer and combed it forward. This type of comb-over is visible on portrait statues of Emperor Hadrian. If a man was hippocratically bald”—hairless on top, like Hippocrates—“he would grow any remaining side hair longer and comb each side up over the top to meet in the middle. These comb-overs were unstable, because of gravity and wind. They were likely held in place with pomade or primitive hair gels made from acacia gum—ancient versions of the hairspray, in other words, that keeps Donald Trump’s signature comb-over in place.","1698","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"“I can talk about pretty much every candidate,” Stephens went on. “A few general points: Carly Fiorina, Jim Webb, Ted Cruz, and Trump all would have mocking epigrams written about their dye jobs. Jeb Bush would fit right into the first century A.D., the bridge between the Republic and the principate. Ben Carson looks more like a third-century soldier: he has great dignity, but he doesn’t really resemble any Roman emperors. Chris Christie could be Emperor Vespasian, but he’d have to lose a little more hair. He’d also have to brush forward and trim his bangs. He resembles Vespasian mostly in facial shape and attitude.","1699","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"“Ted Cruz would fit perfectly in ancient Rome. Carly Fiorina, absolutely not: short hair was a sign you’d been conquered. Jim Gilmore vaguely resembles Emperor Galba, from the first century. I’m amazed at how many styles Bobby Jindal has had. He’d fit into the Trajanic period, early second century. Perfect throughout the Mediterranean world.”","1700","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"As for Lindsey Graham, Mike Huckabee, John Kasich, George Pataki, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio, and Rick Santorum, “they’d all be fine in ancient Rome if they combed forward. Rand Paul has a kind of disturbing resemblance to Patrick Stewart in ‘I, Claudius.’ That curly hair with a very slight leftward part: you could just drop him into the middle of ancient Rome and, except for eye color, he’d fit.","1701","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"“Scott Walker resembles Emperor Tiberius. Lincoln Chafee bears an interesting similarity to Emperor Trajan, but he’d need a cleft chin. Hillary Clinton, because of her short hair and blue eyes, would be a captive like Fiorina. Bernie Sanders carries the spirit of Rome. He lets his hair grow out between cuts, perfect for ancient Roman portraiture: ‘uncared-for beauty,’ as Ovid would have said.","1702","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"“Donald Trump is the outlier. Definitely the Gallus comatus, or long-haired Gaul. His comb-over is just too much for ancient Rome.” She paused to look up a line of verse. “Martial wrote a funny poem about an acquaintance with a comb-over, Epigram 10.83. I’m partial to a translation that ends, ‘Why not be straightforward and admit to being an old man / so that at last you look like one man? / Nothing is uglier than a bald head with a lot of hair.’ ” ♦","1703","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"The annual party conference, a centerpiece of the U.K. political calendar, has no analogue in the U.S., but the pregame commentary by the British media resembles the buildup for America’s quadrennial conventions: the controlled leaks of lines from the speech; the unsolicited advice from pundits and scolds; the official photos of the speaker hard at work on the draft. This year’s Labour Party gathering in Brighton has generated more of this sort of interest than usual, since yesterday marked the maiden conference speech of Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s newly elected leader. (The Conservatives will meet next week in Manchester.) Even the photos, unremarkable as they are—Corbyn, in a white shirt with rolled-up cuffs, sits in a room at the Brighton Hilton, writing with a pen or drinking coffee from a paper cup—drew the attention of BuzzFeed. The site invited readers to decipher Corbyn’s scribblings by zooming in on a photo, rotating it, and squinting. Interpretations sprung up on Twitter: “soil please” and “mandatory peas” were phrases people professed to see through the pixels; so were “goats of mercy” and, more darkly, “goats of rage.”","September 30, 2015","1704","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"
"They kid. But, in the run-up to the conference, the question was not whether Corbyn would ride the podium off the rails but how quickly and spectacularly he would do it. In his few weeks as leader, his speeches have been so shambling, malcontented, and overheated that a meltdown in Brighton seemed as likely as not. There is an opposing camp: the young supporters who have just joined Labour and helped install Corbyn as leader. To them, the man’s grouchiness, his allergy to contrivance and spin, is exactly what recommends him. These are the markers of the New Authenticity, prized in Britain no less than in Bernie Sanders’s and Ben Carson’s America.","1705","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"
"Corbyn may be new to his role as party leader, but his problem is not a lack of experience; his problem is a surplus of the wrong kind of experience. At sixty-six, he has been for decades a protest politician—a pest, a goad, answerable chiefly to his own conscience and to Islington North, his constituency in London. Listening to Corbyn, one often has the feeling of being castigated—which might be his intent. He has never, until recently, aimed to appeal to the whole of the Labour Party, never mind the broader electorate. Instead, he has been tuned to a frequency that sounds, to many ears, like a stuck whistle. “People must understand,” Jack Straw, who served as Foreign Secretary under Tony Blair, warned during the leadership contest, “this is a vote for perpetual opposition.”","1706","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"
"Corbyn, it appears, has been listening to his critics. Yesterday’s conference speech made concessions to speechcraft, as well as to stagecraft: Corbyn wore a tie; he used a teleprompter (“autocue” is the British term); and he opened with a run of politically deft jokes, taking the air out of perceptions that he is a radical who would end, among other things, premier-league football. He was friendly, never scary; he didn’t shout more than was necessary. Corbyn’s “movement,” as he portrays it, is a diverse and sunny and, well, effervescent group of Britons who “are fizzing with ideas. Let’s give them the space for that fizz to explode into the joy we want of a better society.” (So maybe he was a little scary.) “Just because I’ve become the leader of this party,” he assured supporters, “I’m not going to stop standing up on those [human rights] issues or being that activist” he’d been before. But, unless you were a member of the Conservative Party (who have nothing but “misery on offer”) or the “commentariat” (“Cut out the personal abuse,” he told them), it was a mostly inoffensive speech, padded with soft-focus phrases like “kinder politics” and “caring society,” and obviously intended to take the edge off his public persona. There were no “goats of rage.” (No goats at all, in fact.)","1707","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"
"It was surely Corbyn’s best big performance to date, but there is substantial room for improvement. The speech had no structure and no consistent theme. It fulfilled, all too well, his anti-political promise of “not necessarily message discipline all the time.” Three-quarters of the way into the hour-long address, Corbyn started to take on the aspect of a man who strikes up a conversation with you at a bar (“pub” is the British term), draws you in with his intensity and intellect, and then at last call is still talking at you about “property and power, class and capital,” having hardly touched his beer (“pint”). Right to the end, Corbyn was still throwing in topics—housing policy, tax breaks to hedge funds—that could well have been introduced by saying, “and another thing.”","1708","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"
"The reception on the floor was enthusiastic, but that was misleading: the crowd was not broadly representative of the party that Corbyn must now try to lead. Some moderate, “Blairite” M.P.’s fled Brighton before Corbyn gave his speech. One, on the way out of town, muttered to a reporter that “it’s like occupied Paris here”; another explained that he was afraid of getting caught on camera wearing a sour expression. As for Corbyn, beyond his repeated promise to “listen to everyone” he had little to offer the disaffected by way of conciliation or common ground. His call for an “open debate in our party” was the sound of one man punting. Nor did he manage to define or direct what he calls “our movement”—or even to argue persuasively that a movement, rather than a loose body of the like-minded, exists. “Our new members,” Corbyn said, “they don’t want to do things the old way.” But what is the new way?","1709","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"
"In Britain, as in America, there is a widespread and well-founded feeling of frustration and disgust with the political process—of being “fed up,” as Corbyn puts it, of being “sick and tired,” as Bernie Sanders often says. But the problem with the New Authenticity, as presently practiced, is that it is just another form of telling people what they want to hear. It offers psychic satisfaction but few credible solutions. “Straight talk,” which Corbyn promises, is not just a matter of tone.","1710","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"
"It is your tenth birthday. You invite close friends to your party, plus a few other kids from your class—the popular ones, good to have on your side, and maybe a couple of smart ones, who know all the answers to the questions. Your mother has an idea: “Invite Jerry.” You scoff at the thought. Jerry is the outlier—the class grouch, making trouble but never headway. Nobody hates him, but you all roll your eyes whenever he raises his hand, because you know what’s coming next. Plus, Jerry is no fun. He actually likes school. For just those reasons, however, your mom thinks you should include him; it will loosen the guest-list, shake things up a little. So, with a sigh, you agree.","September 13, 2015","1711","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"Jerry comes to the party. Everyone laughs when he arrives—dressed like a dork, of course, because he is a dork. Still, he hangs around, and talks. And then something strange happens. The other kids begin to listen to Jerry. They sidle toward him, and cluster round. He seems different from everyone else; that used to be a liability, but now it makes him stand out from the crowd. It even makes him—get this—a little bit cool. And so it is that, as the party ends, everybody leaves with Jerry, hanging on his every word. He has already blown out the candles on your cake, taken a large slice for himself, and handed round the rest. He has opened your presents. He has utterly won over your mother, who finds him “so real” compared with the rest of your pals. Today, in short, feels like his birthday, not yours. Everybody loves Jerry.","1712","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"All of which is one way of describing the events that have overtaken the Labour Party in Great Britain over the past four months—events that culminated, Saturday, in the election of Jeremy Corbyn as the leader of the party. How you regard this singular occurrence depends on your point of view. If you cleave to the idealistic left and believe that Labour has strayed for too long from the path of righteousness, you will treat the ascent of Corbyn to the top job—he is now the Leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition, in Parliament—as the advent of a Messiah. (That was certainly the tone of the adulation that Corbyn received on Saturday afternoon, in Parliament Square, when, in his first deed as leader, he addressed a large rally that was urging the government to welcome refugees who are fleeing war in Syria and elsewhere, and arriving in ever greater numbers at the borders of Europe.) If you are someone who worked for Tony Blair, when he was the party leader, you will lie down in a dark room, press your fingers to your temples, and wonder if your life’s work just got thrown out with the trash. And, if you are a member of the Conservative Party, currently governing with a healthy majority, you will solemnly pour a glass of champagne and then, midway through your first sip, start laughing so hard that bubbles come out of your nose.","1713","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"Our story begins on May 8th, when the Tories, contrary to all predictions and polls, awoke to discover that they had won an outright majority in the general election. The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, resigned forthwith. An interim boss took his place, while the contest to find his successor got under way. Three candidates emerged: Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper, and Liz Kendall. All of them were personable, well-drilled, and hovering ideologically around the center of Labour politics, with Burnham tilting slightly to the left and Kendall to the right. All three had been shadow ministers. (This means that, while your party is out of power, you “shadow” your opposite number in government, challenging his or her policies in the House of Commons and constructing better ones of your own. In so doing, you prepare for the day when, after your party wins an election, you step into the full glare of ministerial office.)","1714","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"And then, unexpectedly, a fourth contender arose. His name was Jeremy Corbyn, and he was a last-minute candidate. That is no exaggeration. Anybody wishing to enter the contest for the leadership had to be nominated, with the support of thirty-five Labour Members of Parliament, by noon on June 15th; with hours to go before the deadline, Corbyn was still short of that figure, and it was not until 11:59 A.M., apparently, that the final nomination for him was registered. What movie director, making “The Corbyn Supremacy,” years from now, will be able to resist a closeup of that second hand, and its deafening tick?","1715","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"One wonders how funny that film will turn out to be. The scenes set in 2015, for sure, will be tinged with irresistible comedy. We will see the faces of the actors playing Burnham, Cooper, and Kendall as word begins to filter through, from the campaign trail, that they are no longer in a three-horse race; that the hobbling outsider, far from being an also-ran, is right on their hooves. Even more aghast will be the expressions of the Corbyn nominators. It is now clear that some of them—sane, experienced politicians—encouraged him to enter the fray not because they shared his beliefs, or even because they were backing him in the leadership contest, but because they felt, in their wisdom, that the race would benefit from a broader range of candidates. The other three were on the bland side; why not, you know, toss a maverick into the mix? Who on Earth could object to a more vigorous debate? To which the only response is: be very, very careful what you wish for.","1716","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"Jeremy Corbyn is sixty-six. He has been married three times. “He’s a genuinely nice guy,” according to his first wife. “The problem is that his politics are to the exclusion of other kinds of human activities.” There is a cruel caricature, hard to erase from the popular imagination, that depicts the archetypal resident of the British far left: a bearded, bicycle-riding, teetotal vegetarian from Islington, in north London. The image is lazy and unjust; in Corbyn’s case, unfortunately, it also happens to be true. Since 1983, he has been the Member of Parliament for Islington North. He owns no car. He was a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Stop the War coalition against the invasion of Iraq. His natural weapons are the banner, the bullhorn, and the protest march. He has never been a minister, or a shadow minister. What he has been, persistently, is a pain in the neck, or, at any rate, a thorn in the side. More than five hundred times in his parliamentary career he has defied the whip; in other words, he has ignored the advice of the party whips—a thrillingly British term for the enforcers who, in a House of Commons debate, cajole and command M.P.s to vote in line with the leadership. Corbyn’s reputation as a rebel has been honestly earned, over the long haul, but it now presents him with a problem; how exactly, in his new capacity, can he expect those who serve beneath him to obey the touch of the whip? How do you square the example of your own conscience with the need for party order, without which, in opposition, you cannot hope to hold the government to account?","1717","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"This conundrum may be all the more acute for Corbyn, because few of his M.P.s want him as their commander-in-chief. They did not choose him. He was chosen under a new set of Labour Party rules that, like many things devised in the interests of fairness, have concluded in a splendid fiasco. You might think that, because M.P.s are elected by the populace, they could—or logically should—be trusted to appoint their own overlord. Not so. There was a time when the trades unions, fettered by history and loyalty to Labour, wielded great influence in the matter of its leader, but that age has faded. Instead, with a bracing simplicity, every paid-up member of the party now has a vote. The payment is three pounds (about four dollars and sixty cents). For that trifling sum, you get to sway the direction of Labour’s future, and, if enough of you sign up—many minds with but a single thought—the outcome will be anything but a trifle. That is what transpired in 2015: the Corbynistas ran amok. They swarmed to their man. Corbynmania was born.","1718","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"In the end, he won the leadership with embarrassing ease. The rubric demands that only by gaining fifty per cent of the votes can a contestant win in the first round; otherwise, further rounds will ensue, with the weaker candidates dropping gradually away. Corbyn took almost sixty per cent, more than his three rivals put together. (Kendall, an instinctive modernizer, and thus the person whom the Tories would most have feared at the ballot box, scored four and a half per cent.) So who are his fans, whose ardor has verged on idolatry? What do they see in the chap with the undervest and the cycle clips?","1719","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"Well, they feel personally wounded by the result of this year’s general election, routinely referred to as a tragedy. Either they refuse to accept it or they tell themselves that it never happened. And the wishing away does not stop there. They would, if equipped with a magic wand, undo the whole reign of Tony Blair—in many ways a more despised figure than Margaret Thatcher. She was the known witch from the other side of the forest; he was the traitor within, with his merchants of spin, his indecent weakness for wealth, his suspiciously ready grin, and his unnecessary wars. The fact that Blair won three general elections, granting Labour its most sustained period of government in the modern era, is not just an inconvenient truth. To the Corbynite left, it demonstrates his perfidy, for only an accommodating scoundrel—a thinly disguised Tory, and a disgrace to the socialist faith—would be happy to shape and shrink his opinions until they fitted the capitalist mold. It follows, from this thesis, that the last golden age was the nineteen-seventies, before the witch flew down, when the kingdom was safe in Labour’s hands. There are sunlit glades of yore to which Corbyn will conduct the faithful. As he informed them Saturday, in his victory address, “Welcome back. Welcome home.”","1720","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"It is a shining vision, and, had I been a restive eighteen-year-old, watching that speech, I would have bathed in the glow of its abstractions. The Labour movement was, Corbyn said, “passionate, democratic, diverse, united, and absolutely determined in our quest for a decent and better society that is possible for all.” Who could disagree with that? The plea became a cry: “Let us be a force for change in the world, a force for humanity in the world, a force for peace in the world, and a force that recognizes we cannot go on like this, with grotesque levels of inequality, grotesque threats to our environment all around the world, without the rich and powerful governments stepping up to the plate to make sure our world becomes safer and better.” Apart from the unlikely sound of the member for Islington North using a baseball metaphor, there was much to inspire in these words, and little cause for alarm. Why, then, within hours, had a sizable number of Labour M.P.s, including Cooper, Kendall, and some of the most able shadow ministers, declared that they would not serve in a Corbyn cabinet? Who’s afraid of the bearded wolf?","1721","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"Well, consider where the wolf went next. Before heading off to the rally for refugees, he repaired to a Westminster pub. There he was caught, on camera, joining in a cheerful sing-along of “The Red Flag.” He also hugged a hulk: Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, which is the largest trade union in the country, and which had backed him in his quest for the leadership. The heart of McCluskey, and his spiritual kin, will have been stirred by the avowed policies of the victor: under a Corbyn Administration, the plan would be to renationalize the British rail network, as well as the major energy companies. There would be a cap on the maximum wage of high earners. The national deficit would be erased not through austerity, as practiced by the heinous Conservatives, but through taxes on the rich and by what Corbyn calls “quantitative easing for people.” This means, we are told, that the Bank of England will print more money: an endearing and almost childlike solution, though not one that has met with unqualified success elsewhere. One suggestion is that, by dint of the refreshing threat that he poses to the establishment, Corbyn is roughly the British equivalent of Bernie Sanders. Nice try, but no. Corbyn makes Bernie Sanders look like Ted Cruz.","1722","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"Corbynism is by no means confined to his native land. He is skeptical of the European Union, and of Britain’s place within it: a stance that puts him in peculiar league with many on the right of the Conservative Party. Unlike them, however, he is also disquieted by British membership of NATO, possibly because that organization is predicated on the need to fight. Questioned as to the circumstances in which he would unleash the armed forces, Corbyn said, “I’m sure there are some, but I can’t think of them at the moment.” As for Trident, the U.K.’s nuclear deterrent, which will soon require a replacement, that’s easy: he would scrap the entire project. All of the above views are standard tenets of the British left, at least in its wilder reaches, and nobody could charge Corbyn with a lack of tenacity. For decades, whether on the backbenches of Parliament or on the streets, he has stuck to his gunlessness, and it is that air of principle—consistent, unspinnable, and pure—that has impressed his allies and foes alike. On the other hand, there is this:","1723","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"Imagine if an American politician, running for high office, had been filmed uttering those sentences. His or her candidacy would have dropped off a cliff. The truly disturbing aspect, though, is not that Corbyn said such things, which he did at a conference in 2009, but that, when the footage was replayed during the leadership campaign, it caused such a minimum of fuss, and did nothing to impede the march of the Corbyn camp. Anti-Zionism is firmly rooted in parts of the left-wing agenda in the U.K., and protestations that it should not be confused with anti-Semitism bear more than a shade of naïveté, especially in a year when Jews have been targeted and murdered in mainland Europe for being Jews. The honorable traditions of Jewish socialism, in Britain and elsewhere, have suffered an erosion, and it was reported that even Ed Miliband, who is Jewish and the son of refugees from the Holocaust, proved unable to count on the Jewish vote at the election in May. It would have been deemed politically unwise if, as a standard-bearer for Labour, he had failed to lend sufficient prominence to the Palestinian cause.","1724","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"In the end, of course, whatever Miliband’s private discomfort on the matter, we had no opportunity to see it aired and tested in the spotlight. He was trounced in the general election. If the pollsters are right (not that anyone trusts them, after their pitiful showing in May), Corbyn will never have the chance to put his theories, mulled over with such enduring fervor, into effect. The argument of the Blairites, or what remains of them, runs like this: what Miliband promised, and what brought about his doom, was but a mild dilution of the socialist brew that Corbyn prefers to serve neat; by definition, then, the warmth with which Corbyn has been embraced in recent months by his own party could be directly inverse to the froideur of the broader electorate. He will not just lose the next general election, in 2020; he will be flattened. To those who study such arcana, it is an article of faith that you cannot hope to win a general election without securing the hearts, minds, gut feelings, and wallets of Middle England—that nebulous but sacred zone which, with its touch of Tolkien, refers to the millions of citizens who have acquired the hobbit-y habits of moderation, and who, having done O.K., would like to do better still. To them, the nineteen-seventies are not a paradise lost but a wrecking yard where British industry went to die, and where Labour governments got snarled in the machinery of the unions. It was the epoch when the lights went out, when garbage was stacked in the streets, and when the I.R.A. planted bombs in English pubs. And who was it, such folk may now remind each other, who invited Sinn Féin—assumed, at the time, to be the public face of the I.R.A.—to the House of Commons, only weeks after a bomb, intended for Mrs. Thatcher, had exploded at a hotel during the Conservative Party conference and killed five people? Jeremy Corbyn.","1725","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"To which his admirers will reply: get over it. That controversy belongs in the stale past, and, besides, was Corbyn not ahead of the game? Has Sinn Féin not participated in a power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland since 1999? (Quite so, although that agreement is once again under intense strain, in the wake of a murder in Belfast.) Even those in the Labour Party who despair at Corbyn’s triumph will concede that the primary task right now is not to rummage through his record but to arm him for the fray. This coming week should, to some extent, offer an easy ride. The House of Commons schedule includes debates on the Trade Union Bill and the Welfare Reform and Work Bill: perfect material for the newly minted leader, who can be relied upon to flay every item on the Conservative Party’s list of proposals. More vexing will be a debate on a possible increase in air strikes against ISIS, in Syria, and the case for deeper British involvement—a case that enjoys a measure of support among many Labour M.P.s, who could, within days, wind up voting against the wishes and convictions of their superior. The whips will be busy. Most enticing of all is the prospect of Wednesday, when Corbyn will, barring a fit of stage fright, stand up and confront David Cameron at the weekly installment of Prime Minister’s Question Time.","1726","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"The Tories, on the benches opposite Corbyn, will no doubt be praying for blood, yet Cameron, no fool, will be treading with extreme caution. For one thing, he will be the junior partner: a paltry fourteen years in the House of Commons, as opposed to Corbyn’s thirty-two. The Labour leader knows the ropes of the place as well as anyone does, and, for all his dedication to peace, he has long since mastered the most effective way to land a punch. There is also a serious risk that Cameron could seem to be behaving de haut en bas: the smooth and ruddy-cheeked squire, gazing down with a courteous smile upon the callow upstart at the cottage door. Nothing stinks like condescension in the British nose. Think of their duel: the scion of Eton and Oxford standing face to face with a man who performed poorly at school and has no college degree. The hale fellow who might have made his name, and a far larger fortune, in countless spheres of life, and who sometimes gives the impression that politics is a useful and diverting sport, versus the gentle ascetic who can conceive of no life other than the political brand. Would that Bernard Shaw were alive to observe their exchanges from the public gallery.","1727","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"
"Yet even that encounter pales beside another, still to come. By custom, the leader of the opposition becomes a member of the Privy Council—the small body of advisers to the Queen. When you are first sworn in as a Privy Councillor, you must observe a particular ritual: kneel on one knee, on a stool; raise a Bible in the right hand, for the lengthy intoning of the oath; stand up, walk three paces forward, and kiss the monarch’s hand; then walk backward, preferably without tripping over the stool. All of this is enough to strike terror into the privileged. So how will it affect someone who is a self-confessed republican, and an atheist to boot? Will Corbyn even go through with the ceremony? Will he skip the kiss? Will he, in a gesture of defiance, hurl the stool through a window? Will Her Majesty, who has seen everything, be amused? Say what you like about Jeremy Corbyn, but his confounding rise to power, and the thought of what he might do with that power, has afforded Great Britain—the very name presumably gives him the heebie-jeebies—its most entertaining and most Shakespearean plot in a long while. A nation awaits.","1728","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-corbyn-supremacy"

"But in the next breath, he revealed he actually had no plan. “I’m running for President, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people,” he said, in a confusing and bizarre non sequitur. “And what I hear is people’s concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy. People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one per cent.”","1732","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"Next up was Hillary Clinton, and she, too, promised to explain how she would deal with ISIS. “I will be laying out, in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coördinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism,” she said. “Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.”","1733","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"You can’t get any more direct than that: she would be “laying out in detail” the whole plan. Shortly after, she added a Sanderseque promise that ISIS “cannot be contained, it must be defeated,” which would be a notable shift from simply preventing ISIS’s expansion to eradicating it. But after two hours of debate, the Clinton plan never came.","1734","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"The same was true of Martin O’Malley.

"That’s not to say that there wasn’t some debate about the issue. But even those moments that seemed to highlight a difference of opinion fizzled into agreement about platitudes.

"There was a great deal of time spent on what caused ISIS’s rise. Sanders pointed to the effects of climate change. O’Malley and Sanders both pointed to Clinton’s vote in favor of the war in Iraq, which created the vacuum that ISIS has filled. John Dickerson, the moderator, asked whether Clinton’s support for deposing Muammar Qaddafi in Libya also contributed to the massive instability in the region. Clinton herself, in a creative stroke of deflection of responsibility for her role in the events of the last twelve years, argued that terrorism is simply a long-running problem in that part of the world.","1737","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"“I think it’s important we put this in historic context,” Clinton said, before taking viewers back through the history of terrorist attacks against Americans, including the 1983 bombing of a Marine barracks in Beirut, the 1998 embassy attacks in Tanzania and Kenya, and 9/11. She was perhaps trying to show off her knowledge of the region and its history, but it seemed more like she was trying to avoid criticism that the invasion of Iraq and intervention in Libya helped fuel ISIS’s rise.","1738","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"Some of the explanation for the lack of detail from Sanders, Clinton, and O’Malley has to do with the state of the Democratic primary race right now. As extreme underdogs, Sanders and O’Malley had incentives to attack Clinton’s record on Iraq and Libya, but they have little reason to lay out a comprehensive strategy, especially when appealing to a Democratic electorate that is wary of any military intervention that could produce high casualties for Americans.

Sitting on an enormous lead, she was loath to say anything that might cause a reaction from the anti-war Democratic base that Obama tapped in 2008 to beat her. But aside from the obvious politics, she may have believed her caution was the more responsible course. She might not want to box in Obama, who has yet to settle on a new course against ISIS, by laying out her own more ambitious and detailed plan.

"The days when Labor Day marked the beginning of the electoral season have long gone. Thanks to information technology, money, and the Supreme Court, we live in the era of the permanent campaign. But the end of summer still feels like a significant marker, and it provides a good moment to take stock of a set of events that surely would have prompted the good Doctor, had he been alive to chronicle them, to send out for another bottle of Wild Turkey.","1743","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Let’s start, as we must, at Trump Tower, where, last Thursday, Reince Priebus, the boyish-looking forty-three-year-old who has the unenviable task of heading up the Republican National Committee, presented a piece of paper to the fellow whose name is on the building. “I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,” the words on the paper said. “I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.” Donald Trump filled in his name in a blank space at the start of the text and signed at the bottom. He or someone else got the date wrong, writing August 3rd instead of September 3rd, but that didn’t matter: the deed had been done.","1744","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"A few weeks ago, when the loyalty pledge was first mooted, it looked like a clever insurance policy for the Republicans. After all, if Trump were to run as an independent and win even four or five per cent of the vote, he could easily hand the Presidential election to the Democrats. But as Trump extended and enlarged his position as the G.O.P. frontrunner, Priebus’s ploy came to take on a rather different aspect. From the vantage of Trump and his advisers, it must have seemed as if the Republican establishment, which they hold in utter disdain, were repeating the mistake of the Trojans and pulling the Greek horse into its midst.","1745","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"If Trump’s candidacy fails, as Priebus and his colleagues are dearly hoping that it will, whoever wins the Republican nomination won’t have to worry about Trump running as a third-party candidate: that’s the theory, anyway. But for the author of “The Art of the Deal,” this was a concession well worth making. For one thing, it assured him that his name will be on the G.O.P. primary ballot in every state, including those, like South Carolina, that had made (or threatened to make) a loyalty pledge a pre-condition for participating. Secondly, the signed pledge goes at least some way toward immunizing Trump against the charge that Jeb Bush had levelled at him on the very morning he signed it: that he isn’t a real conservative, or even a genuine Republican.","1746","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Finally, and most importantly from Trump’s standpoint, if all the other G.O.P. hopefuls go down—or rather, if they fail to get up from the prostrate position Trump’s summer stampede through the polls has left most of them in—the pledge insures that Trump will be guaranteed the support of the party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. As Jim Newell remarked at Slate, “Trump has not pledged to incorporate into his candidacy any of the cheerier tones or traditional Republican policies that the GOP establishment would like to see from him. The Republican Party, though, has agreed to incorporate Trump.” No wonder that, once Preibus had left, Trump called in the press and said he “will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands.” He added: “We will go out and fight hard, and we will win. We will win.”","1747","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"That remains an unlikely outcome, but not nearly as unlikely as it seemed a couple of months ago. Monmouth University’s poll data for June showed Trump’s favorable rating among likely Republican voters to be twenty per cent and his unfavorable rating to be fifty-five per cent. In Monmouth’s latest poll, which was released last week, Trump’s favorable rating among Republicans had jumped to fifty-nine per cent, and his unfavorable rating had fallen to twenty-nine per cent. Even in an era of declining party loyalty and footloose voters, these numbers represent an astonishing turnaround—and one that has sent pollsters searching, largely in vain, for a historical analogy. It isn’t unheard of for a previously unknown candidate to take off like a rocket before exploding at high altitude. But Trump wasn’t an unknown. He was a familiar television personality and blowhard, about whom the majority of Republicans harbored critical opinions. In just a couple of months, he has reversed many of those opinions, raising his positive rating by nearly forty percentage points and lowering his negative rating by almost thirty points.","1748","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Political scientists will be arguing for years about how he managed this feat. Clearly, his critical comments about Mexicans, and his pledge to deport as many as eleven million undocumented immigrants, struck a chord, as did his promise to renegotiate trade agreements that have cost jobs. But what really seems to have enthused the Republican electorate is Trump’s renegade attitude toward the Party establishment and the press. Every time he describes Washington as a hopeless cesspit, paints Jeb Bush as an ineffectual ninny, and jumps on anybody in the media who tries to question him, his numbers go up. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Real Clear Politics poll average showed him leading Ben Carson, another political outsider, by 27.8 per cent to 13.5 per cent at the national level, with all the other candidates stuck in single figures.","1749","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Developments on the Democratic side have been a bit less dramatic, but pretty remarkable nonetheless. At the start of the year, practically nobody in Washington took seriously the prospect of a Bernie Sanders Presidential candidacy. Indeed, some Hillary Clinton supporters were hoping that he would run, on the grounds that he would fill a potentially dangerous void to the left of Clinton with an unelectable presence. Now Sanders is running well ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire, the second primary state, and he’s gaining ground in Iowa, the first primary state.","1750","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The level of concern in the Clinton camp is perhaps best conveyed by two reports that appeared in the Times in the past few days, which were based on briefings from Clinton staffers and supporters. One of the stories said that, going forward, the candidate would seek to present a more likable side, demonstrating that she possesses a sense of humor and a beating heart. The other Times article said that the Clinton campaign is hoping to build a “political firewall across the South” starting on Super Tuesday, March 1st, when a dozen states, nine of them below the Mason-Dixon line, will vote in the Democratic primary. A firewall to contain Sanders? He was supposed to be incapable of lighting a gas stove, let alone sparking a raging brush fire.","1751","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"How did the Democratic primary come to this? Sanders deserves credit for recognizing that there is a resurgent progressive movement in the United States, one based on the proposition—shared by many Tea Party members, and even Trump—that American politics is now hopelessly corrupt. Once Elizabeth Warren made it clear that she wasn’t interested in acting as the movement’s standard-bearer in 2016, Sanders seized the opportunity. As the lone Socialist in Congress, he was never going to be accused of being an opportunist or a Johnny-come-lately to the progressive cause. But, at the age of seventy-three, he needed to show that he had the fire and the durability to be a Presidential candidate. This he has certainly done. Rather than engaging Clinton directly, he has stuck to the issues, calling for the public financing of elections, free enrollment at state universities, a breakup of the big banks, and a minimum wage of fifteen dollars an hour. All of these policies are popular, particularly with college-educated liberals, who have been flocking to Sanders in huge numbers.","1752","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The Vermont senator has earned his current position in the race. But he has also received a good deal of help from Clinton, who, despite the endorsement of many senior figures in the Party, is still struggling to recover from some self-inflicted wounds. Earlier in the year, when the stories about her private e-mail system and the tangled finances of the Clinton Global Foundation started to come out, it seemed like the money story would prove the most serious, but it is the e-mail saga that has plagued Clinton’s every step. It continues to damage her reputation. Recently, pollsters from Quinnipiac University asked a random sample of voters which word they most associated with various candidates. When Clinton’s name was mentioned, the three most popular answers were “liar,” “dishonest,” and “untrustworthy.”","1753","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"After this poll received a lot of publicity, some Hillary supporters argued that Quinnipiac had hyped the findings, and they raised some sound points. Out of a sample of fifteen hundred and sixty-three voters, a hundred and eighty-seven people answered “liar,” and it’s probably fair to assume that the vast majority were Republicans. (The sample contained six hundred and sixty-six self-identified Republicans.) Undoubtedly, much of the venom directed at Clinton is coming from ardent G.O.P. supporters, and this shouldn’t be overlooked. But it’s also true that her approval rating among independent and moderate voters has fallen sharply. In a P.P.P. poll released in April, fifty per cent of self-identified moderates had a favorable opinion of Clinton, and forty-one per cent had an unfavorable opinion. Now these numbers have flipped. A P.P.P. poll released last week showed that thirty-nine per cent of moderates view Clinton favorably, and forty-nine per cent view her unfavorably.*","1754","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The e-mail saga has surely helped to drive this turnaround. While Clinton’s insistence that she didn’t break any laws or violate any rules appears to be true, her explanation for why she did it—for the sake of convenience—beggars belief. The more she repeats this line, the harder it seems to be for voters to avoid the conclusion that she has something to hide. Last week, Clinton told NBC News’s Andrea Mitchell that she wasn’t thinking much about the server when she set it up. “We had so many problems around the world,” Clinton said. “I didn’t really stop and think, What kind of e-mail system will there be?” The day after the interview, the Washington Post reported that Clinton had personally paid a State Department staffer to set up the private e-mail server, maintain it, and keep it going. And in case you missed it, the staffer, Bryan Pagliano, has reportedly indicated that he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence rather than testify before Congress.","1755","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"To state the obvious, it’s a worrying situation for Clinton. In the past few months, she has laid out a series of liberal-leaning policies on everything from student loans to day care to short-termism on Wall Street. (On Tuesday, she outlined her plans for campaign-finance reform.) Once the televised Democratic debates get started, in October, this extensive and detailed platform, together with Clinton’s ability to master complex policy issues, should place her in a strong position. But for all the political good it’s done her so far, she could have spent her time quoting from the Book of Deuteronomy (or Thompson’s favorite, the Book of Revelation). In media coverage of the Clinton campaign, and particularly in broadcast coverage, the e-mail story has overshadowed everything else, and it isn’t going away.","1756","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"On Monday, the Times reported that an intelligence review has concluded that some of the information Clinton received at her personal account was “top secret,” although it wasn’t marked classified at the time. In all probability, there will be more such stories. Indeed, as Labor Day approached, Clinton appeared to be trapped in the same kind of three-sided vice that, over the decades, has crushed many Washington figures. Simultaneously, she had to contend with an F.B.I. investigation into whether classified information was mishandled; a hostile Congressional committee under the control of the opposition party; and a media eager to report any damaging leaks from the authorities. Small wonder that Vice-President Joe Biden was seriously considering a late entry into the Democratic race.","1757","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"All this, and there are still five months until the first primary voter casts a ballot. Before crowning Trump or burying Clinton, it is worth keeping this reality in mind—and a few others, too, such as the fact that early leads in primary races often prove ephemeral. It is certainly possible that Trump will go ahead and win the Republican nomination, but as Larry Sabato and his colleagues at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics said of Trump, in a post at Politico on Monday, “It’s far more likely he will fade long before the primary season does.” Only now is he being subjected to sustained attacks from other Republicans, and, as yet, the media scrutiny of his record has been cursory. For instance, we are still awaiting the first major investigative report into how many undocumented immigrants are employed at the hotels and golf courses that bear Trump’s name. While his bombast has served him well so far, he could yet overreact to criticism and self-destruct.","1758","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"On the Democratic side, Clinton remains highly popular inside her own party, and she has the support of important interest groups that help to mobilize Democratic voters. In the latest national poll of Democrats and voters who lean Democrat, which was released by Monmouth on Tuesday, she was leading Biden by twenty percentage points and Sanders by twenty-two percentage points. Among the electorate at large, Clinton’s favorable rating has fallen well below fifty per cent. But among the Democratic electorate, seventy-one per cent of voters have a favorable view of the former Secretary of State, and just seventeen per cent have an unfavorable view.","1759","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Seeking to solidify her position and change the post-Labor Day media narrative, Clinton on Tuesday apologized for setting up her own e-mail server, telling ABC News’s David Muir, “That was a mistake. I’m sorry about that. I take responsibility.” It remains to be seen what impact, if any, this statement will have on the polls, but many of Clinton’s supporters will welcome the interview as a step in the right direction. “As long as the email mess doesn’t sink her, Clinton could lose both heavily white Iowa and New Hampshire, and still have a fairly unobstructed path to the nomination because of her mighty position with women and minorities,” Sabato and his colleagues wrote on Politico. “This is true even if Vice President Joe Biden enters the race.”","1760","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"I’m not sure whether that final assertion takes account of the possibility of Biden jumping into the race with Elizabeth Warren as his running mate. Last week, a Boston Globe reporter asked Warren whether she and Biden had discussed this possibility during a recent meeting at the Vice-President’s residence. Rather than giving a straight answer, Warren smiled and said merely that the conversation had been a long one.","1761","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"

"In Joe Biden’s political vocabulary, nothing is more important than being “in the deal.” In 2008, when he was weighing whether to accept Barack Obama’s invitation to join the Presidential ticket, his only requirement was a guarantee that he would be “in the deal”—in every meeting that mattered, never unable to reach the President, worthy of inclusion. Once Hillary Clinton began to accumulate the air of a front-runner, logic dictated that the best way for Biden to stay in the deal was to keep alive the prospect of a candidacy, however quixotic it might appear. He played that hand as long as it made sense—and a week or two after it did not. But when the moment passed, Biden made the rarest of choices in Presidential politics today: dignity over ambition.","October 21, 2015","1764","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"In a Rose Garden announcement on Wednesday, with his wife, Jill, and Obama standing beside him, Biden said that he would not run for President. He tried to present a sense of certainty, a look of effortful serenity, but the dominant impression was ambivalence. He couldn’t help frame the choice—a major one, to say the least—in fitful, faintly procedural terms. “I believe we’re out of time,” he said, “the time necessary to mount a winning campaign for the nomination.” Ending the guessing game will insulate him from the perils of a campaign, and reassure the Democratic establishment, but, even as he bowed out, it was clear that he wasn’t quite ready to exit the deal entirely. “While I will not be a candidate, I will not be silent. I intend to speak out clearly and forcefully to influence as much as I can where we stand as a party and where we need to go as a nation,” he said.","1765","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"For Biden, after all, it was a harder choice than it is for most. The Presidency—as an idea, a vocation, a validation—means more to him than it does even to the other politicians who believe it should be theirs. When, as a teen-ager at the University of Delaware, he first met the parents of his future wife, Neilia Hunter, her mother asked what he planned to do for a living. “President,” he said—and added helpfully, “of the United States.”","1766","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"At times in his career, he succeeded in suppressing the urge. In 2008, Obama’s advisers favored Biden for Vice-President in part because they assumed that Biden’s age—he will be seventy-four on Inauguration Day, 2017—would prevent the classic White House intrigue: a No. 2 angling and strategizing around his own desire to be No. 1. Biden gave them reason to believe that; during the 2008 campaign, he told Newsweek that he had said to Obama, “I’m sixty-five, and you’re not going to have to worry about my positioning myself to be president.” (Some in Biden’s closest circle didn’t believe that for a second. One of his longtime friends and aides told me last year, “For six years, I’ve been saying, if you don’t believe that Joe Biden intends to run in 2016, you don’t know Joe Biden.”)","1767","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"Biden was not being dishonest when he told the world, for twelve agonizing weeks, that he was unsure whether to run. In a series of interviews for a Profile in The New Yorker, Biden expressed persuasive misgivings about his age and the strain another campaign would put on his family. But he also made clear that he regarded the decision to run as something more than a political question; it got to the essence of how he envisioned the next phase of his life. He said, “I watched my father. I made a mistake in encouraging him to retire. I just think as long as you think you can do it and you’re physically healthy—” He trailed off.","1768","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"The arguments against his candidacy were impossible to ignore: he has high favorability ratings, and a surge of good will surrounding the death, in May, of his son, Beau, but other numbers were inauspicious. In a recent New Hampshire poll by the Boston Globe, he drew only eleven per cent support—far behind Hillary Clinton, at thirty-seven per cent, and Bernie Sanders, at thirty-five per cent. When CNN asked people, in August, if Biden should enter the race, slightly more than half said he should. But when they asked the question again recently, more people said he should not. Moreover, the theory goes, as an outgoing Vice-President, with a long center-left voting record in the Senate, Biden was poorly positioned to challenge Sanders from the left, and would have been forced to compete with Clinton for mainstream Democratic voters. Had he put temperament and instinct above political calculation, it would have been a preview of his vulnerability as a candidate.","1769","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"After Clinton had established a broad lead, there remained one especially tempting reason to run. Once it became clear that the other Democratic challengers—Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb, and Lincoln Chaffee—were immaterial, Biden faced the once-unimaginable prospect that the next person in line, in the event that Clinton stumbles, was Bernie Sanders, who has been, for most of Joe Biden’s political career, little more than a venerable irritant. Clinton has been having a good month, but the election is thirteen months away. If, for any reason, Clinton is not the Party’s choice, Joe Biden will now have to bear watching Bernie Sanders contend for the job that Biden has wanted for six decades.","1770","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"Biden would have had to begin with no money (and no love for raising it), no staff, and no organization in the states. He would have been equipped with little more than a fervent belief that he could be President and an appetite for politics that is inexhaustible even by Washington standards. The former Senator George Mitchell once told me a story of working the phones with Biden, when they were trying to rally support for a bill in the mid-nineties. “Usually a senator would come to me, the majority leader, and say ‘Well, here’s a problem. Can you get the votes?’ Then they go off to dinner.” But Biden asked Mitchell to join him in calling every Democrat at home, a process that lasted until after two in the morning. “After a while, I was up to No. 8, and he was still on No. 2,” Mitchell said, “I said, ‘Joe, I know you want to explain this thing to these guys, but you’ve to got be a little more concise.’ ”","1771","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"And that is what makes his decision especially memorable. Biden is giving up his last chance at the role that he has always wanted—and a bet that he believes his son Beau wanted him to place. “As my family and I have worked through the grieving process, I’ve said all along…It may very well be that that process, by the time we get through it, closes the window on mounting a realistic campaign for president, that it might close,” Biden said. “I’ve concluded that it has closed.”","1772","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"In 1998, David Mamet, the acclaimed playwright, published a short treatise, “Three Uses of the Knife,” on “the nature and purpose of drama.” The book, based on lectures he delivered the previous year at Columbia University, is well regarded in the theatre world and among screenwriters for its philosophical approach to explaining what makes good drama. But Mamet’s book also offers some shrewd observations on politics and serves as a useful tool for understanding the rise, and potential fall, of Donald Trump.","September 18, 2015","1773","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"On Wednesday evening, during the Republican Presidential debate on CNN, Trump was exposed as ignorant of basic policy details (he was a bystander during the foreign-policy exchanges), boorish (he refused to apologize to Columba Bush for saying that her background influenced Jeb’s allegedly permissive views on undocumented immigrants), and he seemed—no other way to put it—“low energy” as the debate dragged on into its third hour. (As my colleague Amy Davidson put it, “he seemed to be insulting people just to stay awake.”) Political observers then spent the day after the debate ruminating on whether we may be witnessing the beginning of Trump’s decline, and whether his fate will look similar to that of the five Republican candidates—Herman Cain, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum—who all experienced similar polling surges in the 2012 G.O.P. Presidential contest, before Republican voters wised up and picked Mitt Romney.","1774","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Why did Trump’s support shoot up to an average of almost thirty-five per cent in national polls? The (boring) political-science answer is that Trump’s support was a function of his news coverage. His rise correlates perfectly with the amount of attention he received from the media. When voters, most of whom don’t pay close attention to politics, are asked to choose from a long list of names, a third mention the one that they’ve heard in the news most recently or most frequently.","1775","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"But that explanation seems to leave a lot out. Why does the media cover Trump so much? Are voters, especially “the likely voters” who are often polled, really that passive and ignorant? Why did they express increasingly positive views of him, as measured by favorability ratings, as the summer of Trump rolled on? How did Trump seize our attention?","1776","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"He did it by stepping onto the summer stage in a way that none of his rivals did. The other Republican candidates spent 2015 attending to the traditional business of the so-called invisible primary: hiring staff, studying up on policy, building political networks in Iowa and New Hampshire, wooing elected officials whose endorsements might make a difference, and—most of all—courting donors.","1777","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Most of the invisible primary is, well, invisible. Getting inside the rooms in New York and Miami and Dallas and Washington where the transactions of the invisible primary take place is nearly impossible. Sometimes good stories drip out, but they make for terrible TV. Meanwhile, much of the public portion of the invisible primary bores the media. Generally, the policy speeches and town-hall events in the early stages of the campaign are vague and uninteresting, as candidates resist taking firm and detailed positions on controversial topics for fear of opening themselves up to attacks later on.","1778","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"But the political press demands drama. If it is not given a plot, it will create one. As Mamet argues, this is hardly unique to reporters. Humans are hardwired to turn mundane experiences into dramatic ones. “It is in our nature to dramatize,” he writes. “We dramatize the weather, the traffic, and other impersonal phenomena by employing exaggeration, ironic juxtaposition, inversion, projection, all the tools the dramatist uses to create, and the psychoanalyst uses to interpret, emotionally significant phenomena.”","1779","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"A political campaign that is organized around a drama has an immediate advantage over one that is not. Mamet argues, and he’s right, that politics “sticks closer to traditional drama than does The Stage itself. A problem is stated, the play begins, the hero (candidate) offers herself as the protagonist who will find the solution, and the audience gives its attention.”","1780","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Which of the candidates has done that this year? Trump—and, to some extent, Bernie Sanders—has provided a plot and fared well. Trump has identified a clear problem to which many Republican voters respond: America doesn’t “win anymore.” And he has offered a simple solution that only he can provide: Trump “will make America great again.”","1781","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"The fact that the problem and solution are laughably vague is a virtue. Hillary Clinton’s campaign has been forgettable exactly because she has insisted on promoting a myriad of highly specific solutions to very concrete problems before she has laid out the one big problem she wants to solve. (In fact, it’s not so different from how Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign of “hope and change” crushed Clinton’s campaign of policy white papers.) Mamet argues that a politician “who promises drama and then delivers only social concern” rarely excites the public. That’s why it’s “essential to the healthy political campaign that the issues be largely or perhaps totally symbolic—i.e. non-quantifiable.” He recites a long list of slogans from recent American history, to which Trump’s could easily be added: “Peace with Honor, Communists in the State Department, Supply Side Economics, Recapture the Dream, Bring Back the Pride.” The less detail, he argues, the more engaged the audience will be: “A loose abstraction allows audience members to project their own desires onto an essentially featureless goal.”","1782","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Trump realized all of this, and he has had a great first act. But Wednesday night’s debate suggested that he has no plan for a second act. First acts are famously easy to pull off. “It has often been remarked that anyone can write a good first act,” Mamet notes. “When the curtain goes up, we’ve got your attention. So we dramatists don’t have to do anything for a while. Later, either the plot will kick in or the audience will start yawning and eating popcorn.”","1783","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"The struggle of the second act in a political campaign, as in any drama, is that the problem identified at the beginning—the one that seized our attention—must be translated into the more mundane tasks that propel the protagonist toward his or her goal. Won’t even the most committed Trump supporter start to wonder why this self-proclaimed savior hasn’t prepared himself to answer standard policy questions? Will Trump build a staff and campaign infrastructure in Iowa and New Hampshire to handle all the dull mechanics of finding voters and getting them to the polls? Again, Obama’s historic 2008 campaign is a good point of comparison: the vague promise of “hope and change” was married to an enormously sophisticated national operation that tended to the mechanics of winning the delegates needed to capture his party’s nomination.","1784","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Mamet illustrates second-act problems—and their solutions—by pointing to the real-life examples of political actors who actually changed history. The most ambitious and inspirational leaders are also the ones who, after articulating what seemed to be an impossibly lofty goal, soon found themselves mired in the tedious work required to realize it. “In the middle term the high-minded goal has devolved into what seem to be quotidian, mechanical, and ordinary drudgery,” Mamet writes. Trump seems more ill-prepared to bother with the ordinary drudgery of politics than anyone in the race.","1785","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Perhaps Trump can keep the first act going a little longer, but it is far more likely—and the debate made it seem obvious—that he hasn’t a clue how to move beyond the bluster and bromides that initially seized our attention.

"It was an unseasonably warm night in Chicago. On Tuesday, November 4, 2008, nearly a quarter of a million people—young and old, men and women of almost every racial and ethnic background—streamed into Grant Park. The crowd was peaceful and somewhat subdued, filled with a jittery anticipation about how the night would likely unfold. Shortly after 10 P.M. Central Standard Time, television networks announced that Barack Obama had been elected the forty-fourth President of the United States. For a few seconds, the crowd stood still, in a stunned silence. Then, the crowd let out a collective and euphoric scream. There was joy, relief, and disbelief. Tears flowed freely, strangers hugged for several minutes, others knelt and prayed. Senator John McCain’s concession speech put Obama’s election into its historic context by reminding Americans that just a century ago President Theodore Roosevelt had been vilified for inviting Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House. Obama’s victory speech took the high-spirited crowd even higher: “If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.” I called my cousin, who was too filled with emotion and too mystified to complete her thought: “This country . . .

Of course, one cannot compare the moment of an election victory of one candidate to a moment during another candidate’s campaign, a year before the election.

"There are myriad reasons, and Clinton, of course, is not remotely as inspiring a speaker or campaigner as Obama. But another obvious explanation is the persistent problem of gender bias in American culture. Perhaps the sexism—in both overtly hostile and less visible but still insidious ways—has helped stoke the fires of animosity towards Clinton while, at the same time, creating an almost impossible standard for her. Unlike her male opponents, Clinton has to be far more careful and measured in what she says and does. To be free from a strict choreography of words and actions is a form of male privilege that Hillary Clinton cannot access.","1790","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"Authenticity has been a keyword during this election season. And our culture, suffused with sexism, plays the role of the arbiter of a candidate’s authenticity. Clinton must tread lightly: she cannot appear too strong without risking her likability ratings; she cannot appear too vulnerable without her credibility suffering. Herein lies Clinton’s dilemma. The Clinton campaign declared recently that Hillary would show more of what the New York Times called “humor and heart,” so she learned a popular dance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and appeared on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.” Clinton may “play the Granny card” to appear less ambitious and more friendly and family-focussed. It is hard to imagine that a man would have to do the same.","1791","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"On a more visceral level, some Americans still wince at the idea of a woman in the Oval Office. When it comes to sexism in American culture, very little has changed since the 2008 election. Indeed, things may have gotten worse. Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has continued to thrive after making unseemly comments about Fox News host Megyn Kelly and his opponent Carly Fiorina. The conservative political blog RedState maligned Clinton as proof that “even a homely woman can sleep her way into power.” Bill Maher’s suggestions for infusing some spirit into Clinton’s “joyless” campaign were not as vicious, but they were belittling nonetheless: “See if Taylor Swift has room in her girl gang for you. . . . Lick a donut with Ariana Grande. . . . Start a Twitter war with Katy Perry and then delete your tweets.” Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s opponent, summed it up: “I don’t know that a man would be treated the same way that Hillary is.” He added, “Some of it is sexist.”","1792","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"Clinton, who is regularly ribbed for her signature pants suits, has tried to defuse another issue that hounds her—her age. Recall that in 2007, when Hillary had just turned sixty, Matt Drudge printed an A.P. photo of Clinton looking fatigued, and Rush Limbaugh asked his audience, “Will this country want to actually watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis?” On Tuesday, RedState ran a piece titled simply, “Hillary: sick, elderly crook.” Degrading comments about Clinton’s age represent the most unadulterated form of sexism levelled against her. In a culture obsessed with youth, fresh-faced femininity is valued while “older” women (who may be as young as fifty) are made to feel invisible. Tira Harpaz, writing for the blog Feministing, quipped that women “have a sell by date and after that we’re pretty disposable.” In an attempt to get out ahead of the age issue, Hillary joked that she will not go gray in office as most male Presidents do, since she has been coloring her hair for years. Male candidates need not worry about coloring their hair or “growing old gracefully.”(Jeffrey Frank wrote about this today, in the context of Dwight Eisenhower’s reëlection.)","1793","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"Some of the concerns about Clinton are very personal, but even these have an element of sexism in them. Many Americans, for example, feel a pointed disaffection for her. She faces what pundits call a likability problem. Voters perceive her as competent and hardworking, but not warm. A recent series of psychology studies by Princeton professor Susan Fiske showed that women who present traditionally feminine traits (stay-at-home moms, for example) are viewed as warm, but not competent, and are treated dismissively. Women considered less traditionally feminine (including lesbians, athletes, feminists, and working women) are not thought of as warm, but are perceived to be competent, and face a more antagonistic form of sexism. Women, unlike men, are rarely perceived as warm and competent, which, as Fiske explains, puts them in a “catch-22 situation.”","1794","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"So what should Hillary do? This Sunday, on “Face the Nation,” she was asked to offer three words describing herself. She responded, “I mean, look, I am a real person with all the pluses and minuses that go along with being that. And I’ve been in the public eye for so long that I think, you know, it’s like the feature that you see in some magazines sometimes, ‘Real people actually go shopping,’ you know?” She was mocked, but maybe she shouldn’t have been. Perhaps the “real” Hillary Clinton is the woman who said, in a “60 Minutes” interview in 1992, when Gennifer Flowers alleged that she had had a romantic relationship with Bill Clinton, “I’m not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.” Perhaps the “authentic” Hillary Clinton is also the woman who famously snapped, “I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was fulfill my profession.” And maybe the “real” Hillary Clinton also tears up when she talks about her mother’s difficult childhood, her grief over her mother’s death, and her longing to have her mother by her side now. Why can’t she be all those things?","1795","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"And why can’t we be inspired by her? Clinton famously declared “human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights” when she spoke at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing, in 1995. In 1997, as First Lady, she worked with Republicans and Democrats to create the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides health care to more than eight million children and has reduced the number of uninsured children by half. After September 11th, as a New York senator, Clinton helped to secure funding to track the health of first responders, and she has worked to expand health benefits for members of the National Guard, the Reserves, and their families. As Secretary of State, she helped open the United States’ relations with Cuba and negotiate sanctions against Iran. She also oversaw the diplomatic response to the Arab Spring. Clinton has championed children’s causes since she was the First Lady of Arkansas, and she has a long history with the Children’s Defense Fund.","1796","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"Our culture is stubborn; it changes at a glacial pace. If we look at Hillary Clinton from another angle, the enthusiasm gap is less remarkable than we thought. Perhaps it is the expected response to a complex woman who has a long and tangled history in politics. Perhaps the ambivalence toward Hillary Clinton is evidence that we still have a long way to go before we openly accept a woman who spills over the strict parameters and rigid boundaries that our culture constructs. If Hillary Clinton wins, she will become the first woman President, and her victory will be a transformative moment in our nation’s history. There will be tears, hugs, and prayers.","1797","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"I’ve already given my instant verdict on Tuesday night’s Democratic debate: in terms of the horse race, Hillary Clinton was the clear winner, although Bernie Sanders also did pretty well. But it was a long discussion about serious issues, and some of the exchanges bear closer inspection—including the one about Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who is currently languishing in Russia.","October 14, 2015","1798","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"The exchange began with host Anderson Cooper asking Lincoln Chafee, a former governor of Rhode Island, “Governor Chafee: Edward Snowden, is he a traitor or a hero?” Chafee replied that he would bring Snowden home without forcing him to serve any jail time. “The American government was acting illegally,” he continued. “That’s what the federal courts have said; what Snowden did showed that the American government was acting illegally for the Fourth Amendment. So I would bring him home.”","1799","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"Chafee was stating a truth. In May of this year, a three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, ruled that the N.S.A., in routinely collecting the phone records of millions of Americans—an intelligence program that Snowden exposed in 2013—broke the law of the land. The Patriot Act did not authorize the government to gather calling records in bulk, the judges said. “Such expansive development of government repositories of formerly private records would be an unprecedented contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans,” the decision read. The ruling overturned one that had been handed down in December, 2013, in which a federal judge, William Pauley, said that the N.S.A.’s collection of metadata was legal.","1800","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"After Chafee spoke, Cooper turned to Hillary Clinton and asked, “Secretary Clinton, hero or traitor?” Clinton, who earlier in the debate had described herself as “a progressive who likes to get things done,” replied, “He broke the laws of the United States. He could have been a whistle-blower. He could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistle-blower. He could have raised all the issues that he has raised. And I think there would have been a positive response to that.”","1801","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"“Should he do jail time?” Cooper asked, to which Clinton replied, “In addition—in addition, he stole very important information that has unfortunately fallen into a lot of the wrong hands. So I don’t think he should be brought home without facing the music.”","1802","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"From a civil-liberties perspective—and a factual perspective—Clinton’s answers were disturbing enough that they warrant parsing.","1803","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"Did Snowden break the law? In passing classified information to reporters, he did. The Espionage Act explicitly prohibits such actions. But this violation surely needs to be balanced against the public service that Snowden carried out in informing the American public about the extent to which their government had been spying on them. “I think Snowden played a very important role in educating the American people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined,” Bernie Sanders pointed out, immediately after Clinton spoke. “He did—he did break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that. But I think what he did in educating us should be taken into consideration.”","1804","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"Evidently, Clinton disagrees. In saying that Snowden should have invoked “all of the protections of being a whistle-blower,” she was repeating an argument that President Obama has made. But it doesn’t withstand inspection. The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, which provided legal immunity to government employers who reveal lawbreaking, malfeasance, or abuse of authority, doesn’t apply to employees of the intelligence agencies, including contractors like Snowden. These workers are covered by the 1998 Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act; but, as, Michael German, a senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, pointed out, in 2013, “it is no more than a trap.”","1805","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"German explained that the 1998 act set up a procedure for employees of the intelligence agencies to report wrongdoing to Congress via the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General. But the legislation didn’t fully protect whistle-blowers from internal reprisals or subsequent prosecutions. “Reporting internally through the ICWPA only identifies the whistleblowers, leaving them vulnerable to retaliation,” he noted. “The examples of former NSA official Thomas Drake, former House Intelligence Committee staffer Diane Roark and former CIA officer Sabrina De Sousa show [this] too well.” (In 2011, my colleague Jane Mayer wrote a long piece about Drake, who was charged under the Espionage Act.)","1806","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"Finally, what about Clinton’s claim that some of the information Snowden took from the N.S.A. has “fallen into a lot of wrong hands”? The assertion echoed a report, published in June by the Sunday Times, which quoted anonymous officials in the British government who said that Russia and China had decrypted some of the files taken by Snowden, prompting MI6, the U.K.’s foreign-intelligence service, to pull agents out of several countries. At this stage, though, there has been absolutely no confirmation of this allegation, nor even that Russia or China obtained any of the classified material that Snowden accumulated. Snowden has said that he destroyed all of the documents he had in his possession before departing Hong Kong for Moscow. In an article querying the Sunday Times story, the Guardian’s Ewen MacAskill, one of the reporters who worked on the original Snowden revelations, wrote that it may reflect “a cack-handed attempt by some within the British security apparatus to try to take control of the narrative.”","1807","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"That sounds about right, and it’s not clear why Clinton would want to associate herself with such an effort. Moreover, as Glenn Greenwald, another journalist who worked with Snowden, pointed out on Twitter: “It is ironic how Hillary used the same slimy innuendo against Snowden that’s been used for months about her emails.”","1808","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"So what was Clinton up to? Perhaps she is such a pillar of establishment thinking, and of the national-security state, that she really believes what she said. Perhaps she was just using Snowden to burnish her credentials as a hawk and appeal to the American public at large, which is rather less sympathetic to Snowden than most progressives are. (In a recent poll carried out by the digital-media company Morning Consult, fifty-three per cent of respondents said that they would support a government prosecution of Snowden, and just twenty-six per cent said they would oppose such an action.)","1809","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"Ultimately, speculating about motives doesn’t get us very far. The fact is that Clinton said what she said, and she said it unapologetically, just as she did in telling Cooper that she didn’t regret voting for the Patriot Act. At least some Democratic voters—those who take seriously the right to privacy established under the Fourth Amendment—will have been listening.","1810","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"

"With more rumors circulating that Vice-President Joe Biden is about to enter the 2016 race, it’s a good time to take a look at what he might face. A couple of months ago, I suggested that Biden could be a more serious candidate than some people thought. But the obstacles he would face are formidable, and he will have made things even more difficult for himself by not declaring his candidacy prior to last week’s Democratic debate, in Las Vegas. In almost any other country, it would be crazy to suggest that a candidate announcing his candidacy more than a year before Election Day had missed his or her chance. The United States is different, however.","1812","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"In the past decade or two, American Presidential elections have turned into multi-billion-dollar businesses that operate in fifty states, and this imposes certain requirements on the candidates. The obvious one is that they need to raise a lot of money early. The Clinton campaign and groups associated with it have already raised more than a hundred million dollars. Bernie Sanders, who relies largely on small donations, has raised more than forty million dollars. Ultimately, much of this money will go to media companies, in the form of paid advertising. At this stage, however, the main outlays are for building campaign organizations.","1813","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"“You can’t just parachute into a state at the last minute and hope to build a campaign overnight,” Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, told the Times last week. “That’s why we made smart early investments in data, analytics, tech, digital and on-the-ground organizing to build a strong, sturdy campaign designed to fight for and earn every vote in every state.” Biden would have to start from scratch.","1814","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"In appealing to potential staffers, supporters, and donors, he would be able to point to opinion polls suggesting that, currently, he has the backing of somewhere between fifteen per cent and twenty per cent of potential Democratic voters. In late August and early September, as talk of him jumping in got louder, his support rose from the low teens to about twenty per cent, according to the Real Clear Politics poll average. Since then, though, and particularly since the debate in Las Vegas, Biden has dropped back a bit. Three polls that were carried out over the weekend—by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal; ABC News and the Washington Post; and Monmouth University—showed him getting between fifteen per cent and seventeen per cent of the Democratic vote.","1815","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"It isn’t just money and promising poll numbers that Biden lacks. It’s also endorsements in the so-called “invisible primary,” in which the electorate is made up of elected officials and other party notables. From the beginning, the Clinton campaign has made a concerted effort to bring fellow-Democrats onboard. According to an unofficial count kept by The Hill, a hundred and twenty-four senators and congressmen have already endorsed Clinton. The rest of the candidates—from both parties—have sixty endorsements between them.","1816","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"That’s just the disparity on Capitol Hill. Last week, Julián Castro, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, became the second member of President Obama’s cabinet to endorse Clinton. (Tom Vilsack, the Secretary of Agriculture, endorsed her earlier this year.) Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio, is one of the leading Hispanic politicians in the country. On Tuesday, the Clinton campaign announced another raft of endorsements, by more than fifty African-American mayors across the country. “Whether it’s her vision for economic fairness and shared prosperity or her steadfast commitment to comprehensive criminal justice reform—it’s clear that Hillary Clinton is the best candidate to be our next president,” Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, South Carolina, and the president of the African American Mayors Association, said in a statement issued by the Clinton campaign.","1817","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Picking up the most endorsements doesn’t guarantee a candidate victory. Historically, however, it has been a pretty good predictor of the eventual winner.

"Biden is no Obama, of course. He doesn’t have the youth, the excitement factor, or the opportunity to present his potential ascendancy to the Oval Office as a historic turning point. (As a Hillary supporter pointed out to me yesterday, he is, after all, “another old white guy.”) What the Vice-President does have is a wealth of political experience, a reputation for honesty, and relatively high favorability ratings—and not just among Democrats. According to the Huffington Post’s polling average, forty-nine per cent of Americans think favorably of Biden, and 37.1 per cent think unfavorably of him. Clinton, by contrast, has a favorability rating of 42.2 per cent and an unfavorability rating of 51.2 per cent. (Biden also has slightly higher favorability ratings than Obama.)","1819","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"In a general election, Biden’s likability could serve him well. To get that far, though, he’s going to have persuade a lot of Democrats—Clinton and Sanders supporters, especially—to switch to him, and that won’t be easy. There is little in the polling data to suggest that the Democratic electorate is crying out for new candidates to enter the race. Many progressives like Sanders, and Clinton appeals to a broad range of Democrats. In the new Monmouth University poll, seventy-seven per cent of Democratic voters and voters who lean toward the party said that they had a favorable opinion of her. Other surveys report similar findings.","1820","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Campaigns are narratives that occupy mental space in the minds of voters. Right now, Clinton and Sanders are filling most of that mental space, and the plot has been set: insider versus outsider; establishment favorite versus scrappy underdog; first woman in the White House versus first socialist in the White House. The debate in Las Vegas confirmed this narrative. If Biden is going to bust the primary race open, he will need to provide a compelling justification for his candidacy, likely one that goes beyond the personal saga of a decent man and dedicated public servant who is seeking to fulfill the hopes of his dead son—touching and uplifting as that would be. What sort of larger narrative could that be?","1821","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Conceivably, Biden could run as a candidate who can bring together not just Democrats but Americans at large—someone who will fulfill the promise of Obama’s 2008 campaign. At this stage, however, it’s far from clear that voters in the Democrat primary are looking for a unifier. After watching the Republicans frustrate a Democratic President for eight years, many of them may prefer an outsider, like Sanders, or a partisan battler who knows how to overcome political opposition—“a progressive who likes to get things done,” as Clinton describes herself.","1822","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Realistically, Biden’s only option would be to run a populist campaign, portraying himself as a passionate defender of the middle class who will stick up for the little guy. But, of course, Clinton and Sanders are already doing that, so Biden’s pitch would have to be that he’s more authentic than they are—that he’s someone who rides Amtrak, lives modestly, supports labor unions, is skeptical of overseas military engagements, and has an emotional bond to ordinary Americans. Of course, he would also advertise his experience, his service as Vice-President, and his policy platform (whatever that might be). But the main selling point would be the one that Huey Long and other self-made populists have used to great effect: I am one of you.","1823","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"To pull off such a strategy, Biden would have to demonstrate a level of political skill that was largely absent in his previous two Presidential campaigns: in 1988 and 2008. He would also need to explain away some lines on his résumé, such as his support for a 2005 bankruptcy law that Elizabeth Warren and other critics of the financial industry regarded as a sop to credit-card companies. And, even if Biden managed to do all this, he might still need some unintended help from Clinton, or from the F.B.I. agents who are looking into how, as Secretary of State, she and her colleagues handled confidential information.","1824","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"To sum up, the Vice-President is a long shot. In the online betting markets, the odds of him getting the nomination are about four to one, which implies that the probability of him winning is about twenty per cent. After his failure to show up in Las Vegas—a major error if he was seriously intent on running—I’d guess that the real probability is even lower than that.

If your answer is that the United States and ten Pacific Rim countries have agreed on the terms of a new trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you’re half right.

"But there was another significant development, which is connected to the ongoing debate about the T.P.P., and which has received rather less attention. On Sunday, the World Bank announced that this year, for the first time on record, the percentage of the earth’s population that is living in extreme poverty is likely to fall below ten per cent. As recently as 1990, the proportion was more than a third. “This is the best story in the world today—these projections show us that we are the first generation in human history that can end extreme poverty,’’ Jim Yong Kim, the head of the World Bank, said in a statement accompanying the release of the new figures.","1827","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-good-and-bad-news-about-poverty-and-global-trade"
"The transformation certainly is remarkable. Twenty-five years ago, according to the bank, 37.1 per cent of humanity lived below its metric for the global poverty line, which is now roughly $1.90 a day. This year, according to the bank’s new projections, the proportion living in extreme poverty will be 9.6 per cent. To put it another way, since 1990 the number of people in extreme poverty has fallen from close to two billion to about seven hundred million. About 1.3 billion people have been lifted above the poverty line. Even if these figures are off by twenty or thirty per cent, the change would still be extremely significant.","1828","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-good-and-bad-news-about-poverty-and-global-trade"
"It’s worth injecting a note of caution, though. The World Bank and the United Nations have set a goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030, but achieving this target will be very difficult. Today, close to half of all extreme poverty is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, which, despite some recent progress, is still beset by war, disease, and a lack of properly functioning institutions. In addition, it is important not to read too much from the extreme-poverty figures as regards the fight against poverty as a whole. If you are an African, an Asian, or a South American, just because you have edged above the World Bank’s bar doesn’t mean that you aren’t still poor. In the poorest forty per cent of countries, according to the bank’s own figures, about half the population is still in “moderate poverty,” which it defines as existing on less than four dollars a day of income.","1829","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-good-and-bad-news-about-poverty-and-global-trade"
"Furthermore, some of the recent decline in the rate of extreme poverty may be an artifact of how the bank calculates it, which changed recently. In a skeptical piece in the Financial Times, Shawn Donnan explained some of the tricky technical issues, which largely revolve around how to compare prices across countries and across time. Meanwhile, Francisco Ferreira, a senior economist at the World Bank, defended its procedures in a blog post arguing that, whichever numbers are used, the trend in extreme poverty is a downward one.","1830","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-good-and-bad-news-about-poverty-and-global-trade"
"That does seem to be true, and it’s something to celebrate. Above all else, it reflects the entry of China, India, and other developing countries into the global trading system, not merely as sources of raw materials and cheap labor but also, increasingly, as independent players in global capitalism. In industries ranging from steel to autos to energy to solar panels, Chinese and Indian companies are now competing head-to-head with western rivals. The global market that Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote about in 1848 is now largely a reality, with individual countries and corporations vying for the spoils.","1831","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-good-and-bad-news-about-poverty-and-global-trade"
"That’s what trade agreements like the T.P.P. are all about. With a good deal of justification, critics like Bernie Sanders argue that previous deals, such as NAFTA, favored business interests at the expense of workers and the environment. Many progressives argue that the T.P.P. will be another giveaway. Meanwhile, conservative critics such as Donald Trump, with rather less justification, argue that the United States’ trading partners have outsmarted and out-negotiated us. In fact, the known details of the agreement, which include strong guarantees for intellectual-property rights and some binding resolution procedures for cross-border disputes, appear to reflect pretty closely what corporate America wanted, even if some individual interests, such as tobacco producers, aren’t happy about last-minute concessions that U.S. negotiators made in order to get a deal.","1832","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-good-and-bad-news-about-poverty-and-global-trade"
"For the sake of American workers threatened by overseas competition, sick people in poor countries who buy American drugs, and many, many others, it is important to get the details right. But the larger context is also worth bearing in mind. With the remarkable rise of China and India, the global economy’s center of gravity has shifted to the east—and there, despite the problems currently facing China and other developing countries, it is is likely to stay. Not for nothing are the White House and other supporters of the T.P.P. busy promoting it as way of defining some rules for a more Asia-centric world, and also—in traditional mercantile fashion—as a means of checking a rising rival power, in this case China.","1833","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-good-and-bad-news-about-poverty-and-global-trade"
"While the World Bank’s briefing didn’t include poverty figures for individual countries, it did provide regional breakdowns that show the extent of the global transformation that is taking place. In 1990, 60.8 per cent of the population in the East Asia and Pacific region, which includes China, lived below the extreme poverty line. By 2012, that figure had fallen to 7.2 per cent, and this year it will be 4.1 per cent, according to the bank’s projections. For the South Asia region, which includes India, the trend is similar, if a bit less dramatic. In 1990, 50.6 per cent of the population lived in extreme poverty; by 2012 the figure had fallen to 18.8 per cent, and this year it will be 13.5 per cent.","1834","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-good-and-bad-news-about-poverty-and-global-trade"
"One flip side of this transformation, which the bank’s study didn’t linger on, is the rise of sweatshops, Chinese “princelings,” and Indian billionaires. As in Britain and the United States during the nineteenth century, the price of industrial development has been a sharp rise in intranational inequality. How will this play out? Will it eventually produce a populist backlash that threatens the shift toward market economies? Nobody knows.","1835","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-good-and-bad-news-about-poverty-and-global-trade"
"Another aspect of this new global economy, which the bank does acknowledge, is that in many developed countries the poor and near-poor are actually falling further behind. One way to see this is to look at how households in the bottom forty per cent of the income distribution are doing. When the bank’s researchers did this, they found that in seventeen of thirty-six advanced countries, per-capita income in such households has fallen since 1990.","1836","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-good-and-bad-news-about-poverty-and-global-trade"
"That figure doesn’t easily jibe with the upbeat story of mutually reinforcing prosperity that trade economists used to tell. It reflects the reality of a world transformed, with globalization creating winners and losers in a manner that defies easy description. Globalization reduces some inequities, such as the scourge of extreme poverty, while accentuating others, and everywhere it causes political tensions.

"If there is one thing most Americans have been able to agree on over the years, it is that getting an education, particularly a college education, is a key to human betterment and prosperity. The consensus dates back at least to 1636, when the legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony established Harvard College as America’s first institution of higher learning. It extended through the establishment of “land-grant colleges” during and after the Civil War, the passage of the G.I. Bill during the Second World War, the expansion of federal funding for higher education during the Great Society era, and President Obama’s efforts to make college more affordable. Already, the cost of higher education has become a big issue in the 2016 Presidential campaign. Three Democratic candidates—Hillary Clinton, Martin O’Malley, and Bernie Sanders—have offered plans to reform the student-loan program and make college more accessible.","1838","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Promoters of higher education have long emphasized its role in meeting civic needs. The Puritans who established Harvard were concerned about a shortage of clergy; during the Progressive Era, John Dewey insisted that a proper education would make people better citizens, with enlarged moral imaginations. Recently, as wage stagnation and rising inequality have emerged as serious problems, the economic arguments for higher education have come to the fore. “Earning a post-secondary degree or credential is no longer just a pathway to opportunity for a talented few,” the White House Web site states. “Rather, it is a prerequisite for the growing jobs of the new economy.” Commentators and academic economists have claimed that college doesn’t merely help individuals get higher-paying jobs; it raises wages throughout the economy and helps ameliorate rising inequality. In an influential 2008 book, “The Race Between Education and Technology,” the Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz argued that technological progress has dramatically increased the demand for skilled workers, and that, in recent decades, the American educational system has failed to meet the challenge by supplying enough graduates who can carry out the tasks that a high-tech economy requires. “Not so long ago, the American economy grew rapidly and wages grew in tandem, with education playing a large, positive role in both,” they wrote in a subsequent paper. “The challenge now is to revitalize education-based mobility.”","1839","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"The “message from the media, from the business community, and even from many parts of the government has been that a college degree is more important than ever in order to have a good career,” Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at Wharton, notes in his informative and refreshingly skeptical new book, “Will College Pay Off?” (PublicAffairs). “As a result, families feel even more pressure to send their kids to college. This is at a time when more families find those costs to be a serious burden.” During recent decades, tuition and other charges have risen sharply—many colleges charge more than fifty thousand dollars a year in tuition and fees. Even if you factor in the expansion of financial aid, Cappelli reports, “students in the United States pay about four times more than their peers in countries elsewhere.”","1840","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Despite the increasing costs—and the claims about a shortage of college graduates—the number of people attending and graduating from four-year educational institutions keeps going up. In the 2000-01 academic year, American colleges awarded almost 1.3 million bachelor’s degrees. A decade later, the figure had jumped nearly forty per cent, to more than 1.7 million. About seventy per cent of all high-school graduates now go on to college, and half of all Americans between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-four have a college degree. That’s a big change. In 1980, only one in six Americans twenty-five and older were college graduates. Fifty years ago, it was fewer than one in ten. To cater to all the new students, colleges keep expanding and adding courses, many of them vocationally inclined. At Kansas State, undergraduates can major in Bakery Science and Management or Wildlife and Outdoor Enterprise Management. They can minor in Unmanned Aircraft Systems or Pet Food Science. Oklahoma State offers a degree in Fire Protection and Safety Engineering and Technology. At Utica College, you can major in Economic Crime Detection.","1841","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"In the fast-growing for-profit college sector, which now accounts for more than ten per cent of all students, vocational degrees are the norm. DeVry University—which last year taught more than sixty thousand students, at more than seventy-five campuses—offers majors in everything from multimedia design and development to health-care administration. On its Web site, DeVry boasts, “In 2013, 90% of DeVry University associate and bachelor’s degree grads actively seeking employment had careers in their field within six months of graduation.” That sounds impressive—until you notice that the figure includes those graduates who had jobs in their field before graduation. (Many DeVry students are working adults who attend college part-time to further their careers.) Nor is the phrase “in their field” clearly defined. “Would you be okay rolling the dice on a degree in communications based on information like that?” Cappelli writes. He notes that research by the nonprofit National Association of Colleges and Employers found that, in the same year, just 6.5 per cent of graduates with communications degrees were offered jobs in the field. It may be unfair to single out DeVry, which is one of the more reputable for-profit education providers. But the example illustrates Cappelli’s larger point: many of the claims that are made about higher education don’t stand up to scrutiny.","1842","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"“It is certainly true that college has been life changing for most people and a tremendous financial investment for many of them,” Cappelli writes. “It is also true that for some people, it has been financially crippling. . . .The world of college education is different now than it was a generation ago, when many of the people driving policy decisions on education went to college, and the theoretical ideas about why college should pay off do not comport well with the reality.”","1843","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"No idea has had more influence on education policy than the notion that colleges teach their students specific, marketable skills, which they can use to get a good job. Economists refer to this as the “human capital” theory of education, and for the past twenty or thirty years it has gone largely unchallenged. If you’ve completed a two-year associate’s degree, you’ve got more “human capital” than a high-school graduate. And if you’ve completed a four-year bachelor’s degree you’ve got more “human capital” than someone who attended a community college. Once you enter the labor market, the theory says, you will be rewarded with a better job, brighter career prospects, and higher wages.","1844","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"There’s no doubt that college graduates earn more money, on average, than people who don’t have a degree. And for many years the so-called “college wage premium” grew. In 1970, according to a recent study by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, people with a bachelor’s degree earned about sixty thousand dollars a year, on average, and people with a high-school diploma earned about forty-five thousand dollars. Thirty-five years later, in 2005, the average earnings of college graduates had risen to more than seventy thousand dollars, while high-school graduates had seen their earnings fall slightly. (All these figures are inflation-adjusted.) The fact that the college wage premium went up at a time when the supply of graduates was expanding significantly seemed to confirm the Goldin-Katz theory that technological change was creating an ever-increasing demand for workers with a lot of human capital.","1845","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"During the past decade or so, however, a number of things have happened that don’t easily mesh with that theory. If college graduates remain in short supply, their wages should still be rising. But they aren’t. In 2001, according to the Economic Policy Institute*, a liberal think tank in Washington, workers with undergraduate degrees (but not graduate degrees) earned, on average, $30.05 an hour; last year, they earned $29.55 an hour. Other sources show even more dramatic falls. “Between 2001 and 2013, the average wage of workers with a bachelor’s degree declined 10.3 percent, and the average wage of those with an associate’s degree declined 11.1 percent,” the New York Fed reported in its study. Wages have been falling most steeply of all among newly minted college graduates. And jobless rates have been rising. In 2007, 5.5 per cent of college graduates under the age of twenty-five were out of work. Today, the figure is close to nine per cent. If getting a bachelor’s degree is meant to guarantee entry to an arena in which jobs are plentiful and wages rise steadily, the education system has been failing for some time.","1846","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"And, while college graduates are still doing a lot better than nongraduates, some studies show that the earnings gap has stopped growing. The figures need careful parsing. If you lump college graduates in with people with advanced degrees, the picture looks brighter. But almost all the recent gains have gone to folks with graduate degrees. “The four-year-degree premium has remained flat over the past decade,” the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland reported. And one of the main reasons it went up in the first place wasn’t that college graduates were enjoying significantly higher wages. It was that the earnings of nongraduates were falling.","1847","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Many students and their families extend themselves to pay for a college education out of fear of falling into the low-wage economy. That’s perfectly understandable. But how sound an investment is it? One way to figure this out is to treat a college degree like a stock or a bond and compare the cost of obtaining one with the accumulated returns that it generates over the years. (In this case, the returns come in the form of wages over and above those earned by people who don’t hold degrees.) When the research firm PayScale did this a few years ago, it found that the average inflation-adjusted return on a college education is about seven per cent, which is a bit lower than the historical rate of return on the stock market. Cappelli cites this study along with one from the Hamilton Project, a Washington-based research group that came up with a much higher figure—about fifteen per cent—but by assuming, for example, that all college students graduate in four years. (In fact, the four-year graduation rate for full-time, first-degree students is less than forty per cent, and the six-year graduation rate is less than sixty per cent.)","1848","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"These types of studies, and there are lots of them, usually find that the financial benefits of getting a college degree are much larger than the financial costs. But Cappelli points out that for parents and students the average figures may not mean much, because they disguise enormous differences in outcomes from school to school. He cites a survey, carried out by PayScale for Businessweek in 2012, that showed that students who attend M.I.T., Caltech, and Harvey Mudd College enjoy an annual return of more than ten per cent on their “investment.” But the survey also found almost two hundred colleges where students, on average, never fully recouped the costs of their education. “The big news about the payoff from college should be the incredible variation in it across colleges,” Cappelli writes. “Looking at the actual return on the costs of attending college, careful analyses suggest that the payoff from many college programs—as much as one in four—is actually negative. Incredibly, the schools seem to add nothing to the market value of the students.”","1849","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"So what purpose does college really serve for students and employers? Before the human-capital theory became so popular, there was another view of higher education—as, in part, a filter, or screening device, that sorted individuals according to their aptitudes and conveyed this information to businesses and other hiring institutions. By completing a four-year degree, students could signal to potential employers that they had a certain level of cognitive competence and could carry out assigned tasks and work in a group setting. But a college education didn’t necessarily imbue students with specific work skills that employers needed, or make them more productive.","1850","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Kenneth Arrow, one of the giants of twentieth-century economics, came up with this account, and if you take it seriously you can’t assume that it’s always a good thing to persuade more people to go to college. If almost everybody has a college degree, getting one doesn’t differentiate you from the pack. To get the job you want, you might have to go to a fancy (and expensive) college, or get a higher degree. Education turns into an arms race, which primarily benefits the arms manufacturers—in this case, colleges and universities.","1851","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"The screening model isn’t very fashionable these days, partly because it seems perverse to suggest that education doesn’t boost productivity. But there’s quite a bit of evidence that seems to support Arrow’s theory. In recent years, more jobs have come to demand a college degree as an entry requirement, even though the demands of the jobs haven’t changed much. Some nursing positions are on the list, along with jobs for executive secretaries, salespeople, and distribution managers. According to one study, just twenty per cent of executive assistants and insurance-claims clerks have college degrees but more than forty-five per cent of the job openings in the field require one. “This suggests that employers may be relying on a B.A. as a broad recruitment filter that may or may not correspond to specific capabilities needed to do the job,” the study concluded.","1852","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"It is well established that students who go to élite colleges tend to earn more than graduates of less selective institutions. But is this because Harvard and Princeton do a better job of teaching valuable skills than other places, or because employers believe that they get more talented students to begin with? An exercise carried out by Lauren Rivera, of the Kellogg School of Management, at Northwestern, strongly suggests that it’s the latter. Rivera interviewed more than a hundred recruiters from investment banks, law firms, and management consulting firms, and she found that they recruited almost exclusively from the very top-ranked schools, and simply ignored most other applicants. The recruiters didn’t pay much attention to things like grades and majors. “It was not the content of education that elite employers valued but rather its prestige,” Rivera concluded.","1853","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"If higher education serves primarily as a sorting mechanism, that might help explain another disturbing development: the tendency of many college graduates to take jobs that don’t require college degrees. Practically everyone seems to know a well-educated young person who is working in a bar or a mundane clerical job, because he or she can’t find anything better. Doubtless, the Great Recession and its aftermath are partly to blame. But something deeper, and more lasting, also seems to be happening.","1854","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"In the Goldin-Katz view of things, technological progress generates an ever-increasing need for highly educated, highly skilled workers. But, beginning in about 2000, for reasons that are still not fully understood, the pace of job creation in high-paying, highly skilled fields slowed significantly. To demonstrate this, three Canadian economists, Paul Beaudry, David A. Green, and Benjamin M. Sand, divided the U.S. workforce into a hundred occupations, ranked by their average wages, and looked at how employment has changed in each category. Since 2000, the economists showed, the demand for highly educated workers declined, while job growth in low-paying occupations increased strongly. “High-skilled workers have moved down the occupational ladder and have begun to perform jobs traditionally performed by lower-skilled workers,” they concluded, thus “pushing low-skilled workers even further down the occupational ladder.”","1855","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Increasingly, the competition for jobs is taking place in areas of the labor market where college graduates didn’t previously tend to compete. As Beaudry, Green, and Sand put it, “having a B.A. is less about obtaining access to high paying managerial and technology jobs and more about beating out less educated workers for the Barista or clerical job.” Even many graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—the so-called STEM subjects, which receive so much official encouragement—are having a tough time getting the jobs they’d like. Cappelli reports that only about a fifth of recent graduates with STEM degrees got jobs that made use of that training. “The evidence for recent grads suggests clearly that there is no overall shortage of STEM grads,” he writes.","1856","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Why is this happening? The short answer is that nobody knows for sure. One theory is that corporate cost-cutting, having thinned the ranks of workers on the factory floor and in routine office jobs, is now targeting supervisors, managers, and other highly educated people. Another theory is that technological progress, after favoring highly educated workers for a long time, is now turning on them. With rapid advances in processing power, data analysis, voice recognition, and other forms of artificial intelligence, computers can perform tasks that were previously carried out by college graduates, such as analyzing trends, translating foreign-language documents, and filing tax returns. In “The Second Machine Age” (Norton), the M.I.T. professors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee sketch a future where computers will start replacing doctors, lawyers, and many other highly educated professionals. “As digital labor becomes more pervasive, capable, and powerful,” they write, “companies will be increasingly unwilling to pay people wages that they’ll accept, and that will allow them to maintain the standard of living to which they’ve been accustomed.”","1857","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Cappelli stresses the change in corporate hiring patterns. In the old days, Fortune 500 companies such as General Motors, Citigroup, and I.B.M. took on large numbers of college graduates and trained them for a lifetime at the company. But corporations now invest less in education and training, and, instead of promoting someone, or finding someone in the company to fill a specialized role, they tend to hire from outside. Grooming the next generation of leadership is much less of a concern. “What employers want from college graduates now is the same thing they want from applicants who have been out of school for years, and that is job skills and the ability to contribute now,” Cappelli writes. “That change is fundamental, and it is the reason that getting a good job out of college is now such a challenge.”","1858","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Obtaining a vocational degree or certificate is one strategy that many students employ to make themselves attractive to employers, and, on the face of it, this seems sensible. If you’d like to be a radiology technician, shouldn’t you get a B.A. in radiology? If you want to run a bakery, why not apply to Kansas State and sign up for that major in Bakery Science? But narrowly focussed degrees are risky. “If you graduate in a year when gambling is up and the casinos like your casino management degree, you probably have hit it big,” Cappelli writes. “If they aren’t hiring when you graduate, you may be even worse off getting a first job with that degree anywhere else precisely because it was so tuned to that group of employers.” During the dot-com era, enrollment in computer-science and information-technology programs rose sharply. After the bursting of the stock-market bubble, many of these graduates couldn’t find work. “Employers who say that we need more engineers or IT grads are not promising to hire them when they graduate in four years,” Cappelli notes. “Pushing kids into a field like health care because someone believes there is a need there now will not guarantee that they all get jobs and, if they do, that those jobs will be as good as workers in that field have now.”","1859","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"So what’s the solution? Some people believe that online learning will provide a viable low-cost alternative to a live-in college education. Bernie Sanders would get rid of tuition fees at public universities, raising some of the funds with a new tax on financial transactions. Clinton and O’Malley would also expand federal support for state universities, coupling this funding with lower interest rates on student loans and incentives for colleges to hold down costs. Another approach is to direct more students and resources to two-year community colleges and other educational institutions that cost less than four-year colleges. President Obama recently called for all qualified high-school students to be guaranteed a place in community college, and for tuition fees to be eliminated. Such policies would reverse recent history. In a new book, “Learning by Doing: The Real Connection between Innovation, Wages, and Wealth” (Yale), James Bessen, a technology entrepreneur who also teaches at Boston University School of Law, points out that “the policy trend over the last decade has been to starve community colleges in order to feed four-year colleges, especially private research universities.” Some of the discrepancies are glaring. Richard Vedder, who teaches economics at Ohio University, calculated that in 2010 Princeton, which had an endowment of close to fifteen billion dollars, received state and federal benefits equivalent to roughly fifty thousand dollars per student, whereas the nearby College of New Jersey got benefits of just two thousand dollars per student. There are sound reasons for rewarding excellence and sponsoring institutions that do important scientific research. But is a twenty-five-to-one difference in government support really justified?","1860","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Perhaps the strongest argument for caring about higher education is that it can increase social mobility, regardless of whether the human-capital theory or the signalling theory is correct. A recent study by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco showed that children who are born into households in the poorest fifth of the income distribution are six times as likely to reach the top fifth if they graduate from college. Providing access to college for more kids from deprived backgrounds helps nurture talents that might otherwise go to waste, and it’s the right thing to do. (Of course, if college attendance were practically universal, having a degree would send a weaker signal to employers.) But increasing the number of graduates seems unlikely to reverse the over-all decline of high-paying jobs, and it won’t resolve the income-inequality problem, either. As the economist Lawrence Summers and two colleagues showed in a recent simulation, even if we magically summoned up college degrees for a tenth of all the working-age American men who don’t have them—by historical standards, a big boost in college-graduation rates—we’d scarcely change the existing concentration of income at the very top of the earnings distribution, where C.E.O.s and hedge-fund managers live.","1861","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Being more realistic about the role that college degrees play would help families and politicians make better choices. It could also help us appreciate the actual merits of a traditional broad-based education, often called a liberal-arts education, rather than trying to reduce everything to an economic cost-benefit analysis. “To be clear, the idea is not that there will be a big financial payoff to a liberal arts degree,” Cappelli writes. “It is that there is no guarantee of a payoff from very practical, work-based degrees either, yet that is all those degrees promise. For liberal arts, the claim is different and seems more accurate, that it will enrich your life and provide lessons that extend beyond any individual job. There are centuries of experience providing support for that notion.” ♦","1862","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"

That spirit of visibility recurs throughout, in works by emerging talents (Kevin Beasley, Deana Lawson) and in a text piece by Glenn Ligon, an artist so established that his work hangs in the White House. Ligon chronicles every apartment he’s had in New York, from the public housing project in the Bronx where he grew up to a condo on the edge of Tribeca; in the same room, the soundtrack of an installation by Sergei Tcherepnin pounds away like a sonorous jackhammer. Ligon concludes, “The idea of living anywhere else has never occurred to me. Indeed, to live in New York is to have lived everywhere.” In its sprawl—sometimes confused, often stirring—it’s an everywhere that “Greater New York” tries to reflect. ♦","1878","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/a-tale-of-two-cities-art-andrea-k-scott"

"Politico has posted a fifty-one-second compilation video of what it calls “unfortunate comments” by Jeb Bush—“stuff happens,” “free stuff,” “anchor babies,” “I’m not sure we need to spend half a billion dollars for women’s-health issues,” and so on. The implication is that it’s a mystery why a sixty-two-year-old third-generation politician, the grandson of a senator and the son and brother of Presidents (his own son George P. Bush, an office-holder in Texas, is fourth-generation), would be capable of making stupid mistakes in a campaign that he has to have been thinking about for decades.","October 7, 2015","1880","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"All of the unfortunate comments are presumably impolitic, but all of them also seem to reveal what Bush really thinks: mass shootings ought not give rise to gun-control legislation, government payments engender dependency, illegal immigrants have babies so that they can stay in the United States, women’s-health issues (especially birth control!) should not be government’s responsibility. Bush, as an insider, is supposed to know better than to be this candid, especially when he is confronted with the difficult task of persuading a very conservative Republican primary electorate to trust him, while in full view, via the press, of the much more liberal general electorate. Candor is for people like Donald Trump.","1881","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"Jeb Bush seems to be, to descend into New Age lingo, a left-brain politician: rational to a fault. George W. Bush was right-brain: instinctive. Left-brain politicians think about policy. Right-brain politicians think about politics, and about how to connect with people. George W.’s description of himself, in the 2000 campaign, as a “compassionate conservative” was brilliantly vague—liberals heard it as “I’m not all that conservative,” and conservatives heard it as “I’m deeply religious.” It was about him as a person, not a program. Jeb’s slogan, “Right to rise,” is harder-edged, more specific in its implications, less personal, and easier to attack.","1882","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"Jeb Bush has said that he is the most ideologically conservative member of his family, and he’s also known for being fascinated by the details of government. His brother preferred to have issues boiled down into very short memos. He prided himself on decisiveness, not knowledge or intellectual consistency.","1883","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"It may not be so easy for liberals in 2015 to understand why many conservatives regard George W. as a sellout. His sins, in conservatives’ view, included getting the federal government much more involved with local public schools through No Child Left Behind, creating a very expensive new entitlement program in the prescription-drug benefit for senior citizens, and going to war for reasons beyond an immediate need to protect the homeland.","1884","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"Jeb, compared to his brother, seems much more sincerely devoted to the great theoretical cause of American conservatism, limited government. You can sense his impulse to turn each news event to which he must respond into a teachable moment about how government isn’t the solution to every problem. No less than liberals, conservatives feel themselves to be perpetual underdogs, because the other side’s main selling point, the provision of government benefits to people, is far more immediately appealing. Conservatives see themselves as having the challenge of arguing that you really shouldn’t want the goodies the Democrats are offering you. That’s the place where Bush’s unfortunate comment about taking care of you with free stuff seems to come from.","1885","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"For a very long time, Presidential politics have been stuck in a dynamic in which Republicans attack “government” without getting too specific about which of the government’s activities they have in mind, and Democrats defend popular programs but not the over-all idea of the welfare state. Bill Clinton’s typically centrist attempt to address the larger issue was to say, in his second inaugural address, that government was not the problem but neither was it the solution. Who can argue with that?","1886","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"Anyone who has found this situation frustrating ought to be happy with the way this campaign season is going. The legacy of the financial crisis and the rise of Bernie Sanders have pushed Hillary Clinton to be more open about offering government as a corrective to the excesses of the market than either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama has generally been. And Jeb Bush is one of several Republican candidates—one of whom isn’t Trump—to make specific, non-consensus proposals.","1887","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"

"Let’s say you are a diehard Muppets fan with very mixed feelings about the new ABC show “The Muppets.” Maybe you grew up on the Muppets and worry that they are now being cynically marketed back to your demographic with bizarrely adult humor. Maybe you’re not sure whether Kermit would really call Miss Piggy “sexy”—Muppet sex being something you’ve never had to ponder before now. But perhaps you feel ambivalent about condemning such gags, because you don’t want to sound like a prude, and because it’s nice to see the Muppets back on prime-time TV.","October 5, 2015","1897","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"In this case, you may find yourself refraining from criticizing the show by any means necessary, including avoidance of the first-person pronoun (a tactic you learned from Nancy Franklin). You may even distract yourself by deciding which Muppets are which Presidential candidates. (Here goes: Hillary Clinton is Miss Piggy, Joe Biden is Fozzie, Bernie Sanders is Gonzo, Jeb Bush is Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Ben Carson is Rowlf, Marco Rubio is Scooter, Chris Christie is Sweetums, Carly Fiorina is Janice, John Kasich is Sam the Eagle, Rand Paul is Beaker, Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee are Statler and Waldorf, and Donald Trump, obviously, is Animal.)","1898","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"That being done, you have to get down to business. Two episodes of “The Muppets” have aired, but even before that there were signs that this wasn’t your mother’s “Muppet Show.” Over the summer, as part of a cheeky marketing campaign, the “news” broke that Kermit and Miss Piggy had split up, and that Kermit was now seeing a younger pig, Denise. In the pilot, Kermit explains, “What can I tell you? I’m attracted to pigs.” (A future Prime Minister?) (Sorry.) In the same episode, Fozzie talks about his dating foibles: “When your online profile says, ‘Passionate bear looking for love,’ you get a lot of wrong responses.” And Kermit describes his life as “bacon-wrapped hell on Earth.” In the second episode, Zoot draws a penis on a greeting card, and Miss Piggy sleeps with Josh Groban. (Both, thank goodness, are off-camera.)","1899","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"The show is itself bacon-wrapped in a clever premise: Miss Piggy is the host of a late-night talk show, Kermit is her beleaguered producer, and the rest of the Muppets comprise her terrorized staff: sort of a felt “Larry Sanders Show.” The series is shot in the mockumentary style of “The Office” and “Parks and Recreation,” a contemporary spin on the original “Muppet Show,” which mirrored variety television. Also like its predecessor, “The Muppets” makes good use of celebrity cameos—kudos to whoever thought Reza Aslan would have chemistry with Miss Piggy, because (surprise) he did. And, as TV’s only female talk-show host, Miss Piggy is given the status and ambition she deserves.","1900","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"But the off-color humor seems badly misplaced, as if the show’s creators were trying to beat “Crank Yankers” and “Avenue Q” at their own game. With the exception of Gonzo, the Muppets should not work blue. The problem isn’t that the Muppets should appeal solely to children; Muppets humor has always been sophisticated and self-knowing, a “gateway drug to comedy,” as Jason Segel, the ultimate Muppets superfan, put it. The 2011 film “The Muppets,” which Segel wrote with Nick Stoller, nailed the absurdist tone that had eluded the franchise post-Henson: at once antic, self-referential, and heartfelt. Kids could revel in the anarchic (Gonzo as a toilet magnate), while nostalgists could smirk at the jokes that flew over their children’s heads (Animal in anger management). But the funniest bits were funny for everyone—the villain saying the line “Maniacal laugh!” instead of maniacally laughing—because absurdism, done right, cuts through the age gap. This was a lesson that Segel and Stoller took from the “classic” Muppets films, especially “The Great Muppet Caper.” What’s funnier than John Cleese dryly informing his wife of a “pig climbing up the outside of the house”? Or Miss Piggy, stranded on the side of the road, watching a motorcycle fly from the back a moving truck and remarking to the camera, “What an unbelievable coincidence”?","1901","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"Not that the Muppets are strangers to innuendo. Charles Grodin’s lust for Miss Piggy, in “The Great Muppet Caper,” is legitimately steamy—though it’s never implied that they actually have sex. What the new show misjudges isn’t some kind of moral standard but what makes the Muppets funny in the first place. They exist in the rude, recognizable world of adult humans but are too innocent to notice. It’s funny, in a cheap way, to joke about Zoot being in Alcoholics Anonymous. (“It’s not that kind of meeting,” he’s told in the pilot.) But it’s a lot funnier when Fozzie, at a London nightspot in “The Great Muppet Caper,” says of his champagne, “You know, if you put enough sugar in this stuff, it tastes just like ginger ale!” Maybe that’s the recipe for Muppets humor: take champagne and add sugar. Not salt.","1902","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"It’s a testament to Jim Henson and Frank Oz that the Muppets sensibility has been so tricky to get right without them. After Henson died, in 1990, the brand languished for years under various owners, and its reëmergence has been a welcome consequence of our current mania for rebooting. (As the writer Pixie Casey tweeted, “Racist Atticus Finch and Midlife Crisis Kermit are exactly what we deserve for our collective inability to let go of things.”) Scores of think pieces accompanied the Kermit-Piggy breakup, including one on Miss Piggy as a domestic abuser (though most often she used her karate skills to thump bad guys). The Muppets revival has even brought on an academic volume, “Jim Henson and Philosophy,” with entries on “Fraggle Rock and Post-Structuralism” and “The Metaphysics of Muppetationality.”","1903","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"What is Muppetationality, anyway? To me, it’s a haven for eccentricity, where even “whatevers” like Gonzo have a place. And it’s a style of humor that can work on multiple levels, winking differently at the same fans as the decades pass. So, to those who have been given temporary custody of the Muppets legacy, I ask this: dig deeper, handle with care, and keep it PG.","1904","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"Bernie Sanders was eleven years old when Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the war against Nazi Germany, won the Presidency in 1952. Eisenhower was no socialist, despite Sanders’s joke during the recent Democratic Presidential debate, though it’s been pointed out that a long career in the military, which provides cradle-to-grave assistance—for education, housing, and health care—does have its Scandinavian aspects. What continues to distinguish Eisenhower, though, is not the ninety-per-cent marginal tax rate he inherited but his calm disposition in times of crisis and his patient approach to major problems. It was the nation’s good luck that he was born with those qualities.","November 18, 2015","1905","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"
"Eisenhower saw that his tasks, as President, included settling the nerves of his countrymen.

The massacres in Paris have so far brought out the worst in many of them.","1906","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"
"The Eisenhower Presidency represented not only stability but, as the historian Richard Neustadt has pointed out, an unusual decade notable for an “environment of policy and politics marked by a high degree of continuity,” from a Democratic Administration (Harry Truman’s) to Eisenhower’s Republican one. This year’s Presidential election cycle suggests that whatever remains of that stability is at risk.","1907","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"
"You could hear Eisenhower at his best during a televised speech that he delivered on April 5, 1954, one he began by asking his listeners to survey America’s “strength, its problems, its apprehensions, and its future,” before attempting to do that. The talk was soon called the “multiplicity of fears” address (he’d actually used the phrase in a press conference a few weeks earlier) because, above all, Eisenhower wanted to tamp down what he properly sensed was enormous uneasiness in a world that had changed so rapidly in his lifetime. “Thirty-seven years ago tomorrow, our country entered the First World War,” he said; he had been a lieutenant, in Texas, serving with the United States Infantry. “My regiment was armed, as were all other regiments, with the same kind of equipment … as were the regiments that fought the Spanish-American War. Now, only a year ago, the hydrogen bomb was exploded in the Pacific. Last month, another series of tests was undertaken.” He continued, saying that “this transfer of power, this increase of power from a mere musket and a little cannon, all the way to the hydrogen bomb in a single lifetime, is indicative of the things that have happened to us. They rather indicate how far the advances of science have outraced our social consciousness, how much more we have developed scientifically than we are capable of handling emotionally and intellectually.”","1908","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"
"Because it was the height of the Cold War, the President acknowledged that “we are concerned about the men in the Kremlin,” who also had the bomb; he also mentioned the possibility of another economic depression. But what he most wanted people to hear was that “the greater any of these apprehensions, the greater is the need that we look at them clearly, face to face, without fear, like honest, straightforward Americans, so we do not develop the jitters or any other kind of panic, that we do not fall prey to hysterical thinking. Sometimes you feel almost that we can be excused for getting a little bit hysterical, because these dangers come from so many angles, and they are of such different kinds and, no matter what we do, they still seem to exist.”","1909","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"
"The speech seemed to work. Jack Gould, the Times television critic, wrote, “Heretofore his famed smile often has seemed hesitant and forced on TV. Last night it had its old warmth and infectious quality.” The Wall Street Journal, calling the speech “remarkable,” understood that the President’s purpose was “not to emphasize but to put in perspective the multiplicity of fears besetting the United States and the free world.”","1910","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"
"Sixty years later, some lessons seem to have been forgotten. Rather than urging calm in a world with the Islamic State and other dangers, Jeb Bush, who gets advice from Paul Wolfowitz, an architect of his brother’s catastrophic Iraq conflict, is urging the United States to declare war. Hysteria has become the leitmotif of Donald J. Trump, who suggests that we “strongly consider” shutting down mosques because “some of the ideas and some of the hatred, the absolute hatred, is coming from these areas.” Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz talk about clashes of civilizations and the “lunacy” of admitting refugees from the region. Have I left anyone out? Well, let’s not forget Carly Fiorina, who wants to give the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, the silent treatment while exploring her personal brand of brinksmanship: “I would start rebuilding the Sixth Fleet right under his nose, rebuilding the military—the missile-defense program in Poland right under his nose,” she said at the last Republican debate. “I would conduct very aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states.” Hillary Clinton, as is her habit, has been careful, and a little vague, saying, “We have to be rallying our partners and allies, pulling countries off the sidelines,” while not exactly spelling out an American role. And so on.","1911","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"
"The voice of calm so far has come from Barack Obama, attempting, as a President should, to bring perspective to hideous events in a difficult world. He knows as well as anyone, and far more urgently, that the Islamic State must be destroyed. As his reward, his critics become ever more hysterical.","1912","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"
"In November, 1954, Dwight D. Eisenhower was mulling a matter that he mulled with some frequency: the effects of age on someone in a stressful, non-stop job like his. He’d been President for nearly two years and, in his diary, wrote down some of the reasons why seeking a second term might be a bad idea: “The greater likelihood that a man of 70 will break down under a load than a man of 50,” a need for “younger men in positions of the highest responsibility so as to symbolize the youth, vigor and virility of the Republican Party,” and, perhaps above all, the “growing severity and complexity of problems that rest upon the President for solution.” As far as he knew, he was in good shape, but intimations of mortality shadowed him, and he thought a lot about the next political generation. At a White House political dinner a few days before Christmas, he said, “We have got to begin right now, at the state level and at the precinct level, to see to it that the Party puts up the right kind of young man to run in ’56. All the programs in the world, and all the Eisenhower prestige, cannot elect some revolting old Republican hack against a youthful, able, and personable Democrat.”","September 23, 2015","1913","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"Modern readers will note a certain gender bias in phrases like “a man of 70,” “the right kind of young man,” and “virility,” and should know that these somewhat depressed observations came soon after the midterms, in which Democrats took control of the Senate and House, by majorities that the party would keep for decades. Eisenhower’s worries became far more intense several months later, in late September, 1955, when he suffered a major heart attack.","1914","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"This is a roundabout way of getting to the sensitive, impolite subject of when, if ever, a candidate might be too old for the Presidency. It is a question whose premise, in an era when the word “ageism” is embedded in the language, many are inclined to reject, in part because the motives for asking it tend to be suspect. The thuggish wing of the talk-radio community uses the age question to undermine Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, who will be sixty-eight in October. That makes her more than a year younger than Donald Trump, although age is the least of many concerns about him. Age should certainly count a lot less than the goofy ideas and inexperience demonstrated by too many Republicans. But the curious absence of a new political generation should concern Democrats, and a party whose other poll-leading 2016 candidates, declared and not, are Bernie Sanders, who is seventy-four, and Joe Biden, who will be seventy-three in November. (Barely registering in the polls are Jim Webb, who is sixty-nine, and Martin O’Malley, a relative teen at fifty-two.) Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Mike Huckabee are in their early sixties, but, for better or worse, Republicans also have half a dozen contenders in their forties and fifties. The distinct problem for the Democrats isn’t the presence of elders; it’s the absence of young women and men with the potential to be credible national candidates.","1915","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"Apart from Ronald Reagan, who at sixty-nine was the oldest President ever to be elected, Americans have tended to choose younger men for the office. Franklin D. Roosevelt was fifty when he won his first term; John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama were in their forties. Even Eisenhower, grandfatherly affect and all, was only sixty-two when he won the White House for the first time.","1916","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"In the early winter of 1956, as the next Presidential cycle began and Eisenhower recovered from his heart attack, he wrote to his childhood friend Edward E. (Swede) Hazlett to say, “We all know that when advancing years and diminishing energy begin to take their toll, the last one that ever appreciates such a situation is the victim himself.” In another letter, to a doctor who’d recently examined him and thought that he was healthy enough to run again, Ike expressed still more doubts. In “contemplating my own future duty,” he compared his job to that of a quarterback: “He may have all of the wisdom to be derived from years of experience in the game. But when the need arises, he has to throw himself unreservedly into the play…. If we merely needed a brain on the field, a quarterback could play if he had to be in a wheelchair; but that isn’t true in his case, nor is it in the Presidency.”","1917","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"At the end of February, 1956, a month after sending that letter, Eisenhower announced that he would indeed seek a second term, though he planned to let Vice-President Richard Nixon do most of the campaigning. Ike went on to win reëlection in a landslide. But his health was shakier than his doctors were willing to say, and he suffered two more serious medical alarms—ileitis, an intestinal condition, in the summer of 1956, and a minor stroke, in the fall of 1957. In October, 1960, he marked his seventieth birthday, which, until the Reagan era, made him the oldest President ever to serve.","1918","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"The country fifty-five years ago was lucky that it all turned out as it did. It was also another reminder, just ten years after Roosevelt’s death, that choosing a Vice-President is a serious matter. During the 1956 campaign, the Democratic candidate, Adlai Stevenson, made an issue of Eisenhower’s health—and the possibility that Nixon, deeply hated by Democrats, might become President. Democrats, without a successor generation in clear view, may get lucky in 2016, especially facing a Republican field whose contenders include people who say, inexplicably, as they did in last week’s debate, that George W. Bush left the country safer (Jeb Bush), or that vaccines may cause autism (Trump), or that it’s worth shutting down the government to defund Planned Parenthood (Ted Cruz, Chris Christie). Sixty years ago, Eisenhower was willing to consider the nation’s welfare ahead of personal ambition. That was an impulse rarely glimpsed in last week’s Republican debate.","1919","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"When Jeb Bush launched his campaign for President, in June, most of the attention paid to his political branding focussed on his folksy logo, which featured his first name alone, in Target red, followed by an exclamation point. But, at the same time, Bush also débuted his campaign’s hashtag, #AllInForJeb, which serves as his digital message, rallying cry, and women’s vintage-T-shirt slogan. With it, Bush, the former governor of Florida, was asking his volunteers to go “all in” in support of his candidacy, and suggesting by association that, in contrast with his previous flirtations with running for the White House, he would be fully engaged with the task this time, too.","September 7, 2015","1920","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"In American usage, the phrase “all in” began as a colloquial expression meaning to be in a bad spot—exhausted, worn out, and spent. In the game of poker, it refers to the moment when a player—whether out of bravado, recklessness, or desperation—bets all of his or her chips on a single hand. Thanks to the Texas Hold’em craze of the nineteen-nineties and two thousands, and the public’s appetite for new forms of dramatic hyperbole, the poker version of the phrase crossed over to general use and, along the way, became denuded to the point of near meaninglessness. Whereas “all in” once referred to a scenario in which someone either wins a hand or loses everything in a flash, now it means that a person is simply generally enthusiastic or fully committed. It’s everywhere these days—business jargon, marketing catch phrases, sports mantras, and the idioms of religion and self-help.","1921","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"The all-in moment in poker is a thrilling win-or-lose-everything crisis of dramatic clarity: you’ve wagered all you’ve got, giving your fate over to the cards, and you can’t go back out again. Going all in is often a spectacularly bad idea. But in life, it seems, it is all good—the only way to live boldly is to be all in on many different things at once.","1922","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"“All in” has become especially popular in the language of politics. It’s the title of Chris Hayes’s talk show on MSNBC and Paula Broadwell’s ill-fated biography of David Petraeus, the former director of the C.I.A. The phrase gets tossed into headlines every time a politician decides to try to do something. In just the past year, President Obama has been said to have been all in on free trade, climate change, and criminal-justice reform. In April, the Washington Post reported that Hillary Clinton had gone “all-in on gay marriage.” In May, Clinton was, according to MSNBC, going “all in on immigration reform.” In July, Fusion said that Bernie Sanders was going “all-in on the $15 minimum wage.” A few weeks ago, Salon argued that Donald Trump had gone “all in on right’s latest insanity.” More recently, NBC News announced that Jeb Bush, true to his hashtag promise, was planning to go “all in against Donald Trump.” In Iowa, Bush was asked by a reporter if he really was all in on the caucuses there.

Modern politicians have not, all of a sudden and all at once, become incredible risk-takers—betting their entire legacies or campaigns on a particular issue or strategy. It’s difficult to think of any moment in history when a politician has actually gone all in. (Though it’s probably safe to say that Abraham Lincoln went all in on restoring the Union.) If Hillary Clinton’s policy on immigration or Bernie Sanders’s support of a higher minimum wage turn out to be unpopular with voters, they won’t suddenly have to quit the race. Jeb Bush won’t drop out if he loses in Iowa. And the stakes of the election for Bush are several notches below his campaign’s rhetoric. If he loses, he’ll go back to sitting on corporate boards and being the son of one President and the brother of another.","1924","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"Many of poker’s words and phrases are tinged with a kind of roguish romance and drama that we hope may rub off on the more mundane activities of normal life—upping the ante, stacking the deck, calling a bluff, putting your cards on the table. In terms of politics, there is an obvious benefit, for both elected officials and the people who cover them, in making the business of government sound more dangerous or dashing than it really is—riskier and more headless, more heroic, more “mavericky.” Politicians become prizefighters or gunslingers or gamblers; elections are fights or showdowns or high-stakes card games. “All in” makes every event sound like a decisive, dramatic turning point that provides instant, unambiguous resolution. But politics isn’t really like a poker game. And neither is life. As a phrase, “all in” is troublesome because it is almost always just an exaggeration, if not an outright falsehood. The free-climber Alex Honnold goes all in when he climbs vertical rock faces without a rope. Jeb Bush and the rest of us are doing something else.","1925","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"In poker, being all in is a lonely place to be. But elsewhere, “all in” is used to evoke inclusiveness and community, as in, “we’re all in this together.” In 2006, when Alex Rodriguez wanted to assure Yankees fans that the team was serious about winning, he said, “To use a poker term, we’re all in. This is the most urgent we’ve been. It’s going to be exciting.” (The Yanks didn’t win the World Series that season, but the players still got paid and weren’t compelled to retire.) The phrase was still unusual enough that Rodriguez felt the need to offer a bit of context. By now, it has joined the ignoble ranks of the sports cliché. Last spring, as the Cleveland Cavaliers began their playoff run in the N.B.A., fans were exhorted to go all in for LeBron James and their home-town team, which in turn would go all in for them. Cleveland was a family, drawn together and dreaming big. Let’s hope that there weren’t many gamblers in Cleveland who took the suggestion seriously and bet the farm on the Cavs in the Finals. They lost in six games to the Golden State Warriors.","1926","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"For Bush, #AllInForJeb suggests that same idea of community, of people coming together for a common purpose. But, right now, it appears that Bush is all in all by himself. As he languishes in single digits among the Republican field following a few months of tepid campaigning, it is difficult to picture some young volunteer out there putting everything on the line to help elect the third member of the Bush family to the White House. As the Times put it in a recent editorial, “Mr. Bush has been angering to many, boring to many others, inspiring to none.” It is hard to think of a candidate who is, at this point, less in than Jeb Bush. If the trouble continues, he might need to take courage from his campaign hashtag, and really try something desperate.","1927","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"In nineteen-forties Mississippi, William Daniels, an employee of the United Novelty Company, was cleaning a piece of his employer’s machinery. Daniels was using gasoline as a cleaning agent even though the company had repeatedly told its employees not to clean with gasoline. As he cleaned, the gasoline leaked through the machine and soaked a rat hiding underneath it. The rat ran under another machine for cover—a gas heater. The gas heater’s open flame lit the rat’s gasoline-soaked coat on fire, sending the flaming rat scrambling back toward the machine that Daniels was cleaning. Another drop of gasoline may have fallen on the rat. The resulting explosion killed them both. Daniels was nineteen.","September 28, 2015","1928","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"Daniels’s estate sued the United Novelty Company for wrongful death. In 1949, the Supreme Court of Mississippi upheld a jury’s finding that the company was liable for his death. The court suggested that the company’s repeated warnings against cleaning with gasoline proved that the company knew that its employees were using gasoline to clean its machinery and that it was dangerous. The company hadn’t presented any evidence that Daniels himself had heard the warnings against using gasoline, but this was beside the point—it was the company’s responsibility, not the nineteen-year-old’s, to make sure its employees were not blown up while they worked.","1929","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"On Sunday morning in Winsted, Connecticut, the American Museum of Tort Law, which features a Flaming Rat Case exhibit, officially opened its doors. In the gift shop, a T-shirt with a drawing of the flammable rat was selling briskly, especially compared to the thousand-two-hundred-and-seventy-six-page author-autographed tort-law textbook “Prosser, Wade, and Schwartz’s Torts,” which sat a few feet away. Quiet confusion was in the air around the entrance to the museum—“What the heck is a tort?” a man whispered to his wife as they walked in. She wasn’t sure. Luckily, the museum made it clear: a tort is any wrongful act that can be the basis for a civil lawsuit. For example, if you punch the mailman, the county prosecutor can charge you with the crime of assault and the mailman can sue you for the tort of battery. The law looks at the same punch in two different ways.","1930","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"Tort law is essentially the law of personal injury, and the museum’s mission is to restore the idea that personal-injury law is not a way to line the pockets of a few lucky lawyers but rather a way to hold the powerful to account. (The most popular exhibit was dedicated to explaining the McDonald’s hot-coffee lawsuit.) As presented by the museum, personal-injury law may be the only way to hold a corporation accountable to the people it has harmed.","1931","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"Sometimes, even a good lawsuit isn’t powerful enough. Walking through the museum on Sunday was its director, Richard L. Newman, a former personal-injury lawyer who was barred from discussing the case that he said was the signature achievement of his career. “I can’t say anything about that case because the settlement has one of those damned confidentiality agreements,” Newman said. “As a lawyer, you’re torn between getting your client fair compensation and knowing that there are dangerous products out there injuring people.” He reflected for a moment. “You know, people don’t see the benefits of tort law. Their cars are safer. Their foods are safer. They just live in an improved world.”","1932","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"A few feet away stood thirteen-year-old Alexis Smith. She sported blue hair, a nose ring, a lip ring, and a hat with “#BITEME” printed across its cuff. “It’s boring,” she said, before her mother chastened her. Ralph Nader stood on the museum’s front steps, slightly hunched over, smiling and eagerly greeting guests. “Better a fence at the top of the mountain than an ambulance at the bottom of the valley,” he’d said the day before at a museum event, summing up its ethos. The event had been in the church next door to the museum. At the entrance to the church stood a woman pointing out a slight decline in the flooring. “Watch this slope!” she told guests, occasionally chuckling while keeping the museum free from slip-and-fall liability, i.e., liability for the tort of negligence.","1933","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"Nader, who is now eighty-one, conceived of the museum in 1998 and spent the next seventeen years raising money for it. “The hardest part of raising the money was getting people to return my calls,” he said. (Nader relishes creating the impression that his phone hasn’t rung since a few minutes after George W. Bush was declared the winner of the 2000 election. On Bernie Sanders, he said, “He hasn’t returned my call in fifteen years.” In April, he published a book entitled “Return to Sender: Unanswered Letters to the President, 2001-2015.”)","1934","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"Nader continued, “There are thirty-five thousand museums in the United States and not one museum dedicated to law. There are timber and lumber museums.” He shook his head. “There are museums for every fruit and vegetable!” The Museum of American Tort Law itself lies in a prodigious tract of museums. Northwest Connecticut is home to, among many others, the Lock Museum of America, the American Clock & Watch Museum, the New England Carousel Museum, and the Vintage Radio & Communications Museum of Connecticut. The state has four different railroad museums, not including its trolley museums.","1935","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"Winsted, Connecticut, is Nader’s home town. As he stood in front of his museum, he pointed out a creek that runs through nearby woods. “That’s the Mad River,” he said of the trickling creek. “In 1955, it destroyed half the town in twenty minutes. It took the buildings on Main Street and a car dealership. My mother got the Army Corps of Engineers to build a dam so it would never happen again. When Prescott Bush,” George W. Bush’s grandfather and a U.S. senator for Connecticut, “came to campaign in Winsted in 1955, he shook my mother’s hand. She wouldn’t let it go until he promised to build the dam.”","1936","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"Nader’s consumer-protection advocacy is the lifeblood of the museum. In the center of the museum sits a cherry-red Chevrolet Corvair, the car Nader disgraced in his 1965 book “Unsafe at Any Speed.” General Motors responded by trying to uncover and publicize his embarrassing secrets, allegedly going so far as to send a woman to seduce him. (He then sued the company for the tort of invasion of privacy and, as part of the settlement, made the President of G.M. publicly apologize.) An exhibit in front of the Corvair includes a cartoon of the attempted seduction: Nader pushes a shopping cart through a supermarket as a blond woman in a tight dress winks at him. Nader, whose only earthly pleasures are apparently a comfortable pair of shoes and a sense of righteous indignation, responds with a look of suspicion. A question mark, illustrating his distrust, is drawn above his head.","1937","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"In an unfortunate irony for the museum, its building is located directly across the street from the local ambulance service and its fleet of ambulances. But during the opening, a group of E.M.T.s walked across the street with a copy of their training textbook for Mr. Nader to sign. “Why does a car door not fly open in a crash?” one paragraph begins. “The answer is the Nader pin (named for Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate who lobbied for the device), a case-hardened pin in an automobile door. In a collision, the cams in the door locks grasp the pin to keep the door from flying open, preventing occupants from being thrown from the vehicle. All cars sold in the United States since 1966 have the Nader pin.” He signed his name next to this paragraph and requested a copy for the museum.","1938","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"At the museum’s convocation, held at the local high school the day before, some seven hundred and fifty reasonable New Englanders (and a group of Chinese high-school exchange students, whom Nader briefly addressed in Chinese) squeezed into the auditorium to hear Nader rail against corporate America’s sustained attack on tort law, which came to the fore with the tort-reform movement in the nineties. The timing felt right; personal-injury lawyers have long been supplanted at the top of America’s list of public enemies by terrorists, profligate mortgage lenders, the stubborn Congress, Wall Street, and, most recently, the police.","1939","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"Some of the attendees had also come to hear Patti Smith, who performed two songs. Nader introduced her as the greatest living artist in America. “She won the National Book Award! That’s like winning The World Series,” he said. Bashfully, she put her face in her hands and shook her head.","1940","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"After her performance, Smith explained her connection to Nader: “I learned about Ralph Nader when I was quite young, from my father. He was a strong advocate of Ralph Nader and voted for him every election. He wrote him in. He said Ralph was the man he most trusted in America. My father died in 1999, and shortly after he died I got a call from Mr. Nader’s office asking if I would participate in a rally at Madison Square Garden. It seemed like the most beautiful way to honor my father. After that, I understood why Ralph Nader meant so much to him. Every time I hear him speak, I leave uplifted and inspired. I leave with more tools for conducting myself in the world.”","1941","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"Smith paused. “When I was campaigning with him, we were in upstate New York. We stopped in a town and there were maybe eighteen people there. It was freezing cold, and we were in a little brick building. He stood there with his overcoat on and spoke to the people with the same vigor and indignation as he did at Madison Square Garden.” This indifference to the size of the crowd might come in handy with the American Museum of Tort Law. “For him, there are no small audiences,” she added.","1942","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"Inside the museum, Nader personally escorted bewildered townspeople through the exhibits. He stopped in front of the McDonald’s Coffee Cup Case exhibit. “The lawyers didn’t tell people that McDonald’s kept their coffee that hot for commercial advantage. So it would stay hotter than Burger King’s as you drove along the highway. They’d already gotten seven hundred complaints about the burns.” Nader shook his head and looked at his guest, who nodded. He had changed one mind. He seemed satisfied.","1943","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ralph-naders-tort-museum"
"The contrast couldn’t have been more stark. On Friday, as Hillary Clinton was basking in the reaction to her marathon appearance before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, her communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, told reporters that the hour between nine and ten o’clock on Thursday night, after the hearing finally finished, was the campaign’s best fund-raising hour yet. And also on Friday, A.F.S.C.M.E., the largest public-sector union in the country, announced that it was endorsing Clinton for the Presidency—an important win in her tussle with Senator Bernie Sanders for the backing of organized labor.","October 25, 2015","1944","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Meanwhile, the campaign of the supposed Republican front-runner, Jeb Bush, was letting it be known that it was laying off people and slashing its payroll by forty per cent. It’s well known that the Bush campaign has been spending heavily, and there have been persistent rumors that, with the candidate trailing badly in the polls, its fund-raising efforts had stalled. Evidently, these rumors were accurate. Seeking to put a positive spin on things, the Bush campaign portrayed the cost-cutting as an effort to play the long game and direct resources toward the early primary states—Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. “This is about winning the race,” a Bush adviser told Bloomberg Politics. “We’re doing it now and making the shifts with confidence. We expect to win.”","1945","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Campaign advisers have to make such statements. But many people in the G.O.P. are losing confidence in Bush. A new poll from Iowa, which was released on Thursday, showed the former Florida governor garnering just five per cent of the votes among likely Republican voters. Perhaps the poll, from Quinnipiac University, was an outlier? No, it wasn’t. On Friday, another Iowa survey, this one carried out by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics, also showed Bush at just five per cent. “By any honest analysis, the first ten months of this year have been a political disaster,” a senior Republican told the Times, adding that it was “an unbelievable position to be twisted into, from ‘shock and awe’ to ‘aw, shucks.’ ”","1946","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"

"The obvious answer is that Bush has had Donald Trump to deal with, and Clinton hasn’t. In virtually monopolizing media coverage and subjecting Bush to months of public criticism, the New York billionaire has transformed the dynamics of the G.O.P. race in a way that almost nobody anticipated—a point the managers of the Bush campaign acknowledged in an internal memo announcing the cost cuts. “We would be less than forthcoming if we said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer health care and partial-birth abortion would be leading the G.O.P. primary,” the memo said.","1948","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"With Bush’s campaign having been outpaced in such outrageous fashion, it is hard not to feel a little sympathy for him. However, his problems can’t be entirely attributed to the Donald. According to the Real Clear Politics poll average, he’s also running behind Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz, and nationwide he has the support of just 7.2 per cent of likely Republican voters. For a candidate whose main selling point was supposed to be his electability, these are terrible numbers. On the Democratic side, Clinton, even at the height of concerns about her e-mail server, maintained a healthy lead in the national polls.","1949","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"In part, Bush’s weak numbers reflect the fact he has run a weak campaign—one dogged by his tendency to mangle the English language, or, at least, to use it carelessly. In his first big speech, back in February, he confused Iran with Iraq and got mixed up about how many fighters the Islamic State has. Since then, the list of phrases he has been forced to clarify or disavow is long and embarrassing: “People need to work longer hours”; “I’m not sure we need half a billion dollars on women’s health-care issues”; “anchor babies”; “stuff happens.” On the basis of what we’ve seen so far, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Bush simply isn’t a good communicator. Indeed, he often appears to be a terrible one. Asked on Saturday whether his campaign’s cost-cutting showed it was in crisis, he said, “Blah, blah, blah. That’s my answer: blah, blah, blah.”","1950","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"If Bush were wowing the world with innovative and substantive policy proposals, his verbal shortcomings could perhaps be overlooked. But he isn’t. His tax-cutting economic plan, which he claims will increase G.D.P. growth to four per cent a year, is largely based on wishful thinking. His foreign-policy speeches are so vague that they’re hard to evaluate. On social issues, such as guns and abortion, he has said little to distinguish himself from the G.O.P. pack. In 2000, his brother George ran on the platform of “compassionate Conservatism,” which was his way of distinguishing himself from Newt Gingrich and other Republican bomb throwers. Jeb’s only memorable slogan is “Jeb!”","1951","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Clinton, on the other hand, has made it clear that she is running as a progressive candidate; in the first Democratic debate, she defined herself as “a progressive who believes in getting things done.” To back up this talk, she has rolled out a series of proposals, including paid sick leave, expanded child care for preschoolers, a higher minimum wage, tax breaks for firms that promote employee share ownership, and a series of measures designed to make college more affordable. None of the things she has proposed is particularly radical, but taken together they amount to a concerted effort to tackle wage stagnation and boost the middle class.","1952","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Bush has nothing comparable to offer. And, even if he improved as a communicator and Trump dropped out of the race, there would be no assurance that he would win the nomination. Indeed, it now appears possible that his entire campaign is based on two false premises.","1953","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The first is that Republican voters want a shift to the center. The one area where Bush has issued a proposal that separates him from other Republican candidates is immigration. To his credit, he has stuck to the position that law-abiding undocumented immigrants should be given the opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship. About all that has done is win him the enmity of conservative pundits and talk-show hosts, who accuse him of promoting an “amnesty.” On this issue, most Republican voters agree with Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Polls consistently show that a majority favor the mass deportation of undocumented aliens—an issue Trump has built his candidacy on.","1954","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The second shaky premise is the notion that Republicans are keen on restoring the Bush dynasty. From the beginning, this seemed like a dubious proposition: never in its history has America had three Presidents from the same family. When Jeb entered the race, G.O.P. supporters were being asked to embrace the possibility of three Bush Presidents in thirty years.","1955","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"In its eagerness to promote someone it considered electable, the G.O.P. establishment sought to play down the dynastic aspect of Bush’s candidacy, portraying Jeb as very different from his elder brother: more thoughtful, more conservative, more articulate. Despite these efforts, no groundswell of support emerged for a Bush restoration. Indeed, it now appears that Barbara Bush, Jeb’s mother, spoke for many Republicans when she said, in April, 2013, “There are other people out there that are very qualified, and we’ve had enough Bushes.”","1956","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The Clinton campaign raises dynastic issues of its own, but there are important differences. As evidenced by the Adams, the Harrisons, and the Roosevelts, the idea of having two Presidents from the same family isn’t alien to the American tradition (even though the Roosevelts were only fifth cousins). And, in serving as a U.S. senator and as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has established credentials independent of her husband’s time in office. At the same time, it’s also important to note that Bill Clinton’s Presidency is far more popular among Democrats than George W. Bush’s Presidency is among Republicans. Some left-leaning Democrats may regard Bill Clinton’s Administration as a neo-liberal sellout, but most associate it with peace, prosperity, and the ability to outlast Republican attacks.","1957","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Even among Republicans, the last Bush Presidency inspires few fond feelings. It ended with the economy in recession, and with the U.S. military trapped in two costly and unwinnable-seeming wars. For a time, Jeb and his establishment backers pretended they could sustain a 2016 campaign that ignored this toxic legacy, but, once Trump entered the race, the strategy proved unsustainable. In portraying the Iraq war as a disaster and repeatedly tying Jeb to his elder brother, Trump forced Republicans to confront the question of why anybody would think that putting another Bush in the White House was a good idea.","1958","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"There are still more than three months to go before the G.O.P. Iowa caucus, but, if Bush is going to reëmerge as the front-runner, he’ll have to do a much better job of answering Trump’s charges. He’ll get his first opportunity this week, at the Republican debate in Boulder, Colorado. When the pressure was on these past two weeks, at the first Democratic debate and then at the Benghazi hearing, Clinton rose to the occasion and gave her campaign a huge boost. Now it’s Bush’s turn. “Jeb really needs a knockout performance—it needs to be all him, with nobody even close,” a New Hampshire Republican told Politico. “Otherwise those fumes he’s on are going to evaporate even quicker.”","1959","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The moment Hillary Clinton seemed to realize that her testimony Thursday before the House Select Committee on Benghazi was not going to be a big problem for her or for her campaign came about forty-five minutes in. When the hearing opened, she had regarded the chairman, Trey Gowdy, of South Carolina, with irritated skepticism. She looked as if she might say something rash, if not throw something, and perhaps she might have. Nearly three years ago, in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Benghazi, she lashed out after having been asked many times about U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice’s comments on the Sunday talk shows about what had instigated the attack, on September 11, 2012, in which four Americans, including Chris Stevens, the Ambassador to Libya, died. “What difference, at this point, does it make?” Clinton demanded. Out of context, she sounded unmoved by the men’s deaths. Now, in the House hearing, it seemed to dawn on her that the proper response to her Republican interrogators was not outrage but pity.","1960","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"Peter Roskam, of Illinois, was laying out a scenario in which Clinton’s assumption of a leadership role on Libyan policy “didn’t come easy,” when he stopped and said, in case he might be overwhelming her, “I can pause while you’re reading your notes from your staff.” Clinton replied, “I can do more than one thing at a time, Congressman—thanks.” A minute or two later, Roskam said, “Go ahead and read the note if you need to.” This time, Clinton laughed. “I’m not done with my question,” Roskam said; he was just doing her a “courtesy.” “That’s all right,” Clinton responded, with a friendly wave of her hand. From then on, she was in control. “I’m sorry that doesn’t fit your narrative, Congressman. I can only tell you what the facts are,” she told Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who is the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. As he spoke, she rested her chin on the palm of one hand, as if he were not much more than a loud boor at a party who, puzzlingly, doesn’t seem to know how he sounds. When Lynn Westmoreland, of Georgia, informed her that he spoke slowly, Clinton laughed again and said, “I lived in Arkansas a long time. I don’t need an interpreter.”","1961","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"But in one sense she did need interpreters, and she got them. There was plenty of combat in the course of the hearings, but on Clinton’s side it was waged, for the most part, by the Democrats on the panel, who served as her anger translators. Elijah Cummings, of Maryland, repeatedly called out his Republican counterparts on conspiracy theories mooted and on inaccurate statements made, such as the charge that Clinton had personally turned down requests from Ambassador Stevens for more security. (“Four Pinocchios!”) Cummings, in his opening statement, asked why the committee existed at all. The answer that he suggested—“to drive down Secretary Clinton’s poll numbers”—seems almost a truism by now; indeed, it has been confirmed by a number of prominent Republicans in less guarded moments.","1962","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"There have now been seven full investigations of the circumstances surrounding the Benghazi attack, five in the House and two in the Senate. The Tampa Bay Times’s PolitiFact Web site noted recently that it was largely accurate to say that all the investigations found things that could have been done better (such as intelligence sharing) but none found “overt wrongdoing.” (Meanwhile, the Obama Administration’s larger Libya policy and its real failures have hardly been discussed.) Gowdy, whose defensiveness was palpable, said that his committee was better than the others: he has found more e-mails and more witnesses, even though they have led farther away from the burning compound in Benghazi.","1963","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"One such witness was Sidney Blumenthal, the writer and longtime Clinton friend. (He has worked for the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation and, in the nineteen-nineties, for The New Yorker.) Blumenthal sent Clinton a number of e-mails about Libya, some of which she passed on to others in the State Department. As a result, he was questioned by the committee, in a closed hearing, for almost nine hours, despite having no real knowledge of what unfolded in Benghazi; his name has become one that Clinton’s opponents obsessively allude to. “I honestly don’t understand this fixation,” Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, said.","1964","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"Gowdy’s rationale was essentially that the people in the State Department might have been as distracted by Blumenthal as he apparently is, and in a way that harmed national security. “It’s relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal’s drivel,” he said. (Gowdy was also bothered by the fact that one of Clinton’s aides, Huma Abedin, had sent her an e-mail about milk.) There is plenty to debate in Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server and the potentially overlapping interests of the State Department and the Clinton Foundation without lapsing into that sort of illogic. Any Americans who are not yet tired of hearing about Clinton’s e-mails may finally have had their fill.

"During this hearing, Clinton did convey that she saw Ambassador Stevens and the other Americans who died—Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty—as human beings. She spoke about sleepless nights spent worrying about diplomats’ safety and “racking my brain about what more could have been done.” Gowdy, speaking next, used his time to rail against Schiff, who, several minutes earlier, had called the hearing a “prosecution.” At one point, the proceedings turned into a shouting match between Gowdy and Cummings. Clinton straightened the papers on the table in front of her, pausing occasionally to contemplate Gowdy or to smile at Cummings. There were several more rounds of questions, in which her interrogators manifested all of Washington’s pathologies—dysfunction, partisan squabbling, insularity—in such extreme form that Clinton came across not only as a grownup, as her supporters had hoped, but as the most normal person in the room.","1966","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"Clinton has been immersed in politics for decades, and yet the panel managed to make the contrast between her manner and the ways of Washington look stark. She appeared to be a sensible outsider. At 7:15 P.M., nine hours after the hearings began, Martha Roby, of Alabama, asked Clinton about her movements when she went home on the night of the attack. “Were you alone?” she asked. Yes, Clinton said. “The whole night?” Clinton started to laugh once more. “I don’t see why that’s funny,” Roby said. Not funny, perhaps, but, like the Benghazi committee itself, absurd. ♦","1967","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"The reverberations from last Wednesday’s CNBC Republican debate continue to rattle the political china. According to the conventional wisdom—and, let’s face it, the conventional wisdom is more often right than wrong—the big winners were Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, the big losers were Jeb Bush and … well, Jeb Bush, and the big nothings were everybody else, although Donald Trump and Ben Carson got through the night without doing much to either help or harm themselves.

"It came when Bush fumblingly tried a maneuver that he and his advisers had obviously planned—and that Rubio and his had obviously anticipated. The plan was for Bush to slam his former Florida protégé as a shirker and a grifter, the proof being that he has been running around the country campaigning for President instead of dutifully staying in Washington to vote on bills and “do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.” Here’s Bush, delivering what was no doubt supposed to be the coup de grâce:","1970","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"Rubio had a pretty good answer, and I’ll get to that in a moment. Really, though—isn’t it time to retire this stupid talking point, which gets trotted out every time a member of the United States Senate has the temerity to run for President? It was used against Senator Barack Obama, whose floor-vote-missing tally was slightly worse than Rubio’s. It was used against—speaking of France!—Senator John Kerry, whose absenteeism in 2004 was worse still. More to the point, it was used against Senator John McCain, who missed three-fifths of the votes the Senate took while he was a candidate in the 2008 campaign. Rubio, for his part, has skipped about a third of this year’s roll-call votes, and almost half of those taken since April, when he announced his candidacy. Which raises two questions. So what? And who cares?","1972","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"RUBIO: Well, it’s interesting. Over the last few weeks, I’ve listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you’re modelling your campaign after John McCain, that you’re going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport. You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you’re now modelling after?","1974","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"
"BUSH: He wasn’t my senator.","1975","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"
"RUBIO: No, Jeb, I don’t remember—well, let me tell you, I don’t remember you ever complaining about John McCain’s vote record. The only reason why you’re doing it now is because we’re running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.","1976","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"
"“Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you”—that was the saber thrust that won Rubio both ears, the tail, and the debate. Bush tried feebly to respond, but a halting “Well, I’ve been—” was as far as he got before Rubio interrupted him to talk confidently and a little patronizingly about how his own campaign is “about the future,” how much he admires his hapless former patron, and how important it is to defeat Hillary Clinton.","1977","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"By the way, to the (trivial) extent that any candidate deserves censure for supposedly neglecting the routine duties of his day job, governors are a more logical target than senators. Any given senator is only one per cent of the Senate, and the institution can function, or dysfunction, quite normally in his or her absence. Any given governor is a hundred per cent of his state’s supreme executive authority. Senators, like Presidents, deal mainly with national matters. The responsibilities of governors, if not their ambitions, end at the borders of their states.","1980","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"There’s been a spate of stories lately about how Cruz’s rhetoric is more hifalutin than everybody else’s. He uses lots of big words and dependent clauses. The Times’s Upshot feature has analyzed the speeches of the Republican field by comparing the complexity of their language to that of a range of literary classics. The Upshot concludes that “Mr. Cruz’s debate style is much more complicated than that of his fellow Republican candidates, close to works like Beowulf and Don Quixote.” Beelzebub and Don Knotts is closer to the mark, but the oleaginous Texan is inarguably erudite.","1982","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"It’s possible that, at some point in the past half-century or so, some important major-party American politician—Daniel Patrick Moynihan would be a prime suspect—has publicly uttered the word “Bolsheviks.” But “Mensheviks”? Not likely.","1985","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"The Bolsheviks (the name derives from the Russian for big, or majority) were the ultra-radical faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party and the direct ancestor of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Mensheviks (small, or minority) were the not-so-radical faction. They were the Russian cousins of the social democrats of Europe—Britain’s Laborites, Germany’s SPD, France’s SFIO (now the Socialist Party), and the parties that made Scandinavia what it is today.","1987","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"As for Hillary, she doesn’t fit either half of Cruz’s formula. Her closest analogue in early-twentieth-century Russia would be the Constitutional Democrats, Kadets for short, the party of the liberal bourgeoisie. The Kadets often formed political alliances with the Mensheviks, and both were represented in the provisional government that Lenin and the Bolsheviks overthrew in the coup d’état known to Communists as the Great October Socialist Revolution.","1989","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"Well, let’s see. The Bolshevik faction was prepared to split the party of which they were members. Bolsheviks scorned Mensheviks as socialists in name only, and they utterly despised the Kadets. The Bolshevik deputies in the State Duma were strangers to any notion of reaching across the aisle. The Bolsheviks were extremists. When they couldn’t get their way, they shut down the government. They had no problem with repudiating the public debt. They stockpiled guns. They were ideologically rigid fanatics who regarded those who disagreed with them, however slightly, as enemies. Their leader, educated at the finest schools, was known for his cold intelligence, his contempt for compromise, his fondness for tea, his eloquence and debating skills, and his steely determination to achieve power by unconventional, even disruptive, means.","1991","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"On Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton went on the “The Tonight Show” to talk about, well, mostly Donald Trump. She first appeared in a skit in which the host, Jimmy Fallon, dressed as Trump, called her on the phone to catch up, offer campaign advice, and provide a set-up for her to discuss the many ways that she has fought for women’s rights throughout her long career in public service. Later, during the interview portion of her appearance, she and Fallon joked about Trump’s hair (she invited Fallon to touch hers) and mocked his stream-of-consciousness speaking style.","September 17, 2015","1993","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Noting that Trump and other Republican candidates have never held political office, Fallon asked Clinton, “Is this possible, that you have too much experience to become the President of the United States?” The questions did not get harder hitting from there. Are you tough enough to be President? How did you figure out how to use Twitter? Fallon tried to ask Clinton about the ongoing scandal involving the e-mails she sent as Secretary of State, but she parried the question by joking about gefilte fish, then offered a vague explanation about how various governmental agencies interact. Fallon, nodding, was ready to move on.","1994","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Fallon, as Trump might say, always wins in the ratings, and is a great big, huge, massive success on social media. Clinton was eager and a good sport, but if there was a viral moment I missed it.","1995","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"It could have been different. Clinton was reportedly offered a spot on Colbert’s first show, which aired last week, but her campaign team turned it down. (Perhaps they were worried that he would ask a coherent question about the e-mails; he probably would have.) So the invitation went to Jeb Bush, who, during an oddly paced conversation, earned from Colbert some lukewarm and circuitous praise. “There is a nonzero chance that I would consider voting for you,” Colbert said, causing Bush to pause for a moment, taken aback, perhaps thinking that the host had said “a zero chance.” But such scorn from Colbert was instead reserved for Trump, who is, despite the host’s antipathy, appearing on “The Late Show” next week, a day after Ted Cruz. Before that, on Friday, it will be Bernie Sanders, who earlier this summer went on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” There, Meyers began the interview by making fun of Sanders’s hair, but then, remembering perhaps that he is supposed to be the intelligent late-night alternative (or is that Colbert now?), led a substantive conversation about economic inequality.","1996","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"All of the candidates—including those among the herd of Republicans in the race, some of whom have started their own late-night tours—have the misfortune of campaigning to replace an all-star yakker, Barack Obama, who looks more comfortable on talk-show sets than at least half of the guys (yes, still all guys) currently behind the desks. In 2009, he became the first sitting President to appear on a late-night show, when he visited the “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.” This summer, he offered quasi-official Presidential goodbyes to the departing David Letterman and Jon Stewart. The 2016 candidates aren’t just running for President, but auditioning for the role of Guest-in-Chief.","1997","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"And this campaign arrives at a time when the hosts, too, are jockeying for position in a crowded field. Some see the booking scramble as a new iteration of the late-night wars, with Fallon and Colbert reëstablishing the old Leno-Letterman dynamic, in which Fallon, like Leno, wins the ratings, but Colbert, as was true of David Letterman, enjoys more cultural cachet. (This interpretation relegates “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to third-party status, and the others to the further fringe.)","1998","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"The emerging conventional wisdom suggests that if you want to behave like a grown-up, you’ll go on Colbert’s show, and if you want to make a dent on social media, you’ll go to Fallon and make yourself look gently ridiculous in exchange for a little viral gold dust. But, for politicians, it hasn’t worked out that way so far. Last week, Trump chose Fallon and faced off against the genial host’s Trump impression. (He seemed pleased at what he saw.) When Fallon asked him how he would create new jobs as President, Trump replied, “I’m just going to do it.” (Same thing with the border wall.) At the end of the bit, Trump blew Fallon a kiss. The exchange did not make waves.","1999","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Trump might have made more of a splash on Jimmy Kimmel’s show, which, like Fallon’s, produces reliably shareable moments, but with a touch more vinegar thrown in. Watching Trump read mean tweets about himself could have been fun for all. Then again, the invitation might not be forthcoming: Kimmel doesn’t seem to like Trump much. (An even better, but sadly impossible, match for Trump: the short-lived but sensation-making “Morton Downey Jr. Show,” which ran for a couple years in the late nineteen-eighties, and where Trump could have traded insults with the vituperative host, mocked his fellow-guests, and basked in the madhouse frenzy stirred up by the braying audience.)","2000","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Remarkably, the most viral late-night moment for any politician during this cycle was a long, wide-ranging conversation about authenticity and grief. When Vice-President Joe Biden went on Colbert last week, they talked about how religious faith has shaped the way that they both have faced personal tragedy, and the discussion was raw and unsettling and poignant. No one quite knew how to put this politely, but it was political gold. Colbert, visibly moved, more or less demanded that Biden run for President—if he does, these several minutes on television will be cited, rightly or wrongly, as a turning point. They were also a reminder that Internet virality is not always a reflection of our most shallow selves. Sometimes people share things for the simple reason that they mean a great deal.","2001","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Watching Clinton on Fallon, Wednesday night, I was reminded of just how many times Clinton has, while running for office, strained to come across as an ordinary person. No amount of self-deprecating quips about dyeing her hair or wearing pantsuits, or jokes about being a kooky grandma, will make the case. She is not ordinary, but rather an exceptional person with an exceptionally complicated public history. That doesn’t mean that she can’t connect with people, though, even in the constricting genre of late-night TV. She was always funny on Letterman, but during an appearance in 2003 she was more than that, talking about how she felt in the days after her husband admitted to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky. She was there to promote her book, but everyone goes on late night for a reason. She had profound things to say about marriage, pain, and forgiveness. Viewers have come to expect a politician’s appearance on a talk show to be frivolous and opportunistic. When it is more than that, they are surprised and sometimes even moved. Humanizing yourself, after all, is a different thing from showing your humanity.","2002","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"When Vice-President Joe Biden arrived to tape “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” on Thursday, it had the makings of an ordinary, slightly decorous affair. Two nights earlier, the guest, Jeb Bush, had put in a serviceable performance: hands clasped, a look on his face that was only slightly terrified. Bush didn’t know how Colbert would play it, so Bush maintained the wary, affable bearing of a dad plucked from the audience to go onstage at a magic show.","September 11, 2015","2003","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"But with Biden Colbert wasn’t going for laughs. Biden, of course, has been grieving for his son, Beau, who died on May 30th of brain cancer, while discussing, with more openness than most politicians, the emotional costs of a potential run for President. Colbert asked Biden how he kept a “soul” in Washington, and Biden replied with an old line about Amtrak—“I commuted every day for thirty-six years”—before turning serious. He admitted that the culture of falsity in D.C. baffled him. He wondered “why in the world would you want the job if you couldn’t say what you believe.” Colbert offered condolences, and asked him for a story about Beau. “I never once—my word as a Biden—never ever heard my child complain.” He recalled a conversation shortly before Beau died, when Beau said, “Dad, I know how much you love me. Promise me you’re going to be all right.”","2004","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"Biden was looking down, eyes wet, staring at his hands, kneading them. He went on, “I don’t know what it was about him. He had this enormous sense of empathy. I’m not making this up. I know I sound like a father.”","2005","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"In 1972, Biden’s first wife, and their daughter, were killed in a car accident. Colbert, a fellow Catholic, asked Biden how his faith had helped him, and Biden might’ve been tempted to draw a gentle distinction between himself and politicians who wield their faith like a weapon. (Earlier that day, Bobby Jindal, a low-polling governor of Louisiana, had said, “It’s clear Donald Trump has never read the Bible.”) Of his own faith, Biden said, “I go to Mass, and I’m able to be just alone. Even in a crowd, you’re alone.” These days, he said, his wife, Jill, sometimes sticks notes on his bathroom mirror to read while he shaves; not long ago, she put up a quote from Kierkegaard: “Faith sees best in the dark.” He said, “The faith doesn’t always stay with you.”","2006","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"Biden looked down again, elsewhere for a moment. He patted one hand with the other, and looked up at Colbert, eyebrows raised, as if seeing him for the first time. Colbert was asking a question about “what lessons would you give other people,” and Biden mentioned, as always, an expression from his mother: “As long as you are alive you have an obligation to strive, and you’re not dead until you see the face of God.”","2007","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"He marvelled at people who have suffered and “don’t have anything like the support I had.” Then he leaned into Colbert, and said, “I’m not going to embarrass you, but you’re one of them, old buddy.” For a moment, Colbert looked genuinely stumped; he smiled, closed his eyes. When Colbert was ten, his father and two brothers were killed in a plane crash. Biden went on, “Losing your dad when you’re a kid . . . It’s like asking what made your mother do it every day? How did she get up every single day?”","2008","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"

"Eventually, Colbert got around to asking about the campaign, recalling that Biden had said recently that he wasn’t sure if he is “emotionally prepared” to run for President. Biden looked up at the klieg lights and gave a jut of the chin. “Look, I don’t think any man or woman should run for President unless, No. 1, they know exactly why they would want to be President. And, No. 2, they can look at folks out there and say, ‘I promise you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion to do this.’ And, and, I’d be lying if I said that I knew I was there. I’m being completely honest. But nobody has a right in my view to seek that office unless they are willing to give it a hundred and ten per cent of who they are.”","2014","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"Biden circled back to Beau. The Vice-President said that he was recently meeting troops and their families, in Denver. “It was going great,” Biden said. “And then a guy in the back yells, ‘Major Beau Biden! Bronze star, sir! Served with him in Iraq.’ And all of a sudden, I lost it.” Biden smiled—a grateful but haunted smile. “How can you—That’s not—I shouldn’t be saying this.” He trailed off.","2015","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"The eighteen minutes that Joe Biden spoke with Stephen Colbert produced the most public and painful demonstration of emotional honesty by any politician in months, if not years. Biden could never speak in a campaign quite the way that he spoke on Colbert. But a version of that would be powerful, and it was impossible not to see, in the Biden interview, a rebuttal to Trump’s moment in America—to the notion of self-promotion as success, of cruelty as candor, of empathy as weakness. Biden is no naïf; after a half-century in politics, he knew that he was doing well on that stage, and one suspects that he also knows the delicate risks inherent in seeking to convert deep good will into political capital.","2016","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"The familiar reasons why Biden would be a long-shot candidate remain what they were a week ago. Most importantly, a candidate is never more popular than on the day before he announces. But, already, the 2016 campaign has upturned expectations about what the political class thought Americans want most. Hillary Clinton is confronting more than a strategic deficit. (A Times headline this week: “Hillary Clinton to Show More Humor and Heart, Aides Say.”) If Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump can excite voters by simply suggesting the presence of candor, real or imagined, what would be the reaction to a candidate who doesn’t need to strain to say what he believes?","2017","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"Ben Carson had wanted to be a doctor since he was a child in Detroit in the early nineteen-sixties, but he had the first inkling of what kind of doctor he might be when, as an undergraduate at Yale, he was introduced to Foosball. He played the game “with speed and ease,” he writes in his memoir, “Gifted Hands.” He had “an unusual ability—a divine gift, I believe—of extraordinary eye and hand coordination.” Even after he graduated and went on to medical school at the University of Michigan, a Yale student who made a great Foosball play was said to have scored a “Carson shot.” In the movie version of “Gifted Hands,” broadcast on TNT, in 2009, Cuba Gooding, Jr., as Carson, works the levers with a Jedi-like air—reprised in a later scene in which, during a twenty-two-hour procedure, Dr. Carson separates twin infants conjoined at the head. They were the first ever to survive such surgery.","2018","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Carson mentioned that operation in the first Republican Presidential debate, last month. “I’m the only one to separate Siamese twins,” he said. “The only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it.” It was a Carson shot. Last week, a Monmouth University poll had him in second place among Republicans, with eighteen per cent, behind Donald Trump’s thirty per cent—meaning that the choice of nearly half the respondents was someone who has never held political office.","2019","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"There have been attempts to explain Carson’s rise as being simply of a piece with this disjointed election season. Sunny and unflappable, he has been seen as the refined Trump (Rich Lowry, of National Review, called him the “superior outsider”), or the Trump that not even Trump can hate (the Donald says that he’s “a wonderful guy”). The standard narrative is that Carson first appeared on the political scene in 2013, when, at the National Prayer Breakfast, he told his life story in a speech that, as the Fox News world heard it, was a rebuke to the President, who was sitting on the dais. In fact, Carson has been out telling that story for twenty-five years.","2020","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"His mother, Sonya, married his father when she was thirteen and he was twenty-eight. He turned out to be a bigamist and, once he was gone, Sonya supported Ben and his older brother by cleaning houses. When the boys struggled in school, she made them turn off the TV, read two library books a week, and write reports on them. She was functionally illiterate, but, as Carson said at the Prayer Breakfast, “we didn’t know that—she put check marks and highlights and stuff.” He went from the bottom of the class to near the top. His mother’s motto, which informs Carson’s conservatism, was: “If you don’t succeed, you have only yourself to blame.” But Carson grew up a devout Seventh-Day Adventist, and “Gifted Hands,” like his campaign, is also about grace. When he was in ninth grade, after a friend teased him, he pulled out a knife and thrust it at the friend’s stomach. The boy could have died; Carson could have gone to jail. Instead, the blade hit his friend’s belt buckle and broke. Carson ran home, locked himself in the bathroom with the Book of Proverbs, and prayed to God to take away his temper. He says that he walked out a different person.","2021","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"In 1977, when Carson began his residency, at Johns Hopkins, he was sometimes assumed to be an orderly, but he regarded that as “a natural mistake”—what other black men did people see in hospitals? “I got a real kick out of watching them try to contain their expression of surprise,” he writes. He became an outstanding and innovative surgeon and, in 1984, at the age of thirty-three, the youngest head of a pediatric-neurosurgery department in the country. His joke about taking out half a brain was a reference to his pioneering work on hemispherectomies; the breakthrough case involved a four-year-old girl who had been racked by a hundred seizures a day.","2022","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"“Gifted Hands” was published by the Christian imprint Zondervan in 1990, after the surgery on the twins, and it has sold more than a million and a half copies. It is often assigned in schools, and a condensed version is being sold to fund Carson’s campaign. (According to the Times, as of July he had raised eighty per cent of his money from small donors, a higher proportion than any candidate except Bernie Sanders.) Carson has since written more books, started an educational nonprofit with his wife, Candy (they met at Yale, and have three sons), and gone on speaking tours. There is a parallel between his political emergence and that of Ronald Reagan, whose Prayer Breakfast moment was a televised speech in support of Barry Goldwater in 1964. The speech, titled “A Time for Choosing,” had been honed by Reagan during the decade he spent as a spokesman for General Electric, making appearances at company events in towns across the country.","2023","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Then, as now, the Republican Party was shifting in ways that were only peripherally visible to its ostensible leaders. Carson’s venues have been schools, churches, and gatherings of conservative activists, many of whom deeply distrust both their government and the larger institutions of their party. Their discontent, joined with what Carson sees as the lessons of his mother’s rejection of dependency, seems to have been a crucible for his own views. Eventually, he moved from offering himself as a role model to being a prescriber of policy.","2024","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Carson speaks to an unnerved America in terms that are themselves unnerving. He describes how our “pinnacle nation” is about to be driven down by moral decay. In his most recent book, “One Nation,” he writes that agents working against this country’s greatness include the political-correctness police, who use “faux hypersensitivity” to take power away from the majority of Americans. He regularly traces that strategy to Saul Alinsky, the mid-century community organizer whose name is a byword for conservative suspicions about Barack Obama. Political correctness, Carson says, is used to keep conservatives from invoking slavery or Nazism, both of which he cites freely. (“Obamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery”; “We live in a Gestapo age.”) He wonders if Obama will cause the elections to be cancelled: “He’s sitting there saying, ‘These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything.’ ” Trump, the businessman, tells Americans how the financial system is rigged against them. Carson, the brain surgeon, tells them how they are being denied knowledge. It doesn’t seem to matter that he is a man of science who does not believe in evolution and has called climate change “irrelevant”: he is an ideologue with the trappings of a technocrat.","2025","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Insofar as Carson has a political platform, it involves a low flat tax, modelled on the Biblical tithe; an end to Obamacare and to welfare for able-bodied adults; and the removal of restraints on our military in the Middle East. In lieu of specifics, Carson tends to say that as a surgeon he has experience “doing complex things” and making snap life-or-death decisions. His success in the polls may be best understood as desperation on the part of voters who have rejected political experience as a test of competence. But it should take more than a Carson shot to navigate this Presidential campaign, which has been played, so far, with all the reckless abandon of a Foosball game, and with little of the joy. ♦","2026","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"

"Hillary Clinton’s crucial misstep in the second Democratic debate, in Des Moines on Saturday, may have come about ten minutes in. The subject was Paris, which had been attacked the night before, with more than a hundred and twenty people dead. John Dickerson, the moderator, asked Clinton if the Obama Administration, in which Clinton served, had underestimated the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack. She answered by talking generally about the various means available to defeat the group, and then said, “But it cannot be an American fight. And I think what the President has consistently said—which I agree with—is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.” Then she repeated what sounded, intentionally or not, like a renunciation: “But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.”","November 15, 2015","2059","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"“But Secretary Clinton, the question’s about what—was ISIS underestimated?” Dickerson said, trying again. This time, Clinton responded by saying, first, that “we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis, to leave”—which is true, but not really responsive—and then, after acknowledging that the situation had “developed,” added, “But I don’t think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility. I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.” There was a sensible point in there about not going in alone or pretending that America can solve everything. But Clinton had also laid out ammunition for her opponents, and the responses came from left, right, and center.","2060","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"“John, I would—I would disagree with—with Secretary Clinton, respectfully, on this score,” Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, said, jumping in. “This actually is America’s fight.” O’Malley is not exactly what Donald Trump would call “a killer” (“No dollar too small,” he said in his closing statement, after reminding the audience of his Web site), but he knew an easy hit when he saw it. A few commercial breaks later, CBS’s “back soon” promotion was an abridged video of the exchange. It was one of those moments that will likely be clipped, repeated, and distorted beyond what Clinton deserves. (If only she’d slipped an “only” in there.) And yet, in a way, the stronger response came from Bernie Sanders, from another angle entirely.","2061","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"“I think she said something like, ‘The bulk of the responsibility is not ours,’ ” Sanders said. “Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unravelled the region completely. And led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.” Clinton voted to authorize that war; he voted against it. Dickerson asked, “Are you making a direct link between her vote for that and what’s happening now for ISIS?”","2062","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"“Oh, I don’t think any—I don’t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,” Sanders said.","2063","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"In other words, Clinton had managed, in a couple of sentences, to simultaneously open herself up to the charge that she sees ISIS as someone else’s war and that she rushes into wars too readily. Those notions feel paradoxical, and yet they both feed into a critique of Clinton as someone who does not always embrace responsibility. It did not help that she replied to Sanders not by acknowledging the specific disaster of Iraq but by saying that there had been big terrorist attacks before Iraq, too—under Reagan and “when my husband was President.” Perhaps “cannot be America’s fight” was an attempt to reassure non-interventionist primary voters, but she has favored more direct military involvement in Syria, and needs to better explain that she knows what the consequences might be, rather than occluding them. In that sense, the exchange touched on a fear that Clinton is not only hawkish but hawkish in a politically opportunistic way.","2064","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"There is, and will be, quite enough politicking in this race related to the dilemmas laid bare by Paris. On Saturday, Donald Trump was at a rally in Texas, talking about how what Paris needed was more guns and fewer immigrants. He was sorry about the plight of Syrian refugees, he said, but America would be “crazy” to take more. Jeb Bush gave an interview to Hugh Hewitt, the conservative talk-show host, in which he combined a bouncing eagerness to get on a war footing (“This is not a law-enforcement operation”) with a garbled call to arms (“This is an organized effort to destroy Western civilization, and we need to lead in this regard”). Rand Paul used Paris as a way of attacking Marco Rubio for being soft on immigration. Rubio released a video in which he explained that this is a “civilizational” fight rather than a “geopolitical” one, while sitting in a leather armchair in a shadowy space, as though the place for counterterrorism is and always will be an English gentlemen’s club. It can’t be helped; there is something about a crisis of this scale that makes politicians dream of Churchill.","2065","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"That was the backdrop when the Democrats took the stage, at 9 P.M. They began with a moment of silence for the victims in Paris; all three were suitably solemn. Then came a request from Dickerson for each candidate to give a minute-long opening statement, “to share your thoughts about the attacks on Paris and lay out your vision for America.” Sanders went first and said that the attacks had left him “shocked and disgusted.” Paris got one more sentence in his opening—“Leading the world, this country will rid the planet of this barbarous group called ISIS.” Then he went straight to inequality and money in politics, ending on one of his signature phrases: “A handful of billionaires.” There were pre-debate reports that the Sanders campaign was not happy with CBS’s plans to reshape the opening around Paris; the sense among commentators beforehand was that it would play to all of Clinton’s strengths. It is puzzling that it did not.","2066","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"And, again, there was the contrast with Sanders’s theatricality: in a discussion about the limitations of the phrase “radical Islam,” Clinton got caught up in the fine print, in a way that will likely leave her open to out-of-context quoting. Sanders basically said that he wasn’t so interested in labels, and then immediately railed, with greater passion, against organizations like ISIS that think “we should go back several thousand years,” to a time when there wasn’t even a Brooklyn.","2067","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"Clinton’s answers on domestic policy were generally clearer, and more likely to serve her well in the general election—though here she was up against Sanders’s populism. (“It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids,” he said.) And yet it was in a discussion of a domestic issue that she gave what may have been her most discordant answer. Sanders had wondered why Wall Street figures and institutions would be among her biggest backers if they didn’t think they were getting something for their money—“I mean, you know, let’s not be naïve about it.” Clinton said that the answer was easy: “I represented New York on 9/11, when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan, where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.”","2068","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"Wall Street the street is, indeed, in Lower Manhattan. But Wall Street the industry is all over town, and in other towns, too. Some financial institutions were devastated, and lost many people. But the idea that the guys in the neighborhood, whom she, particularly, helped to their feet after the terrorists attacked, had just passed the hat out of gratitude was Giuliani-level 9/11 political exploitation. It felt disingenuous. And, after a night that Paris spent under siege, it felt wrong.","2069","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"“I am who I am,” Donald J. Trump said in August, on the eve of this season’s first G.O.P. Presidential debate, and what he meant by that was this: “I don’t have a pollster.” The word “pollster,” when it was coined, was meant as a slur, like “huckster.” That’s the way Trump uses it. Other candidates have pollsters: “They pay these guys two hundred thousand dollars a month to tell them, ‘Don’t say this, don’t say that.’ ” Trump has none: “No one tells me what to say.”","2070","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Every election is a morality play. The Candidate tries to speak to the People but is thwarted by Negative Campaigning, vilified by a Biased Media, and haunted by a War Record. I am who I am, the Candidate says, and my Opponents are flunkies. Trump makes this claim with unrivalled swagger, but citing his campaign’s lack of a pollster as proof of his character, while fascinating, is utterly disingenuous. The Path to Office is long. To reach the Land of Caucuses and Primaries, the Candidate must first cross the Sea of Polls. Trump is a creature of that sea.","2071","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Lately, the Sea of Polls is deeper than ever before, and darker. From the late nineteen-nineties to 2012, twelve hundred polling organizations conducted nearly thirty-seven thousand polls by making more than three billion phone calls. Most Americans refused to speak to them. This skewed results. Mitt Romney’s pollsters believed, even on the morning of the election, that Romney would win. A 2013 study—a poll—found that three out of four Americans suspect polls of bias. Presumably, there was far greater distrust among the people who refused to take the survey.","2072","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"The modern public-opinion poll has been around since the Great Depression, when the response rate—the number of people who take a survey as a percentage of those who were asked—was more than ninety. The participation rate—the number of people who take a survey as a percentage of the population—is far lower. Election pollsters sample only a minuscule portion of the electorate, not uncommonly something on the order of a couple of thousand people out of the more than two hundred million Americans who are eligible to vote. The promise of this work is that the sample is exquisitely representative. But the lower the response rate the harder and more expensive it becomes to realize that promise, which requires both calling many more people and trying to correct for “non-response bias” by giving greater weight to the answers of people from demographic groups that are less likely to respond. Pollster.com’s Mark Blumenthal has recalled how, in the nineteen-eighties, when the response rate at the firm where he was working had fallen to about sixty per cent, people in his office said, “What will happen when it’s only twenty? We won’t be able to be in business!” A typical response rate is now in the single digits.","2073","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Meanwhile, polls are wielding greater influence over American elections than ever. In May, Fox News announced that, in order to participate in its first prime-time debate, hosted jointly with Facebook, Republican candidates had to “place in the top ten of an average of the five most recent national polls.” Where the candidates stood on the debate stage would also be determined by their polling numbers. (Ranking in the polls had earlier been used to exclude third-party candidates.) Scott Keeter, Pew’s director of survey research, is among the many public-opinion experts who found Fox News’s decision insupportable. “I just don’t think polling is really up to the task of deciding the field for the headliner debate,” Keeter told me. Bill McInturff doesn’t think so, either. McInturff is a co-founder of Public Opinion Strategies, the leading Republican polling organization; with its Democratic counterpart, Hart Research Associates, he conducts the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. “I didn’t think my job was to design polling so that Fox could pick people for a debate,” McInturff told me. Really, it’s not possible to design a poll to do that.","2074","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Even if more people could be persuaded to answer the phone, polling would still be teetering on the edge of disaster. More than forty per cent of America’s adults no longer have landlines, and the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act bans autodialling to cell phones. (The law applies both to public-opinion polling, a billion-dollar-a-year industry, and to market research, a twenty-billion-dollar-a-year industry.) This summer, Gallup Inc agreed to pay twelve million dollars to settle a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of everyone in the United States who, between 2009 and 2013, received an unbidden cell-phone call from the company seeking an opinion about politics. (Gallup denies any wrongdoing.) In June, the F.C.C. issued a ruling reaffirming and strengthening the prohibition on random autodialling to cell phones. During congressional hearings, Greg Walden, a Republican from Oregon, who is the chair of the House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, asked F.C.C. chairman Tom Wheeler if the ruling meant that pollsters would go “the way of blacksmiths.” “Well,” he said, “they have been, right?”","2075","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Internet pollsters have not replaced them. Using methods designed for knocking on doors to measure public opinion on the Internet is like trying to shoe a horse with your operating system. Internet pollsters can’t call you; they have to wait for you to come to them. Not everyone uses the Internet, and, at the moment, the people who do, and who complete online surveys, are younger and leftier than people who don’t, while people who have landlines, and who answer the phone, are older and more conservative than people who don’t. Some pollsters, both here and around the world, rely on a combination of telephone and Internet polling; the trick is to figure out just the right mix. So far, it isn’t working. In Israel this March, polls failed to predict Benjamin Netanyahu’s victory. In May in the U.K., every major national poll failed to forecast the Conservative Party’s win.","2076","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"“It’s a little crazy to me that people are still using the same tools that were used in the nineteen-thirties,” Dan Wagner told me when I asked him about the future of polling. Wagner was the chief analytics officer on the 2012 Obama campaign and is the C.E.O. of Civis Analytics, a data-science technology and advisory firm. Companies like Civis have been collecting information about you and people like you in order to measure public opinion and, among other things, forecast elections by building predictive models and running simulations to determine what issues you and people like you care about, what kind of candidate you’d give money to, and, if you’re likely to turn out on Election Day, how you’ll vote. They might call you, but they don’t need to.","2077","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

"A “poll” used to mean the top of your head. Ophelia says of Polonius, “His beard as white as snow: All flaxen was his poll.” When voting involved assembling (all in favor of Smith stand here, all in favor of Jones over there), counting votes required counting heads; that is, counting polls. Eventually, a “poll” came to mean the count itself. By the nineteenth century, to vote was to go “to the polls,” where, more and more, voting was done on paper. Ballots were often printed in newspapers: you’d cut one out and bring it with you. With the turn to the secret ballot, beginning in the eighteen-eighties, the government began supplying the ballots, but newspapers kept printing them; they’d use them to conduct their own polls, called “straw polls.” Before the election, you’d cut out your ballot and mail it to the newspaper, which would make a prediction. Political parties conducted straw polls, too. That’s one of the ways the political machine worked.","2079","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Straw polls were usually conducted a few days or weeks before an election. This August, to cull the field for the first G.O.P. debate, Fox News used polls conducted more than four hundred and sixty days before the general election. (These early polls have become so unreliable that neither Gallup nor Pew conducts them.) The question asked ordinarily takes the form of “If the election were held tomorrow . . .” The circumstances under which the next U.S. Presidential election would actually be held tomorrow involve, essentially, Armageddon. Trump won. All flaxen was his poll.","2080","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"A century ago, newspapers that wanted to predict the outcome of a Presidential election had to join forces. In 1908, the New York Herald, the Cincinnati Enquirer, the Chicago Record-Herald, and the St. Louis Republic tallied their straws together. William Randolph Hearst’s newspapers did the same thing. But the best predictions were made by a national magazine, the Literary Digest, beginning in 1916. It regularly miscalculated the popular vote, but for a long time it got the Electoral College winner right. In 1920, the Digest mailed out eleven million ballots. By 1932, its mailing list had swelled to twenty million. Most of those names were taken from telephone directories and automobile-registration files. George Gallup was one of the few people who understood that the Digest risked underestimating Democratic votes, especially as the Depression deepened, because its sample, while very big, was not very representative: people who supported F.D.R. were much less likely than the rest of the population to own a telephone or a car.","2081","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Gallup was borrowing from the insights of social science. Social surveys, first conducted in the eighteen-nineties, had been a hallmark of Progressive Era social reform. In 1896, W. E. B. Du Bois went door to door in Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward and interviewed some five thousand people in order to prepare his study “The Philadelphia Negro.” In the nineteen-thirties, social scientists argued for the merits of a shortcut that relied on statistical science: surveying a tiny but representative sample of a population.","2082","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Gallup had always wanted to be a newspaper editor, but after graduating from the University of Iowa, in 1923, he entered a Ph.D. program in applied psychology. In 1928, in a dissertation called “An Objective Method for Determining Reader Interest in the Content of a Newspaper,” Gallup argued that “at one time the press was depended upon as the chief agency for instructing and informing the mass of people” but that newspapers no longer filled that role and instead ought to meet “a greater need for entertainment.” He therefore devised a method: he’d watch readers go through a newspaper column by column and mark up the parts they liked, so that he could advise an editor which parts of the paper to keep printing and which parts to scrap.","2083","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"In 1932, when Gallup was a professor of journalism at Northwestern, his mother-in-law, Ola Babcock Miller, ran for secretary of state in Iowa. Her late husband had run for governor; her nomination was largely honorary and she was not expected to win. Gallup had read the work of Walter Lippmann. Lippmann believed that “public opinion” is a fiction created by political élites to suit and advance their interests. Gallup disagreed, and suspected that public opinion, like reader interest, could be quantified. To get a sense of his mother-in-law’s chances, Gallup began applying psychology to politics. The year of the race (she won), Gallup moved to New York, and began working for an advertising agency while also teaching at Columbia and running an outfit he called the Editors’ Research Bureau, selling his services to newspapers. Gallup thought of this work as “a new form of journalism.” But he decided that it ought to sound academic, too. In 1935, in Princeton, he founded the American Institute of Public Opinion, with funding provided by more than a hundred newspapers.","2084","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"In 1936, in his syndicated column Gallup predicted that the Literary Digest would calculate that Alf Landon would defeat F.D.R. in a landslide and that the Digest would be wrong. He was right on both counts. This was only the beginning. “I had the idea of polling on every major issue,” Gallup explained. He began insisting that this work was essential to democracy. Elections come only every two years, but “we need to know the will of the people at all times.” Gallup claimed that his polls had rescued American politics from the political machine and restored it to the American pastoral, the New England town meeting. Elmo Roper, another early pollster, called the public-opinion survey “the greatest contribution to democracy since the introduction of the secret ballot.”","2085","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Gallup’s early method is known as “quota sampling.” He determined what proportion of the people are men, women, black, white, young, and old. The interviewers who conducted his surveys had to fill a quota so that the population sampled would constitute an exactly proportionate mini-electorate. But what Gallup presented as “public opinion” was the opinion of Americans who were disproportionately educated, white, and male. Nationwide, in the nineteen-thirties and forties, blacks constituted about ten per cent of the population but made up less than two per cent of Gallup’s survey respondents. Because blacks in the South were generally prevented from voting, Gallup assigned no “Negro quota” in those states. As the historian Sarah Igo has pointed out, “Instead of functioning as a tool for democracy, opinion polls were deliberately modeled upon, and compounded, democracy’s flaws.”","2086","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Ever since Gallup, two things have been called polls: surveys of opinions and forecasts of election results. (Plenty of other surveys, of course, don’t measure opinions but instead concern status and behavior: Do you own a house? Have you seen a doctor in the past month?) It’s not a bad idea to reserve the term “polls” for the kind meant to produce election forecasts. When Gallup started out, he was skeptical about using a survey to forecast an election: “Such a test is by no means perfect, because a preelection survey must not only measure public opinion in respect to candidates but must also predict just what groups of people will actually take the trouble to cast their ballots.” Also, he didn’t think that predicting elections constituted a public good: “While such forecasts provide an interesting and legitimate activity, they probably serve no great social purpose.” Then why do it? Gallup conducted polls only to prove the accuracy of his surveys, there being no other way to demonstrate it. The polls themselves, he thought, were pointless.","2087","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

Trump Dominates Time Poll,” the Trump campaign posted on its Web site following the August debate, linking to a story in which Time reported that forty-seven per cent of respondents said that Trump had won. Time’s “poll” was conducted by PlayBuzz, a viral-content provider that embeds quizzes, polls, lists, and other “playful content” items onto Web sites to attract traffic. PlayBuzz collected more than seventy-seven thousand “votes” from visitors to Time’s Web site in its instant opt-in Internet poll.

"This wasn’t always the case. In the nineteen-thirties and forties, motions were regularly introduced in Congress calling for an investigation into the influence of public-opinion polling on the political process. “These polls are a racket, and their methods should be exposed to the public,” Walter Pierce, a Democratic member of the House, wrote in 1939, the year Time first called George Gallup a “pollster.” One concern was that polls were jury-rigged. In the Presidential election of 1944, George Gallup underestimated Democratic support in two out of three states. When Congress called him in for questioning to answer the charge that “the Gallup poll was engineered in favor of the Republicans,” Gallup explained that, anticipating a low turnout, he had taken two points off the projected vote for F.D.R. In another instance, a congressman voiced concern that polls “are in contradiction to representative government”: pollsters appeared to believe that the United States is or ought to be a direct democracy.","2092","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Social scientists began criticizing pollsters, too. In 1947, in an address to the American Sociological Association, Herbert Blumer argued that public opinion does not exist, absent its measurement. Pollsters proceed from the assumption that “public opinion” is an aggregation of individual opinions, each given equal weight—an assumption Blumer demonstrated to be preposterous, since people form opinions “as a function of a society in operation.” We come to hold and express our opinions in conversation, and especially in debate, over time, and different people and groups influence us, and we them, to different degrees.","2093","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

"In the wake of polling’s most notorious failure, the political scientist Lindsay Rogers published a book called “The Pollsters: Public Opinion, Politics, and Democratic Leadership.” Rogers, the Burgess Professor of Public Law at Columbia, had started out as a journalist and, as a scholar, he was a humanist at a time when most students of government had turned away from the humanities and toward social science. (Amy Fried, in an essay about what was lost in that abandonment, has called him “the Forgotten Lindsay Rogers.”) He had drafted “The Pollsters” before the election debacle; his concern had very little to do with miscalculation. Where Blumer argued that polling rests on a misapplication of social science, Rogers argued that it rests on a misunderstanding of American democracy. Even if public opinion could be measured (which Rogers doubted), he believed that legislators’ use of polls to inform their votes would be inconsistent with their constitutional duty. The United States has a representative government for many reasons, among them that it protects the rights of minorities against the tyranny of a majority. “The pollsters have dismissed as irrelevant the kind of political society in which we live and which we, as citizens, should endeavor to strengthen,” Rogers wrote. Polls, Rogers believed, are a majoritarian monstrosity.","2096","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"The alarms raised by Blumer and Rogers went unheeded. Instead, many social scientists came to believe that, if the pollsters failed, social science would fail with them (not least by losing foundation and federal research money). Eight days after Truman beat Dewey, the Social Science Research Council appointed an investigative committee, explaining that “extended controversy regarding the pre-election polls among lay and professional groups might have extensive and unjustified repercussions upon all types of opinion and attitude studies and perhaps upon social science research generally.” The committee concluded that the problem was, in part, quota sampling, but, in any case, the main work of the report was to defend the sample-survey method, including a landmark project founded at the University of Michigan in 1948, which became the most ambitious and most significant survey of American voters: the American National Election Survey.","2097","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"In 1952, Eisenhower unexpectedly defeated Stevenson. “Yesterday the people surprised the pollsters, the prophets, and many politicians,” Edward R. Murrow said on CBS Radio. “They are mysterious and their motives are not to be measured by mechanical means.” But politicians don’t want the people to be mysterious. Soon, not only political candidates but officeholders—including Presidents—began hiring pollsters. Meanwhile, pollsters claim to measure opinions as elusive as Americans’ belief in God, as the sociologist Robert Wuthnow points out in a compelling and disturbing new book, “Inventing American Religion: Polls, Surveys, and the Tenuous Quest for a Nation’s Faith.” In 1972, when Congress debated a Truth-in-Polling Act, longtime pollsters like Gallup attempted to distance themselves from campaign and media pollsters. Called to testify, Gallup supported the bill, objecting only to the requirement that pollsters report their response rates. That same year, in “Public Opinion Does Not Exist,” the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu revisited arguments made by Herbert Blumer. As these and other critics have demonstrated again and again, a sizable number of people polled either know nothing about the matters those polls purport to measure or hold no opinion about them. “The first question a pollster should ask,” the sociologist Leo Bogart advised in 1972, is “ ‘Have you thought about this at all?

"If public-opinion polling is the child of a strained marriage between the press and the academy, data science is the child of a rocky marriage between the academy and Silicon Valley. The term “data science” was coined in 1960, one year after the Democratic National Committee hired Simulmatics Corporation, a company founded by Ithiel de Sola Pool, a political scientist from M.I.T., to provide strategic analysis in advance of the upcoming Presidential election. Pool and his team collected punch cards from pollsters who had archived more than sixty polls from the elections of 1952, 1954, 1956, 1958, and 1960, representing more than a hundred thousand interviews, and fed them into a UNIVAC. They then sorted voters into four hundred and eighty possible types (for example, “Eastern, metropolitan, lower-income, white, Catholic, female Democrat”) and sorted issues into fifty-two clusters (for example, foreign aid). Simulmatics’ first task, completed just before the Democratic National Convention, was a study of “the Negro vote in the North.” Its report, which is thought to have influenced the civil-rights paragraphs added to the Party’s platform, concluded that between 1954 and 1956 “a small but significant shift to the Republicans occurred among Northern Negroes, which cost the Democrats about 1 per cent of the total votes in 8 key states.” After the nominating convention, the D.N.C. commissioned Simulmatics to prepare three more reports, including one that involved running simulations about different ways in which Kennedy might discuss his Catholicism.","2101","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

For decades, Republicans were far more likely than Democrats to use computer-based polling. In 1977, the R.N.C. acquired a mainframe computer, while the D.N.C. got its own mainframe in the eighties. The political scientist Kenneth Janda speculates that the technological advantage of the Republican Party during these years stemmed from its ties to big business. Democratic technological advances awaited the personal computer; the R.N.C. is to I.B.M. as the D.N.C. is to Apple.

When he co-founded Knowledge Networks and conducted polls through Web TV, he used probability sampling as an alternative to quota sampling. The initial response rate was something like fifty per cent, but over time the rate fell into the single digits.

"Sometimes when political scientists are hired by corporations their research becomes proprietary. “When I say I don’t know the secret sauce, I really don’t know it,” Arthur Lupia says of political scientists who sell their research to businesses rather than publish it in journals that would require them to reveal their methodologies. Lupia is a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, a former director of the American National Election Survey, and the lead author of “Improving Public Perceptions of Political Science’s Value,” a 2014 report prepared by a task force established by the American Political Science Association. Where once social scientists avidly defended the polling industry, many have grown alarmed that media-run horse-race polls may be undermining the public’s perception of the usefulness of social-science surveys. (Lupia jokes that horse-race polls ought to have a warning label that reads “For entertainment purposes only.”) Like Rivers, Lupia ardently believes in the importance of measuring public opinion. “It is critical for a nation that cherishes its democratic legitimacy to seek credible measures of how citizens think, feel, and act in electoral contexts,” Lupia and the political scientist Jon Krosnick have written. Otherwise, “there will be no strong evidentiary basis for differentiating propagandistic tall tales from empirically defensible and logically coherent readings of electoral history.”","2106","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

"The best and most responsible pollsters, whether Democratic, Republican, or nonpartisan, want nothing so much as reliable results. Today, with a response rate in the single digits, they defend their work by pointing out that the people who do answer the phone are the people who are most likely to vote. Bill McInturff, of Public Opinion Strategies, told me, “The people we have trouble getting are less likely to vote.” But the difficulty remains. Surveying only likely voters might make for a better election prediction, but it means that the reason for measuring public opinion, the entire justification for the endeavor, has been abandoned. Public-opinion polling isn’t enhancing political participation. Instead, it’s a form of disenfranchisement.","2109","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"“There are all kinds of problems with public-opinion research, as done by surveys,” Lupia admits. “But a lot of the alternatives are worse. A lot of what we’d have would be self-serving stories about what’s good for people. ‘When given a clear choice between eggs and bananas, ninety-eight per cent of the people prefer one or the other.’ Prior to the polls, I can say that, and you have no check on me.

As you do, you use an app called iThePublic to learn the opinions of your constituents. You oppose Smeadwell-Nutley; your constituents are seventy-nine per cent in favor of it. Your constituents will instantly know how you’ve voted, and many have set up an account with Crowdpac to make automatic campaign donations. If you vote against the proposed legislation, your constituents will stop giving money to your reëlection campaign. If, contrary to your convictions but in line with your iThePublic, you vote for Smeadwell-Nutley, would that be democracy?","2117","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

"To winnow the field of candidates who would hold the main stage in the second G.O.P. debate, in September, CNN had intended to use the average of national polls conducted over the summer. But after Carly Fiorina’s campaign complained that the method was unfair CNN changed its formula. The decision had very little to do with American democracy or social science. It had to do with the practice of American journalism. It would make better television if Fiorina was on the same stage as Trump, since he’d made comments about her appearance.

"Martin Knott, Jr., is the national finance chairman for Martin O’Malley, the Democratic Presidential candidate and former governor of Maryland. Not long ago, Knott and Damian O’Doherty, the head of O’Malley’s super PAC, flew to Kansas City, rented a car, and headed for Des Moines, to join O’Malley at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner, a prerequisite for any caucus hopeful. Knott pursues one kind of donor, and O’Doherty pursues another—inside money, outside money, you might say. Election laws forbid them from coördinating, so they have to be careful when they travel together. “We are very strict about not ending up in jail,” Knott said last week. They listen to music and don’t talk much.","2126","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"
"Leaving Kansas City, Knott, a Grateful Dead fanatic, put on the Dead’s 1990 live CD “Without a Net.” “It seemed appropriate,” Knott said. Fund-raising for a long shot can feel like a high-wire act. Speeding through cornfields under a vast blue Iowa sky, Knott flashed back to bygone migrations to Midwestern amphitheatres. “I felt like I was back on tour, headed for Deer Creek,” he said. “ ‘Going down the road feeling bad’! And then dropping into the Jefferson-Jackson dinner—it was like dropping into a show.” He began to evolve a theory that crisscrossing the country to raise money for a Presidential candidate is a lot like following the Dead. “You know the back roads, so to speak,” he said. “On tour and on the trail, you learn how to connect with people.”","2127","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"
"Knott, who is forty-four, attended, or at least matriculated at, Xavier University, in Cincinnati, in the early nineties, and used it as a base of touring operations. In 1993, the year before he graduated, he attended forty-two shows. To many Deadheads, he is known as the Today in Grateful Dead History guy. Every weekday for the past nine years, he has sent out an e-mail blast with a link to a streamable recording of a concert from the date in question, along with some hastily typed pensées.","2128","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"
"Knott, who runs an H.V.A.C. and plumbing business in Baltimore, reckons that no one has ever raised as much money for Maryland Democratic gubernatorial candidates as he has. He comes from a family of prominent Baltimore Catholics. His grandfather on his father’s side, Henry J. Knott, was a bricklayer who became a prosperous real-estate developer; the family foundation supports Catholic charities and schools. On his mother’s side, there are connections reaching back to the old Baltimore mayor Tommy D’Alesandro, Nancy Pelosi’s father. “My great-grandfather ran her father’s and brother’s campaigns,” Knott said. He has more than a hundred first cousins.","2129","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"
"He passed through New York a couple of weeks ago to attend a Wall Street Deadhead networking event (he’s also on the board of the Rex Foundation, the Dead’s charity) and then was back in town last week to attend a performance at Madison Square Garden by a group featuring three of the Dead’s surviving members—and to meet with a slate of potential donors. The morning after the show, he was at a coffee shop in the West Village, in a pink shirt and blue suit, caffeinating for some afternoon meetings. He’s big and fit, with a John Edwards part and puggish eyes.","2130","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"
"Knott met O’Malley in 1998, when O’Malley, a Baltimore councilman, was running for mayor. “He asked me for a thousand dollars, which was a lot for me,” Knott said. “We hit it off. We were the youngest guys in the room. We were fellow-Jesuits.” They also both liked music—O’Malley is a Springsteen fan and plays in a Celtic rock band. Knott was a chairman of O’Malley’s 2006 and 2010 gubernatorial campaigns. When O’Malley asked him, in May, to run the national campaign, Knott looked to Jerry Garcia: “I was like, ‘One good ride from start to end? I’d like to take that ride again.’ ” (These are lyrics from the song “Might As Well.”)","2131","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"
"O’Malley, at the moment, is running a distant third in a field of three. But, as Knott sees it, to the extent that Bernie Sanders, as an avowed socialist, is unelectable, and that Hillary Clinton is still vulnerable (“The only person who’s ever been able to stop her is her,” Knott said), his man would be next in line. “Last I checked, three minus two is one,” Knott said. “Our focus is Iowa, Iowa, Iowa, Iowa—and New Hampshire.”","2132","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"

"Last week, polls had O’Malley with seven per cent support in Iowa in advance of this weekend’s debate in Des Moines. Knott, echoing O’Malley, said, “We got ’em right where we want ’em.” He also noted that the Dead never played a bad show in Iowa. “Not once!” Zero plus one equals one. ♦","2134","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"
"Like many parents, I suspect, my first reaction to the news of the shootings at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, on Thursday was to think of the families of the victims, and my second reaction was to turn away and mutter some obscenities. With the implacable grip that the gun lobby has on Congress, there is virtually no prospect of the United States following the example of nearly every other advanced country and restricting the supply of deadly firearms to civilians. Given that seemingly immutable reality, what is there left to say? Quite a lot, it turns out.","October 2, 2015","2135","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Evidently, President Obama felt the same frustration and hopelessness that many others did. But rather than resigning himself to the situation, he went down to the White House briefing room and issued one of the most powerful statements that he has delivered since taking office. We should be grateful that he did. Even if it doesn’t do much immediate good, it will be there in the record, to remind historians where the primary blame lies for this ongoing national disgrace.","2136","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The President started out by saying some words about the victims and their families, and said, “America will wrap everyone who’s grieving with our prayers and our love.” Then he said, “It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America—next week, or a couple of months from now…. We are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.”","2137","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Earlier this year, the President recalled, he made this point in an interview, noting that the country persists with lax gun laws despite repeated mass killings. “And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day! Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to this.”","2138","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Obama’s emotion—his anger—was palpable. He went on: “We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out. We need more guns, they’ll argue. Fewer gun-safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?”","2139","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Whether they believe it or not, supporters of the gun lobby were already out there making this argument—on cable shows, on conservative Web sites, and on social media. Some of them argued that the shooter targeted Umpqua Community College because it was a “gun-free zone,” a claim that has been disputed. Others accused President Obama of playing politics—apparently ignorant of, or oblivious to, the fact that he had already addressed this very criticism.","2140","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"“What’s also routine is that somebody, somewhere, will comment and say, ‘Obama politicized this issue,’ ” the President said. “Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.” He challenged news organizations to “tally up the number of Americans who’ve been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who’ve been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports.” He went on: “We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?”","2141","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"We all know the answer.","2142","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The Republican Party has long exercised a veto on any meaningful addition to the gun laws. And among its current crop of Presidential candidates, there is no sign of anybody breaking ranks. Reaction to the shooting ranged from nonexistent to predictably depressing. As far as I could see, Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina, the third- and fourth-place candidates in the polls, didn’t say anything on Thursday about what had happened in Oregon. In a message on Twitter, Jeb Bush called the massacre a “senseless tragedy.” Donald Trump, in an interview with the Washington Post, referred to it as a “terrible tragedy.” He also said, “It sounds like another mental-health problem. So many of these people, they’re coming out of the woodwork.” Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, took a similar line. “Obviously, there are those who are going to be calling for gun control,” he said on “The Hugh Hewitt Show.” “Obviously, that’s not the issue. The issue is the mentality of these people.”","2143","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"That is a familiar trope, of course: it’s not the guns that are the problem, it’s the shooters. There was no suggestion from anybody on the Republican side that what had happened might justify a reconsideration of gun laws, let alone a significant recasting of them. Even those G.O.P. candidates who have previously expressed support for some forms of gun control, such as Chris Christie and George Pataki, didn’t have anything to say on that subject.","2144","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The Democratic candidates, by contrast, were united in calling for action. Speaking to reporters in Massachusetts, Hillary Clinton said, “We have got to get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe.” She suggested that it wasn’t a hopeless task: “I know there is a way to have sensible gun-control measures that help prevent violence, prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands, and save lives. And I am committed to doing everything I can to achieve that.” Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, said in a tweet, “Tweets won’t stop this. Thoughts and prayers won’t either. Only real gun reforms will stop mass shootings from occurring nearly every day.” Bernie Sanders, who has been accused by Clinton allies of shifting his positions on gun control, called for “sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them.”","2145","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"But Democrats aren’t entirely blameless. After experiencing a political backlash during the nineteen-nineties, when the Clinton Administration pushed through gun-control measures that included a ban on assault weapons, too many members of the Party adopted a craven approach as, during the Bush years, Republicans in Congress rolled back some of the reforms. Even President Obama, who urged for stricter gun control during his 2008 campaign, can’t entirely escape criticism. During his first term, when for two years the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, his Administration didn’t propose any actual gun-control legislation. It wasn’t until 2013, after the massacre in Newtown, that the White House made a serious effort to persuade Congress to act—one that failed in the face of implacable Republican opposition.","2146","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"If you listened closely to Obama on Thursday, you would have noticed that, in his words of anger and despair, he didn’t entirely spare himself, or the rest of us, from responsibility. “This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America,” he said. “We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.”","2147","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"That is true. But it is also true, as Obama pointed out, that “this is not something I can do by myself.” To break through the politics of hopelessness, it will evidently take something more than blood—the blood of women, men, children, teachers, pastors, janitors, pensioners, first responders, anybody who happens to be in the way—being shed. “I hope and pray that I don’t have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances,” Obama said. “But based on my experience as President, I can’t guarantee that.”","2148","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"One recent morning at the Jefferson Hotel, in Washington, D.C., Peter Wehner, a conservative writer who served as an adviser for the past three Republican Presidents, described his party’s problems over a bowl of oatmeal. He said, “We got clobbered in 2012”—the fifth Presidential election out of the past six in which the Republican candidate lost the popular vote. “There’s a demographic problem. White votes are going down two points every year. We’re out of touch with the middle class.” Mitt Romney—whose very hair embodies wealthy privilege—was nominated at a national convention, in Tampa, that became an Ayn Rand-style celebration of business executives, the heroic “makers.” During the campaign, Romney wrote off forty-seven per cent of the country—the “takers”—as government parasites. He went on to lose badly to President Barack Obama, whom Republicans had regarded as an obvious failure, a target as vulnerable as Jimmy Carter. In the shock of that defeat, Wehner said, some conservatives realized that “there was a need for a policy agenda that reaches the middle class.” He added, “This was not a blinding insight.”","2149","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"A generation ago, Democrats lost five of six Presidential elections; in 1992, Bill Clinton, calling himself a New Democrat, ended the streak. Clinton didn’t repudiate the whole Democratic platform—government activism on behalf of ordinary Americans remained the Party’s core idea—but he adopted positions on issues like crime and welfare that were more closely aligned with the views of the majority, including some rank-and-file Democrats. The message, Wehner said, was as much symbolic as substantive: “ ‘We’re not a radical party; we’ve sanded off our rougher edges, and you can trust me.’ ” He went on, “The hope for some of us was that our candidate in 2016 would be the Republican version of Clinton”—a conservative reformer who, having learned from past defeats, championed economic policies that placed Republicans on the side of the hard-pressed, including non-white Americans, the soon-to-be majority.","2150","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"For fresh ideas, such a candidate had only to turn to a group of Republican thinkers who call themselves “reformocons,” of whom Wehner is a leader. Last year, the reformocons published a pamphlet of policy proposals called “Room to Grow,” on health care, education, taxes, entitlements, and other topics. In an introduction, Wehner writes, “Americans do not have a sense that conservatives offer them a better shot at success and security than liberals. For that to change, conservatives in American politics need to understand constituents’ concerns, speak to those aspirations and worries, and help people see how applying conservative principles and deploying conservative policies could help make their lives better.”","2151","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"The essays don’t upend Republican orthodoxy. They argue that government should intervene on behalf of poor and middle-income Americans, but in ways that apply market principles to public policy, taking power away from Washington and giving individuals more options. Some proposals are familiar: school choice, health-care savings accounts. Others are more daring—for example, having college education underwritten by private investors, then repaid over the next decade as a predetermined percentage of graduates’ earnings. A few ideas, such as a wage subsidy that would increase the pay of workers making less than forty thousand dollars a year, building on the Earned Income Tax Credit, could easily garner bipartisan support.","2152","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Room to Grow” contains a striking description of the American economic landscape: children born into poverty with little chance of escaping it, and middle-class families overwhelmed by the rising costs of health care and education while their incomes stay flat. It’s not that different from the story that Elizabeth Warren, the liberal Massachusetts senator, tells. After years of ignoring these stark realities—or of blaming big government, in the spirit of Ronald Reagan—some Republicans have begun to sound more like Abraham Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt.","2153","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"The reformocon project shows how extreme mainstream conservatism has become in its opposition to anything involving the state. The reformocons court right-wing censure simply by acknowledging that the middle class is under pressure, and that government has a role to play beyond cutting taxes. The reckless, and ultimately doomed, shutdown of the federal government by congressional Republicans, in October, 2013, precipitated the first conference of reformocons, in Middleburg, Virginia, and that led to “Room to Grow.”","2154","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"When the 2016 Presidential campaign began, an organizer of the conference, April Ponnuru, became a policy adviser to Jeb Bush. Governor John Kasich, of Ohio, read an essay by Wehner and Michael Gerson, a speechwriter in the Bush White House, titled “A Conservative Vision of Government,” and expressed approval to an aide. Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, sought policy advice from several reformocons, including Yuval Levin, who, as editor of the quarterly National Affairs, is the group’s foremost intellectual. Earlier this year, Rubio published a book, “American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone,” interwoven with the personal stories of struggling Floridians. Most of the policy ideas came directly from “Room to Grow,” a debt that Rubio acknowledged effusively.","2155","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"To the reformocons, the Republican Presidential race appeared to be stocked with candidates who were eager to take the Party into the twenty-first century. “I thought it was a group of people who would make that case,” Wehner said. He looked up from his oatmeal with a wan smile. “But then came Mr. Trump.”","2156","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Donald Trump’s campaign first attracted attention, in the press and among Republican voters, when he disparaged Mexican immigrants. Since he entered the race, in June, slurs and feuds have been the mainstay of his media image. Less widely discussed are his positions on working- and middle-class concerns like trade, taxes, and entitlements. In his scattershot, get-out-of-my-way fashion, Trump has vowed to rewrite trade deals involving China, impose tariffs on the products of American companies that send manufacturing overseas, leave Social Security and Medicare alone, and raise taxes on hedge-fund managers. (“I want to save the middle class. The hedge-fund guys didn’t build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.”) To the reformocons’ dismay, Trump has commandeered their target audience and tainted their high-minded proposals.","2157","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Trump’s popularity isn’t based on ideology. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, he draws about evenly from Republicans who consider themselves “moderate to liberal,” “somewhat conservative,” and “very conservative.” More than anything, Trump supporters are defined by class: non-college-educated whites favor him at twice the rate of those with college degrees. Trump is attracting the very blue-collar Americans whom the reformocons were aiming to bind to the Republican Party. So far, at least, these voters, many of them angry and alienated, aren’t listening to the “Room to Grow” crowd. They’re thrilling to madder music.","2158","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Working-class whites remain the most coveted demographic in American politics, even as they shrink as a percentage of the electorate. Ever since Ronald Reagan became President, Democrats have worried about their declining share of this vote. In 2012, Obama captured just thirty-six per cent of white voters without college degrees, down three per cent from 2008—partly owing to the unpopularity of the Affordable Care Act, and skewed by Obama’s abysmal numbers among white Southerners. The emergence of the reformocons shows that more thoughtful Republicans have also grown concerned about the allegiance of the Party’s presumed base.","2159","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Last year, a Gallup poll found that forty-five per cent of Republicans think that the rich should pay more in taxes. Another poll, by the Pew Research Center, showed that more Republicans favor increased spending on Social Security, Medicare, education, and infrastructure than favor cutting those programs. Although government activism is anathema to conservative donors and Grover Norquist, it’s fine with a lot of Republicans making less than fifty thousand dollars a year. April Ponnuru’s husband, Ramesh, a contributor to “Room to Grow” and a senior editor at National Review, said, “Trump shows that Republican voters are not especially dogmatic conservatives—not as much as I’d like them to be.”","2160","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Reihan Salam, the executive editor of National Review, told me, “Trump is not someone I consider an ideal candidate—he does not represent my line of thinking. But he is proving that certain beliefs the professional political class had about who Republican primary voters are—what they respond to, what they care about—were just incorrect.” In 2008, Salam, along with Ross Douthat, the Times columnist, published a manifesto that presaged the reformocon movement: “Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream.” Salam grew up in lower-middle-class, multi-ethnic Brooklyn. At Harvard, where he met Douthat, he became interested in wage subsidies “as a way to enhance the legitimacy of market economies,” he said. “There’s a natural marriage between a belief in a dynamic economy and a belief in solidarity and mutual trust, because the one tempers the other. Most human beings seek stability. A society where you allow this idea of a dynamic economy to pervade every aspect of life is very frightening to people, and certainly you’re not going to be able to build a political coalition around it.”","2161","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Salam, the son of Bangladeshi immigrants, is critical of increased immigration and believes that Trump, though the wrong messenger, has forced an important issue into the open. He points to evidence that second-generation Hispanic Americans have less faith in the country’s promise than their parents did—that the vaunted American talent for absorbing people from other places is waning under economic pressure. Salam’s idea of a national community, united by a sense of mutual obligations and a belief in legitimate institutions, evokes the type of conservatism found in Europe. Trump, meanwhile, calls to mind Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi: a strongman, a nationalist, and a nativist, who appeals to voters of limited means by tapping into their gauzy aspirations, echoing their anxieties about decline, and assuring them a secure place in a country restored to greatness. Trump presents himself as a capitalist boss who won’t let capitalism tear apart the (white) social fabric.","2162","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"This approach is far from the contemporary American right’s rugged libertarianism, just as Bernie Sanders sounds more like a European democratic socialist than like Bill Clinton.

"Trump’s campaign has offered a CAT scan of the Republican Party’s central nervous system, revealing its undetected growths, fissures, and abnormalities. His sustained popularity shows how contradictory and irrational the Party has become. It’s as if, in 1992, Democrats had thrown their support to Ross Perot, not Bill Clinton, because Perot—while departing from much of the Party’s basic ideology and offering only crude policy simplifications—voiced the submerged feelings of many Democrats whose presence hadn’t registered with national leaders and pundits.","2164","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Some of Trump’s positions so sharply violate Republican dogma—and his intemperance so deeply threatens the Party’s chances in the general election—that many conservative outlets are trying to destroy his candidacy. The Wall Street Journal has denounced him for supporting protectionist trade policies and higher taxes on the wealthy, especially hedge-fund managers and other beneficiaries of the “carried-interest” loophole, which allows them to pay taxes at lower rates than middle-income Americans. The Club for Growth, a conservative pressure group devoted to low taxes and small government, has aired ads deploring Trump’s past positions on taxes.

After the second Republican debate, Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, declared on Fox that Carly Fiorina had cut Trump’s “balls off with the precision of a surgeon.” Megyn Kelly, the Fox anchor, who has been the target of a stream of abuse from Trump, exclaimed, “You can’t say that!” Trump later tweeted, “@FoxNews has been treating me very unfairly & I have therefore decided that I won’t be doing any more Fox shows for the foreseeable future.” (Trump held out for a week before ending his boycott.)","2166","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“This is like a lunar eclipse,” Wehner told me in August, when many Republicans still believed that Trump would fade by September. “The damage he’s doing—while he’s leading in the polls, that’s the face and voice of the Party, and it’s toxic.” Wehner insisted that Trump is the antithesis of real conservatism: his confidence in his ability to fix America’s problems single-handedly shows no understanding of the restraints embedded in the Constitution and the separation of powers. “In no traditional sense could you call him a conservative,” Wehner said. “Conservatism in the spirit of Madison is the idea of taking popular passions and channelling them in a constructive way. Trump is doing the opposite—he’s taking popular passions and stoking them, by demonizing the Other.” Since then, Trump’s front-runner status has been challenged by another outsider, Ben Carson, who presents even more extreme ideas, but with a whisper instead of a shout. In late September, Wehner posted an essay on the Commentary Web site called “The G.O.P. Is Killing Itself.”","2167","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Conservatism in the spirit of Madison” has almost ceased to exist. The outlook of the Republican grass roots, and of many Party leaders, is what Richard Hofstadter, writing toward the end of the McCarthy era, called “pseudo-conservative,” because “its exponents, although they believe themselves to be conservatives and usually employ the rhetoric of conservatism, show signs of a serious and restless dissatisfaction with American life, traditions, and institutions.” Republicans today have given the country conservatism in the spirit of Sarah Palin, whose ignorance about the world, contempt for expertise, and raw appeals to white identity politics presaged Trump’s incendiary campaign. So did the spectacle, in 2009, of a Republican congressman calling the President a liar during a speech Obama gave to a joint session of Congress, and Party leaders comparing Obamacare to Nazism and slavery. Earlier this year, forty-seven Republican senators wrote the Supreme Leader of Iran and declared that the President didn’t speak for the country. There have been regular threats to close the federal government in order to accomplish limited political goals. (In September, another shutdown, over the defunding of Planned Parenthood, was narrowly avoided, despite the support of nearly all the Republican Presidential candidates.) On right-wing radio, Obama is constantly accused of tyranny and treason. Once the restraints are lifted, they’re hard to restore. Trump may be the bastard spawn of the Republican Party, but his parentage can’t be denied.","2168","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In mid-September, I travelled to a small town in southeastern New Hampshire called Raymond, where John Kasich was holding a town-hall meeting in a middle-school auditorium. Eighty chairs were arranged around a stool. One of the early arrivals was a twenty-six-year-old named Mark Lynch, who had come with his grandmother. Lynch, the son of a firefighter and a factory worker, had a crewcut and stubble, and wore a Red Sox T-shirt that exposed the tattoos on his biceps. He had just finished four years of service in the Navy and was training to be a policeman. Lynch wanted to hear what Kasich had to say, but he was more interested in the billionaire with the copper comb-over.","2169","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Trump is tapping into this belief that politicians are self-serving,” Lynch told me. “He’s telling these donors, ‘I don’t need your money, I’ll finance my own campaign.’ If you look at what’s controlling government these days, it’s lobbyists and all these big corporations.” Lynch liked Trump’s positions on trade, taxes, and Wall Street. “People don’t want to see billionaires getting richer,” he said. “If Donald Trump, a billionaire in his own right, is saying billionaires in Washington and New York should be paying more—that says something.”","2170","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Lynch sounded a bit like a Sanders guy. When I pointed this out, his grandmother made a face. Lynch said that he couldn’t possibly vote for Sanders—“a self-proclaimed socialist from Vermont.” Lynch was a conservative, not so much on specific policies but in his values and in his ideas about America’s character. He didn’t want an overweening government creating costly programs and interfering in people’s lives. He just wanted a system that wasn’t rigged in favor of the rich and well-connected.","2171","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In Lynch’s eyes, his antipathy toward this privileged class didn’t make him an unwitting Democrat. “I don’t think Republicans are the party of big corporations and billionaires,” he said. “They’re for ordinary middle-class people.” The problem wasn’t conservatism but the dirty role of money in politics. Change would have to come at the hands of someone who wasn’t beholden to the system—a rich outsider like Trump.","2172","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich entered the room, dressed casually, all in black. At sixty-three, he’s lean and combative, with a slump in his posture and a jutting neck. He served nine terms in Congress, and, as chairman of the House Budget Committee, in the nineties, he was a key lieutenant of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and a crusader for balanced budgets. As he never fails to tell audiences, he helped craft the 1997 deal that brought surpluses to the federal government for the first time in three decades, though most of the credit belonged to a booming economy. Elected governor of Ohio in 2010, and reëlected overwhelmingly last year, Kasich turned the state’s deficits into surpluses, while cutting taxes. This is the essence of his stump speech.","2173","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“I’m running for President ’cause I know how to land the plane,” he said, without mentioning the name of the candidate who could well crash it. “I understand that people are frustrated. My dad carried mail on his back. My mother was a blue-collar housewife. I understand anxieties about losing jobs and ringing up college debt. I know all this. But we can beat these things.” The way to beat them was to cut the deficit and say no to special interests in Washington. He offered no policy proposals to help the middle class, besides balancing the federal budget and deregulating business.","2174","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich added a dose of spiritual uplift to this starchy message. “We need to live a life bigger than ourselves,” he said. “Life is not just about me, me, me, me, me. Do you agree with that? It’s about living a life that’s bigger than yourself. . . . I am the most flawed in this room, but at least I know I give grace and every day I can start over and try to do something positive.” There’s a strain of George W. Bush’s compassionate conservatism in Kasich. (During a run for the Presidency in 2000, Kasich admitted to wishing that he’d thought up the term.) He often mentions the working poor in the same breath as the addicted and the mentally ill, as if all three groups needed charitable help. He has supported the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio, to the abhorrence of many conservatives; he likes to say that he’ll have this accomplishment in hand when St. Peter asks him what he did for the poor. “Be a center of justice and healing,” Kasich told the audience in Raymond.","2175","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich, unlike Trump or Sanders, isn’t angry on behalf of the middle class. Ramesh Ponnuru told me, “Kasich’s problem is that he speaks down to poorer people—not to middle-class self-interest.

Probably not all that great. ’Cause what it gets down to is what’s in your heart.” He went on, “I got bigger fish to fry.” He mentioned the budget, entitlements, defense spending. “These are really big things.

"“All I can do is tell you what my record is,” Kasich answered. “And if it doesn’t work I move on to the next person. I can’t—” He pointed a finger at me. “What do you think I should do?” I started to describe Lynch’s views, and when Kasich realized I was talking about an ex-serviceman he found his sound bite: “Our veterans, they should be top priority.”","2181","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Lynch later told me that he was “very disappointed” by Kasich’s answer to the question about the campaign-finance system. “If you take care of the money issues in politics, it’s going to solve the problem of politicians going to Washington and either doing nothing or catering to lobbyists and big donors,” he said.","2182","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Lynch still liked Trump, but he was beginning to worry that Trump was offending too many people to be elected; Republicans couldn’t afford to abandon the Hispanic vote in Colorado and Florida. “My ideal candidate would be somebody who has a lot of Donald Trump’s views but is more polished,” he said. The best alternative, he felt, was Rubio. When I pointed out that Rubio was a Washington insider, Lynch sighed. “That’s the pickle I’m in, and a lot of people are in,” he said. “No matter who gets elected, it’s just going to be more of the same.

"Over the past few years, the key phrase for Democrats has been “income inequality.” The relentlessly widening gap between wealthy Americans and the rest—accelerated by the Great Recession and the not-so-great recovery—is at the heart of Sanders’s campaign, animates many of Hillary Clinton’s policies, and would make Warren an instant contender were she to enter the race. But “inequality” is a word that Republicans don’t like to use. Romney, during his Presidential campaign, characterized “inequality” as a code word: “I think it’s about envy. I think it’s about class warfare.”","2184","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In 2012, Wehner co-authored an essay in National Affairs, titled “How to Think About Inequality.” He concludes:","2185","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In other words, the way to think about inequality is by looking down, not up. It’s not the wealth amassed at the top but, rather, the lack of “skills, values, and habits” at the bottom that accounts for the widening income gap. Oddly, Wehner’s essay barely mentions the economic struggles of the middle class. A close look at the three middle quintiles of income, where Americans with an education, a job, and a spouse can be found treading water or sinking, would have forced him to reconsider the notion that a lack of “social capital”—as opposed to just capital—explains the entire problem.","2186","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Even though the reformocons recognize the difficulties of the middle class, they prefer to focus not on income disparities but on “mobility,” which describes how individuals fare across their own life span and in comparison with past generations. Levin told me that the word “growth”—the unconvincing mantra of supply-siders—was losing its hold on conservatives. When Jeb Bush predicted that his economic policies would lead to four-per-cent economic growth, a level not seen since the late nineties, the claim was either ignored or derided. “ ‘Mobility’ is much healthier,” Levin said. “It’s the right lens to talk about the economy.”","2187","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"But there’s a reason to look up as well as down the economic ladder, and it has nothing to do with envy or with punishing the rich. Economic stratification, and the rise of a super-wealthy class, threatens our democracy. Americans are growing increasingly separated from one another along lines of class, in every aspect of life: where they’re born and grow up, where they go to school, what they eat, how they travel, whom they marry, what their children do, how long they live, how they die. What kind of “national community” built on “mutual obligation” is possible when Americans have so little shared experience? The Princeton economist Alan Krueger has demonstrated that societies with higher levels of income inequality are societies with lower levels of social mobility. As America has grown less economically equal, a citizen’s ability to move upward has fallen behind that of citizens in other Western democracies. We are no longer the country where anyone can become anything.","2188","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Inequality saps the economy by draining the buying power of Americans whose incomes have stagnated, forcing them to rely on debt to fund education, housing, and health care. At the top, it creates deep pools of wealth that have nowhere productive to go, leading to asset bubbles in capital markets bearing little or no relation to the health of the over-all economy. (Critics call this the “financialization” of the economy.) These fallouts from inequality were among the causes of the Great Recession.","2189","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Inequality is also warping America’s political system. Greatly concentrated wealth leads to outsized political power in the hands of the few—even in a democracy with free and fair elections—which pushes government to create rules that favor the rich. It’s no accident that we’re in the era of Citizens United. Such rulings give ordinary Americans the strong suspicion that the game is rigged. Democratic institutions no longer feel legitimate when they continue to produce blatantly unfair outcomes; it’s one of those insights that only an élite could miss. And it’s backed up by evidence as well as by common sense. Last year, two political scientists found that, in recent times, policy ideas have rarely been adopted by the U.S. government unless they’re favored by corporations and the wealthy—even when those ideas are supported by most Americans. The persistence of the highly unpopular carried-interest loophole for hedge-fund managers is simply the most unseemly example.","2190","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"Thus far in the campaign, the ideas of the reformocons have scarcely made an appearance among the Republican candidates. In Washington in June, Rubio—the favorite of the reformers—gave a speech to a group of them summarizing the arguments of his book. And he became the first Republican candidate to support paid family leave when, in September, he proposed a tax credit for businesses that offer their employees between four and twelve weeks off to care for newborns or sick family members. (Critics say that the tax credit wouldn’t offset enough of the costs in wages to induce companies to permit such leaves.) For the most part, though, Rubio has left the proposals in “American Dreams” on the shelf. “Rubio has the most interesting platform, but he’s not using it,” Ramesh Ponnuru said. Rubio, the son of a bartender and a maid who both emigrated from Cuba, “has established himself as the articulate, different Republican in a biographical sense,” Ponnuru added. “He’s not working to establish himself as a problem-solver. His campaign guys must be saying, ‘You have a good story, and voters aren’t interested in policy ideas.’ ”","2192","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In April, Rubio announced a tax proposal that hardly diverges from the Republican Party line. It offers families a twenty-five-hundred-dollar tax credit per child. But the proposal also reduces income taxes beyond the levels of George W. Bush’s cuts, making them even more regressive; cuts corporate taxes by ten per cent; and eliminates taxes on most investment income and inheritance. It gives a huge windfall to the rich, amounting to trillions of dollars in tax revenue. At the same time, Rubio promises to increase defense spending and pass a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Ponnuru offered an explanation for Rubio’s lapse into conventional conservative thinking: “The problem with the campaign-finance system is that it forces the candidates to spend too much time with rich people.”","2193","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Even though Rubio’s tax plan included the usual deep cuts for the wealthy, it was unacceptable to the Wall Street Journal, which criticized the child tax credit as a giveaway. Stephen Moore, the former president of the Club for Growth, explained his opposition to the columnist Albert R. Hunt: “The more you increase things like the child tax credit, the more you will move back to the 1960s and 70s tax system with higher tax rates.”","2194","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Jeb Bush, another hope of the reformocons, issued his tax plan in September. He framed it as an attempt to support social mobility and the “right to rise”—the name of his Super PAC, which, in the first half of the year, raised more than a hundred million dollars. Such rhetoric fooled some political reporters into characterizing the plan as “populist.” Though it does eliminate the carried-interest loophole, it offers the rich more than ample compensation, in the form of a large cut in income and capital-gains taxes. According to the Times, people making ten million dollars or more a year would see their effective tax rates reduced from twenty-six to twenty-one per cent, saving them an average of a million and a half dollars a year. Bush’s plan would drain up to $3.4 trillion dollars from the Treasury.","2195","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In the end, the reformocon candidates haven’t sounded that much different from Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, and Rand Paul. All of them have had more to say about defunding Planned Parenthood, shutting down the federal government, repealing Obamacare, balancing the budget, and building a wall along the border with Mexico than about the problems of the middle class. The mantle of economic populism has essentially been handed to Donald Trump.","2196","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"At a press conference at Trump Tower on September 28th, Trump unveiled his own tax plan. “Too few Americans are working, too many jobs are being shipped overseas, and too many middle-income families cannot make ends meet,” he proclaimed. “This plan directly meets these challenges, and the challenges also of business.” What followed was a tax cut for just about everybody. Seventy-five million Americans—single people making less than twenty-five thousand dollars a year and married couples making less than fifty—would be dropped from the tax rolls altogether. But the biggest winners would be the rich: Trump would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four, and would cut the rates of the top earners by fourteen per cent, below the level proposed by Bush. Even Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform blessed Trump’s plan. In the midst of an anti-establishment revolt, supply-side dogma has an unbreakable hold on Republican politics.","2197","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

The Presidential campaign felt far away—Ohio’s primary isn’t until next March—but the state remains key to the general election. “Part of it is that Trump’s an emblem of success, and the other part of it is he taps people’s anger,” Green said. “It’s not the same anger as a few years ago, when it was ‘Where are the jobs?’ Now it’s ‘Where’s our share of the American dream?’ ” Green, who does polling research on Ohio and American politics, went on, “A lot of white working-class votes are up for grabs in this election. In recent years, they’ve gone Republican, but this year the Democrats could get a slice of them.” The Republican coalition of business interests and the white working class, he said, “is under more stress this year than it’s been for a while.”","2198","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

Canton is one of those American towns where industrial decline and population loss give a sense of uninhabited space. The Hoover vacuum company, once headquartered in North Canton, was acquired in 2007 by a Hong Kong firm that moved production to Mexico and China. An abandoned brick factory is being redeveloped for white-collar service companies and apartments.

"After a winter of continuous below-zero temperatures, many of Canton’s streets crumbled, and nearly a year later they remain impassable. The Democratic mayor, William Healy, laid the blame for the city’s infrastructure woes on climate change and John Kasich. In balancing Ohio’s budget, the Governor dramatically reduced state contributions to local governments while cutting certain business taxes and eliminating the estate tax. The result, Healy said, was a loss of seventeen million dollars to Canton—twenty per cent of its revenue—bringing spending below the level of 2007. The Mayor had to choose between keeping policemen and firemen employed or repairing broken streets. “That tells you the impact of John Kasich,” he said. “But on the national front, where you’ve got Trump, Kasich comes across as a moderate! Damaging as Kasich has been to my city, as mayor, if I had to vote for a Republican for President I would vote for Kasich over the entire field.

"Around Ohio, local governments are being forced to choose between raising taxes and neglecting services, even though the state now has a two-billion-dollar “rainy-day fund.” In his stump speech in New Hampshire, Kasich claimed that his fiscal policies helped create three hundred thousand jobs. In fact, Ohio remains below its pre-recession employment rate, meaning that the state has lagged behind most of the country during the recovery. Zach Schiller, the head of research at the nonpartisan group Policy Matters Ohio, in Cleveland, told me, “Kasich’s claims to good economic performance? I don’t know if I want to say ‘deceptive,’ but they’re certainly misleading.”","2201","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"According to Policy Matters Ohio, since 2013 Kasich’s policies, including a higher sales tax and cigarette tax, have raised average annual taxes on the state’s poorest fifth by seventeen dollars, given middle-income people a ninety-four-dollar cut, and returned seventeen thousand dollars to members of the one per cent. “We’ve engineered a tax shift to lower- and middle-income Ohioans,” Schiller said. “And we’ve reduced over-all tax revenue.”","2202","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich’s tax policies have earned him the approval of Arthur Laffer, a native of nearby Youngstown, whose famous curve—supposedly demonstrating that lower income taxes generate higher revenue by stimulating economic growth—started the revolution in supply-side economics, forty years ago. Schiller pointed out that nothing in Ohio’s recent economic experience supports supply-side theory. The same is true nationally: growth has accelerated in periods when tax rates have been higher on top earners and stalled when rates came down. Kasich, who has positioned himself as the capable, reasonable, experienced “grownup” on the G.O.P. stage, is a supply-sider at his core. As long as Republicans cling to the warped logic of trickle-down economics, their efforts to help middle-class Americans will be largely rhetorical.","2203","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

He had a thick neck and a bushy mustache, and he held a sign that said “Fighting for Good Jobs in Our Community.” Every now and then a passing car honked, and Baum waved.","2209","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Baum calls himself an independent libertarian. “I believe in the company’s right to make money,” he said. “It helps all of us. And I also believe in the worker’s right to bargain for a fair wage.” In 2004, as president of the local, Baum led difficult negotiations; managers and workers eventually came to terms by making concessions—they needed one another to keep the steel industry alive. “This time is different,” he said. “They brought new people in to break the union. They do not respect us. They look at us as a number.”","2210","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Baum believes that “The Jungle,” Upton Sinclair’s classic novel about the Chicago stockyards, should be required reading for American corporations. “At the turn of the century, the boss would go home and sleep with your wife in order for you to keep your job,” he said. Unions, he explained, were “a necessary evil. We need them, ’cause without them—I don’t know if you’d see a return to the turn of the century, where children are working, but corporations still have that deep-rooted sense of ‘I’ll just work you. Family doesn’t matter, outside life doesn’t matter.’ ”","2211","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Baum is fifty-five, with a grown daughter who’s a nurse at Cleveland Clinic. His marriage fell apart under the strain of long shifts, and he lives alone, in a trailer. He has voted Republican all his life, except for two times, when he voted for Ross Perot. This year, Baum was supporting Trump. He didn’t agree with everything Trump said, but he liked his position on trade and his tax plan—the way that it cut working-class people’s taxes to zero but also gave businesses a financial break, “because it’s killing our industries’ competitiveness.” He thought that Trump was strong enough to bring jobs back to America, and he appreciated his willingness to tell both parties, “You can’t buy me.” Baum found Trump’s insulting manner refreshing, calling it “a mirror of the way they treat us.”","2212","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Baum wanted to see a forty-year mandatory minimum sentence for anyone who took money from lobbyists. “The rich élitists are not just Republicans,” he said. “They’re Democrats, too.” He continued, “Our Founding Fathers told us we should be able to go from modest means to riches with our own efforts. This is a country of capitalists—everybody should be rich. The problem is, the rich don’t want anybody rubbing shoulders with them. The middle class hits that wall and can’t get over it. We’ve been cornered. If you’re in a corner, you have no choice but to fight your way out.”","2213","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In an essay in “Room to Grow,” Yuval Levin describes what makes conservatives different from liberals. Conservatives don’t emphasize the individual and the state; they focus on the space between—where families, communities, religious groups, associations, and private enterprises create a web of interrelationships. “What happens in that space generally happens face to face—between parents and children, neighbors and friends, buyers and sellers,” he writes. “It therefore answers to immediately felt needs, and is tailored to the characters, sentiments, priorities, and preferences of the people involved. This kind of bottom-up common life, rather than massive, distant systems of material provision, is what makes society tick.”","2214","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Levin’s description of American life sounds appealing, but it does not reflect the reality of the steelworkers’ lives. The “massive, distant system of material provision” is their company, which is far more top-down than any federal bureaucracy. Nothing happens face to face; immediately felt needs go ignored; families don’t matter. There is no “common life” except for the workers’ desperate effort to stick together as they look ahead to weeks or months without pay—or, perhaps, a future without a job. Global competition is making these workers disposable, and so they are turning for insight and inspiration to Sanders, or Piketty, or Trump. The reformocons, for all their creativity and eloquence, don’t grasp the nature of the world in which their cherished middle-class Americans actually live. They can’t face its heartlessness. ♦","2215","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"“He’s perfect!” Drunk Uncle, one of the commentator characters on “Saturday Night Live” ’s Weekend Update said of Donald Trump, who happened to be the host of the show last night. “He’s like a big old beautiful Monopoly man.” Drunk Uncle (played by Bobby Moynihan) blinked at his drink. Trump was “someone who has been saying the things that I have been thinking as well as saying.” And the two of them were so alike, sort of. They both liked White Russians. Trump had a wife named Melania and that was, as far as Drunk Uncle could recollect, what his doctor said his mole was called. As Colin Jost, one of the anchors, tried to quiet him, Drunk Uncle cried out about “crime perpetrated by immigrants.” Then he sniffled some more.","November 8, 2015","2241","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"There was a scenario in which “S.N.L.,” having secured Trump as a host, might have engaged his affinity for self-parody in a way that exposed him more fully than he would have liked. Instead, all they added was a little gold-plating. Trump looked tacky, but we already knew that. The show didn’t, in any truly cutting way, make fun of Trump: it made fun of Trump voters, or at least the people it imagined them to be. Instead of looking for the weakness in the Republican front-runner, the show looked for the weak characters drawn to him. It’s not clear how much is gained, even in the interests of humor, by simply expanding the circle of people called losers in this race, and leaving it at that. The reply might be that you can’t blame the Donald for Drunk Uncle being sad. Trump can’t help it that he has groupies and stalkers. (When Kenan Thompson, playing Toots Hibbert, who was the musical guest the last time Trump hosted “S.N.L.,” in 2004, gets a bit too pushy about wanting to be considered for the Vice-President’s job, Trump says, “You know I carry a gun, don’t you?”). It’s just natural that two porn-actress characters, in the Vote for Donald Tramp sketch, were desperate to get his attention, since, as one said, he’d be in the White House soon, and “I haven’t been there since the nineties.”","2242","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"The show, it should be said, also mocked Trump haters. As it was being broadcast, there were protesters outside the NBC studio, complaining that the network had given him this forum. A group called Deport Racism 2016 had offered five thousand dollars to anyone on the set who would call him a racist. They didn’t really get their money’s worth. Trump wasn’t in the cold-open skit, which made fun of the Democratic candidates at MSNBC’s Southern-voters forum—and was more harshly amusing than anything else in the show—with Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton, switching between regional accents, and Larry David as Bernie Sanders, the role he was born in Brooklyn to play. (“Go to your closet; pull out your vacuum; dump it upside down; and send me all the pennies that fall out of it.”) Trump waited for his monologue to make an appearance. As he began, flanked by two actors who have played him—Taran Killam and Darrell Hammond, in full Trump regalia—someone offstage called out, “You’re a racist!”","2243","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"“Who the hell is—ah, I knew this was going to happen,” Trump said, or rather recited; he made it very clear that the interruption was scripted. “Who is that?” The camera switched to Larry David, now in a white T-shirt and a gray hoodie, who shouted, “Trump’s a racist!”—and then lolled his tongue and grinned quickly, as if to confirm that this was a joke. But a joke on whom?","2244","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"“What are you doing, Larry?” Trump said. David shrugged, and said, “I heard that if I yelled that they’d give me five thousand dollars.” (Deport Racism said in a tweet, after the broadcast, that it still would.) “As a businessman, I can fully respect that,” Trump said. Maybe David thought he got one over on him, but Trump was cagy enough to convey that he didn’t care. (“I loved it,” Trump said, when he was asked about David’s heckling on “Meet the Press.”) Later, on Weekend Update, one of the jokes turned on the supposed parallels between the anti-Trump demonstrators and Iranians shouting “Death to America”: so pathetic, so hilarious. The show also made fun of those who were too weak to decide whether they loved or hated him: the needy types. One skit involved the cast supposedly trying to do a scene at an Italian restaurant but coming undone as “Trump” tweets about them. Mostly, he’s mean, and they crumble; when he’s not, saying that he has “tremendous respect” for Leslie Jones, she instantly declares her love for him, then keens (“Whaaaat!”) when he follows up with “and I love the blacks.” The joke is that none of the actors know what to do with that. That was the point at which the show came closest to acknowledging that it didn’t know what to do with the front-runner, either.","2245","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"Maybe it tried: in a White House scene, an aide talks about the wild success of “all the laws you’ve tweeted,” but it’s not clear if the idea is that the policies are shallow or that Trump’s tweets are awesomely, hysterically powerful. There’s not really a good sense of the distinction. And Cecily Strong’s attempt at a pushy First Lady Melania Trump, which already felt artificial, was thrown off, as was the skit as a whole, when the actual Ivanka, Trump’s daughter, walked in for a cameo as Secretary of the Interior. Everyone in the studio seemed to pause, for half a second too long, to figure out how real Ivanka or any of this was. (Ivanka’s mother, Ivana, was played brilliantly twenty-five years ago by Jan Hooks, who also did a fine job with the Donald’s second wife, Marla; Cecily Strong has not yet quite captured the sculpted diffidence of Melania, though she was a fine Rachel Maddow in the opening.) The skit could have been provocative, but, like much of the show, it got lost.","2246","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"During Trump’s opening monologue, Killam and Hammond mostly stood there, jutting out their lower lips in a way that made them look more like kids at a Halloween party, who have just binge-watched “The Apprentice,” than like effective satirists. They got the costume down, but not the real strangeness of Trump—neither his physical nor his political presence. This is disappointing, because the show should know him so well. Both “S.N.L.” and Trump emerged in the same tabloid-tawdry years: during the show’s first season, in 1975-6,Trump was negotiating his deal for the Commodore Hotel, which would define his business in many ways. Perhaps some institutional knowledge has been lost as the show, and Trump, have become more national, and, perhaps, less alive to New York. When Phil Hartman played him, back in the days when Ivana and Marla were circling each other and Trump Tower was new, he did so without what are now regarded as some of the key tropes (the hair isn’t even close). His Trump, giving Ivana a beautiful giant door as a Christmas gift in 1988, then triumphing over her thanks to an iron-clad pre-nup in 1990, was an almost generically crass New York real-estate guy. And yet, in that, Hartman might have come closer to the heart of the matter.","2247","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"Comedy has to find a way to strip Trump bare. A mastery of mannerisms can help to achieve that, as Tina Fey did with Sarah Palin, Will Ferrell did with George W. Bush, and Hartman did as the mastermind Reagan. Sometimes, though, the portrayal just fluffs the hair a bit more. When Trump last hosted the show, eleven years ago, he appeared in a skit about a bullying father, with Seth Meyers as his son and Horatio Sanz and Jimmy Fallon as their neighbors. In it, Trump is dressed in an off-the-rack sports jacket that looks like something Archie Bunker might wear. He is Drunken Dad. In another 2004 skit, based on “The Prince and the Pauper,” he wore a janitor’s uniform. This Saturday, Trump’s costumes included a space-age black number half glimpsed behind a grid of lasers, and, in a brief appearance as a dodgy music promoter, a flashy jacket and glittery earring—more shiny things. And he’s got enough of those.","2248","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"

"Growing up in a lapsed but deep-seatedly Catholic household, it was an article of faith that the co-religionists to watch out for on Sundays and days of obligation were the converts. They were the tiresome sticklers who insisted on attending early Mass, going to confession, and giving up something they actually liked for Lent. But, if you had be stuck with a couple of converts for the duration of Holy Week, a good pair to pick would have been Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton, two of the four Americans (along with Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr.) whom Pope Francis singled out for praise on Thursday, in his address to Congress.","September 26, 2015","2269","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-popes-favorite-american-radicals"
"Why did he choose those Catholics instead of, say, Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first American to be made a saint, or Kateri Tekakwitha, who was here first but was canonized later, or Frances Cabrini, of “another Martini for Mother Cabrini” fame? And why is it that more women than men come to mind? (Though let it be said that the only person Francis paused to shake hands with in the Capitol was John Kerry, perhaps as compensation for his poor treatment by the Church during the 2004 Presidential campaign. Of the celestial prospects of the three Catholic Supreme Court justices who chose not to attend the Pope’s address—Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito—perhaps the less said the better.)","2270","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-popes-favorite-american-radicals"
"One explanation for Francis’s choice may be his fondness for people who have lived life raw and have complicated stories to tell. He seems to prefer their company to that of people who tend toward piety and entitlement—hence his decision to decline a Capitol Hill luncheon invitation in order to break bread with the homeless. Day would have joined him at that table. Merton would have done so in spirit.","2271","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-popes-favorite-american-radicals"
"Born in 1897, Day was a Greenwich Village bohemian, who had a daughter out of wedlock, campaigned for women’s rights, and wrote for the socialist press (and, once, for The New Yorker), until, at the age of thirty, she converted to Catholicism. She then concentrated her energies on the Catholic Worker newspaper, which she co-founded with Peter Maurin, and the Catholic Worker houses, which fed and sheltered the poor. Under Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI she was already being considered for sainthood—not owing to her dedication to the poor but because she spoke out against abortion, having had one as a young woman and come to regret it. Francis didn’t mention that. He said simply that a nation is great when “it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed, as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work.” His comments thrilled Bernie Sanders, and sent Rush Limbaugh into a frenzy.","2272","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-popes-favorite-american-radicals"
"Merton was born in France, in 1915. He was the son of artists, who died when he was young, and he, like Day, led a boisterous early life, fathering a child while at Cambridge University before ending up at Columbia University, in 1935. He flirted with communism, frequented jazz clubs, and joined the staff of the college humor magazine, Jester, where he made a handful of lifelong friends, including the artist Ad Reinhardt and the poet Robert Lax (who later worked for The New Yorker, and also converted to Catholicism, eventually settling on the Aegean island of Patmos).","2273","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-popes-favorite-american-radicals"
"Merton’s conversion, in 1939, was the result of an intellectual journey—which, to the shock of his friends, led him, two years later, to a life of contemplation and extreme austerity, in the Abbey of Gethsemani, a Trappist monastery in Kentucky. His life became one of withdrawal, but he wrote many books, including, at the age of thirty-three, an autobiography, “The Seven Storey Mountain.” Published in 1948, it was edited by another friend from Columbia, Robert Giroux (then at Harcourt, Brace), and became one of the most influential spiritual books of the past century, selling more than a million copies. (Merton also published a couple of poems in The New Yorker.) As Robert Ellsberg, the editor and publisher of Orbis Books, said yesterday on “Democracy Now,” Merton had an epiphany a few years later, which he said was like waking from a dream of separateness: “He looked around at all the people on the street and said there were no strangers, we are all human beings.” He began writing on the struggle against war, poverty, racism, and injustice.","2274","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-popes-favorite-american-radicals"
"That did not sit so well with the Trappists, but Pope Francis called him “a thinker who challenged the certitude of his time and opened new horizons for souls and for the Church. He was also a man of dialogue, a promoter of peace between people and religions.” In fact, Merton’s interests turned toward Eastern religions, particularly Zen Buddhism, which he is credited with introducing to a wider audience in the West. In 1968, he went to Asia. One day in Bangkok, he gave a speech and, at the end, told the audience, “Now I will disappear.” That night, as he was stepping out of the shower, he touched an electric fan, and was electrocuted.","2275","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-popes-favorite-american-radicals"
"It’s tempting to imagine Merton and Day together, knocking back beers (Trappists are known for their brews) and marching for peace. However, according to Jim Forest, who joined the Catholic Worker movement in 1960, although the two corresponded, and Merton wrote for Day’s paper, they never met. In fact, they followed nearly opposite paths. If Day is a figure out of Hugo, Merton is out of Kerouac. Once she found Catholicism she stuck with it and led an engaged life, committing countless acts of civil disobedience, and was jailed many times. She died in 1980, at a Catholic Worker house on East Third Street. Merton continued his spiritual search, but his voyage was largely within, and he never engaged in confrontation.","2276","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-popes-favorite-american-radicals"
"Another key to Francis’s focus on the two converts may lie in Merton’s insight that, ultimately, there are no strangers, just fellow human beings. A good deal of the Pope’s address dealt with the refugee crisis and the status of immigrants past and present in this country. “When the stranger in our midst appeals to us,” he said, “we must not repeat the sins and the errors of the past,” reminding the assembled leaders that “most of us were once foreigners.” People who make journeys in search of justice—in life as well as in the mind—are people we must value. They are the ones with stories to tell.","2277","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-popes-favorite-american-radicals"
"This week marks an important anniversary in the political lives of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Eight years ago, Hillary Clinton was dominating the young upstart from Illinois in the Democratic primaries. After a burst of excitement when Obama announced his candidacy, in February, 2007, his campaign flagged over the summer. He was down in the polls, his donors were complaining, and, hard as it is to believe now, he was even losing to Clinton among African-Americans.","October 13, 2015","2278","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"“A lot of our supporters nationally were very concerned that we weren’t moving in the national polls,” Larry Grisolano, one of Obama’s top campaign strategists, told me.","2279","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"Dan Pfeiffer, then the campaign’s deputy communications director, told me, “It’s crazy to think now, but the big narrative was whether Obama was tough enough to take on Clinton and whether he was black enough to win the African-American vote. That’s an actual debate we had in America. You could see the political world placing its bets on Hillary.”","2280","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"“We were trailing in national polls by a wide margin, the pundits were pouncing, and donors were panicking,” David Axelrod, who was Obama’s top strategist and later became a senior White House adviser, told me.","2281","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"How did the Obama team turn it around? The conventional wisdom is that he inspired voters with an uplifting message and out-organized Clinton in Iowa and elsewhere. And while it’s true that Obama had a superior organization and an optimistic message, the real beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton was when Obama attacked her greatest vulnerability: her character.","2282","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"The kill-Hillary strategy began with an October memo that was written by several top Obama officials, including Axelrod, Grisolano, Pfeiffer, the campaign manager David Plouffe, and Joel Benenson, Obama’s pollster. “Joel Benenson was a key contributor to how we stack up against her message-wise,” Grisolano said.","2283","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"I’ve previously reported on aspects of the memo, but the entire document is being published here for the first time. It offers a fascinating glimpse into campaign strategy, and specifically into the strategy used to defeat Hillary Clinton, who was then, as now, the Democratic frontrunner.","2284","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"The memo was used to set up a crucial meeting to plot Obama’s fall strategy, which included a debate in Philadelphia and the Iowa Democratic Party’s Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, traditionally one of the most important events in the run-up to the caucuses. Obama and his aides met in a Chicago office building on October 11, 2007. “The memo was written for a big Come-to-Jesus meeting, at which Obama wanted us to review the strategy and lay out our plans,” Axelrod said, adding that Obama “wanted to talk brass tacks about where we were going” and “we had a rigorous discussion around the points in the memo.”","2285","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"Obama’s strategists argued that the “key premise” of the campaign was that 2008 would be a change election, and that while Hillary was trying to “define this as change from George Bush,” Obama had a broader definition, one that emphasized her weaknesses:","2286","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"The only way for Obama to win this argument about change was for him to raise the character issue, which he had tiptoed around until that point in the campaign. Benenson’s polling showed that voters wanted a President “who can unite the country and restore our sense of common purpose,” “stand up to lobbyists,” and “who doesn’t just tell people what they want to hear.” The strategists, addressing Obama, wrote that these qualities “are the ones on which YOU scores high and Hillary, low.” They concluded, “Barack Obama is change. She is not.”","2287","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"The next section was headlined, “The Fault Line: Hillary’s the Problem, Not the Answer,” and the strategists laid out the case against Clinton in stark terms, explaining that everything in Obama’s campaign, including his slogan—“Change you can believe in”—was meant to provide a contrast with Hillary, not on policy, but on character:","2288","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"The memo went on to criticize Clinton as “a prescription for more of the same, meaning that our shared goals will once again be frustrated by Washington’s failed politics,” and it included a grid—“The Basic Messaging Framework”—to highlight the differences that Obama needed to emphasize:","2289","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"Attacking Clinton as “driven by politics, not conviction” and arguing that she “puts preserving political power ahead of reliable principles or progress for the American people” was a tricky for Obama. After all, if he represented a new way of doing politics, he couldn’t sound like a traditional politician on the attack.","2290","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"“Frequently, in campaigns, when we say ‘contrast,’ it’s a euphemism for a frontal attack,” Grisolano explained. “You can see in the memo, and this is important about the constraints that the message put on us, because if you are the unity guy you can’t come out with a crowbar against your opponent. We had to show we were different, but do it in a way that wasn’t as direct as most campaigns do.”","2291","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"In the memo, Obama was counselled to attack Clinton subtly but not “so subtly or obtusely that the press doesn’t write about them and the voters don’t understand that we’re talking about HRC.” Obama agreed with the strategy. “One thing I recall was that he was willing to draw contrasts with Hillary but was very intent on doing it in ways with which he felt comfortable,” Axelrod told me.","2292","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"Another former senior Obama adviser argued that the same vulnerabilities that the Obama team seized upon still exist and are just waiting to be exploited by Bernie Sanders or Martin O’Malley or her other opponents. “Her greatest vulnerability in this primary is on shifting positions,” the former senior adviser said, adding that her recent announcement to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she previously supported, was a mistake. “Her decision on T.P.P. is a fairly significant error. She is going to get attacked either way, so she might as well get attacked while having a sincere position.”","2293","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"The adviser added that inside the Administration Clinton was not a critic of the deal: “I went to a lot of T.P.P. meetings and she was in all of them.”","2294","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"Could Obama’s 2007 strategy work in 2015? The Obama strategists I talked to were skeptical. “The conventional wisdom is that Hillary is in deep trouble and that Biden is ready to ride to the rescue of the Party,” Axelrod said. “I just don’t see it. I said a month ago that I thought her stock was greatly undervalued, and I would buy it now. I still feel that way.”","2295","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"Hillary learned a lot of lessons from the 2007-2008 battle with Obama. In fact, one of the first decisions she made this time around was to hire Joel Benenson, the pollster who helped write the memo on how to beat her.","2296","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"

"Gender isn’t a preordained limit in movies. Some of the best movies about men (“Mikey and Nicky,” “Le Bonheur”) have been directed by women; some of the best about women (“The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum,” “Gertrud”) have been made by men. But ideas and emotions are inseparable from experience, and with the best women directors, their experiences of gender relations fuse with the depiction of women characters—and also, as with the director Dorothy Arzner, in the film “Dance, Girl, Dance” (which I discuss in this clip), give rise to a distinctive aesthetic style that embodies that experience. The question isn’t whether a man could have come up with these cinematic devices and deployed them to the same end; only Arzner did so. In the process, she got fiercely committed performances from her leads—Lucille Ball, who flung herself exuberantly into the flashy role, and Maureen O’Hara, whose temperamental fury seemed to burn here with an intimate spark before rising to historical dimensions in John Ford’s films. It’s worth noting that the script was written by the short-lived novelist Tess Slesinger and her husband, Frank Davis, a producer but a relatively inexperienced writer. The movie’s fine and urgent turns of phrase bear the mark of a literary art that Arzner lent cinematic life through her own distinctive vision.","October 21, 2015","2314","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-of-the-week-dance-girl-dance"
"A few pages into Robert Harbison’s “Ruins and Fragments: Tales of Loss and Rediscovery,” I had to stop, catch my breath, and laugh. Harbison opens the book by reflecting on a chunk of the Pergamon frieze, which was part of a second-century B.C. altar and which depicts, among other things, the mythical battle between the Greek gods and giants. The chunk somehow ended up in the “decayed industrial town” of Worksop, in Nottinghamshire, England. Meditations on the frieze lead Harbison to Peter Weiss’s “immense historico-political novel ‘The Aesthetics of Resistance,’ ” a book composed of “unwieldy blocks” of prose, not unlike the unwieldy fragments of stone that the Pergamon frieze has become over time. From Weiss we move on to Bernardino de Sahagún and Guaman Poma, “two preservers of the native cultures of Mexico and Peru.” Sahagún’s “General History of the Artifacts of New Spain” (1575-7) interests Harbison primarily because it was suppressed in Spain and “disappeared for two centuries until the hand-coloured original was discovered in the national library of Florence in the eighteenth century.” A paragraph or two about Poma and Sahagún and Harbison is off to a garbage dump in “the vanished Egyptian town of Oxyrhynchus,” where fragments of lost plays by Aeschylus have been discovered. We are eight pages into the book.","November 4, 2015","2315","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-delightfully-out-of-control-sentences-of-a-writer-in-love-with-ruins"
"Robert Harbison is a hard figure to pin down. He’s an expert on architecture—at least, he lectures about architecture here and there, though he doesn’t hold a position at any institution. He wrote a book called “Eccentric Spaces,” which was first published in 1977, and in 2000 was reissued by M.I.T. Press. On its website, M.I.T. Press explains that the book concerns “the mysterious interplay between the imagination and the spaces it has made for itself to live in.” Richard Todd, in a review of the book for the Atlantic Monthly, wrote that “Eccentric Spaces” “awakens the reader to the space around him” and described the book as “a reminder of how much we want from the world.” Reading these descriptions and others, one gets the sense that many smart people like Robert Harbison’s writing and aren’t entirely sure what it’s about.","2316","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-delightfully-out-of-control-sentences-of-a-writer-in-love-with-ruins"
"There are also those, of course, who don’t like it. In 1980 the writer Brigid Brophy dismantled Harbison’s “Deliberate Regression” (subtitle: “The disastrous history of Romantic individualism in thought and art, from Jean-Jacques Rousseau to twentieth-century fascism”) in the London Review of Books. Brophy found herself violently annoyed by the following sentence:","2317","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-delightfully-out-of-control-sentences-of-a-writer-in-love-with-ruins"
"“This shock-horror pile-up on the motorway manner of writing makes it hard to sort out what belongs to what,” Brophy wrote. And she has a point. You do tend to smack into such pileups when reading Harbison. This is true of “Ruins and Fragments,” too, though the grammatical traffic accidents have become a bit less dramatic, by and large. Ponder, for instance, this sentence from the prologue: “The story begins with dramatically shorn off ancient fragments, of the Pergamon frieze and Aeschylus’ plays, but we find them stuck to other things that in one sense have nothing to do with them, a grimy location in England or a rubbish dump in Egypt, but their later history is now part of them and makes these ragged scraps more riveting than the others who stayed behind in their proper places.” Not as egregious as the sentence Brophy singled out, granted, but something does go syntactically awry once we get into the first subordinate clause. Harbison seems to find nuances of meaning in the word but that are unavailable to the rest of us.","2318","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-delightfully-out-of-control-sentences-of-a-writer-in-love-with-ruins"
"Still, just as we are about to give up on Harbison and his unfathomable sentences, we come across this line, in which he discusses the often haphazard way Montaigne structured his “Essays”:","2319","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-delightfully-out-of-control-sentences-of-a-writer-in-love-with-ruins"
"Admittedly, Harbison’s now-familiar compulsion to drag the word but into rather odd territory is once again on display. Still, we must give some credit to a thinker who can call Montaigne’s writing “scatty.” More substantively, the description of Montaigne as “in pursuit of the natural rhythms of consciousness” is genuinely illuminating. Also, “the self in all its hideous inconsistency” is a great phrase. Harbison is talking about Montaigne here, but he is also, obviously, talking about himself.","2320","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-delightfully-out-of-control-sentences-of-a-writer-in-love-with-ruins"
"Toward the middle of “Ruins and Fragments,” Harbison gets lost in a rambling but delightful discussion of Laurence Sterne’s impossible-to-categorize eighteenth-century novel “The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman.” Harbison is trying to explain the structure of Sterne’s novel, which is largely the deviation from any structure.","2321","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-delightfully-out-of-control-sentences-of-a-writer-in-love-with-ruins"
"As with the meditation on Montaigne, Harbison is clearly doing something autobiographical here. But the passage applies not just to Sterne and Harbison but to the rest of us as well: we are all symphonic fluxes. We grasp, we fumble. We hit on an illusory fragment of stability now and again, but we are not in control.","2322","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-delightfully-out-of-control-sentences-of-a-writer-in-love-with-ruins"
"And this, ultimately, is why Harbison is so interested in ruins and fragments. They are not, in his view, aesthetic amusements to be discovered at the periphery of civilization but clues to “the way reality works.” Fragments can, paradoxically, reveal more than the whole from which they came. They tell a greater truth about fragility and time than perfectly preserved monuments. Harbison regards ruins and fragments so highly that he has written a book about ruins and fragments that reads like a series of ruins and fragments.","2323","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-delightfully-out-of-control-sentences-of-a-writer-in-love-with-ruins"
"Plenty of others before him have written about the power of such objects, and many of those writers have crafted smoother sentences and published better-organized books. But there is a beauty in the symmetry between Harbison’s subject matter and his style. It is possible, of course, to conclude, as Brigid Brophy did, that Harbison’s mind is as jumbled as his sentences sometimes are, and that there is nothing salutary to be found in mental jumbles. One might even invoke the mimetic fallacy. But those of us who love his work love precisely the way those intellectual jumbles reflect an idea about the world.","2324","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-delightfully-out-of-control-sentences-of-a-writer-in-love-with-ruins"

"You may smile with satisfaction after reading this paragraph, with its unlikely simile that pleasingly gets at the knotty delights of Homeric Greek. Or you may wince at its clauses and commas and general clutter. I am of the former camp. To me, Harbison’s books, difficult as they may sometimes be to understand, consistently provide brief, fragmentary glimmers of hope.","2326","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-delightfully-out-of-control-sentences-of-a-writer-in-love-with-ruins"
"Veterans of the New York Film Festival (Sept. 25-Oct. 11) return with bold and surprising variations on their longstanding political themes. The Portuguese director Miguel Gomes takes economic crisis as the springboard for “Arabian Nights” (Sept. 30-Oct. 2). Split into three films, it’s an uproarious and scathing, compassionate and urgent outburst that runs more than six hours.","2327","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/present-tense"
"Gomes riffs freely on the legend of Scheherazade, depicting himself as a filmmaker telling stories in order to save his own life. He hired a team of journalists to crisscross Portugal, and he developed the film’s present-day stories on the basis of its findings. The action ranges from the bravery of workers protesting the closing of a shipyard to the absurdity of a rooster put on trial for crowing. Meanwhile, Scheherazade herself (played by Crista Alfaiate) is a crucial presence, seen riding on a Ferris wheel with her father and theorizing about narrative. In the wry context of tweaked myths, Gomes mines human-interest stories for their authentic human interest, finding high drama in intimate conflicts sparked by unemployment or cuts in social services, by twists of temperament or the force of desire.","2328","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/present-tense"
"Elaborate fantasies and raucous antics converge with Gomes’s view of an ostensible democracy whose citizens have lost control. An obscene burlesque of international bureaucrats dictating Portugal’s austerity program is matched with a parody of local elections and a wild mockery of the judicial system. Animals play a big part in Gomes’s humanistic vision; a dog in a housing project bears witness to the calamities of a neighborhood in stifled despair. The movie culminates in a warmly majestic look at a community of bird-catchers whose passionately engaged self-regulation yields an autonomous, populist utopia.","2329","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/present-tense"

He plays Giovanni, an engineer whose mother (Giulia Lazzarini), a beloved professor of Latin, is stricken with a fatal illness. The protagonist is Margherita (Margherita Buy), Giovanni’s sister, a movie director whose effort to shoot a drama about factory workers facing layoffs is beset by distractions, including her mother’s illness and the behavior of her star, an American actor (John Turturro) who veers from overbearing warmth to arrogant aggression. Turturro’s comic exuberance is matched by Moretti’s sardonic view of life on a movie set; the practical obstacles to artistic creation are rivalled by mental crises, which Moretti depicts in a brilliant cinema-centric dream sequence.","2330","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/present-tense"

Here, Akerman films her elderly mother in the family’s apartment in Brussels, composing shots through doorways and at incisive angles that serve as insulation for the heat of family sentiment. Eliciting her mother’s tales of escape from Poland and deportation to Auschwitz, of her grandparents’ religious devotion and her father’s flight to secularism, Akerman enfolds vast currents of history in a prodigal daughter’s tale of concern for an ailing parent. ♦","2331","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/present-tense"

"I first became aware of Clive Owen in 1998, when he starred in Mike Hodges’s film “Croupier.” The thin actor, who bore a certain resemblance to a young Lucian Freud, played a writer who could not get on with his work; one area in which he could exercise some control, though, was in the gambling hall, where he had a job as a card dealer. Whenever his hand grazed the table to deal cards or to gather up someone else’s losings, Owen looked as if he were handling a piece of exquisite art—something he was mesmerized by—but then quickly ashamed, too, as if he didn’t measure up to the moment. His intense gaze made everything seem erotic, or maybe on the verge of being defeated. Striding past all those losers who didn’t know when to stop, Owen’s character could not stop, either—he was compelled by some unidentifiable force to live in a kind of spiritual purgatory, not unlike a character in a Robert Bresson film.","2339","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/social-studies-the-theatre-hilton-als"
"Owen, who is now fifty, grew up in Coventry, in a family of men—he has four brothers—and is brilliant at playing characters who say nothing while others, generally women, get excited about accompanying him to unnamed dark places from which he may or may not bring them back. He’s also blessed with one of the screen’s more attractive voices, which is deep and slow, like Robert Mitchum’s. It feels slightly weird when his sonorous tone turns to a laugh; for the most part, Owen’s best characters wouldn’t put themselves out to chuckle. On the exciting and complex Steven Soderbergh-helmed series “The Knick,” Owen is believable and magnetic as a surgeon who seems to be addicted to everything but love.","2340","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/social-studies-the-theatre-hilton-als"

The play is about social talk as a kind of poison—the cordials that couples and old friends offer one another in the hope that they’ll get drunk on a shared memory, or social vision. Remember when we had fun? Of course, no memory can be truly shared—the past, to say nothing of the present, makes each of us different. Owen knows that, and makes us feel it, too. You can see his isolation when he stares us down from the distance of his character’s internal reality. You can hear it when he doesn’t say what his characters won’t say, for fear that the words won’t matter at all. ♦","2341","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/social-studies-the-theatre-hilton-als"

Kaluk, a troupe of branding consultants-cum-street performers, mostly from Red Hook and all under the age of twenty-five, offers, according to the group’s Web site, “a playful touch of theatricality to get your brand noticed in a crowd.” As dusk fell at Louis Valentino Jr. Park, overlooking the Red Hook Channel, several members arrived early for a public movie night, a screening of “The Incredibles,” sponsored by local businesses.

"The Kaluk team, weary of digital ploys, promotes products the old-fashioned way: with spectacle. “People on Facebook, they don’t look at stuff,” one of the group’s founders, a twenty-year-old named Luis Fernandez, said, at the park. “Or they do, but what would you remember? That or this?” He pointed to one of his cohorts, who was putting on a robot costume. “The marketing that we do is not regular marketing,” he went on. “We’re not boring. I’m not trying to insult other marketing, but, it’s, like, they’re so basic.

The school is operated, in part, by Good Shepherd Services, a family-support agency. Reg Flowers, who coördinated its community outreach, helped the hype crew start a business.

For the past year, the Kalukers—there are now ten of them—have gathered for weekly training sessions, taught by volunteers and by Good Shepherd staff. There were lessons in budget-planning, accounting, and improv. Flowers taught role-playing. “Having a master’s in theatre from Yale is really useful,” he said. “A lot of it is creating live-action commercials on the street.” Kaluk is a workers’ coöperative—everybody shares ownership. “I hate pyramids,” Fernandez said. “I don’t want to be at the top. I’m more of a chill dude.” Carlos Menchaca, the local City Council representative, hired the group to drum up votes for a participatory budget proposal.

A crowd had gathered, sprawling on the grass in front of the movie screen. The opening credits rolled.

Addressing the perplexed crowd, he made his pitch. “The Red Hook community microgrid will be a solar-powered backup generator,” he said. “If the power goes out, we can avoid another Hurricane Sandy situation!” Then the robot entered, break-dancing to “The Power,” by Snap!, as Kalukers distributed informational stickers. People cheered.","2347","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/spreading-the-word-up-lifes-ladder-betsy-morais"
"“Beautiful!” Fernandez, who was watching from the edge of the lawn, said. Kaluk would take home about five thousand dollars for the job. Some of that would be split among the members, and the rest would be deposited into a group bank account. “They’re not all running around in new sneakers because of this,” Flowers said.

"As directors go, Luis Buñuel, who started as a Surrealist with the loudest of cinematic shrieks (“The Andalusian Dog”), eventually became the slyest of sly foxes, infusing his bemused revulsion at the way of the world into recognizably realistic depictions of the world, as seen in his sardonic and erotic 1970 drama “Tristana” (which I discuss in this clip). It’s based on an 1892 novel by the Spanish writer Benito Pérez Galdós, but Buñuel updates the action to the nineteen-thirties, not exactly an anodyne time in Spanish history or in history over-all. He transforms the story of a sexual predator with a refined aesthetic sense and a victim who turns the tables on her enemy into a furious allegory—though one that’s not so literal as to diminish the disturbing immediacy of the story’s moral and physical depredations. Buñuel had left Spain during the Civil War and had been living in Mexico for more than two decades when he “Tristana”—he had filmed “Viridiana” (a similar story) there a decade earlier, and the result was scandal. At the time that Buñuel returned to Spain to film “Tristana,” “Viridiana” was still banned there and would remain so until the end of the Franco regime. It’s that very repression, the complex links of sex and politics, of intimate life and the public face of society, that Buñuel wryly reveals in “Tristana.”","November 19, 2015","2353","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-of-the-week-tristana"
"Cities can’t win. When they do well, people resent them as citadels of inequality; when they do badly, they are cesspools of hopelessness. In the seventies and eighties, the seemingly permanent urban crisis became the verdict that American civilization had passed on itself. Forty years later, cities mostly thrive, crime has been in vertiginous decline, the young cluster together in old neighborhoods, drinking more espresso per capita in Seattle than in Naples, while in San Francisco the demand for inner-city housing is so keen that one-bedroom apartments become scenes of civic conflict—and so big cities turn into hateful centers of self-absorbed privilege. We oscillate between “Taxi Driver” and “The Bonfire of the Vanities” without arriving at a stable picture of something in between.","2354","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"Has it ever been acceptable to regard a big city as admirable through and through? Maybe in books about Paris and London from around 1910 to the Second World War, and in books about New York in the years just after the Second World War, before the Dodgers moved and the big fractures began. For the rest, whether it’s Victorian London or post-sixties New York, pop novels and scholarly urbanism are most often voiced in a tone of complaint or querulous warning. (The outlier is the architectural historian Reyner Banham’s 1971 “Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies,” still the best book ever written about an American city, its happiness fuelled by an Englishman’s perversity: Everyone says L.A. sucks? I’ll show you it shines.) Nothing urban would be more likely to evoke disgust than a study promoting a benign picture of Bloomberg’s New York—even though, in reality, that city was relatively peaceful (and self-healing from the worst war wound in its history) and prosperous (if more and more unevenly so), with the parks restored or expanding and the subways so safe that they became crowded at two or three in the morning. Those of us who dreamed of the High Line as an improbable public benefit, and then saw it come true, had to accept that it would next become a subject of ridicule, as a cynical developer’s amenity, a green-tinted scam.","2355","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"The reason that perceptions of cities switch so radically is twofold. Cities are the contradictions of capitalism, spelled out in crowds. They are engines of prosperity and inequality in equal measure, and when the inequality tips poor they look unsavable; when it tips rich, they look unjust. And then cities enfold a subtler contradiction—they shine by bringing like-minded people in from the hinterland (gays, geeks, Jews, artists, bohemians), but they thrive by asking unlike-minded people to live together in the enveloping metropolis. While the clumping is fun, the coexistence is the greater social miracle, though not one that lends itself to stories. Greenwich Village and Park Slope and Southie count as homes and get reverent treatment; a musical might be made of hipsters and Hasidim learning to live together in Williamsburg. But a movie about the lives of the people in a single car on the 6 train would trail off into inconsequence, since the point is that city kinds and lives are so different that contiguity is their only coinciding point. (The one proviso of the local story is that the neighborhood must be under assault and the narrator must side with the old ways, even if he or she is representative of new ones. And so Ray, in Lena Dunham’s beautifully observed, Brooklyn-based “Girls,” runs for the local community board as a champion of preservation, not transformation, though he is utterly typical of the transformative kind.)","2356","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"The things that give cities a bad conscience are self-evident: seeing the rise of 432 Park Avenue, the tallest, ugliest, and among the most expensive private residences in the city’s history—the Oligarch’s Erection, as it should be known—as a catchment for the rich from which to look down on everyone else, it is hard not to feel that the civic virtues of commonality have been betrayed. Every day brings news of old favorites closed, familiar neighborhoods homogenized, ethnic enclaves turned over to the legions of Capital, not to mention Oberlin and Bard.","2357","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"Yet the social crises that cities face are remarkably consistent, country to country and town to town. Very little that is going on in New York, from plutocratic excess to outlying gentrification, is not also going on, with different emphases and origins, in London: the same tales of people who drink wine and lattes buying the property of those who drink whiskey and beer. At the same time, cities are local. Saying that Manhattan and central London share the same problems is like saying that a man dying of drink in London is like one doing the same in Manhattan. It’s true, but all the local conditions—what he’s drinking, where he drinks it, who takes him home, and what kind of home he goes to—are so different that a story about the drunk in either place becomes a story about the place. Cities are at once the most cosmopolitan and the most particular of subjects; they require, and rarely receive, a view sufficiently wide-eyed as to become effectively double.","2358","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"The foundation of the city is its spatial organization, the way its streets meet and the way its citizens travel on them. Gerard Koeppel’s “City on a Grid” (Da Capo) tells the too little-known tale of how and why Manhattan came to be the waffle-board city we know. He shows us that the grid, far from being a long-range plan imposed by a class of managers, was the result more of a shrug, an inconclusive meeting, and a big “Why not?” Koeppel reproduces the key paragraph of the Gouverneur Morris report of 1811:","2359","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"Koeppel argues, convincingly, that the show of hardheaded rationality here is merely a show. There was no good commercial reason to make a thrifty city of intersections at right angles. London, the model of an imperial commercial city, had its ovals and organic oddities and still prospered. Philadelphia had lovely squares interrupting its own version of the grid. Straight-sided and right-angled houses can be built in circles as well as on street corners. The details of New York’s grid turn out to be surprisingly haphazard and improvisational in their origins. As Koeppel points out, no one has ever provided a good explanation for why the wide two-way streets were chosen to fall where they do—at Fourteenth, Twenty-third, Thirty-fourth. In general, he persuades us, the impulse behind the grid was less the rationalizing impulses of the Enlightenment than the eternal desire of a bureaucratic commission to finish its report, accented, later, by the eternal real-estate developers’ urge to have regularized lots to develop.","2360","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"A lost city of stars and ovals may appeal to us more, but one wonders if it would have altered the city’s story much. The history of the grid suggests that its character is determined by its uses more than the other way around. Mansions that arose within it had a fenced, forbidding look, as in pictures of early Fifth Avenue; the clustering of poor immigrants seemed to create crowded streets and slums not terribly different from those in Paris or Chicago.","2361","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"Koeppel certainly recognizes the ambiguities of the grid, but he seems unsure what to make of them; early in his book, he darkly insists that the dead hand of the rectilinear grid “favors private interest over public convenience,” and cites a German urban planner who claimed that “mystic” peoples favor organic cities over regularized ones. But any town that has Walt Whitman as its bard can hardly be accused of forcing narrowly straight-sided views on its singers. Rectilinear the grid may be, but it twists and turns in our imaginations as much as any winding road.","2362","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"The grid, useful as an accelerant for pedestrians and horse-drawn vehicles, ended up being unintentionally well-adapted to the imperialism of the car; a short ride in a London cab can take forever, while taxi- and Uber-drivers race up and down the midnight Manhattan avenues at hyper-speeds. Evan Friss’s forthcoming “The Cycling City: Bicycles & Urban America in the 1890s” (Chicago) wants, in turn, to show us a forgotten parenthesis when the city had not yet yielded to the car. But he ends up showing mainly how terrific research and a feeling for detail can be undermined by the pieties of the contemporary social sciences. Common sense wins, barely, but not without the author taking many frightened-looking glances over his shoulder to see if the consensus of the discipline is gaining on him.","2363","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"The consensus of the discipline takes a dim view of common-sense considerations (say, that people rode bikes because they were the best way to get places before cars). More sinister Foucauldian épistèmes must be shown to govern social life: any social explanation that can’t be expressed as a conspiracy theory involving bourgeois society stamping out Difference is inadequate to the phenomenon, even if the phenomenon is on two wheels with gears and going many different places at once. Still, Friss has a good story to tell. In the late nineteenth century, bicycles were not just a sweet means of romantic transport—“Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do,” and all that—but a technological triumph creating fanatical followers and interest groups. The bicycle was more like a personal computer than like a love seat. There were “dozens of exclusive bicycle clubs dotting America’s leading cities. . . . Libraries, card rooms, and billiard tables kept members busy while dumbwaiters shuttled food from kitchen hands to hungry cyclists.” Women considered them “an almost utopian instrument,” Friss says, and quotes a contemporary source: “Now and again a complaint arises of the narrowness of woman’s sphere. For such disorder of the soul the sufferer can do no better than to flatten her sphere to a circle, mount it, and take to the road.”","2364","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"Friss is a demon researcher, and his book is full of revelatory facts: who knew that the bicycle lobby played a key role in the Chicago mayoral election of 1887? Yet one feels impatient as he torturously tries to track academic concepts of class and mentalité onto what are, clearly, the inevitable inner squabbles of fan clubs and interest groups. Friss illustrates, without quite articulating, the central Trollopean social insight: like-minded people with similar passions typically end up fighting among themselves far more than they do with their class or intellectual opponents. Cyclists fight cyclists, as union leaders fight union leaders. To take one instance, Friss shows that the American biking community itself split, violently, in the eighteen-nineties, between those who were in favor of dedicated bike paths and those who mistrusted any segregation of the biker from the common highway.","2365","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"Although Friss concedes that “bicycle mechanics became automobile mechanics” (as the Wright Brothers sprang from a bicycle shop into the air), he still insists that bikes were defeated not by cars but by a growing fear of the potentially radical effects, particularly on women, of the popular bicycle. The decline in cycling had to do with “its loss of social and cultural appeal,” Friss writes. “As more and more varieties of people began to ride, others no longer found bicycles so appealing.” Class panic, in this view, was central: “The smart set and their followers no longer found that their machines served as a social marker. The bicycle could not sustain itself as a fashionable social tool and also as a utilitarian tool.” Well, why not? Cars do. Bikes do again today, with sleek architects racing to their ateliers on the gearless kind and underpaid deliverymen pedalling through the rain with Chinese food. Scanting the obvious technological history, one can also overstate the determinisms of class warfare.","2366","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"Surely many things, including bikes, fall in and out of fashion for reasons that have more to do with fashion than with reason. Hemlines do not rise and fall because of changing attitudes toward sexuality, unless attitudes toward sexuality change radically every five years. They rise because they had previously fallen and fall because they once rose. Fashion is not a subsidiary idea but itself an explanatory one. Any New York student of styles of transport and recreation will have seen, for instance, the rise and fall of roller skates, a craze that claimed the cover of this magazine more than once in the nineteen-seventies, and its replacement by in-line skating, and then, eventually, the decline of both. All of this had less to do with changing social visions than with the inevitable pull of tides and time.","2367","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"How much do the physical arrangements of cities—their alleys and streets, their transportation infrastructure—actually affect their character? The grid expresses something about a common New York ideal of busyness and intersection—mercantile capitalist order as a devouring Dionysian force—more than it enforces that ideal. The greatest celebrations of the grid are the émigré Piet Mondrian’s two New York paintings: “Broadway Boogie Woogie” and “Victory Boogie Woogie.” They are part of a forties-New York efflorescence, the blinking, stable, dynamic, and yet still rectilinear energy—an image of energy that breaks with the usual organic forms of ecstatic spirals and gyres. They show the grid as metaphor, and a metaphor, after all, is a cell with a view: the bars in the window bend, and you leave as, and when, you want to.","2368","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"If city tales begin with grids and transportation, they end in ruins: there are no more moving or frightening images in urban history than those of contemporary Detroit. The photographs of Michigan Central Station now be-weeded, or of Mishkan Yisroel synagogue abandoned, are presented on the Internet as if Piranesian and romantic, until one recalls that this Rome fell not after five hundred years of Vandals and Christians but after a mere few decades of neglect and decay and social change. The journalist David Maraniss has written a book about the fall of Detroit, and done it, ingeniously, by writing about Detroit at its height, Humpty Dumpty’s most poignant moment being just before he toppled over. Maraniss’s “Once in a Great City” (Simon & Schuster) is an encyclopedic account of Detroit in the early sixties, a kind of hymn to what really was a great city. (Maraniss spent his early childhood in Detroit, and its old monuments still have a childlike glow for him. I feel the same way about Philadelphia, a similar place with a similar fate and a happier rebound.)","2369","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"Maraniss begins with twinned disasters that at the time no one saw as portents. In 1962, the Ford Rotunda, a now forgotten but formerly world-famous example of high-tech architecture, designed by the visionary modernist Albert Kahn—once one of the five leading tourist attractions in America—burned to the ground in an hour after a stupid roofing accident. The same day, another Kahn building, a model black-owned-and-operated hotel called the Gotham, was raided on charges of housing a gambling ring; it was shortly doomed to demolition, to make way for a parking garage, as much of black Detroit was being steamrolled for expressways. Both structures were monuments of civic optimism in their day, and their destruction dramatically illustrates all that could be lost.","2370","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"We then meet a panorama of social players and types: from Berry Gordy, Jr., then emerging as a tycoon of rhythm, to Wilfred X, Malcolm’s older brother, a significant character in the era and the town. The Motown chapters, to any lover of American music, are especially engrossing. Maraniss dramatizes one of the most compelling of all historical questions: How did a line of geniuses suddenly emerge in this one industrial town—Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder and Holland-Dozier-Holland, and so many more that Aretha Franklin, across town, was snobbishly kept out of the line by her preacher father, who didn’t want her to mingle with crass Motown? Was it because there was a local hit-making music business, or because there was, by serendipitous chance, a special gathering of geniuses? The obvious answer, that it was a little of both, is not that helpful, since we want to know how much of each, a question that applies equally to Florence in 1400. The art historian E. H. Gombrich, the best student of the process, once identified the central engine of such renaissances as in-group competition, and, indeed, the engine of Motown’s genius seems to have been the morning meetings, when all the composers would have to go head to head and demo to demo, and the competitive level was so high that Gordy’s sister Esther generally sided with Smokey over Berry.","2371","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"We are also reintroduced to the man who ought to be on the twenty-dollar bill, the great Walter Reuther, the president and a founder (with his brother) of the United Auto Workers, tragically little remembered now, especially compared with the thug Jimmy Hoffa, who betrayed the labor movement to organized crime. We witness Reuther’s heroic past—he was a social democrat who worked in the Soviet Union and denounced Stalinism; a labor leader who survived attempts by the owners not just to intimidate but to assassinate him—and his visionary nineteen-sixties present. He thought that autoworkers needed not only higher wages but less stressful work, and proposed regular sabbaticals for them, as for college professors.","2372","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"We get a deservedly sympathetic portrait of Henry Ford II, who knew perfectly well what a louse his old man had been, fired the goons who had tried to kill Reuther and his brother, recognized the necessity of unions, and worked hard to accommodate their concerns. There are also some lovely and funny intertwinings: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a saint but no fool, got into a squabble with Gordy over potential royalties for an LP of his “I Have a Dream” speech. (Maraniss notes that there were multiple “Dream” speeches—Gordy was ready to release the one delivered in Detroit, before the March on Washington, which Reuther helped organize.)","2373","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"The display of municipal energies is so impressive that every page haunts us with the questions What went wrong? How could so much go so wrong so rapidly? How did a city of so many fruitful tensions and monuments and intermediary institutions turn into the ruins we see now, with scarcely a third of its 1950 population remaining and so many of the sites that Maraniss mentions ruined or destroyed? The answers, more hinted at than spelled out, are depressingly familiar: the riots of 1967 and the upward swoop of crime that dissolved old neighborhoods and drove their residents to the suburbs; the separation of the suburbs as a tax base from the city that they depended on; and, above all, the simple and inexorable decline of Detroit as a manufacturing base, under the pressure of Asian competition. (It is exactly the historic arc of change that John Updike captured for all time in his “Rabbit” books.)","2374","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"Reading about Maraniss’s Detroit in isolation, though, one would have only a vague idea that pretty much the same things happened in Gary and Buffalo and Cleveland and Camden—if Detroit got it worse, it was partly because it had it better. What’s more, the same thing (minus the gun violence, an American specialty) happened in the North of England. Liverpool (which also had a pop efflorescence), Manchester, and Leeds all saw similar depressions. Read the English novelist Keith Waterhouse on what downtown Leeds was like, splendid and civic, during his Yorkshire childhood in the forties, and the Detroit agony seems universal.","2375","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"The rise in urban violence certainly played a decisive role in the American disaster. Maraniss details the first significant clash between police and citizens in the sixties, caused by the killing of a prostitute known as St. Cynthia, in recognizably muddled circumstances. The local community’s suspicion of the police was not assuaged by the possibility that in this particular case the police were not at fault, or by what Maraniss records as the genuinely good intentions of the recently appointed police commissioner. His book reminds us that amnesia about the effect of crime on middle-class voters is a dangerous narcotic for liberal politics. It was crime and the fear of violence, however paranoid or overstated, that impelled the rise of Richard Nixon, and of George Wallace, and fuelled the paranoia about cities that became a staple of the American political diet for decades. Maraniss shows us that periods of progressive politics—and one of the most heartbreaking things in his chronicle is the certainty, of Dr. King among others, that Detroit was at the onset of an upward-moving arc—coincide not with periods of heightened despair but with periods of rising expectations. (Black Lives Matter rose under Obama because a reminder of residual bigotries met an increasing expectation of equality of treatment.) Walter Reuther was well to the left of Bernie Sanders, but he understood that his union needed a better Ford, in both senses. The U.A.W. could get more power for itself and benefits for its members when there was more to share. Someone once called anti-Semitism the socialism of fools, meaning that imagining that Jewish financiers were responsible for inequality was a half-witted way of explaining it. Sentimentality about urban violence is the progressivism of fools, a half-witted insistence that the American middle class, itself plagued by economic insecurities, is more likely to pay tender attention to cities if they are made unlivable.","2376","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"Granting that what looks peculiar to a place usually turns out to be endemic to a kind, has anyone found a cure for the common modern urban ills? The two best books about American cities—Reyner Banham’s on Los Angeles and Jane Jacobs’s “The Death and Life of Great American Cities,” which is essentially about New York—share an oddly double-headed ideology. Both Banham and Jacobs believe in unplanned, organic, emergent cities. Banham’s ecstatic expressway is an expression of L.A.’s endless appetite for elsewhere; Jacobs’s beloved street corner expresses New York’s nightly celebration of community. Their ideas are conservative and bottom up, in one sense, but also progressive and top down, inasmuch as both writers believe that intelligent government decisions create the places where the unplanned can happen. The expressway is Jacobs’s enemy and Banham’s friend, but they both know that expressways are not self-made. So there is a kind of tension in the way they describe the cities they love, and that tension may be built into what cities are: highly organized and planned—gridded and gated—yet unpredictable in their unfolding pattern.","2377","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"What we need, obviously, and find hard to make, are stable pots and beautiful flowers, good plans producing open forms. We mourn the small stores lost and the neighborhood neutered, even as we recognize that cities depend for their future on new ways of selling and buying and living. Cities often produce whatever the next wave of social change is going to be, and then violently reject it for altering the nature of the city. The tech kids clustering in San Francisco depend on the special virtues of the old San Francisco—contiguity, character, charm—which they cannot help but diminish. The old city recoils, even as it is, inevitably, remade. As city people, we are our own pathogens and our own patients.","2378","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"Can we be our own doctors, too? Certainly, the chief way that cities have renewed and restored themselves in recent times is through the process that has the ill-given name of gentrification—ill-given because it is dehumanizing to fix under the label “gentry” the mixture of social types who reënter the urban arena, ranging from real-estate keeners to young gay couples to painters seeking space, just as it is to label a similar mixture of social types an “underclass.” (And the gentry are, often enough, the ambitious locals, as in Harlem, where Calvin Butts’s Abyssinian Baptist Church is the single most potent agent of change.) D. W. Gibson’s “The Edge Becomes the Center: An Oral History of Gentrification in the Twenty-first Century” is a fair example of how the topic often gets treated. The book’s aim is to highlight the voices of the dispossessed and the often rightly aggrieved, with one meek lawyer there to say that the High Line has become that scam. The problem, Gibson suggests, is with property itself; reading a pamphlet titled “Squatting in New York City,” he’s captivated by the phrase “the sin of property.” (Proudhon thought it merely theft; the Catholic imprecation is newer.) This is odd for someone who presumably wishes to preserve the New York City that immigrants built and loved. They did not believe that property was sin. They believed that property was salvation—that a small house or a corner store was the path out of immigrant poverty. At the end, Gibson holds out the fear that New York may yet become Detroit, but the truth is that stagnation strikes cities in many ways, and that the homogeneity that threatens New York is entirely a problem of unexpected civic success—too many people from too many places chasing too little property—not, as in Detroit, a civic failure so large that it causes the government, in effect, to give property away.","2379","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"Cities change. It is their nature. Those which stop changing stop being cities. Cities that change entirely, though, cease to be themselves. If there are sane grounds for hope, they lie in how resilient the social capital accumulated in cities turns out to be. Detroit today is, all agree who work there, a harsh place, haunted by the past, but one with real civic resources that are being called on for its renewal. The clashes between local people and new arrivals, in inner-city Detroit as elsewhere, are real, and a fit subject for a novel or a film or a real oral history; but they are not poisonous or intractable.","2380","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"If there is one book that might fill your heart with small but reasonable hope about the possibility of rebuilding social capital through civic instruction—in reinforcing organic community with social engineering—it is a 2008 study of dog shit. “New York’s Poop Scoop Law,” by Michael Brandow, tells the story of the Koch-era initiative to make people pick up after their dogs. We forget now that, while crime raged on the streets, dog shit lay beneath the feet of muggers and victims alike. Brandow is a dog lover, who, for much of his book, sneers at the absurdity of the law and at those who protect trees instead of accepting dogs, only to confess that, on the whole, it has worked wonderfully well. A combination of, so to speak, ground-up enterprise—citizens’ groups demanding cleaner streets—intelligent legislation, and a surprising surge of civic good will made into a durable social convention a law that most thought would be unenforceable or neglected. It arose from a perfect interaction of laws and manners, top-down instruction and bottom-up consensus. Civic groups acting to save their city inspired politicians to pass intelligent laws, and the laws became traditions so entrenched that no one now walks his poodle without a plastic bag. The streets of the city may not be paved with gold. But they are clean of dog poop. It’s a start. ♦","2381","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/naked-cities"
"On Friday, October 2nd, Jeb Bush was onstage at a college auditorium in Greenville, South Carolina, for a public interview with Alan Wilson, the state’s attorney general and a prominent figure in the right-wing firmament. Bush is sixty-two, but, thanks to a low-carb Paleo diet, he looks younger than he did when he left the Florida governor’s office eight years ago for a life in the business world. A trim physique, however, hasn’t boosted his appeal to potential voters. A new national poll showed that Bush’s support had sunk to four per cent; South Carolina, which has one of the most conservative Republican electorates in the country, and will hold its primary early next year, just after Iowa and New Hampshire, is crucial to winning the nomination. Once considered the front-runner, Bush is trailing a clutch of candidates, among them Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who have never held public office and encourage comparison to buffoons.","2382","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Jeb has presented himself as the most electable Republican candidate: willing to break with Republican orthodoxy on domestic issues such as immigration and education, and committed to breaking, if vaguely, with his brother’s legacy on foreign policy and to being, as he has said, his “own man.” Before Bush officially entered the 2016 campaign, he remarked to a group of C.E.O.s at a conference in Washington, D.C., that a successful candidate had to be willing to “lose the primary to win the general,” and should campaign “without violating your principles.” He meant that one must avoid the perennial trap of party primaries, in which “base voters,” the hard-core conservatives, force politicians to take extreme positions that will prove unpopular in a general election and, when later disavowed, expose the candidate as a phony. “It’s not an easy task, to be honest with you,” he noted. (Hillary Clinton faces a similar problem in her race for the Democratic nomination.)","2383","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But in his conversation with Wilson, and in a subsequent interview with me and other reporters, Bush veered toward the right. On domestic affairs, his view was neatly summarized by his answer to a question about gun control. It was the day after the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, and yet Bush rejected any calls for new legislation. He noted that he had confronted similar pressure for government action after tragedies while he was governor: “Look, stuff happens. There’s always a crisis, and the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.”","2384","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush was pilloried by Democrats for his “stuff happens” remark, but he defended it, telling me that the government doesn’t have a solution to every problem, and that sometimes government action makes matters worse. Some variety of a laissez-faire philosophy is standard for modern Republicans, at least on most domestic issues. But, increasingly in recent months, Bush, like a number of his colleagues, has been making the case for aggressive intervention abroad. Two days earlier, Russia had carried out its first air strikes in Syria. When I asked Bush how he would respond if he were President, he said that it was the lack of American action that had created the dire situation in Iraq and Syria, and invited the Russian military to bolster the Assad regime.","2385","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I think we need to stand up to Putin, not just as it relates to Syria,” Bush told me. “This sends a signal all around the world of the United States pulling back, not being serious. Our allies don’t believe that we’re going to have their back. And this emboldens our enemies.” Bush offered no details on how to “stand up to Putin” or what, exactly, he would do to pacify the killing floor of the Middle East and South Asia and reconcile the tangled rivalries and interests there. But his message to the base was clear: We must do something. And we must do it now.","2386","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush’s view represents a return to a simplistic interventionism that seemed discredited in the wake of the Iraq debacle. For decades, the G.O.P. has been split into two camps. The realists, who dominated the Presidency of Bush’s father, George H. W. Bush, emphasized diplomacy and coalitions over go-it-alone displays of force, and a skepticism about America’s ability to shape the internal dynamics of foreign countries. They also expressed a willingness to tolerate tyrannical regimes that advance U.S. interests or create greater stability in volatile regions of the world. The other camp—variously described as idealists, hawks, and neoconservatives—dominated the Presidency of Bush’s brother. They have more often called for the overthrow rather than the containment of hostile regimes, and they remain committed to exporting American-style democracy to places where it has never flourished.","2387","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"The hyper-interventionist foreign policy of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney was widely blamed for the Republican Party’s loss of Congress in 2006 and of the Presidency in 2008. But many hawks, once more in full voice, now believe that the Obama years—the emergence of ISIS, the crisis in Syria and Iraq, Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, the rise of Putin at a time of Russian isolation and economic weakness—have vindicated Bush. “Any Presidential candidate, the first thing he or she needs to do is put up a map of the Middle East in 2009 and one today,” John McCain, a leading hawk in the Senate, told me, as we discussed foreign policy in his office. “And point out that it is this President’s failures. He said he got out of conflicts. He got out of conflicts, but the conflicts didn’t end.”","2388","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Obama thinks that intractable foreign-policy crises should be guided by the physician’s maxim of “first, do no harm”—or, as his aides have said privately, “Don’t do stupid shit.” To Republican hawks, this sounds like a willful and dangerous abdication of American power and influence. Lindsey Graham, who is one of the long-shot Presidential candidates and McCain’s closest ally in the Senate, has called for ten thousand American troops to be sent back to Iraq. Last week, Chris Christie said that he would set up a no-fly zone in the Syrian airspace in which the Russians are now operating, and shoot down any planes that entered it.","2389","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But of all the Republican candidates vying to reform the world of foreign affairs only one belongs to a family of Presidents that, for better or worse, did so much to give that world its present shape. When Jeb Bush began his campaign, he enlisted as advisers some of the realists from his father’s camp, including the former Secretary of State James Baker. But the heaviest contingent consisted of his brother’s liege men: Paul Wolfowitz, the Defense Department official who made the ideological case for invading Iraq; John Hannah, who had been an adviser to Dick Cheney and pushed bad intelligence into Colin Powell’s famous speech at the U.N. making the case for war; Porter Goss, the former C.I.A. director who condoned waterboarding as an interrogation technique; and Stephen Hadley, the former national-security adviser, who took the blame for false assertions that President Bush made about nuclear yellowcake allegedly sought by Saddam Hussein from Niger.","2390","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

(Reich denies that he or the U.S. played any role in the coup.) In May, Jeb Bush, after providing a series of confusing responses on the issue, said that, given what is now known about the condition of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear-, biological-, and chemical-weapons program in 2003, he would not have invaded Iraq. Not all of his advisers share this sentiment.","2391","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I can defend the invasion of Iraq,” Reich told me. “What did the invasion of Iraq do? It caused all of the people who would’ve otherwise come and attacked us and killed Americans on our soil—it caused them to go to Iraq and die there. That may sound very brutal, or whatever, but we have seen what has happened when you have an Administration like the current one, that did not realize what Bush had done; sent the troops home from Iraq; created a vacuum that was filled by ISIS. And they’re killing Americans and everyone else—they’re mostly killing Muslims. I lay that at the feet of the Obama Administration.”","2392","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

"The American public’s appetite for military interventions runs in cycles. After the triumph of the Second World War, policymakers were emboldened to roll back Communism, but the miasma of Vietnam instilled a wariness of major overseas military entanglements that spanned the Carter and Reagan Presidencies. In 1991, the relatively quick and successful Gulf War sparked a new bipartisan consensus that American force could again be deployed wisely if it was undertaken with overwhelming strength and with the benefit of an international coalition. The lack of intervention in Rwanda was widely seen as a moral calamity for which politicians, including Bill Clinton, have apologized.","2394","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"That uneasy consensus lasted through the 2001 toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan. But the invasion of Iraq in 2003 came to be seen as such a catastrophic mistake that even its progenitor could not avoid casting blame on his own circle. George W. Bush, during his last two years in office, forced out Donald Rumsfeld and marginalized Dick Cheney. It was too late to save his own popularity. When voters went to the polls in November, 2008, Bush’s job-approval rating dipped to twenty per cent, the lowest of any outgoing President in the history of polling.","2395","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Voices of restraint can still be heard in the Party’s debates, including on Jeb Bush’s team. One adviser, in contrast to Reich, told me, “I’m sure he’s not going to invade Iraq again. We did that one. You can’t compare him to his brother, because his brother was operating in a different environment. We had just been attacked; we didn’t know what was coming next.”","2396","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

Other politicians of his generation, including Marco Rubio, also forty-four, were strongly influenced by 9/11, but Cruz told me that he draws more lessons from Reagan’s fight against Communism than from Bush’s and Obama’s fight against terrorism. “The foreign-policy events that shaped my world view the most did not occur in the past two Presidencies,” he said. “I believe in peace through strength. It’s worth underscoring. Reagan went through eight years in the Presidency, and the biggest country he ever invaded was Grenada.”","2399","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He emphasized that “among Republicans there is a spectrum of views of foreign policy. At one end, there is Rand Paul”—a non-interventionist who is the most skeptical of further involvement in Syria and Iraq. “At the other end, I would put John McCain. Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio are very similar to McCain. I would describe my views as a third point on the triangle.” He believes that “America should always be a clarion voice of liberty, and that the bully pulpit of the Presidency has enormous power. There is power to speaking the truth on a global stage.” He added, “However, speaking for freedom is not the same thing as using U.S. military force. Historically, America has always been reluctant to engage in military force.”","2400","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Reagan’s foreign policy was rhetorically idealistic but also deeply pragmatic. Although he described the Soviet Union as “the evil empire,” he was quick to negotiate with Gorbachev. Soon after Hezbollah attacked the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, in 1983, killing two hundred and forty-one Americans, Reagan said that a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon would send a “signal to terrorists everywhere: they can gain by waging war against innocent people.” But then he did it anyway, after concluding that the troops’ mission was unclear and that their presence offered too inviting a target to extremists.","2401","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"This strain of pragmatism was powerful enough that George W. Bush called for a “humble” foreign policy in his 2000 campaign, and condemned the kinds of democracy-building interventions for which he would later become known. Cruz strives to return the G.O.P. to its pre-9/11 philosophy. “If and when U.S. military force is required,” he told me, “it should, No. 1, always be to directly further the vital national security of the United States. No. 2, we should use overwhelming force. And, No. 3, we should get the heck out. It should not be the objective of our armed forces to engage in nation-building, to transform foreign nations into robust, utopian democracies.”","2402","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"While many Republicans now criticize Obama for not doing enough in Syria, Cruz was among those who opposed Obama’s 2013 request to strike Syria. “He repeatedly tried to justify this as ‘vindicating international norms,’ or as ‘the violation of international law,’ ” Cruz said. “It’s not the job of our military to behave like a law professor in a faculty lounge, vindicating international law. It’s the job of our military to protect the safety and security of three hundred and thirty million Americans.” He said that although “Assad is a monster” who “has used poison gas” and “killed hundreds of thousands of his own citizens,” he worries about what might happen “if the attack succeeds and you topple Assad, and the weapons then fall into the hands of Al Qaeda or Al Nusra or ISIS or any of the other radical Islamic terrorists.” (Donald Trump has said that he’s happy to have Russia in Syria fighting ISIS, though he failed to note that, so far, Russia has been mainly targeting U.S.-trained rebels, not ISIS.)","2403","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz added that the military commanders he has consulted insist that “the most potent tool to use against ISIS is overwhelming airpower.” He maintained that arming the Kurds in northern Iraq was a better alternative to sending U.S. troops. “We need boots on the ground, but they don’t necessarily need to be American boots,” he said. “The Kurds are our boots on the ground.”","2404","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But Cruz’s prescription may be more like Reagan’s supply-side tax cuts than like Reagan’s foreign policy: it promises enormous benefits with very little sacrifice. Graham, who wants American troops to lead the fight, scoffed at Cruz’s argument. “The Kurds don’t have any offensive capability,” he said, pointing out that Shiites and non-Kurdish Sunnis in Iraq and Syria would be as concerned about Kurdish advances as they are about ISIS. “They’re not gonna go down to Ramadi! Go ask the Kurds, ‘Would you help us liberate Syria?’ And they’d say, ‘Thank you, but no thank you.’ If you want to create a war to end all wars, have a marauding band of Kurds going through the Middle East.”","2405","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz has calculated that, despite the rise of ISIS, Republican voters are still hungover from the costly interventions of the Bush years, and that they share his skepticism about the ability of American troops to accomplish much in Iraq and Syria. “There are some politicians in Washington who approach foreign military action as if they’re playing Risk,” he said. “They want to deploy troops and command them in battle.” He added, “A number of politicians treat American boots on the ground as a talisman to demonstrate that they’re really tough.”","2406","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Obama, who has said that he was elected to end wars, not start them, has bombed more countries than George W. Bush did. But in fighting terrorism he has chosen to use drones and other forms of airpower, Special Forces, and proxy armies. Obama was skeptical about intervening to stop Muammar Qaddafi’s forces as they marched on a helpless population in Benghazi, Libya. He had to be talked into the operation by, among others, Hillary Clinton, and the result—a failed state in Libya that has created a haven for terrorists—shaped his skepticism about intervening in Syria.","2407","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Early on, key Republicans seemed to endorse Obama’s cautious approach. When Marco Rubio ran for the Senate in 2010, he supported Obama’s drawdown of troops in Iraq. As a former city commissioner in West Miami and then a state legislator, Rubio knew the foreign-policy issues that important Florida constituencies care about, such as the Jewish community’s staunchly pro-Israel views and the Cuban-American community’s fierce opposition to Castro. He had little experience with broader foreign-policy questions. In his early months in Congress, he supported attempts at diplomacy with Iran. During the 2013 fight over budget cuts, Rubio advocated for government-spending reform.

His shift might seem political, but he suggested that it was the result of becoming immersed in issues, as a senator, to which, as a candidate, he had given little thought. He noted that some of his opponents, including Jeb Bush, have never held federal office. “I’m a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee,” Rubio said. “I spend a significant amount of time working on these issues on a daily basis. So most certainly I’m going to have more insight than someone reading briefings from the staffers.”","2410","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio’s foreign policy is a clear response to Obama’s alleged retreat from the world. The President’s biggest mistakes, in this view, were all failures to intervene more aggressively. Rubio has said that he would have forcefully taken the side of demonstrators in Iran during the 2009 Green Revolution. “The President was so intent on negotiating with Iran’s tyrants that he did little to help its people,” he remarked in a speech in Washington in 2011.","2411","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But the key issue for many emerging Republican hawks was Obama’s failure to attack Assad when he used chemical weapons. Obama had drawn a “red line,” but then retreated. Instead, he accepted a deal negotiated with Putin to place the weapons under international control. “Everyone heard him,” Reich said. “He said, ‘I didn’t draw the red line, the world drew a red line.’ No, Mr. President, the world didn’t stand before the cameras in the White House and say that it was drawing a red line; you did. . . . It’s very dangerous.”","2412","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"George Shultz, who is ninety-four and is also a Bush adviser, was Reagan’s Secretary of State. He said that the red line was one of the biggest mistakes of Obama’s Presidency. “I don’t think the President realizes how much damage was done,” he said. “I remember when I was in marine boot camp, at the start of World War Two, and the sergeant hands me this rifle and says, ‘Take good care of this rifle—this is your best friend. Remember one thing: never point this rifle at anybody unless you’re willing to pull the trigger.’ No empty threats. That’s boot-camp wisdom. With Obama there are empty threats lying all over the place, and they undermine his credibility.”","2413","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"This outlook relies on some revisionist history. When Obama asked Congress for authorization to bomb Syria in 2013, several Republicans, Rubio among them, voted against the resolution in the Foreign Relations Committee, and many others announced that they would oppose it on the Senate floor. It never came to a vote. Rubio said that the Administration’s proposed attack was not sufficiently robust; now he cites the failure to use force as the reason for much of the current chaos, including Putin’s recent involvement.","2414","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio told me that years ago he warned that the power vacuums in the Middle East were being filled by Islamic extremists, and he noted ISIS’s growing role in Afghanistan, where it had previously had little presence. “If they continue unabated a year from now, we could live in a world where ISIS is now operating in vacated spaces in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya,” he said. Rubio is a favorite of G.O.P. hawks. Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas billionaire who spent some $100 million in the 2012 election and is wooed by almost every Republican candidate, is reportedly also a fan. But Rubio sounds more cautious when asked for details about how to defeat ISIS.","2415","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“Intervening doesn’t mean ground troops,” he said. “Intervening can be a lot of things.” He went on, “A full-scale invasion, sending a hundred thousand troops to Iraq right now, is probably not the best way to defeat ISIS. Because it very well may be what they hope will happen, because it will allow them to point to radicals around the world and attract more recruits and more funding. I think that the better approach is to empower Sunni tribes to defeat them. And they need a lot of help from us, including air strikes and special-op forces.”","2416","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"What Rubio laid out wasn’t very different from Obama’s current plan. When pressed, he conceded that many more American troops might be necessary. “There’s no magic number,” he said. “I don’t know if nine thousand is worse than eleven thousand. What matters is: first you have to establish a mission—what are you trying to achieve? Then you have to allow the military to come up with operations and how to achieve that mission. And that will determine the number in the mission, not the other way around.”","2417","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio, Graham, and many other Republicans believe that the nation’s foreign policy suffers from timidity, not from overexertion. The problem is in the execution, not the intervention itself. “Here’s what I’ve learned,” Graham told me. “If you don’t have a plan after you take Afghanistan down, after you take Iraq down, after you take Libya down, after you take Syria down, you’re going to regret it.”","2418","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

"Jeb Bush’s troubles began almost as soon as he declared his candidacy and included the eighty-five-year-old James Baker on his list. As Communism began to collapse, in 1989, Bush and Baker helped engineer a soft landing for the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the gradual reorientation of Europe’s Eastern Bloc countries toward the West. Hawks pilloried them for not asserting themselves strongly enough. When Bush went to Kiev, Ukraine, for instance, and warned Ukrainians not to secede from the Soviet Union, the address was mocked as the “chicken Kiev” speech. In 1991, after assembling a United Nations-backed coalition to push Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, Bush and Baker ignored the pleas of American neoconservatives who wanted U.S. forces to march on Baghdad and overthrow Saddam following the uprisings against his rule. They were again demonized. Wolfowitz said that it was as if America were “idly watching a mugging.” In 2006, Baker co-chaired the Iraq Study Group, which recommended a dramatic change in Bush’s policy in the Middle East, including the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Iraq and diplomatic engagement with Iran and Syria, policies that Bush rejected.","2421","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"When Baker appeared on Jeb Bush’s list, neoconservatives expressed alarm. His foreign-policy views—diplomacy, stability, and serious doubts about interventions requiring large numbers of U.S. troops—are closer to Obama’s than to George W. Bush’s. Jeb Bush faced a revolt from donors and excoriation in neoconservative publications. A few weeks after Jeb’s announcement, Baker was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at a Washington gala dinner for J Street, the liberal-leaning pro-Israel group founded in 2008 to act as a counterweight to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Commentary published an article about “Jeb Bush’s James Baker Problem” and warned that Jeb may be Baker’s “kindred spirit.” Mark Levin, an influential talk-radio host, wrote that “Jeb Bush turns to Israel-hater, Jim Baker, for foreign policy advice.” Adelson reportedly sent word to Bush that he should pressure Baker to cancel the speech. Bush declined, and Adelson’s allies leaked that Adelson wouldn’t support Bush.","2422","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"At the J Street dinner, Baker criticized Benjamin Netanyahu for “diplomatic missteps and political gamesmanship,” and spoke about his own role in the first Bush Administration’s withholding of loan guarantees to Israel in order to pressure the government to halt settlement construction. William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, called Baker “anti-Israel,” and tweeted, “Thankfully, James Baker doesn’t speak for today’s Republican Party.” Morton Klein, the president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America, told Bloomberg that Bush’s association with Baker would cost the candidate: “There are many mega-donors who will not be with him because of that.”","2423","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In May, Bush appeared in New York, at the Metropolitan Club, before an audience of financiers organized by Paul Singer, a hedge-fund manager and the kind of Republican mega-donor Klein had warned about. Someone asked Bush to explain Baker’s influence on his policymaking. According to the Washington Post, Jeb “said that he respected Baker, but maintained that he is not part of his foreign-policy team.” CNN, which cited four sources and the notes of someone present, quotes Bush as saying, “What you need to know is that who I listen to when I need advice on the Middle East is George W. Bush.” The Bush campaign later insisted that Jeb was speaking narrowly about Israeli policy. Either way, the message was clear: the hawks were back in control of Republican foreign policy.","2424","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Lately, in his effort to be his “own man,” Bush has displayed a willingness to move even further to the right than his brother. At the October 2nd interview in South Carolina, Wilson asked him about the U.S. prison at Guantánamo Bay. During George W. Bush’s tenure, the prison became such a source of shame for America that even Bush, who was loath to acknowledge mistakes or to bow to international pressure, said in 2007, “It should be a goal of the nation to shut down Guantánamo.” Jeb disagrees. Wilson asked if Guantánamo prisoners should be moved to maximum-security facilities in the U.S. “No,” Jeb said. “There is no option for these folks. They should stay where they are. Even if it’s—it’s expensive. It’s the nicest prison you’ll ever want to be in, by the way. And the rights of these terrorists are way beyond what a lot of people get in a lot of different circumstances. They’re not being mistreated at all. But there is no other option.”","2425","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"If the economy improves, and Democrats continue to maintain an advantage on domestic issues, the Republican candidates will increasingly highlight foreign policy, an area of perceived vulnerability for Obama and Clinton. McCain, who lost to Obama in 2008, said, perhaps hopefully, “National security, foreign policy, and terrorism will play a greater role in the decision-making of the American people than at any time since 1980.” He insisted that although Bush’s record on foreign policy contributed to his own defeat, “it has gone from a significant negative” at the start of the Obama Administration “to what has become more and more of a positive.”","2426","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In August, Bush travelled to Simi Valley, California, to give a speech on foreign policy at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Bush called Reagan “a leader of clarity and resolve, not given to idle words,” someone “who took command of events, rebuilt America’s strength, and moved the world toward peace.” But when he shifted from Reagan’s Cold War successes to more recent events his speech sounded more like a tribute to the Administration of George W. Bush.","2427","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“No leader or policymaker involved will claim to have gotten everything right in the region, Iraq especially,” he said. But he argued that, whatever mistakes were made, it was the surge of troops in 2007 that “turned events toward victory.” The surge “was a success—brilliant, heroic, and costly.” It was Obama who lost Iraq, not his brother. The “premature withdrawal was the fatal error,” Jeb said, referring to Obama’s gradual drawdown, “creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill—and that Iran has exploited to the full as well.”","2428","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He then turned this logic against the Democrats’ most likely nominee. “ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat,” he said. “And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the President himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away. In all her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly one time.”","2429","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Clinton herself has tried to create some distance from Obama’s record. Since leaving the Administration, she has repeatedly said that as Secretary of State she urged Obama to do more in the early days of the Syrian uprising against Assad, when moderates could still be found in that country and American intervention could, arguably, have made a difference. Obama has dismissed that view as “a fantasy.” But, whatever Clinton actually believes about the correct course in the Middle East, she has already shown that she will adopt the campaign position that best suits her politically. In early October, facing a challenge from the left from Bernie Sanders, she reversed her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that she championed as Secretary of State.","2430","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"It’s easy to attack Obama as feckless in the face of the chaos in Libya, Syria, and Iraq. Less apparent is how to translate vague campaign promises to do something into a plan that won’t put more American lives at risk. After Jeb Bush spoke with Wilson in South Carolina, he met with reporters backstage. His aides were scrambling to contain any fallout from the “stuff happens” remark, which had immediately elicited a response from President Obama, and echoed one of the most notorious statements of the Bush Administration: Rumsfeld’s declaration during the chaos in Iraq that “stuff happens.” After defending his remark, Jeb Bush then took some questions about Syria, Iraq, and Putin.","2431","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He has called for a no-fly zone over Syria that would help a Sunni-led army fight a two-front war against Assad and ISIS, but it’s unclear who would make up the forces. He told reporters that American airpower in Syria is “restricted by lawyers kind of imposing all sorts of conditions.” He would change the rules, he said, so “that it would be there to fight to win.” He didn’t specify which rules he would lift, but, as Graham noted, almost every military expert dismisses the idea that airpower alone can defeat ISIS. “The only way you destroy a big ground opponent is with another big ground opponent,” Graham told me. “You’re not going to bomb ISIL into submission. You gotta go tear the caliphate up by the roots. That means going into Syria on the ground.”","2432","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"To fight ISIS in Iraq, Bush made the familiar argument that America should arm the Kurds and “embed with the Iraqi military,” both of which Obama is effectively doing. When asked whether he would send more troops, Bush said that the U.S. already has thirty-five hundred troops in Iraq and that the real issue was how to better integrate them into Iraqi forces. Pressed further, he conceded, in a roundabout way, that he would be willing to send more American troops back to Iraq.","2433","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I would listen to the military commanders and I would create a strategy,” he said, a phrase that politicians revert to whenever they want to avoid details. “If it required more supportive troops, fine.” The statement was a reminder of Bush’s continuing dilemma: can he get the nomination without violating his principles? In the months since the start of his campaign, he has only clouded the matter of what, precisely, he stands for.","2434","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

"“I don’t even know what that means anymore,” he said. “In 1992, it meant the end of Communism, and that the United States needed to play a constructive role in forging peace and security, and we still have that role to play. We have threats that are created by our absence. Just look at what’s going on in Syria as an example of that, where we have no strategy, where Putin, agile as he is, ends up injecting himself into something that makes it harder for me to imagine that this brutal Assad regime will depart.” He thought for a moment and added, “American leadership matters.” ♦","2436","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In the early months of 1846, a hundred and twenty-six sailors and officers, commanded by Captain John Franklin of the Royal British Navy, sailed south from their winter harbor on Beechey Island, in the Canadian Arctic. They went in search of the Northwest Passage, the fabled route connecting the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific; what they found instead was some of the thickest sea ice in the world. Their two ships, H.M.S. Erebus and H.M.S. Terror, became trapped in Victoria Strait. After two winters on the ice, the survivors, weakened by scurvy, starvation, and lead poisoning from poorly canned goods, made a desperate break for the mainland. They died hundreds of miles from safety. Not until September of 2014 was the wreck of the Erebus discovered, at the bottom of Queen Maud Gulf; the Terror is still missing.","November 2, 2015","2437","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-new-map-of-the-arctic"
"The Franklin expedition vanished on the cusp of the industrial age. In the course of the next century, as humanity embraced the coal-fired power plant and the internal-combustion engine, the face of the Arctic started to change in ways that could not be explained by seasonal variation. Since 1979, when scientists began using satellites to track the phenomenon, the annual minimum extent of the region’s ice coverage has fallen by more than eleven per cent each decade. Today, a study published in Nature Climate Change suggests that, in a matter of decades, the Arctic sea-ice system will have completely departed from the range of variability that would have been recognizable to Franklin and his crew.","2438","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-new-map-of-the-arctic"
"The new study uses daily satellite measurements and a computer model to reconstruct historic variations in the Arctic open-water season—the ice-free times of year—and to forecast future changes. By 2050, the study predicts, the entire Arctic coastline and most of the Arctic Ocean will experience sixty more days of open water than they did in 1850. By 2100, assuming that greenhouse-gas emissions continue to rise at current rates, much of the Arctic will experience a hundred and fifty more days of open water than it did in 1850. Some places that never saw open water in preindustrial times will be ice-free for at least half the year. The section of Victoria Strait that foiled the Erebus and the Terror, for instance, was ice-free for an average of twenty-five days each year in Franklin’s time; now it averages about seventy-five. By 2025, the study predicts, that number will be close to a hundred.","2439","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-new-map-of-the-arctic"
"Where most studies of Arctic sea ice track over-all declines in the extent of ice coverage, the Nature Climate Change paper provides a newly detailed picture of the open water left behind—a forecast that is particularly useful to humans and other species now adapting to a warming Arctic. “If you’re a walrus in Alaska, or a polar bear in Hudson Bay, or a phytoplankton somewhere above a continental shelf in the Arctic, you may not be affected by the changes in over-all sea-ice extent,” Katherine Barnhart, the lead author of the study, told me. “You will be affected by changes in the number of open-water days.” More open water means less resting and breeding room for walruses, smaller and more dangerous hunting grounds for polar bears and people, and dramatic shifts in the phytoplankton blooms that form the foundation of the Arctic food web. More open water also means that more heat from the sun is absorbed by the dark, ice-free surface of the Arctic Ocean, triggering an accelerating cycle of warming that can alter ocean circulation and, in turn, the entire global climate. (Several recent studies suggest that rapid Arctic warming is affecting the behavior of the polar jet stream, freezing the U.S. East Coast and baking the West.) “Water is an enormous heat reservoir,” James White, the director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado Boulder, told me. “As you open up the ocean, you’re basically putting a hot-water bottle on top of the earth.”","2440","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-new-map-of-the-arctic"
"The current and expected changes in Arctic sea ice have sparked a flurry of international interest in new shipping routes and newly accessible reservoirs of oil, gas, and minerals. Last month, for instance, Icelandic authorities commissioned a feasibility study of a large new deep-water harbor on the country’s northeastern coast. But Lawson Brigham, a professor of geography and Arctic policy at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and a former icebreaker captain, cautions that even at the end of the century the Arctic will remain a difficult place to travel. The Canadian archipelago, where Franklin foundered, will still be full of intersecting straits and fickle ice conditions, likely not smooth enough to compete directly with more temperate routes.","2441","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-new-map-of-the-arctic"

"In the spring of 2013, the consumer-products giant Procter & Gamble asked its former C.E.O. A. G. Lafley to come out of retirement and bail the company out of trouble. When Lafley stepped down, back in 2009, P. & G. seemed in fine shape, but his successor had floundered. Sales were falling short of expectations, and the company was losing market share to nimbler competitors. Lafley’s return seemed like just what was needed. During his first tour at P. & G., he turned the company into a consumer powerhouse and, in the process, became one of the most acclaimed C.E.O.s of his day, earning a reputation as a strategic visionary and an innovation guru. The day his return was announced, the company’s stock price jumped four per cent.

Lafley hasn’t been bad—he slimmed the company down, selling off parts and getting out of less profitable businesses—but there’s been no dramatic turnaround. Sales are growing very slowly; the stock price has significantly underperformed the market; and there have been no major product launches. P. & G. is still facing largely the same problems it was when Lafley came back. In other words, he’s been just O.K.","2444","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/the-comeback-conundrum"
"How could someone who, according to Fortune, was known as “an all-time C.E.O. hero” end up being just O.K.? Well, if commentators had looked at the track record of returning C.E.O.s—boomerang C.E.O.s, as they’re sometimes called—that’s precisely what they’d have predicted. A 2014 study found that profitability at companies run by boomerang C.E.O.s fell slightly, and an earlier study detected no significant difference in long-term performance between firms that reappointed a former C.E.O. and ones that hired someone new. We like triumphant comeback narratives—Jobs and, to a lesser extent, Howard Schultz, at Starbucks. But history tells us that Lafley’s rather ordinary second tour of duty is the way most of these stories end.","2445","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/the-comeback-conundrum"
"The idea that someone hailed as a business hero can produce wildly inconsistent results challenges our conception of the C.E.O. as what the Harvard Business School professor Rakesh Khurana has called a “corporate savior.” In fact, corporate success depends not just on the insight and leadership of the person at the top but also on factors—changing consumer tastes, demographic shifts, the broader state of the economy—over which the C.E.O. has little control. “Of course, the C.E.O. makes a difference,” Sydney Finkelstein, a professor of management at Dartmouth, told me. “But luck also plays a much bigger role than anyone wants to talk about.” It doesn’t help that C.E.O.s are generally called back in times of crisis. “The fact that a company is rehiring a C.E.O. is a sign of real weakness,” Finkelstein said. “So it’s often just a much tougher job the second time around.” Good C.E.O.s can adjust, but whether the wind is at their backs or in their faces makes a big difference. Even successful boomerangers rely on luck as well as on talent. Charles Schwab did a fine job turning around the company that bears his name when he returned, in 2004. But it’s no accident that his success coincided with a booming market.","2446","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/the-comeback-conundrum"
"Boomerang C.E.O.s typically face business conditions dramatically different from the ones in which they originally succeeded. Unfortunately, as the business professors Donald Hambrick and Guoli Chen have written, “an executive who is well suited to lead a firm during one period may be ill-suited for the next period.” The classic example here is Henry Ford, who was an ideal leader when the crucial competitive issue was efficiency. But when the car market matured, and appealing to consumer taste became more important, Ford found himself at sea. “Any color . . . so long as it’s black” was hardly a recipe for winning consumers’ hearts and minds. The real problem, as Finkelstein points out, is that successful companies often flourish because they perfectly fit their current environment. “But those companies are the ones most vulnerable to trouble when conditions change,” he says. Lafley, for instance, was brilliant at running P. & G. during the boom times of the two-thousands, emphasizing a premium-price strategy and expanding the company through acquisitions. Now, with post-recession consumers still frugal and P. & G.’s size looking more like a cost than like a benefit, Lafley has been forced to dismantle the empire he built. But he never managed to come up with a strategy to get P. & G. growing again.","2447","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/the-comeback-conundrum"

But so much of what we call greatness is attributable to factors that we generally ignore. Besides, it’s hard to stay on top forever. This is a problem not just for boomerang C.E.O.s but for all C.E.O.s. A widely cited study found that a C.E.O. who wins a major award is likely to underperform afterward. In this light, the smartest thing a C.E.O. with a sterling reputation can do when asked to come back is to remember the old showbiz maxim: Always leave them wanting more. ♦","2448","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/the-comeback-conundrum"

"But this was only the beginning. Just twenty-four years old at the time, Hernandez had nonetheless been an avid follower of politics since the 1968 Presidential campaign—“Who could forget those televised images from Chicago?”—and had read Theodore White’s classic “The Making of the President 1960,” as well as the political writings of Garry Wills. That background, he said, “plus some number-crunching research in the Marshall campus library,” provided the framework of a computer game. After three months of “tinkering,” in early 1981, Hernandez presented a finished product to Joel Billings, the twenty-three year-old head of nascent war-game developer Strategic Simulations. (Nineteen years later, Strategic Simulations was acquired by the video-game giant Ubisoft.)","2451","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"“Although we were far from each other on the political spectrum, we found a way to enjoy working together,” Billings told me. “His game was pretty amazing when you consider the number crunching it was doing at a time when the floppy disk contained only about 180K” of formatted media. Using basic policy positions, the game calculated every candidate’s political leanings on a numerical scale: zero represented an absolute conservative while a hundred was a pure liberal. According to Billings, Hernandez was a “three per cent, or max conservative,” on the scale at the time, while Billings was a “sixty per cent,” or a moderate liberal.","2452","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"The game, President Elect, was released in July of 1981, just three months after Hernandez had finished it. It simulated the final nine weeks of a Presidential campaign, from Labor Day to Election Night. Any election from 1960 through 1984 could be played out again, with the user acting as campaign manager, essentially, for a pre-programmed candidate—Jesse Helms, Geraldine Ferraro, George Romney—or an imagined one. New candidates were created by answering twenty-one questions about economic, social, and foreign policy—How does your candidate feel about the Cold War?—and then assigning scores, from one to ten, reflecting his or her speaking ability, poise, and personal magnetism. If you wanted to alter the historical scenario, you could tweak six external variables: inflation, unemployment, G.D.P. growth, war or peace, the mood of the country, and incumbency status.","2453","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"Once a candidate was chosen, the player guided him or her through a series of decisions during the course of nine turns: Where should the candidate travel abroad after declaring? How many “political-action points” should be spent on advertising? How will the campaign deal with random events, such as economic reports and national disasters?","2454","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"“It was quite primitive,” Hernandez said, “but for the dawn of the computer age, the predictive results seemed miraculous.” In 1984, the game predicted a huge landslide for Ronald Reagan in almost every scenario short of a national disaster. Sure enough, Reagan won forty-nine states and came within a few thousand votes of winning Minnesota, which was the home state of his opponent, Walter Mondale.","2455","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"Some criticized the game for being biased toward conservative candidates like Reagan. “But in reality,” Hernandez told me, “you had one of the most magnetic Presidents of the century against a below-average politician, in an economy that was roaring in 1984. The country’s mood was much more optimistic. So that year’s outcome was extremely predictable.” Ray Charles sang at the Republican National Convention that year. “The game didn’t simulate the Ray Charles effect,” Hernandez joked. “So, if anything, it was biased toward the Democrats.”","2456","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"In 1982, Hernandez received a phone call from someone who said that he liked the game and wanted Hernandez to join his fledgling company. It consisted of just six other people at the time, but their aim was to become the biggest entertainment-software corporation in the world in five years. “I thought he was nuts,” Hernandez said. “Anyway, I was legally bound to the Army for another three years, so it was out of the question.” The guy on the phone was Trip Hawkins, the founder of Electronic Arts—also known as E.A. Games—which is now one of the largest gaming companies in the world.","2457","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"President Elect became something of a cult favorite, selling forty-five thousand copies through its final iteration, in 1987, before Strategic Simulations discontinued it. In President Elect ’88, players could pick from sixty-nine pre-programmed Presidential candidates, including Joseph Biden, Bill Clinton, and Oliver North. It was also made available for the Commodore 64, the Atari ST, and computers running DOS, as well as the old Apple II. As the blogger Douglas Kern, a devotee of the game, wrote, years later, “Who needs Nintendo when you can watch Pat Robertson shoot down George McGovern in a 1984 Presidential debate?”","2458","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"Hernandez bemoans the current state of Presidential politics, which he called a “high-stakes reality-game show.” “I most lament the complete absence of intellectualism in campaigns,” he said. Still, he said that he believes, with some adjustments, that President Elect could simulate the 2016 election: “I never appreciated what a great franchise I had and all the things that could have been done to elaborate the game design with the help of a better programmer.” Hernandez told me that, at this point, he thinks he could only be a “spiritual leader” for someone like Nate Silver, who could improve the predictive aspects of the game, while others could update its design by incorporating the changing demographics of the electorate, campaign financing, and other facets of contemporary campaign management. “Probably you’d need to design the game so that you could toggle different complicating elements: easy enough for a child or deep enough for a political scientist. But, absolutely, it could work.”","2459","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"Other Presidential simulation games have appeared since President Elect, including Balance Of Power, Shadow President, CyberJudas, Commander in Chief, SuperPower, and Democracy. Most of them put the player in the role of President and take much longer to complete. “As a piece of software, you might argue that President Elect is superior to those other games,” Mike Knotts, a writer and game reviewer for the Web site Geekometry, told me. “It takes a complex subject and turns it into an approachable and fun game that is also a very deep and sophisticated simulation.”","2460","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"In Hernandez’s view, the two most important factors in an election—both of them too subjective to be easily quantified—are a candidate’s magnetism and the country’s mood. “This cycle, the Democrats have a dearth of magnetic candidates,” he said. “Senator Sanders and Vice-President Biden are roughly at par and, in my estimation, average at best. Senator Clinton, on the other hand, is above average in public speaking and less prone to gaffes. But her magnetism is the worst of any Democratic nominee since Michael Dukakis.”","2461","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"As for the candidate who has received the most press coverage, Hernandez said, “Mr. Trump is a special case that breaks any algorithm I devised in the early eighties. He has high magnetism but is terribly gaffe-prone. His speaking ability—a proxy for his debating skill—is average, which is to say, polarizing. But ideologically he is a cipher. Where things break down for Trump is that there are so many people who intensely dislike him for his perceived lack of substance or his brash New York style. My game could not possibly conceive a candidate such as he winning the G.O.P. nomination.”","2462","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"Pressed to pick one someone who could, Hernandez, who is now a financial analyst, mostly demurred. “We cannot know what the mood will be in November, 2016,” he said. “We cannot know if the economy will hold together or sink into recession; we cannot know if some world event will change our focus, usually on economic and domestic matters, to foreign policy or matters of war and peace. On the whole, though, the G.O.P. seems to have the candidates to win. I believe the eventual G.O.P. ticket will consist of—pick two, in any order—Carson, Rubio, and Fiorina.”","2463","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"Some aging fans of President Elect wish that they had an updated version of the game to play out such predictions. “So much has changed in twenty-seven years,” Douglas Kern told me. “A new version of the game is sorely needed. But then, anyone who could accurately model the mood of the current electorate could surely make a fortune doing things other than programming cerebral video games.”","2464","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-short-impressive-life-of-the-first-presidential-election-video-game"
"The mainstream reaction to the forced resignation of John Boehner as the Speaker of the House has been a kind of weary admiration. He fought the good fight against the extremists in his Republican caucus, the narrative goes, but his solid Midwestern virtues (he’s from Ohio) were ultimately no contest for the extremism of the Tea Party. This interpretation is far too generous to Boehner, whose failures, political and substantive, were due mostly to cowardice. The tragedy of Boehner is that he could have been a great Speaker, even on his own terms, but instead his legacy is one of almost complete failure.","September 29, 2015","2465","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"Boehner long made it clear that he was a dedicated party man, who believed that what was good for the G.O.P. was good for the country as well. This is how the issue of comprehensive immigration reform came to be the true crucible of his speakership. Following President Obama’s reëlection, in 2012, it was clear that Republicans had to try to appeal to Hispanic voters. In March of 2013, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, released a report saying that the Party “must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.” In short order, many Republicans in the Senate, including such prominent figures as John McCain and Marco Rubio, did just that, and a bill which included a path to citizenship for a majority of undocumented immigrants passed by a vote of sixty-eight to thirty-two.","2466","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"Boehner also supported immigration reform, at least in its broad outlines—because he correctly saw that it was good for both his party and his country. And there was no doubt that the reform bill could pass the House, with the support of most Democrats and a substantial number of Republicans as well. But Boehner’s Tea Party colleagues in the House opposed immigration reform. So the choice for Boehner, who controlled the House floor, was clear: pass a historic bill that would be good for the Republicans and for the republic, or appease the extremist elements in his party in hopes of hanging on to his position as Speaker.","2467","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"Boehner caved, refusing to bring the bill to the floor for a vote, and he suffered the fate of all those who give in to bullies; he was bullied some more. This year, the fight was over the highway bill, another piece of popular legislation that Boehner himself and a majority of the House (as well as the Senate and the President) supported—as well they might, given that maintenance of roads and bridges represents some of the basic work of government. But again the Tea Party intimidated Boehner into keeping the bill off the floor, depriving the Speaker of another major accomplishment.","2468","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"Boehner adopted an extreme version of the so-called Hastert rule, named for his predecessor as Speaker, Dennis Hastert, who is now under indictment for alleged financial crimes connected to blackmail payments (he has pleaded not guilty). The Hastert rule holds that the Speaker should never allow a vote on a bill unless it’s supported by a majority of the Republican caucus. But Boehner’s approach was to keep bills off the floor that were opposed by a minority of Republicans—the Tea Party caucus, which only numbers about fifty—effectively giving them a veto over the work of the House. Nothing came to the floor without their say-so, so that meant that nothing much came to the floor except for symbolic exercises like votes to repeal Obamacare or to defund Planned Parenthood.","2469","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"When Boehner announced his impending departure, he expressed pride that he had kept the government open (after a sixteen-day shutdown in 2013) and raised the debt limit. This, to paraphrase a famous Republican, reflects the soft bigotry of low expectations. Keeping the government open and paying its debts are the minimal undertakings of an elected body, not legislative triumphs. But Boehner could point to almost nothing else that happened on his watch, because the Tea Party would tolerate nothing else.","2470","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"And what did Boehner’s cowardice in the face of the Tea Party stalwarts get him? They forced him out anyway. Boehner built his career around keeping his job, and he still failed. If Boehner had allowed the passage of immigration reform, it’s entirely possible that the Tea Party would have rebelled and evicted him—but at least he would have had a substantial accomplishment to his credit. Instead, Boehner tried nothing, accomplished nothing, and lost his job anyway. It’s the legacy he deserves.","2471","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"In early 2013, the R.N.C., under its current chairman, Reince Priebus, produced a searching report that tried to make sense of Mitt Romney’s 2012 defeat. When the report was released, the biggest news was its frank dissection of the G.O.P.’s weakness among groups that voted overwhelmingly for Obama. “Public perception of the Party is at record lows,” the document noted. “Young voters are increasingly rolling their eyes at what the Party represents, and many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country.”","November 2, 2015","2472","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"But, beyond the demographic warnings contained in the report, Priebus’s team also cautioned that the Republican Party was living in a cocoon. The report said that the G.O.P. was “increasingly marginalizing itself” at the federal level. “The Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself,” the report said. “We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people, but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue.”","2473","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"One of the report’s less-well-known recommendations had to do with primary debates. The number of G.O.P. Presidential primary debates had grown from six in 1980 to twenty in 2012. Republicans wanted to gain some control over the process in 2016. “The number of debates has become ridiculous, and they’re taking candidates away from other important campaign activities,” the report noted. The report recommended that the G.O.P. sanction no more than ten to twelve debates, a recommendation that Priebus later implemented.","2474","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"But there was another recommendation that wasn’t adopted. Buried in the report was this idea:","2475","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Ultimately, the R.N.C. decided against setting up its own organization to run its debates. Instead, it stuck with the model of partnering with media organizations to conduct them, partly because of the high costs of running its own debates and partly because the R.N.C. worried that setting up its own debates might make the events less credible.","2476","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"All of this was decided long before any of the candidates announced their campaigns for President. (The Republican debate schedule was released in January, 2014.) The candidates were essentially stuck with the agreements that the R.N.C. had already negotiated with the various media outlets.","2477","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Last week, after the CNBC debate that most of the candidates complained was unfair and featured hostile moderators, the campaigns finally revolted against the Priebus-negotiated debates. Representatives from most of the Republican Presidential campaigns met near Washington on Sunday night to wrest control from Priebus and the R.N.C. Today, they released a draft letter with their demands—which essentially consist of having their cake and eating it, too. The campaigns that sign the letter want the media to host and televise the events, but they want a level of control that they would get from running them and paying for them themselves. (Donald Trump is reportedly going to negotiate on his own.) The section of the letter that immediately caught the attention of many in the media was the following:","2478","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Most people would agree that the Republican (and Democratic) Parties should have some say in how the debates are run and organized. These are, after all, not just news events or typical media interviews. They are partnerships between the media and a political party. It’s fair that the mechanics of the debate, such as the format, length of time, rules, and the moderators, should all be up for negotiation. For instance, the R.N.C. asked its mainstream-media partners to add a conservative media outlet to the events, to insure that the questioning would reflect some of the issues important to Republican primary voters.","2479","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"But surely the red line for any media organization has to be editorial content. After all, the R.N.C. rejected the option of running these debates on its own. It is the media that is paying for the events, and it is over the media’s airwaves that the events are broadcast.","2480","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Of course, if the candidates don’t get their way, they don’t have to attend the debates. They could, as they have threatened to do, boycott future R.N.C.-sanctioned events, just as Donald Trump threatened to boycott the CNBC debate. (There’s a precedent for this. In 2007, the Democrats cancelled a Fox News debate, though in that case Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton did not demand to control any elements of Fox News’s editorial content as a precondition for participating in the event.)","2481","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"What the candidates shouldn’t be allowed to do is tell reporters what questions to ask or what graphics to show on the screen, or have any role whatsoever in the editorial judgments of a news organization.

"In late February, 1944, when the United States was at war and national unity was in fashion, the Democratic Senate Majority Leader, Alben Barkley, announced that he was resigning, effective immediately; he put down his gavel and walked out of the Capitol building. But unlike Speaker John Boehner, who on September 24th told Republican House members that he intended to quit at the end of October, Barkley’s complaint was not a rebellion from fellow Democrats but arrogance in the White House. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, he felt, had little regard for the Senate and, with provocative disrespect, had vetoed a revenue and tax bill, something his fellow Democrats had pleaded with him not to do.","October 20, 2015","2483","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"For Barkley, who had served in Congress for thirty-one years and was sometimes mocked as Roosevelt’s lapdog, that was one humiliation too many. He declared that “there is something more precious to me than any honor that can be conferred upon me….and that is the approval of my own conscience and my own self-respect.” What followed, as the New York Herald Tribune reported, was something that bore little resemblance to the sour aftermath of Boehner’s decision: an “ovation unprecedented within the memory of Senators now living.…Senators on both sides of the floor broke the customary rule of decorum and rose in their places to applaud.…The business of the Senate was suspended for ten minutes while the congratulations went on.”","2484","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"There was no such outpouring for Boehner, and little appreciation for his futile attempts to bring stability and civility to a House divided by factions and, in the case of the House Freedom Caucus, an ideological certitude bordering on zealotry. During Boehner’s tenure the “people’s House” became a virtually rudderless organization that now seems unable even to choose a replacement leader. Its members were in full rebellion against—what, exactly? The Freedom Caucus leader, Ohio’s Jim Jordan, seems to crave more legislative anarchy: “reform” that would allow anyone to introduce, and offer for debate, even hopelessly doomed bills and amendments, a process that he said “will benefit everyone.” It has the potential to make caucus members sound like Steve Martin in his routine as a hostage-taker with three demands: a hundred thousand dollars in cash, a getaway car, “and I want the letter ‘M’ stricken from the English language.”","2485","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"Back in 1944, the Times saw Barkley’s resignation as “the greatest political crisis of [Roosevelt’s] three terms”; the Trib called it “one of the most dramatic conflicts between the executive and legislative branches” in American history. Outside Washington, there was alarm at the seeming inability of the President and Congress to cooperate; it was front-page news in wartime London, where headlines said, “Roosevelt faces grave crisis on home front” and “Democrat rages at FDR.” There was concern that Roosevelt’s leadership in foreign affairs might be compromised, especially after his veto was overturned by embarrassingly large margins (299–95 in the House, and 72–14 in the Senate).","2486","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"In the case of the Boehner, the world outside Washington didn’t seem to care very much, which was not surprising. Why should anyone care? In a list of problems facing the planet, Boehner’s pending departure, the abdication of Kevin McCarthy, the unenthusiastic courtship of Paul Ryan to take a job he doesn’t seem to want—maneuverings barely comprehensible to most Americans—would probably not rank high.","2487","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"Unlike the disarray in Boehner’s House, the intramural Democratic fight in the 1944 Senate was resolved with great haste. Roosevelt sent Barkley a “Dear Alben” message that, after recounting their differences vis-à-vis the tax bill and assuring Barkley that he didn’t doubt his good faith, went on to “hope your colleagues will not accept your resignation; but if they do, I sincerely hope that they will immediately and unanimously re-elect you.” That is precisely what happened; history’s earthquake ended overnight. Perhaps because the sixty-six-year-old Barkley harbored Presidential, or Vice-Presidential, ambitions (he wanted to run with F.D.R. in 1944; he became Harry Truman’s running mate in 1948), he still flattered Roosevelt. He told F.D.R. that he had worked for him “with an inspiration, a devotion, and a personal affection which has not been approached by any other men.” He was still able to burn bridges and then cross them.","2488","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"But if little seemed different after Barkley’s one-day drama, there was nonetheless a significant change: he emerged from his reinstatement, as the Trib pointed out, as the “majority’s majority leader” rather than a Roosevelt whip. He had become his own man, which gave him increased stature in both branches of government. Boehner’s successor, who will need approval from the forty-person Freedom Caucus, may end up being the “majority’s minority’s Speaker.”","2489","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"Alben Barkley had many of the attributes of a bloviating politician, but he did rise to this singular occasion, writing to Roosevelt that “there is something broader and more fundamental than any personal acquiescence as between you and me over matters of public policy and fundamental principles.” He continued, “In this great crisis of our nation’s history we must all seek some common ground….If we cannot trust one another…how can the people trust us?” Someday it will certainly be asked why House Republicans in the Boehner era were unable to ask the same question.","2490","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"There was a time—how often has this sentence been written?—when the Republican Party stood for certain ideas, even if they sometimes contradicted each other: for instance, antipathy toward high marginal tax rates and a belief in balanced budgets. On issues involving national security and economic emergencies, many were willing to entertain, and even seek, coöperation from Democrats, as happened after the financial collapse of 2008. It was the approach taken by our postwar (or post-New Deal) Republican Presidents, up to and including George W. Bush, even if the party went through occasional ideological swerves, as when it nominated the sometimes alarming conservative Arizona senator Barry Goldwater, in 1964. But the real live-and-let-live Goldwater, popular with his Senate colleagues, never fully fit his scary image.","October 1, 2015","2491","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"The emergence of the Republican Class of ’16 may be changing the shape of historic Republicanism once and for all. Part of it stems from the “outsiders”—Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina, who have never held elective office and probably never will. But no one better embodies this change than the freshman Texas senator Ted Cruz, who seems unable to stop talking, although the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, recently outsmarted him, as Politico’s Burgess Everett put it, by effectively putting him in party “quarantine.” (McConnell, like past Senate leaders such as Howard Baker and Bob Dole, has the job here of representing the sanity wing of the party.) Cruz, though, knows where to find receptive audiences, as when he recently spoke to the conservative religious Values Voter Summit, in Washington, and went on to win the group’s straw poll, for the third year in a row. (Cruz got thirty-five per cent, followed by Carson, at eighteen per cent, and Mike Huckabee, the perennial champion of his own values, at fourteen per cent.)","2492","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Cruz still surprises. Just when you think he can’t go any further, he goes further. Considering the venue, you can understand why he got an appreciative laugh at the “Values” meeting when he mentioned Xi Jinping’s meeting with President Obama and said, “Media all across the world are reporting on this historic meeting of the world’s most powerful Communist, and the President of China.” (Drum roll.) But his ear has difficulty recognizing the proper key. A few days after Vice-President Joe Biden’s son Beau died, of a brain tumor, Cruz was having his fun: “Joe Biden … You know what the nice thing is? You don’t even need a punch line. I promise you, it works. At the next party you’re at, just walk up to someone and say, ‘Vice-President Joe Biden,’ and just close your mouth. They will crack up laughing.” That wasn’t nearly as funny as the Obama-is-a-big-Communist gag, and perhaps that’s why Cruz offered an apology.","2493","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"On foreign policy, Cruz is even less funny, as when he dilated on the Iran nuclear deal: “If you vote for me, under no circumstances will a nation led by a theocratic Ayatollah, who chants ‘Death to America,’ under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.” So far, that is pretty much what Obama says. Cruz, though, added, “If the Ayatollah doesn’t understand that, we may have to introduce him to his seventy-two virgins,” which sounded very much like a threat to murder Iran’s Supreme Leader. Cruz did not approve of recent Supreme Court decisions that upheld the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage. His solution, as he told Steve Inskeep, of NPR’s “Morning Edition,” is a constitutional amendment—“one that would make members of the Supreme Court subject to periodic judicial retention elections … [so that] if judges overstep their bounds, violate the Constitution, then the people have a check to remove them from office.” This was an attack on a branch of government far more radical than Franklin D. Roosevelt’s infamous “court packing” scheme, in 1937, to add as many as six members when Justices reached age seventy and didn’t retire.","2494","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Sounding mean-spirited and over the top is nothing new in American politics. Senator Joseph McCarthy, to whom Cruz bears a slight physical resemblance (it’s the eyebrows), made use of the Red Scare to attack Democrats. McCarthy, like Louisiana’s Huey Long, belonged to a subcategory of demagogic, disruptive senators, a role that suits Cruz perfectly. McCarthy never ran for President.","2495","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Cruz’s thoughts and language bring to mind the 1993 American Scholar essay “Defining Deviancy Down,” by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (though not Moynihan himself). In it, Moynihan writes, “I proffer the thesis that, over the past generation … the amount of deviant behavior in American society has increased beyond the levels the community can ‘afford to recognize’ and that, accordingly, we have been re-defining deviancy so as to exempt much conduct previously stigmatized, and also quietly raising the ‘normal’ level in categories where behavior is now abnormal by any earlier standard.” Moynihan was writing about crime and antisocial behavior in general, but the change in standards might just as well apply to politics. That someone like Ted Cruz is running for President, and taken seriously—that nearly sixty per cent of Republicans now support, in aggregate, Trump, Fiorina, Carson, and Cruz—suggests that the modern Republican Party is close to “defining politics down.” With more than a year to go before the next Presidential election, Cruz may be posing the essential question: “How far down?”","2496","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"On the morning of October 10th, Marco Rubio, Florida’s junior senator, mounted a small stage at the Elks Lodge in Boulder City, Nevada, a popular retirement spot near Las Vegas. In his twenties, as an obscure Republican state legislator, Rubio exhibited such innate political skill that Dan Gelber, the Democratic leader of the Florida House, warned his colleagues, “When Marco Rubio speaks, young women swoon, old women faint, and toilets flush themselves.” Now that he was a Presidential candidate, Rubio was trying to speak to as many different audiences as possible. The Elks Lodge was decorated modestly, with just a few campaign banners hoisted amid the taxidermy—a demonstration of thrift intended to contrast with the front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, the billionaire Donald Trump, and to counter claims that Rubio occasionally spends more money than he should.","2497","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The attendees were predominantly older white couples, who were seeing Rubio in person for the first time. The son of Cuban immigrants, he grew up mostly in Miami, but he lived in Las Vegas from 1979 until 1985, when he left, after eighth grade. “I love coming back to southern Nevada, because it’s a place where I actually learned so much about the American Dream,” he said. “My father was a bartender at Sam’s Town”—an Old West-style casino, seven miles off the Strip. “My mother was a maid at what was then called the Imperial Palace.” He went on, “They used to have a show called ‘Legends in Concert.’ We saw that show, like, ten times. I met ‘Elvis’ and ‘Marilyn Monroe.’ You know you’re getting old when the Legends in Concert are people you used to listen to in high school.” Big laugh. Adam Hasner, a friend who served with Rubio in the Florida House, told me, “When you’re running for office in Miami-Dade County, you’re spending a lot of time in senior centers.”","2498","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At the age of forty-four, Rubio has lively dark eyes, soft cheeks, and downy brown hair affixed in a perfect part. He sometimes asks crowds to see him in the tradition of a “young President who said, ‘Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.’ ” (J.F.K. was forty-three when he entered the White House.) Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, is only five months older than Rubio, but nobody calls him boyish.","2499","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"If the Democrats nominate Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, the Party will be offering the oldest candidate that it has ever run in a general election, and Rubio has taken to saying, “Never in the modern history of this country has the political class in both parties been more out of touch with our country than it is right now.” But in policy terms Rubio can appear older than his years. His opposition to same-sex marriage, to raising the minimum wage, and to restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba puts him out of step with most American Latinos. In the Spanish-language media, he is sometimes described as un joven viejo—a young fogey.","2500","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After a summer submerged in a raucous primary field, Rubio had recently climbed into third place. He was ahead of Jeb Bush, his former mentor, and far behind Trump and Ben Carson. Trump’s campaign marched to the sound of a dirge—“The American Dream is dead,” he told crowds—and Rubio presented himself as a sunny alternative, a way out of Trump’s sulfurous moment. “We’re very blessed to have so many good people running for President,” he said earnestly to the crowd in Boulder City.","2501","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I had seen Rubio at half a dozen events—in Iowa, New York, Nevada—and his speeches were blemished only by a tic: he occasionally slips into a singsong cadence, turning his story into a breathy schoolboy lullaby about the “new American century.” On the whole, he is impressively consistent. Rubio in Dubuque in October was nearly indistinguishable from Rubio in Miami in April, the political equivalent of a well-managed restaurant chain: “Repeal and replace Obamacare,” scrap President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran “on Day One,” create the “most affordable business taxes in the world”—all the while heeding the populist frustrations of the moment. Vowing to remake higher education, he said, “When I’m President, before you take on student loans you’re going to know how much people make when they graduate from that school with that degree. You’re going to know that the market for philosophers has tightened over the last two thousand years.” In 2012, Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, spoke worshipfully of “job creators.” Rubio rarely mentions them. He returns, over and over, to his central task: how to make helping the poor and the middle class a Republican issue. He tells crowds, “We can no longer allow big government to be used as a tool of crony capitalism.”","2502","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But, at bottom, his campaign is only partly about policy. In a contest against a real-estate tycoon and the son and brother of former Presidents, Rubio is campaigning on the vision of a country where “the son of a bartender and a maid” can reach the White House. “It’s not just my story—it is literally our story,” he told the Boulder City crowd. “In this nation, we are all but a generation or two removed from someone who made our future the very purpose of their lives. Whether or not we remain a special country will be determined by whether or not that journey is still possible for the people trying to make it now.”","2503","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The applause was long and loud, and as Rubio climbed down from the stage to pose for selfies I asked the first couple I saw what they made of him. Cornelia Wallace, a retired nurse from the Chicago suburbs, said, “Well, I’ve got tears welled up in my eyes.” She laughed at her own reaction. “It touched my heart,” she said, and shrugged. “I get a passion from him that I don’t get from the others.”","2504","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In Las Vegas, Rubio was staying at the Bellagio. We met in a suite appointed in the Vegas Italianate style—leather, chrome, photos of fountains. When I stopped by one morning, the windows were shrouded by heavy burgundy drapes, and Rubio was worried about his voice. “I’ve been coming down with something,” he said, crossing the conference room to retrieve a bottle of water. “My throat is always feeling dry.” Doctors had told him it was an allergic reaction. “I said, ‘How come I’ve never had allergies before, and now, suddenly, the last four years I’ve developed allergies? And the answer the doctor gave me was: ‘Well, because you’re travelling to places that you never used to travel to before.’ ”","2505","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

"Rubio, who was spending three days in Nevada, had scheduled both public and closed-door activities. On the first night, he met with Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and donor. In April, Politico had published a story headlined “RUBIO TAKES LEAD IN SHELDON ADELSON PRIMARY,” which reported that Rubio had been calling Adelson every two weeks. I asked Rubio about it, and he said, “I don’t know about every couple of weeks, but I talk to him quite a bit.” Adelson spent about ninety-eight million dollars in connection with the 2012 campaign, including twenty million on the campaign of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. He has yet to commit to a candidate in 2016. Rubio described Adelson and himself as natural allies. “The only thing Sheldon Adelson has talked to me about policy-wise is Israel,” he said. “And he doesn’t have to convince me on that, because I’m pro-Israel with or without Sheldon’s support.”","2507","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s campaign had invited donors from around the country to join him at the Bellagio, for a football-themed retreat. The guests attended a “breakfast and team talk” and a strategy session called “Quarterbacking Victory.” One afternoon, they played flag football at a nearby sports complex, and Rubio was the quarterback on both teams. Over the years, he has developed the ability to disarm jaded donors. Bob List, the former governor of Nevada, told me about watching Rubio work a roomful of prosperous Las Vegas businessmen. At one point, Rubio was asked where his inspiration for politics originated. “He said, ‘I remember one day my father took me in the car, and we drove over to the neighborhood where Liberace’s house was.’ ” List noted, “And everybody knew where Liberace’s house was.” He went on, “He said, ‘We would drive around that neighborhood, and he’d show me where all the rich people lived, and he’d say, “Son, if you want to live like these people, you can do it.” ’ ” List shook his head and said, “He’s good-good.”","2508","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio, who has entered six elections and never lost, is alert to the appearance of overweening ambition. “All my life I’ve been in a hurry to get to my future,” he wrote in his memoir, “An American Son,” published in 2012, his second year in the Senate. In conversation, he sometimes answers so quickly that his friend Dennis Baxley, a Republican in the Florida House, once gave him a piece of advice. “I said, ‘Marco, don’t change anything you’re saying, but just wait, like, three seconds before you say it, and you’ll look so pensive.’ ” When things go wrong, Rubio’s impatience can suggest a man climbing too fast for his own good. In Washington foreign-policy circles, people remember a moment at the Brookings Institution, in April, 2012, when Rubio was delivering a major foreign-policy speech. Reaching the final page, he discovered that it had been removed accidentally from the lectern. Some politicians might have improvised; Rubio stopped awkwardly, in mid-sentence, and asked for the page to be returned.","2509","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For Republican strategists, the loss of the 2012 Presidential election contained signals that spoke to the Party’s future. Latinos are the largest minority group in America, but in 2012 “there was more talk about electrified fences than there was about higher education and tuition,” Peter Wehner, a Republican speechwriter and strategist who served in the past three Republican Administrations, told me. “You can’t win elections when you do that.” Romney, who had called for the “self-deportation” of immigrants, received just twenty-seven per cent of the Latino vote—seventeen points less than what George W. Bush received in 2004. For years, Republicans have believed that they should be faring better with Hispanic voters. Ronald Reagan liked to say that Latinos are Republicans but “just don’t know it yet.” Lionel Sosa, a Texas adman who was hired to run Reagan’s outreach program to Latinos, recalled, “Ronald Reagan told me, back in the 1980 race, ‘Latinos are conservative people. As Republicans, we share the same basic conservative values. We believe in hard work. We believe in family.’ ”","2510","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For Wehner and other reform-minded conservatives, the lessons of 2012 were also economic. “The middle class felt vulnerable and nervous, because of stagnant wages for twenty-five years and skyrocketing costs in health care and higher education,” Wehner told me. “The Party needed an agenda, and it was out of touch with middle-class concerns.” The reformers urged the Party to get over same-sex marriage (a “losing battle”), focus on economic anxiety, and, above all, identify a leader who could articulate a vision that reached beyond Party orthodoxy. As Wehner put it, “You need a figure like a Bill Clinton or a Tony Blair, who can reassure the base and inspire them, but also to signal to people who are not voting for you, ‘We get it.’ ”","2511","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Whit Ayres, a leading Republican analyst who has been Rubio’s pollster for the past five years, drew a somewhat different lesson. He agreed about the demographic reality. “Unfortunately for Republicans, the math is only going to get worse,” he wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. “Groups that form the core of G.O.P. support—older whites, blue-collar whites, married people and rural residents—are declining as a proportion of the electorate. Groups that lean Democratic—minorities, young people and single women—are growing.” He calculated that, in order to win, a Republican Presidential candidate would need at least forty per cent of the Latino vote. But in “2016 and Beyond: How Republicans Can Elect a President in the New America,” published earlier this year, Ayres made a subtle distinction between style and substance. He wrote that polls have found “no evidence that America has shifted to the left.” In his view, America remains a center-right country, the Party’s core ideas are sound, and the problem lies in finding “the right candidate, the right message, and the right tone.” He tested a range of ways of presenting core Republican ideas and composed a list of dos and don’ts. Don’t say we have to reform entitlements or “we will never balance the budget.” Do say that entitlement reform is “the only way to save popular programs.”","2512","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The Party’s plans to change its tone did not last long. In the 2014 midterm elections, conservative candidates seized on reports of a surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the Mexican border, spurred largely by gang- and drug-related violence in Central America, and proclaimed an immigration crisis. Though the number of undocumented immigrants apprehended at the border was at its lowest level in decades, voters who were anxious about jobs and opportunity responded to increasingly militant language. When Trump announced his candidacy, this summer, he said of Mexicans, “They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” Mel Martínez, the former Florida senator (the chamber’s first Cuban-American) and a former head of the Republican National Committee, told me, “Republicans say, ‘Mel, what do we have to do to get the Hispanic vote?’ And one thing I would say is, ‘First of all, stop offending Hispanics!’ ” He urged the parties not to regard a diverse range of voters as a single bloc. “The bottom line is that we are not ‘Hispanics.’ We’re Cuban-Americans, we’re Mexican-Americans, and so forth.” Cuban-Americans represent only about four per cent of the Latino population, and their votes and interests are not always in accord with those of other Latinos. For one thing, many Latinos resent the accelerated path to citizenship that Congress bestowed on Cuban arrivals during the Cold War, a privilege not granted to Colombians, Guatemalans, and others who have faced repression.","2513","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"“There are persuaders and there are crusaders, and I think Rubio is a persuader,” Wehner told me. “When you’re losing Presidential elections on a consistent basis, you’ve got to nominate somebody who is a persuader.” A conservative Super PAC ranked Rubio as the ninth most conservative member of the 114th Congress, but, unlike Ted Cruz, who amplifies confrontation, he excels at rounding off the corners of conventional conservative prescriptions. “I want to be the world leader in renewables,” he tells crowds. “But we better also be the world leader in oil and natural gas.”","2514","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At times, Rubio’s desire to embrace competing views becomes unworkable. In January, he voted for a Senate resolution affirming that climate change is real, but he often voices doubts about the role of humans in it. I mentioned that this puts him at odds with the young generation that he wants to represent. He said, “People who are passionate about climate change come to us and say, ‘The environment is changing because of human activity. The scientists say so.’ And then they say, ‘And here’s what we want you to do.’ And so they present me with this idea, and I look at this idea, and I ask them, ‘Well, if I pass this, how many inches or feet of sea rise will it prevent?’ And they’ll say, ‘Well, it won’t prevent any.’ I say O.K. Then I turn to the economists and say, ‘What impact will this law have on the economy?’ And they say, ‘It will increase the cost of living, it will cost jobs, it will make America less competitive economically.’ And so I say, ‘So you’re asking me to pass something that’s bad economically and does nothing for the environment other than lead the way by example? I think that’s a bad trade-off. I’m not supporting those laws.’ ” (Ken Caldeira, a senior scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science’s Department of Global Ecology, at Stanford, told me, “If Senator Rubio is talking to scientists who say that avoiding greenhouse-gas emissions won’t help avoid sea-level rise, he is talking to the wrong scientists.”)","2515","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s inclusiveness can invite caricature. He considers himself a Catholic, but he attends two churches—an evangelical Protestant service on Saturdays and a Roman Catholic Mass on Sundays. He used to proclaim his love of nineties-era hip-hop—particularly Tupac Shakur—but recently he has also taken to praising cross-genre artists, such as Drake and the Weeknd, who blend electronic dance music with hip-hop, rap, and R. & B. “It’s a twenty-first-century ability to take music and use it in a way that motivates people,” he said last month on CNN, mirroring his campaign rhetoric. “Some of it is blended with other sounds that are sampled from recordings that others have had in the past, and you see traditional artists being brought in and their voices used on an electronic soundtrack.”","2516","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s ecumenism is one reason that prominent Democrats consider him the most worrisome contender. David Axelrod, Obama’s former chief strategist, told me that Rubio “seems to be able to build bridges between the two factions of the Republican Party.” He said, “There is a real civil war going on between populist anti-government Republicans and the establishment conservatives, and Rubio has thus far been able to escape that divide.” Axelrod added, “But it’s going to be harder as time goes on, and he is probably going to have to plant his feet in one place or another.”","2517","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

A day earlier, the House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, facing intense criticism by conservative members of his party, had abandoned plans to run for Speaker. “If the alternative was they all went into a smoke-filled room and cut a deal outside the limelight, everyone would say, ‘Oh, then it’s a done deal, it’s a stagnant process,’ ” Rubio said.

For years, he described himself, in political terms, as the “son of Cuban exiles.” “Nothing against immigrants, but my parents are exiles,” he said during his Senate campaign. “Folks that are exiles are people that have lost their country.” But in October, 2011, the Washington Post and the St. Petersburg Times reported that, according to immigration records, his family had left Cuba voluntarily, as émigrés, aboard a commercial flight, in May, 1956, more than two and a half years before Fidel Castro took power. Like many other immigrants, Rubio’s parents, Oriales and Mario, left in pursuit of jobs and opportunity. (Mario, the bartender, died in 2010.) The Post suggested that Rubio had embellished his story to gain cachet with political refugees, some of whom regard pre-Castro migrants with suspicion. Rubio called that suggestion “outrageous,” saying that he had relied on his family’s “oral history.”","2519","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

In a speech to the Hispanic Leadership Network, in January, 2012, Rubio said that the controversy had turned into “a blessing in disguise.” He explained, “It made me do something that we don’t do enough of.

When the family moved to Nevada, he immersed himself in Mormon reading, and joined the Mormon Church, along with his mother and one of his sisters. A few years later, they reëmbraced Catholicism, “mostly at my instigation,” he wrote in “An American Son.” He also recalled that he was an “inattentive and undisciplined student.”","2521","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

But he writes vividly about the most influential figure in his childhood—his maternal grandfather, Pedro Víctor García, whom he calls “my closest boyhood friend.” According to Rubio’s biographer Manuel Roig-Franzia, in 1962 García arrived from Cuba without a visa and was eventually ordered to be deported. He stayed anyway, becoming an undocumented immigrant. The Cuban missile crisis saved him; commercial air travel to Cuba was suspended, and, eventually, he was granted permanent residency.

He was sometimes mistaken for a clerk, but he embraced conservative doctrine—he read Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged” twice in his first term—and attracted allies.

"For the work of political arm-twisting, he relied on two fellow-representatives, David Rivera and Ralph Arza—or “Boris and Natasha,” as Dan Gelber, the minority leader, nicknamed them, after the “Rocky and Bullwinkle” villains. “I said it jokingly, but there was a little bit of truth,” he told me. “Something would pop up in a bill, and I’d wonder how the hell it got there. Then I’d look at them and they’d smile.” Rubio’s lieutenants proved to be problematic. Arza was forced to resign from the legislature in 2006, after he used the word “nigger” in a drunken message left on a colleague’s voice mail. He pleaded guilty to intimidating a witness and agreed to undergo alcohol and anger counselling. Rivera (who had bought a house with Rubio in Tallahassee, to use when the legislature was in session) went on to Congress but has been the target of state and federal investigations into his income and into his alleged role in supporting a shadow candidate to undercut his rival in the 2012 campaign. He has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged. The Bush campaign, in a slide presentation to donors, has cited the friendship with the “scandal-tarred” Rivera as evidence that Rubio is a “risky bet.” Rubio aides tell reporters that the candidate rarely sees Rivera anymore, but Rivera and Arza were among Rubio’s supporters at the Republican debate in Cleveland.","2534","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio has struggled to manage his personal and professional finances. On several occasions, he used a Republican Party American Express card to charge personal expenses—$3,765 for landscaping stones at his house, ten thousand dollars for a family reunion in Georgia, a hundred and thirty-four dollars in a hair salon. In each case, he made good on the charge before it was publicly reported and explained it as a mixup. A state ethics commission investigated the incidents and cleared him, but that hasn’t stopped his opponents from bringing them up.","2535","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"His income has fluctuated dramatically. In 2000, his first year in the legislature, he was still saddled with student debt. As he ascended in the House leadership, he was hired by Broad & Cassel, a prominent law and lobbying firm, and his annual income grew to more than four hundred thousand dollars. In 2012, he received a contract for his memoir, worth at least eight hundred thousand dollars, and yet, even with his rising income, he cashed out sixty-eight thousand dollars from a retirement account, paying a heavy tax penalty. When reporters asked about it, he said, “My refrigerator broke down.” Political rivals wondered if he had a gambling problem, and searched for evidence but found none. Indeed, Rubio has incorporated the questions about his financial dealings into his self-narrative. “Here’s the truth,” he said, flanked by prosperous rivals, during the third Republican debate, in Boulder, Colorado. “I didn’t inherit any money.” He added, “But I’m not worried about my finances. I’m worried about the finances of everyday Americans.”","2536","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After Rubio finished at the Elks Lodge in Boulder City, he drove to North Las Vegas, a blue-collar suburb where he and his family once lived in a two-bedroom cinder-block house. The city has a large Hispanic population, and bus shelters advertise lawyers who specialize in inmigración. He was scheduled to speak at an event organized by the LIBRE Initiative, a nonprofit group funded in part by the Koch brothers.

"To fulfill Reagan’s prophesy that Latino voters will become Republicans, the Party will need to make its economic case in places like Nevada. Between 1994 and 2012, the Latino share of Nevada’s electorate tripled, from five per cent to fifteen per cent. So far, Latinos have been voting mainly for Democrats. Senator Harry Reid won a tight reëlection fight in 2010 largely because he received ninety-four per cent of the Latino vote. By the end of this decade, non-Hispanic whites will likely be a minority in Nevada.","2538","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The event was held at St. Christopher Catholic School, which Rubio attended briefly as a child. (After lobbying his parents to find a way to cover the tuition, he arrived to find that he hated the uniforms, the extra schoolwork, and the distance from his friends, and he pleaded to go back to public school. “I made life unbearable in our house, and within a week, my parents had relented,” he writes. “I cringe today when I remember how selfishly I behaved.”)","2539","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Drawing on the ideas of reform-minded conservatives, Rubio told the audience, “We have government policies that, quite frankly, have not allowed this economy to grow fast enough and create better-paying jobs.” He went on, “These are the impediments to upward mobility: an economy that isn’t creating better-paying jobs and a higher-education system that’s too expensive or inaccessible. And the result is we are leaving people behind.”","2540","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The crux of Rubio’s economic argument is that the poor and the middle class are facing different problems from those his parents faced. He opposes raising the minimum wage, arguing that it will lead to automation and outsourcing. He wants a greater share of young people to consider trade schools and apprenticeships instead of incurring the debts of a four-year education. “You’re going to have eighteen-year-olds in this country making fifty thousand dollars a year making cars, making seventy thousand dollars a year as a welder!” he says. (His rhapsodies about welding have been ridiculed, because the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the median wage for welders is less than thirty-eight thousand dollars.)","2541","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio told the audience that the notion that “big government is good for the people who are trying to make it” is a “lie.” He said, “When the government dominates the economy, the people that can afford to influence the government—they win. And everybody else is stuck.” He went on, “They know that you can’t start a business out of the spare bedroom of your home if you have to fill out fifteen permits and hire lawyers and lobbyists, and they love it because that means they have no competition.”","2542","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At one point while Rubio was in the Florida House, he and David Rivera visited Washington and got in touch with Mel Martínez, who was then in the Senate. “I walked him around the Capitol, and he was like a kid with his eyes popping out, you know? ‘Oh, my gosh, this is so cool. Oh, my gosh,’ ” Martínez recalled. Within a few years, Rubio was back, with a purpose. “I invited him to lunch in the Senate dining room, and I got the definite impression that he was kind of fishing around as to if I was going to run for reëlection or not,” Martínez said. “I thought it was a bit premature to be talking about that.”","2543","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After term limits forced Rubio out of the Florida House, in 2008, he worked as a consultant for hospitals, a television pundit, and a college instructor, but by 2009 he was antsy. Martínez had announced his retirement, and Rubio wanted to challenge Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor, for the vacant Senate seat, but Party leaders had chosen Crist, and they told Rubio that they would oppose him with money and endorsements. Rubio’s friend Dennis Baxley received a text message from him: “I can’t quit thinking about U.S. Senate. They want me to do Attorney General of Florida instead, but what do you think?” Baxley said, “I texted him back. I said, ‘What does your wife think?’ She’s the spiritual depth gauge.” Jeanette approved.","2544","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio began more than thirty points behind, and almost dropped out. But he sensed that Crist was vulnerable on the right. Small, far-right rallies were gathering steam around the state; they eventually became the Tea Party. Driving around Florida in an F-150 pickup, Rubio went to rallies, and he portrayed Crist as an ally of Obama. He accentuated new priorities. Previously, progressive immigration activists had considered him an ally, because he supported tuition assistance for the children of undocumented workers and used his power to bury hard-line anti-immigration bills. But now he renounced the tuition program; he made use of the phrase “illegal aliens,” and condemned the Dream Act, which would have protected undocumented young people, as a step toward “a blanket amnesty.”","2545","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"He said that he would have supported a controversial Arizona measure that critics called the “Show me your papers” law. (Before his campaign, he had said that the law would be akin to creating a “police state.”) He also received help from Jeb Bush, who introduced him to top donors and helped him secure endorsements. He got the nomination, and won the general election by nearly twenty points. At his victory party, Bush introduced him. The Weekly Standard hailed Rubio as “the most important freshman senator.” In the Senate, Rubio maintained his opposition to the Dream Act.

"In 2012, Mitt Romney considered Rubio as a possible running mate. Democratic researchers had assembled and released an opposition-research file that focussed on Rubio’s relationship with Rivera and on the financial errors, portraying them as evidence of ineptness or profiteering. In the end, Romney chose the Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan. In materials shared with donors and reporters, the Bush campaign has alleged that Rubio was rejected because of concerns about his background. But Beth Myers, the Romney adviser who oversaw the Vice-Presidential search, told Politico last month that that is “simply wrong,” and went on, “I can say that Senator Rubio ‘passed’ our vetting and we found nothing that disqualified him from serving as VP.”","2547","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After Romney lost, the G.O.P.’s official autopsy concluded that the Party had to “embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.” A small group of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate were organizing the first push for a bill that could satisfy both the left and the right, by combining a path to citizenship for eleven million undocumented immigrants with border-control measures. The group coveted Rubio’s participation, because he had both Tea Party support and Latino heritage. In December, Senator Dick Durbin, of Illinois, the No. 2 leader in the Democratic majority, encountered Rubio in the Senate gym and recruited him to what became known as the Gang of Eight. Time put him on the cover with the tagline “The Republican Savior.” He blitzed conservative media and white Evangelical audiences, arguing that border security and citizenship had to be “interwoven” in the bill. “It’s literally impossible to do one part without doing the other,” he said.","2548","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But his staff was ambivalent: his political strategists worried that it would cost him conservative support. After Rubio signed on to the bill, Glenn Beck declared, “What a piece of garbage this guy is.” But Rubio stayed with it, and when the bill reached the Senate floor, on June 27, 2013, he delivered the most powerful speech of his career, recalling that the first words that his father learned in English were “I am looking for work.” He quoted from the inscription on the Statue of Liberty, and said, “Here in America, generations of unfulfilled dreams will finally come to pass.”","2549","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The bill passed the Senate, but Rubio’s poll numbers were dropping, and he was having second thoughts. He was the only one of the eight senators who did not attend a news conference after the vote. In the weeks ahead, he walked away from the immigration bill. He told Sean Hannity, of Fox News, that repealing Obamacare was “more important” than his legislation. In October, he dismissed the bill as something “the Democrats in the Senate are demanding.” He stopped talking about immigration almost entirely. Matt Viser, of the Boston Globe, searched the Congressional Record and found that Rubio referred to immigration a hundred and thirty-five times on the Senate floor in 2013. In the next two years, he mentioned it twice. (The House never brought the bill up for a vote, and it died.)","2550","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio had come to Washington with ambitions to cut the debt, reduce spending, and curb E.P.A. rules in Florida, but none of those plans succeeded. In his first year, his only successful bill was a measure that designated September as National Spinal Cord Injury Awareness Month. He began losing enthusiasm for the Senate. The failure of the immigration bill hastened the process.","2551","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio had talked about running for President, but in Florida political circles few people imagined that he would run in 2016 if Bush did. “I didn’t conceive of them both deciding to compete, because the relationship goes so far back,” Baxley said.

"For those with strong ties to both Rubio and Bush, Rubio’s decision was discomfiting. The Miami Republican operative Al Cardenas, who gave Rubio his first job out of law school (and attended his wedding), and pushed for him to be a Vice-Presidential candidate in 2012, told Fox Latino, “I had hoped he would stay in the Senate,” adding, “It’s like running against your uncle for the president of the company.” When Rubio was asked why he did not defer to his mentor, he replied, “I didn’t know there was a line.” Asked about the sword that Bush gave him, Rubio told reporters, “I have it somewhere at home. I have young kids. I don’t want them running around with a sword.”","2553","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio announced his campaign on April 13th, at Miami’s Freedom Tower, a former newspaper building that the federal government had used in the sixties and early seventies as a Cuban-refugee center. It was nicknamed the Ellis Island of the South. Flanked by enormous American flags, he told the crowd, in a message that pointed at both Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, “Yesterday is over.” At the announcement, demonstrators from Latino advocacy groups carried signs declaring “El Sueño de Rubio Es Nuestra Pesadilla” (“Rubio’s Dream Is Our Nightmare”). On “Despierta América,” the morning newscast on Univision, the host Satcha Pretto noted the presence of the protesters, and said, “Many immigrants are already asking themselves, ‘Does he want to support us or deport us?’ ”","2554","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

Barrel-chested and bearded, he wore a cardigan and rectangular glasses.

"He was born in Mexico while his parents and three siblings were en route to the United States. A church helped them get green cards and allowed them to sleep in the pews for three years until they had saved enough for an apartment in a poor section of Las Vegas. “My parents would go without food. I don’t remember buying new shoes when I was a kid. But I think a lot of people go through that, in different ways.” He learned English from “Sesame Street.” “So I was the family translator until I was eight.” His older brother found work bagging groceries, and the family moved to West Las Vegas, another troubled part of town.","2556","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Murrieta became a naturalized citizen in 2010—“my American birthday,” he calls it. “It was the most beautiful moment of my life. And I registered to vote literally the moment after that, because all I ever wanted to do was vote.” In 2013, he worked nationally on immigration reform and labor issues. “I was blessed to be able to be in a lot of the rooms where policy was being discussed.” He said that Latinos would be receptive to a Republican message, but he thinks that the LIBRE Initiative promotes the interests of big business rather than the interests of the community.","2557","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked what he made of Rubio’s work on immigration reform. “He was for it before he was against it,” he said. “I’m an immigrant kid from the poorest parts of Vegas, and my family is touched by every form of immigration.” His brother-in-law and sister-in-law are undocumented. “This bill would have saved my family a lot of fear. You know, we still live in fear that our family is going to be torn apart.” He went on, “I’ve seen Marco Rubio give us lip service. I’ve seen him and his staff say that they support us. But then, when the spotlight is put on them, they don’t have the muscle to stand. And that’s not what we need in a President. We need someone who can stand up and stay true to what he’s said.” He added, “One of us has forgotten where we came from.”","2558","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The more we talked, the more dispirited Murrieta became about the state of the immigration debate in America. The Obama Administration’s executive actions, announced in 2014, would have shielded members of his family against the threat of deportation, but then a court ruling blocked that protection.

"A Gallup poll released in August found that among Hispanic voters Bush has a net favorability rating of eleven points; Rubio trails him, with five points. Clinton’s net favorability with Hispanics is forty points. But when I asked Lionel Sosa, Reagan’s Latino outreach director, how he thought Rubio would do with Hispanics in a general election, he said that although he had heard the criticisms, he thought they would fade. “The first Latino that has a chance to become President?

"It was, perhaps, inevitable that Marco Rubio would open the deepest cut in the troubled campaign of Jeb Bush. For days before the third Republican debate, the Bush campaign had been criticizing Rubio for missing Senate votes this year. During the debate, Bush sensed an opportunity and turned to face his former protégé. “Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work,” Bush said. “I mean, literally, the Senate—what is it, like, a French work week?” He delivered the line awkwardly, like a principal making a cameo appearance in a school play.","2563","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

The phrase “Someone has convinced you” was lethal. Bush—suddenly in the role of the misled, desperate old pol—smiled wanly and tried to speak, but Rubio turned to face the camera. “My campaign is going to be about the future of America—it’s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage,” he said. “I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.” It sounded like a eulogy.","2564","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The next day, Rubio appeared on six network- and cable-news shows and attracted three-quarters of a million dollars in donations online. Then came the mother lode. On October 30th, Paul Singer, the hedge-fund billionaire, who donated more money to Republican candidates and causes last year than anyone else in America, sent a letter to dozens of donors, encouraging them to help raise money for Rubio, calling him “perfect for this moment” and the best choice to “navigate this complex primary process, and still be in a position to defeat Secretary Clinton in November 2016.” Rubio had been courting Singer for weeks.","2565","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"A few days later, I met Rubio for breakfast in New York, at a restaurant in the Hyatt in Times Square. He arrived at seven-thirty, with two staff members, and slid into the booth. He ordered a cappuccino, and then called after the waitress, “Can I get a double shot of espresso in it?” He looked tired. He was trying to maintain a semblance of a routine: six hours of sleep, a gym visit for “anything that gets your heart rate up for thirty minutes,” a morning call to his kids on the way to school, and an uninterrupted block of time at home with his family on Sundays.","2566","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

"I suspected he might have more difficulty defusing concern that he is becoming indebted to powerful donors—some of the very same “people that can afford to influence the government,” whom he disparaged in his speech at St. Christopher. More than four in five Americans—an equal share of Republicans and Democrats—believe that money plays too large a role in political campaigns, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released in June. While Rubio was getting help from Singer, and perhaps Adelson, a nonprofit group called the Conservative Solutions Project—which, by law, can conceal the identities of its donors—was running millions of dollars’ worth of ads promoting him, more than any similar group devoted to a Presidential candidate.","2568","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked Rubio if he thinks Americans will worry that he is beholden to big backers. He shook his head, and said, “I’ve never had a single donor come to me and say, ‘I’ll support you, but only if you support this initiative.’ ” I said that sounded like a false standard, an unrealistic description of political influence. He continued, “People may not believe this, but the vast majority of big donors in America don’t really ask a lot of government—at least on our side of the aisle. What they really, largely, want is to be treated fairly and be left alone.” He added, “I’ve never changed any item on my agenda in search of a supporter.”","2569","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"On several issues, Rubio has taken a position that suits the faithful in the primaries but is guaranteed to repel voters in a general election. His most obvious vulnerability is on abortion. In the first Republican debate, Rubio said that his opposition to abortion extends to cases of rape or incest—a position at odds with that of more than three-quarters of Americans. Axelrod told me, “No exceptions is a position so extreme that no Republican candidate has ever held it. Presidential races are defined by moments. Maybe he will try to amend that position, but in the age of video it’s hard to extinguish a declarative statement like that.” When I asked Rubio about it, he said, somewhat confusingly, “Look, I personally believe that all life is worthy of protection, and therefore I don’t ever require, nor have I ever advocated, that I won’t support a law unless it has exceptions.” After some more twists and turns, I sensed that we had reached the line he plans to use in a general election: “My goal is to save as many lives as possible, and I’ll support anything that does that. Even if it has exceptions.”","2570","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"During the third debate, he had said that it was time to end an immigration system based largely on family ties. “That’s the way my parents came, legally, in 1956, but in 2015 we have a very different economy.

"“I understand the argument,” he said, but he thought it was unfair. “In 1956, two people with barely any command of English, who had no formal education of any sort, were able to find jobs. In the twenty-first century, those jobs are scarce. . . . So I don’t think, for the country, it makes sense to continue to allow people to immigrate here in large numbers who we know do not have the skills or the education they need to succeed economically. It’s just a change based on new economic reality.”","2572","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked what he thought would have happened to his parents if they had faced the system he is proposing. “It’s not clear what would have happened to them,” he said. “We can all get into hypotheticals about what would have happened two hundred years ago, or one hundred years ago, or fifty years ago, when somebody’s relatives came, but the world changes, and our policy has to keep pace with that.” He seemed dissatisfied with that answer, and went on, “Unlike most of the other people running, I live surrounded by immigration. My family are all immigrants. My kids go to school with kids who are immigrants. So this is not a theoretical issue for me. I live it personally. And it is hard. You know the stories of people that are here illegally, but it’s heartbreaking, because they came because they don’t want their daughter to be abducted by a drug gang in Central America. But the flip side of it is, every country in the world has immigration laws. And America has to have immigration laws, and if you don’t enforce them you don’t have laws. So this notion that somehow to be compassionate you have to be lawless is something I don’t buy, and I think most Hispanics don’t buy it.”","2573","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s campaign faces a range of tactical questions—Does he have the organization to win an early state? Will he lose his home state to Trump? Could Cruz win with only conservative and evangelical voters?—but the larger question will be harder to solve: Rubio has succeeded in politics by straddling as many positions as possible. He is the Catholic at the Protestant church, the quarterback of both teams, the joven viejo.

Hillary Clinton favors an activist American foreign policy, and Rubio mentioned to me that he was rereading “The Last Lion,” by William Manchester. He said, “It’s this book about Churchill. It’s really long. Only because I’m just so fascinated by the leadership he provided.” He went on, “Churchill was a guy who was largely ignored through much of the thirties as a warmonger, and a guy that was crying wolf, and Chamberlain was this heroic figure that was going to achieve peace in our time by diplomacy. And I think, in many cases, we’re kind of at a similar moment, where many of us, including myself, are warning about dangers that are percolating around the world and what they could turn into.

Jeb Bush, after straining, for months, to distance himself from his brother’s invasion of Iraq, said, “We should declare war” on the Islamic State, and called for the deployment of American troops “without their hands tied.” In a Democratic debate on the day after the attacks, Clinton said that the Islamic State “cannot be contained—it must be defeated.” She declined to identify the threat as “radical Islam,” saying that the term was “painting with too broad a brush” and risked alienating allies in the Muslim world.","2577","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio held up that point as a flawed gesture of diplomacy. “I don’t understand it,” he said on ABC’s “This Week,” the next day. “That would be like saying we weren’t at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren’t violent themselves.” It was a shrewd reply—the cool placement of safety over diplomacy—that nevertheless avoided Bush’s sharp turn toward war.","2578","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But in reaching for a broad rhetorical vision Rubio presaged an instinct for aggressive intervention.“This is a clash of civilizations,” he told ABC. “There is no middle ground on this. Either they win or we win.” It was the politics of absolutes, a vocabulary that harks back to the with-us-or-against-us logic of an earlier era. Even George W. Bush disavowed the clash-of-civilizations argument. Rubio stopped short of specifying how many troops he wants to send to the Middle East, but he left no doubt that he believes such action is unavoidable. In an article that Rubio wrote for Politico, he said that the United States should “provide direct military support to Sunnis and the Kurds if Baghdad fails to support them.” He also called for no-fly zones in Syria, for grounding Bashar al-Assad’s Air Force, and for the establishment of “safe zones” to “stem the flow of refugees and provide a place to train and arm rebel fighters.” He said that he would “oppose Russia and Iran” in their efforts to buttress Assad’s regime.","2579","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In one of our conversations, I asked Rubio if his instinct for intervention was out of step with a generation that is exhausted by war and confrontation, young men and women who have come of age in the years since September 11th. He responded instantly: “We’re not Luxembourg. We’re the United States of America—the highest-profile, most important, most influential country in the world.” He went on, “And we may ignore problems that exist far away, but those problems don’t ignore us. America, in the world today, is the only nation capable of convening collective action.”","2580","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Barely two months before the first Iowa caucus, the debates about national security and immigration were converging in ways that Rubio seemed well positioned to exploit. In the days after the Paris attacks, more than thirty governors said that their states would resist the resettlement of Syrian refugees. Rubio, as he so often does, found a way to embrace two sides of a painful question, expressing both empathy and tough-mindedness. He said of the refugees, “It’s not that we don’t want to—it’s that we can’t.” ♦","2581","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The stock market is not the economy. That’s a simple financial truth, but it’s hard to keep in mind in the midst of a sell-off like the one we saw last Monday, especially with headlines screaming about a “Bloodbath in Global Markets.” So, even as the market rallied last week, concerns lingered over the possibility that the sharp decline in stock prices boded ill for the U.S. economy as a whole, giving us front-page stories fretting about the “real threat to the American economy” and warning of “a leaner era ahead.” These worries are almost certainly unfounded. The market sell-off in the U.S. wasn’t just a matter of panic—it reflected investors’ genuine anxieties about the future. But those anxieties have surprisingly little to do with the current state of the American economy.","2582","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/drop-in-the-bucket"
"The sell-off was driven mainly by the turmoil in China, which is dealing with the precipitous deflation of a stock-market bubble and is struggling to maintain its economic growth. This has led many to believe that China will grow more slowly than anticipated, while Chinese leaders’ sometimes ham-fisted policy moves in recent months have raised questions about their ability to manage the economy. Given how much we hear about China’s economic importance, you might think that these problems would have a big impact on the U.S. They won’t. In fact, total U.S. exports to China are just a hundred and sixty-five billion dollars, less than one per cent of G.D.P. There are certainly firms—including commodity producers, microchip makers, and fast-food companies—for which China is a huge market today. But for most firms the prospect of selling billions of products to Chinese consumers remains more of a promise than a reality. Goldman Sachs, for instance, estimates that just two per cent of the S. & P. 500’s revenues come from sales to China.","2583","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/drop-in-the-bucket"
"So, while a significant economic downturn in China would squeeze Apple, Yum! Brands (e.g., Pizza Hut), and Iowa farmers, most Americans, and most American companies, would barely notice it, at least in the short term. (Goldman Sachs estimates that a one-per-cent drop in China’s growth rate translates into a mere 0.06-per-cent drop in the United States’s G.D.P.) And the flow of goods we import from China is unlikely to be affected by the downturn at all.","2584","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/drop-in-the-bucket"
"Globally, China’s slowing pace of growth has certainly had spillover effects. In the past decade, its boom has created a voracious appetite for commodities of all kinds, from iron ore and copper to oil. As growth there has slowed, the price of these commodities has fallen, and the price of oil has been pushed down further by a production glut. This has been bad for energy and mining stocks, and it’s been very hard on developing economies, like those in Latin America, which relied on commodity exports to China. But for the U.S. economy cheaper commodities are a good thing, putting more money in consumers’ pockets and lowering production costs for American firms.","2585","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/drop-in-the-bucket"
"Some pundits worry that all this market turmoil could presage something like the meltdown of 2007-09 or the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. Yet those were ultimately severe insolvency crises, involving enormous piles of debt that were not going to be repaid, companies and countries going bust, and economies that were deep in recession. The situation today isn’t analogous. Unlike the Asian countries that got in trouble in the late nineteen-nineties, China is a creditor to the rest of the world, not a debtor. It has plenty of debt troubles—thanks to enormous overborrowing by corporations and local governments—but those are largely internal issues, unlikely to go global. As for the struggling emerging-market economies, they, too, are in much better shape than they were in the late nineties. Nowadays, these countries typically have sizable dollar reserves and, instead of running big current-account deficits, are mostly running surpluses with the rest of the world. So the ingredients for a full-blown financial crisis don’t seem to be in place.","2586","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/drop-in-the-bucket"
"This doesn’t mean that the stock-market correction was irrational. It reflected concerns about the long-term future, particularly when it comes to China. China isn’t hugely important to U.S. companies or exporters today. But the expectation has been that it will become so, before long. Now investors are wondering if the scenario of a billion consumers happily carrying iPhones will take a lot longer to arrive. And there are similar concerns about emerging markets in general. As the level of uncertainty among investors rises, their tolerance for risk falls, which means they’ll pay less for risky assets, and so stock prices go down.","2587","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/drop-in-the-bucket"
"To say that the stock market isn’t the economy doesn’t mean that stock-market crises can’t become contagious; they can dampen what Keynes called the “animal spirits” of managers and consumers, leading them to cut back on investment and spending. Stock prices do have some impact on consumer spending (the richer consumers feel, the more willing they are to spend). Still, market moves need to be severe and long-lasting to make a real difference. The 1987 crash, for instance, saw stocks drop more than twenty-two per cent in a single day. Yet it had no measurable impact on corporate investment, and only a short-lived effect on consumer spending. Americans’ 401(k)s are a bit lighter than they were two weeks ago. America’s economy looks pretty much the same. ♦","2588","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/drop-in-the-bucket"
"In the prologue to “The Snow Queen” (the source for Disney’s “Frozen”), Hans Christian Andersen describes “an evil troll”—the devil—who fashioned a mirror with unusual qualities: “It would shrink everything that was good and beautiful to almost nothing and it would magnify whatever was worthless and ugly and make it seem even worse”; its effect on ordinary people was to make “their faces so twisted you couldn’t tell who they were.”","September 2, 2015","2589","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"Andersen’s ingenious mirror, were it to exist, would hardly be necessary when looking at today’s Presidential candidates: the campaign, even at this early stage, has been doing the mirror’s work for it. In a rough count, there are twenty-two contenders, men and women, Republican and Democrat, each one seemingly prepared to keep going. It won’t take long for some of them to become unrecognizable—the way Mitt Romney, once the bright, moderate governor of Massachusetts, four years ago became a “severely conservative” office-seeker.

For instance, is Mike Huckabee, the preacher and former governor of Arkansas, the generous fellow who, seven years ago, came to the defense of the Presidential candidate Barack Obama and his pastor, Jeremiah Wright? (That was when Wright said, among other politically unhelpful things, that African-Americans should not sing “God Bless America” but “God damn America.”) Or is Huckabee the inflexible, unforgiving person who now compares same-sex marriage to swearing and drinking, would allow no exceptions for abortion, and says that, by agreeing to a nuclear deal with Iran, Obama “would take the Israelis and basically march them to the door of the oven”?","2591","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"The identity-distortion has its own term of art, the “reset,” often a signal that a candidate isn’t sure what the campaign is about or why it keeps going. When the Times recently reported that Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, looking enviously at polls that favored Donald Trump, “announced a reset of his campaign,” you could only wonder how this shrill, partisan figure (Walker, not Trump) could look any less Presidential. Actually, he managed it by doing several reverse flips on the question of birthright citizenship and the Fourteenth Amendment.","2592","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"Jeb Bush hit his reset button before he formally announced his candidacy. Hillary Clinton, who keeps sinking in key polls no matter how hard she works at sounding like a national leader, has reset her tone and is likely to do so again. On the other hand, Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, who has been trying to come up with a reset strategy, may have fallen so far behind in polls that he won’t qualify for first-tier status in the next Republican debate. With every reset, voters may begin to suspect that a candidate is really saying, “If you don’t like who I am, I’ll be someone else.” If Andersen’s troll does his dirty work, that someone else will be less appealing than the original.","2593","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"The enduring example of a candidate with many resets is Richard Nixon, whose most important one came in 1956. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had suffered a major heart attack, in the fall of 1955, and with Ike’s fragile health and an absence of Republican competition, a Nixon Presidency seemed increasingly likely, later if not sooner. Political reporters began to write about a “new Nixon,” suggesting the emergence of a gentler, more thoughtful iteration of someone whose career in politics started in 1946. When Nixon ran for President against John F. Kennedy, in 1960, and CBS’s Walter Cronkite broached the subject, Nixon said, “When people say there is a new Nixon, that must mean that people who did not like the Nixon that they knew before now like the one that they know now. I happen to believe, myself, that perhaps many of those who discover the new Nixon may not have known the old one.” The new Nixon and the old Nixon turned out to be pretty much the same person, but as the Wall Street Journal’s Vermont Royster observed when Nixon ran in 1968, “Nothing seems to fascinate political journalists . . . more than new images on old faces.” Royster might have written that line today.","2594","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"

But it would be just as helpful to look at his competitors, some of whom, like Jeb Bush, want to take things that are ugly, like his brother’s ruinous Iraq war, and make them disappear.

"It was hard to avoid the irony. The leader of China—nominally, at least, a Communist country—came to Washington and announced that his government was adopting a market-based approach to curbing carbon emissions.

"In an announcement timed to coincide with today’s summit between Presidents Xi Jinping and Barack Obama, the Chinese government said that it would institute a national cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions, starting in 2017. Under the system, large emitters, such as power plants and steel manufacturers, will be assigned a certain number of tons of allowable emissions. If they emit fewer, they can sell the resulting credits; if they emit more, they’ll need to buy credits. The obvious point of such a program is to use financial incentives to spur emissions reductions and limit global warming.","2597","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"
"The announcement was generally hailed as a sign of progress before the global climate summit in Paris, which is set to start in late November. In an e-mail, Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, called the announcement “very welcome” and said it showed that reducing emissions “is being increasingly recognized as in the interest not only of the planet as a whole but of individual countries.”","2598","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"

(John Dales, a Canadian economist, who died in 2007, is also recognized for having come up with more or less the same idea at more or less the same time.) A Republican Administration was the first to put such a system in place. The Reagan Administration used a cap-and-trade approach to phase out lead in gasoline. Then, under President George H. W. Bush, the U.S. set up a cap-and-trade system to curb power-plant emissions of sulfur dioxide. Under President Bill Clinton, the U.S. remained committed to the concept, so much so that the administration insisted that a cap-and-trade provision be included in the Kyoto Protocol. (Although the U.S. subsequently rejected the Protocol, the Europeans, who had resisted the idea of cap-and-trade, ended up establishing an E.U.-wide trading system.)","2599","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"

During his first term, President Obama tried to get a cap-and-trade system implemented for carbon emissions. He’s often been criticized for not having tried hard enough, a criticism that’s probably fair. However, as the President pointed out in a recent interview with Rolling Stone, there weren’t enough votes in the Senate to get the bill through without some G.O.P. support, and none was forthcoming. Indeed, even Democrats were balking.","2600","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"

"In his second term, Obama has turned to regulations to limit carbon emissions. Most significantly, the Environmental Protection Agency has issued a series of new rules to cut power-plant emissions. From a political perspective, this turn is laudable; doing something about climate change is certainly better than doing nothing. However, from an economic standpoint, it’s regrettable that things have come to such a pass; it’s likely—many would say inevitable—that, on a ton-for-ton basis, the regulations will prove more costly than a cap-and-trade system would have.","2602","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"

Carbon trading systems are tricky to design; early on, for example, the Europeans handed out too many credits, with the result that their system very nearly collapsed and even now is just barely functional. Few details have been provided on what China—which now accounts for more than a quarter of global emissions—is planning. One obvious question is how high the cap will be. Another is how the system will be enforced. Reliable data in China are hard to come by, and no one at this point even has very good information on who is emitting how much.","2603","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"

"As most people in the financial markets had been expecting, and as many commentators—myself included—had been urging, Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Federal Reserve have decided not to raise interest rates, at least for now. Citing developments in the world economy, including recent turbulence in the stock markets and softness in inflation, Yellen told reporters, at the conclusion of a two-day Fed policy meeting, that the U.S. central bank wanted to wait a bit and see what impact, if any, the global developments will have on the U.S. economy.","September 17, 2015","2606","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/janet-yellen-and-the-fed-did-the-right-thing"

Despite the fact that job growth has been steady and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1 per cent, which is close to the level at which the Fed believes inflation starts to accelerate, there is absolutely no sign yet of inflation picking up. To the contrary, headline inflation is running at an annual rate of just 0.2 per cent, and last month consumer prices actually fell a little. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is running at 1.8 per cent, which is also below the Fed’s target. Even if you’re an inflation hawk, it’s hard to argue that the Fed needs to act now.","2607","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/janet-yellen-and-the-fed-did-the-right-thing"
"For the rest of us, the primary concern is insuring that the economic recovery continues, and that recent tentative signs of wage growth finally translate into real income gains for the majority of Americans. On Wednesday, while Yellen and her colleagues on the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee (F.O.M.C.) were deciding what to do, the Census Bureau released a report showing that median household income—i.e., that of the household in the middle of the income distribution—fell by about eight hundred dollars last year. The drop, from $54,462 to $53,657, wasn’t statistically significant, but, as Robert Greenstein, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, pointed out in an analysis of the Census Bureau figures, it meant that the income of the typical American household is still more than eight per cent below the level it reached in 2000.","2608","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/janet-yellen-and-the-fed-did-the-right-thing"
"Yellen, since taking over from Ben Bernanke, in 2014, has repeatedly emphasized her concerns about income stagnation and rising inequality. In presiding over another meeting at which the Fed resisted the demands of inflation hawks, she demonstrated that the Fed, under her leadership, will do what it can to support job growth and income growth. But the decision to stand pat raises some tricky questions about where the Fed will go from here.","2609","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/janet-yellen-and-the-fed-did-the-right-thing"
"On one hand, Yellen, in her press briefing, said, “The economy has been performing well, and we expect it to continue to do so.” The gross domestic product is growing faster, and unemployment has fallen farther, than the Fed had expected earlier this year—developments reflected in new economic projections released by the F.O.M.C. members. Citing this good news, Yellen said that the Fed could raise rates at its next meeting, in October, and pointed out that most F.O.M.C. members still expect a rate hike by the year’s end. (There is another policymaking meeting in December.)","2610","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/janet-yellen-and-the-fed-did-the-right-thing"
"On the other hand, Yellen acknowledged that the Fed, which usually maintains a domestic focus, is increasingly concerned about developments in the world economy, including the gyrations in global markets that occurred in August. “A lot of our focus has been on risks around China. But not just China—emerging markets more generally,” she said. That’s perfectly understandable. The Fed isn’t just concerned that the U.S. will import some of the problems occurring elsewhere. Although it seldom acknowledges this publicly, the bank’s actions can have a big effect on markets and economies around the world, and there was a danger that, it if went ahead and raised interest rates now, it would exacerbate the problems in China and elsewhere. In recent weeks, officials from both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have issued warnings about this possibility, and urged the Fed to act with caution. For example, Kaushik Basu, the chief economist at the World Bank, said that a Fed rate rise could trigger “panic and turmoil” in emerging markets.","2611","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/janet-yellen-and-the-fed-did-the-right-thing"
"Yellen didn’t say what role, if any, these warnings played in the Fed’s deliberations. In any case, it seems highly unlikely that the economic problems in China, Brazil, and other developing countries will be resolved anytime soon. So the Fed’s decision to weigh global developments heavily in its decision-making appeared to raise the prospect that it will stay the course for some time—into the first half of next year, at least.","2612","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/janet-yellen-and-the-fed-did-the-right-thing"
"Seemingly aware that she was sending a somewhat mixed message, Yellen pointed out some additional complexities that the Fed is dealing with. On the domestic front, a big fall in oil prices has sent the inflation rate tumbling, but the bank considers this to be temporary development. In the labor market, which Yellen monitors very closely, the unemployment rate has fallen sharply. However, other indicators, such as the number of people involuntarily working part-time and the labor-force-participation rate, suggest that “there are additional margins of slack,” as Yellen put it. At the international level, too, there are a lot of unknowns, she said. In China, for example, “the question is whether there might be a risk of a more abrupt slowdown than most analysts expect.”","2613","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/janet-yellen-and-the-fed-did-the-right-thing"
"To sum it up, Yellen’s message was that the Fed needs more time, and more data, to figure things out. “There are a lot of crosscurrents in economic and financial developments that we need to take into account,” she said. That’s undeniable. What it means is that the great Fed watch of 2015 will go on for a while yet.","2614","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/janet-yellen-and-the-fed-did-the-right-thing"

Burwell, the Court, by a vote of six to three, dismissed a challenge to the Affordable Care Act that might have, as a practical matter, destroyed the law.

Lower courts upheld the Texas plan, which allows an extremely limited use of racial diversity in admissions. Now the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case a second time—an unusual step in itself.

(For example, the laws require that doctors who provide abortions must have admitting privileges at local hospitals; they also impose on clinics the building standards of ambulatory surgical centers.) In Texas, the new rules would require all but nine abortion providers in the state to close their doors.

If the challengers win this case, the unions may lose millions of dollars in revenue, with a consequent loss of power. Since public-employee unions have done so much better than private-sector unions in recent years, that would hurt the union movement as a whole in an especially vulnerable place. The campaign against fair-share fees has been a special crusade for Justice Samuel Alito, and he may kill them off for good this time.","2620","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-coming-liberal-disaster-at-the-supreme-court"
"There is not yet a major campaign-finance case before the Justices, but in an election year it would be no surprise to see one surface. The conservative majority, led in this case by Kennedy, has shown no sign of backing away from its Citizens United decision, from 2010, which said that campaign contributions are a form of free speech. On the rights of criminal suspects, especially those sentenced to death, the Court remains deeply conservative as well. It only underscores the magnitude of the liberal victories in 2015 to recognize that they may seem deeply aberrational in 2016.","2621","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-coming-liberal-disaster-at-the-supreme-court"
"The Warhol superstar Brigid Berlin was a lapsed Fifth Avenue debutante, an amphetamine-loving wild child, the biggest and most proudly exhibitionist member of the Warhol clan, and also Andy’s loyal best friend and muse. In rebellion against her blue-blooded Republican parents (her father ran the Hearst Corporation), she married a window dresser at the age of twenty-one and later escaped into the underground art scene, where she worked as a receptionist at the Factory and appeared in Warhol films like “Chelsea Girls,” in which she lived up to her nickname, Brigid Polk, by self-administering an injection of speed. She also, throughout the nineteen-sixties and seventies, used a tape recorder and her only camera, a Polaroid 360, to obsessively document life in the Warhol social circle. Her collection of sloppy, deadpan snapshots—including Nico and Lou Reed, Viva and Candy Darling, Roy Lichtenstein and Dennis Hopper, and many antic self-portraits, often featuring Berlin half nude—accrue with the casual relentlessness of an analogue social-media stream.","October 28, 2015","2622","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/brigid-berlins-world-in-polaroids"
"Now in her seventies and living in the Gramercy apartment she’s occupied for thirty years, Berlin recently digitized her extensive archive and, in November, will publish a book of her Polaroids through Reel Art Press. (A selection of images is also currently on display at the Lower East Side gallery Invisible-Exports.) Berlin is clear that she never considered herself an artist per se, or even much of an art appreciator; Factory lore has it that when Warhol offered her a painting as a gift, she rejected it, saying she’d prefer a washing machine. “No picture ever mattered,” she’s said. “There was never any subject that I was after. It was clicking it and pulling it out that I loved.” But her photographs, like the dreamy double exposures featured above, capture a visual wit, free-wheeling inventiveness, and methodical self-documentation that betray a prodigious creative spirit. In an introduction to the new book, Bob Colacello, the former editor of Interview, writes, “Brigid’s need to rebel has always been matched by her need to document her rebelliousness, and the overlapping of these two compulsions is what gives her work meaning beyond its curiosity value. In recording life, she captured our times.”","2623","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/brigid-berlins-world-in-polaroids"

"Pope Francis, Secretary of State John Kerry, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were among those said to be likely to win this year’s Nobel Peace Prize. Few prognosticators could have heard of the civil-society groups that make up the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet, let alone have imagined that they would be awarded the prize.","October 10, 2015","2625","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-bright-spot-in-tunisia"
"The Nobel committee praised the quartet—composed of the Human Rights League, the General Labor Union, the Order of Lawyers, and the Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts—for its “decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy . . . in the wake of the Jasmine Revolution in 2011.” Since its foundation two years ago, the quartet has been “instrumental in enabling Tunisia . . . to establish a constitutional system of government guaranteeing fundamental rights for the entire population, irrespective of gender, political conviction or religious belief,” the committee said. By offering a functional alternative to political violence and social unrest the quartet had helped Tunisians to avoid a civil war.","2626","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-bright-spot-in-tunisia"
"The Nobel committee’s decision is inspired and also timely. It offers a momentary break from the avalanche of verdicts, assumptions, disappointments, and regrets that have come to overwhelm discussions about the Arab Spring, and it allows us to consider what actually occurred in 2011 in the Middle East. It has not been possible to think clearly about what has taken place, and is continuing to unfold today, partly because the conversation about the Arab revolutions has become indulgent. It is obsessed with regret. The ideological transformation has been striking, and dizzying to those who witness and suffer from it: The same voices that once spoke with passion and force for democracy are now whispering remorse for ever having stood up to tyranny.","2627","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-bright-spot-in-tunisia"
"Mass migration and loss of life, and the destruction of entire cities, is horrific. Civil war is a national crisis, and also a private trauma: We suffer it collectively, and in isolation. Seeing your own kill and be killed by one another is a daily tragedy. Watching your compatriots run across foreign lands to reach a place of safety and dignity darkens the hours. The despair can break you, and make you long for the savage stability that a boot on the neck once provided. But that is a failure of imagination and a failure of reason. We mustn’t let despair and bewilderment make us doubt the authenticity of our revolutions. Our people did not rise out of indulgence or because they were manipulated by outside forces, but exactly to end the indulgences of dictatorship and the interferences of foreign powers.","2628","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-bright-spot-in-tunisia"
"A thunder struck when the streets of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Bahrain, and Syria were overrun with pro-democracy marches. Those demonstrations did not just shake the Arab world; they nudged every nation. They interfered with the order of the day, where an authoritarian pragmatism cloaks every human argument, until all we have left to believe in is brute force and the economy—“taking refuge,” as Marilynne Robinson puts it, “by hiding our head in the ledger.” The Arab Spring, with all of its failings and failures, exposed the lie that if we are to live then we must live as slaves. It was an attempt to undermine not only the orthodoxy of dictatorship but also an international political orthodoxy where every activity must be approved by the profit logic of the “ledger.”","2629","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-bright-spot-in-tunisia"
"The success of the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet to facilitate compromise between opposing political, religious, and economic camps demonstrates that—despite the challenges and the tragedies that surround us—close coördination, patient dialogue, and civil organization can not only work but work best. The quartet reaffirms the authentic spirit of the Arab Spring and is a testament to Tunisia’s freedoms and robust civil society as well. Cairo used to be the preferred base of human-rights organizations working in the region. Now most such N.G.O.s have moved to Tunisia. Tunis, the capital, has become the Mecca of the Arab world’s best human-rights workers and lawyers. And even though the political situation in Tunisia remains fragile, international recognition of this collaboration between trade unions, human-rights campaigners, and lawyers can only bolster civil society in the nation and the region. The prize is a bright spot in a dark time.","2630","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-bright-spot-in-tunisia"
"The deal announced on Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders will, if approved, keep the government open for the remainder of his term in office and offer modest budget increases in both military and domestic spending. In agreeing to the deal, Speaker John Boehner, who departs his post on Friday, gives his successor, Paul Ryan, a parting gift: the right to do nothing.","October 29, 2015","2631","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryan-won-the-right-to-do-nothing"
"The deal, in short, makes sure that the government will fulfill its most rudimentary obligations. Federal law-enforcement agents will continue to go to work; food-safety inspectors will keep up their duties; park rangers will keep tourists from falling into Old Faithful, at Yellowstone. The debt ceiling will be lifted, so the government’s credit will remain intact. And, because the continuing operations of these functions will be guaranteed through March, 2017, two months into the new President’s term, the House and Senate will not be compelled to do anything else.","2632","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryan-won-the-right-to-do-nothing"
"Under normal circumstances, this would hardly be seen as an advantage. Throughout most of its history, Congress did a lot more than pass a budget. It passed laws to address national problems—to guarantee voting rights or expand access to health insurance or reform immigration laws. But the modern Republican Party operates principally as a negative force. It exists to oppose, and regards compromise as surrender. Indeed, it seems likely that the only reason Boehner could agree to this budget deal at all is that his comrades in the G.O.P. have no leverage against him—they’ve already forced him out.","2633","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryan-won-the-right-to-do-nothing"
"In deference to the feelings of a good number of his new constituents (that is, the Freedom Caucus and other radically conservative House Republicans), Ryan pronounced himself disappointed with the deal. “I think the process stinks,” he said. But it appears that he will vote for it. Still, if the deal does pass (not a sure thing at this point), it will be mostly with Democratic votes in the House, along with a few straggling relics of what used to be called moderate Republicanism.","2634","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryan-won-the-right-to-do-nothing"
"The bizarre, extreme behavior of the Republicans now in charge of the House of Representatives reveals itself most strikingly in those it has chosen as its principal enemies—Boehner and his counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, now the Majority Leader. They are hardly what conservatives like to call “squishes.” As the leader of his party in the Senate, McConnell was best known for this expression of his priorities: “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term President.” Likewise, Boehner said the following about his plans for Obama’s agenda: “We’re going to do everything—and I mean everything we can do—to kill it, stop it, slow it down, whatever we can.”","2635","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryan-won-the-right-to-do-nothing"
"In expressing these views, Boehner and McConnell were channelling the beliefs of their party. Republicans had no higher goals than to defeat Obama and stall his agenda. They failed to stop him from winning in 2012, but they did manage to vote dozens of time to repeal his signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. In taking all these votes, the Republicans in the House never came up with an alternative to Obamacare, but that was never the point. The point was to oppose—endlessly.","2636","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryan-won-the-right-to-do-nothing"
"The chilling reality, though, is that the new leadership in the House may make Obama and the country regard Boehner’s reign as the good old days. When he wasn’t hurling insults at the President, Boehner did have the temerity to meet with Obama and try to find common ground on a handful of areas, at least on keeping the government open. Mindful of the consequences of Boehner’s apostasies, Ryan’s team will probably not make that mistake.","2637","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryan-won-the-right-to-do-nothing"
"And the Republican Presidential candidates? During the debate Wednesday, in Boulder, they were already competing to oppose the budget compromise the loudest, cripple it the most, and, if possible, shred it altogether.","2638","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryan-won-the-right-to-do-nothing"
