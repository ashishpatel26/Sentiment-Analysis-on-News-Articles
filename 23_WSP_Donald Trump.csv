"Where’s the Donald?","April 27","1","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gop-needs-donald-trump/2015/04/27/36e3f7e8-ed13-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"Where is Donald Trump? He has sort of hung around presidential candidate events and even launched a presidential exploratory committee, but when the media’s lists of GOP contenders are printed, the name of Donald Trump is usually nowhere to be found. The man can’t get no respect.","2","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gop-needs-donald-trump/2015/04/27/36e3f7e8-ed13-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"To show you what I mean, I have in my hand the April 18 edition of the Economist magazine, which lists 11 possible presidential candidates, eight of them Republicans. Others cite as many as 19. Still, no Trump. The Post and the New York Times regularly publish similar lists — it’s hard to keep up without them — and yet no Trump. The Times’ list is called “Who Is Running for President (and Who’s Not)?” As far as I can tell, the only one who’s not is me.","3","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gop-needs-donald-trump/2015/04/27/36e3f7e8-ed13-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"This refusal to see Trump as a legitimate candidate is both mystifying and, for the Republican Party, highly injurious. After all, Trump has not only expressed serious interest — he’s in New Hampshire again this week — but he has sincerely declared himself to be “the only one who can make America truly great again.” He wouldn’t say that if he weren’t serious about running. I, frankly, don’t consider him any more of a dark horse than Mike Huckabee, who has noticed a war on Christianity that, apparently, you can see only with special glasses.","4","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gop-needs-donald-trump/2015/04/27/36e3f7e8-ed13-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"But if I were a Republican presidential candidate, I would do everything in my power to get Trump taken seriously. Oh, I know in previous years he has hinted at a presidential run and then done nothing. But the man provides a utility that the party dearly needs: He makes the other candidates seem reasonable. For instance, he recently retweeted: “If Hillary Clinton can’t satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?” A Trump staffer was given the blame, but it was Trump’s official account — and the message was taken down faster than one of his companies could declare bankruptcy.","5","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gop-needs-donald-trump/2015/04/27/36e3f7e8-ed13-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"Trump’s most interesting quirk is his touching conviction that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. You may wonder about the religious fervor of some of the candidates — the ever-running Rick Santorum, for instance — or the suppressed isolationism of Rand Paul. But nothing approaches Trump’s birther belief.","6","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gop-needs-donald-trump/2015/04/27/36e3f7e8-ed13-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"It remains remotely possible that Trump fastened on the birther stuff just to get some attention. After all, he is in other respects both smart and canny. He has built an impressive real estate empire and presided over a long-lasting and evidently successful TV show. He is a billionaire, and his brand is either an icon or a narcotic: People flock to his buildings, positioning themselves so the name Trump can be seen in their selfies.","7","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gop-needs-donald-trump/2015/04/27/36e3f7e8-ed13-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"It’s possible that even in American politics one can go too far. Maybe Trump has soiled himself. Now, it is true that Obama’s birth certificate was a bit late in showing up, but why demand it and not, at the same time, John McCain’s? Could it have been Obama’s race? Or that his father was born in Kenya? Or that his middle name is Hussein? Could it, in short, be a reflection of prejudice? I mean, black man, white mother, Kenyan father, strange middle name . . . can’t you connect the dots? Trump can. Follow them long enough and you’re in the loony bin.","8","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gop-needs-donald-trump/2015/04/27/36e3f7e8-ed13-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"Trump’s birther obsession is both distasteful and more than a minor tic, like his flamboyant hairdo. When, for instance, Hawaii’s health director, Loretta Fuddy, died in the crash of a small plane, Trump tweeted: “How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama’s ‘birth certificate’ died in plane crash today. All others lived.” Was he implying that Obama somehow killed her — maybe by drone? Who knows? Kenyans are capable of anything.","9","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gop-needs-donald-trump/2015/04/27/36e3f7e8-ed13-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"American politics sometimes seems to me to be a version of the movie “Animal House.” Every four years, some wholly unqualified person surfaces — usually in the Republican Party — and is swiftly declared some sort of political messiah. Last time around it was the ridiculous Herman Cain, pedigreed by right-wing pundits as the man we’ve all been waiting for, and before that the comedic Sarah Palin, a woman for whom the word unqualified is itself unqualified. This year, it could be almost anyone, but whoever it is, he or she (Carly Fiorina?) better pray that Donald Trump gets fully into the race. He’ll make everyone else look better.","10","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gop-needs-donald-trump/2015/04/27/36e3f7e8-ed13-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"

"Donald Trump is back, and he's thinking* of running for president in 2016. Again*.","January 26","12","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"
"And his enablers are only so happy to help him out. Trump was given an invitation to the Iowa Freedom Summit this weekend -- perhaps out of affection but more likely out of a desire for the attention Trump inevitably brings.","13","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"
"At the event, he appeared alongside legitimate politicians and prospective GOP presidential candidates, with the best and most influential political journalists in the country sitting through nine hours of speeches. (Yep, nine hours. Wouldn't want to leave anybody out, apparently.)","14","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"
"Trump promptly used the platform he had been given to do what he does best: promote The Donald. But he also found time for a relatively new endeavor -- bashing two of the more likely 2016 GOP nominees, Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney.","15","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"
"“It can’t be Mitt; he ran and failed,"" Trump said, noting Romney's Obamacare-esque Massachusetts health-care law and his ""47 percent"" comments. Then Trump added a striking bit of revisionist history: ""He choked. Something happened to him in the last month. He had that election won.""","16","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"
"(Reality check: There was absolutely no point at which Romney was the clear favorite in the 2012 election. But this is hardly the first time Trump has shown his lack of political acumen.)","17","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"
"For good measure, Trump then turned to Bush, whom he attacked for supporting comprehensive immigration reform and the Common Core education standards -- a total non-starter among groups like the one he spoke to Saturday. ""The last thing we need is another Bush,"" Trump said.","18","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"
"There is a point at which Trump's political apprenticeship (see what we did there?) stops being a relatively harmless sideshow and he starts becoming a potential problem for Republicans. Others would argue that this ship has sailed already, and that's fair. But it has become abundantly clear this whole thing has diminishing -- if any -- returns for the Republican Party.","19","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"
"It's one thing for Trump to espouse discredited theories about whether President Obama was born in the United States; it's another for Trump to start attacking fellow Republicans and fomenting intra-party feuds during his regular media appearances. One is bad enough without the other.","20","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"
"This is all even more striking because Trump was a Romney guy in 2012 -- even during the primary season. He endorsed him in early February, before Super Tuesday, raised money for him and did robo-calls.","21","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"
"It's no secret why Trump is doing this. He's not getting as much attention for his potential presidential candidacy this year, and there's no better way to get attention than to start fighting with your own party. He has been doing this for years, saying he was considering a 2012 presidential bid and a 2014 New York governor bid. He even toyed with a third-party bid in 2000. People aren't paying as much attention this time, so he needs to up the ante.","22","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"
"He's just not serious. He can't even name a county in Iowa.","23","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"
"Republicans -- even in the party establishment like Romney -- have played nice with Trump for a long time, not wanting to inflame the portion of the base he has sway over. That made political sense when he was an early leader in polls of the 2012 GOP primary polls and the birther movement was still a thing; today that's not the case. Trump has moved from a sideshow with a base to a sideshow without a base. It's why there's no real push for him to run for president (outside of his own head, of course).","24","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"
"It might be time for events like the Iowa Freedom Summit to stop inviting him. And for a Republican Party that is trying to broaden its appeal going forward, dealing with its Donald Trump problem would be a pretty good start.","25","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/the-gop-needs-donald-trump-to-shut-up-now/"

"So far, your 2016 plan to faux-run for president is off to a smashing start. Unlike in your previous fake-go-arounds, you’ve actually hired staff in key early states. You’ve created an exploratory committee and filed with the FEC. You have your very own Super PAC (well, not yours, it’s completely independent, of course). In doing so, you have brilliantly demonstrated how wrong BuzzFeed’s McKay Coppins was to write “If history is any judge, Trump is about as likely to run for president in his lifetime as he is to accept follicular defeat.”","72","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/22/a-very-important-memo-to-donald-trump/"

"Turning to substance, your command of foreign policy is, um, not good.","74","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/22/a-very-important-memo-to-donald-trump/"
"Unfortunately, the mainstream media is covering you like they cover other also-rans. While you might dismiss that as incompetence on their part (see below), your poll numbers within the GOP could be better. According to one NBC/WSJ poll, only 23 percent of Republican voters could even conceive of voting for you, whereas 74 percent could not.","75","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/22/a-very-important-memo-to-donald-trump/"

"These are the only tweets our hard-working staff could curate before they melted into laughter. As enthusiastic as the staff at Spoiler Alerts was to cover your coronation as the GOP nominee, we must sadly conclude that GOP candidates that go ballistic on every major conservative media organization — not to mention other GOP politicians — tend to not win the nomination.","77","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/22/a-very-important-memo-to-donald-trump/"

Why not faux-run for president as a Democrat?","79","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/22/a-very-important-memo-to-donald-trump/"
"Think about it, Donald. The GOP field is unbelievably crowded, and the Democratic field is not. Indeed, the Democratic field is so uncrowded that the only significant candidate is unrunning at the current moment. You’ve given to plenty of Democratic Party candidates in the past — why not just give it to yourself and take on Hillary Clinton in the primary?","80","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/22/a-very-important-memo-to-donald-trump/"
"Think of the media coverage! This would be the kind of game-changing, double-down faux-move that would demonstrate your political independence. The conservative media would go from beclowning you to explaining in serious baritones why you would be a real threat to Hillary. In the invisible primary politics that is 2015, it would dominate news cycle after news cycle of coverage.

"We have always been better at dealing with racists, as writer Zac Cheney-Rice wrote in the aftermath of the racist SAE fraternity chanting, than with racism — or any of the broader, more insidious forces at work that create this kind of explosive situation. Racists you can yell at. Decades of structural inequality demand more than words. That’s what we want to talk about Donald Trump. Because we can do something about Donald Trump, quickly.

"But the Baltimore situation demands more nuance than Trump suggests. As writer Michael A. Fletcher, a longtime Baltimore resident, wrote, “Baltimore is not Ferguson and its primary problems are not racial. The mayor, city council president, police chief, top prosecutor, and many other city leaders are black, as is half of Baltimore’s 3,000-person police force. The city has many prominent black churches and a line of black civic leadership extending back to Frederick Douglass. Yet, the gaping disparities separating the haves and the have nots in Baltimore are as large as they are anywhere. And, as the boys on the street will tell you, black cops can be hell on them, too.”","92","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2015/04/28/donald-trump-said-something-donald-trump-is-easy-baltimore-is-hard/"

"President Obama even said as much on Tuesday.

It’s just it would require everybody saying this is important, this is significant, and that we don’t just pay attention to these communities when a CVS burns, and we don’t just pay attention when a young man gets shot or has his spine snapped.

"Donald Trump wants everyone to know that he is serious about running for president in 2016.

"I can't emphasize that strongly enough. A decade ago, Trump might have cut an interesting figure, politically speaking. He was rich, well known and perceived as a no-nonsense businessman. That's not a bad profile for a third party presidential bid, which Trump flirted with in the 2000 race.","100","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/26/donald-trump-might-be-serious-about-running-for-president-hes-still-irrelevant/"
"But that's not the profile Trump has today. He is still rich (I think) and very well known. But, that's where the similarities end. Trump is now notorious rather than famous. He's seen as a professional provocateur rather than a serious businessperson. He has staked out positions -- questioning President Obama's birth certificate, for one -- that have badly marginalized him in the political sphere.","101","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/26/donald-trump-might-be-serious-about-running-for-president-hes-still-irrelevant/"

"There's plenty more polls just like those two but you get the idea. While I tend to believe Trump is in the midst of (yet another) publicity stunt and won't ultimately run for anything, even if he does there's absolutely no evidence that there's a constituency out there waiting for him.","105","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/26/donald-trump-might-be-serious-about-running-for-president-hes-still-irrelevant/"
"Yes, a Trump candidacy would get lots of attention -- from the media (sad face) and voters. But, fascination with a political train wreck isn't the same thing as serious interest in a candidate.

"Whenever Donald Trump’s around, it’s always the Trump Show.

"Williams hit the ceremonial first serve to Trump at an event marking the opening of the tricked-out tennis center. Trump volleyed back, but then hit a shot that went wide — but on his second try (hyper-competitive Trump, of course, wanted a rematch), she seemed to let him score. Mmmkay, so maybe it was a little long, but when your name’s Trump and you’re playing on a Trump court, it’s literally your rules.","120","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2015/04/07/serena-williams-lets-donald-trump-score-on-her-at-opening-of-trumps-tennis-facility/"
"And what’s a point or two between friends? Trump, who purchased the former Lowes Island Club in 2009, didn’t seem to mind sharing the spotlight with Williams. The crowd of champagne-sipping club members — many decked out in golf polos and tennis skirts — mobbed the athlete for selfies and a few old-school autographs, while local poobahs pressed the flesh with Trump, who was flanked by son and business partner Eric Trump.","121","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2015/04/07/serena-williams-lets-donald-trump-score-on-her-at-opening-of-trumps-tennis-facility/"

"But even while complimenting Williams during the brief ceremony, the maybe-presidential candidate couldn’t refrain from name-dropping other VIPs. Once, while extolling Williams’s recent Vogue cover as a testimony to the athlete’s fashion sense: “I know Anna Wintour, and she doesn’t do something like that just because she likes watching you play tennis.” Another came after he called Williams the “greatest” female player. “And Chris is a friend; I have lots of friends.” That was, presumably, a reference to former No. 1 player Chris Evert.","123","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2015/04/07/serena-williams-lets-donald-trump-score-on-her-at-opening-of-trumps-tennis-facility/"
"The center itself smacks of Trump’s over-the-top aesthetic, with unusual blue-surfaced courts and locker rooms that look more like something you’d find in a luxury hotel than a fitness club. Even Williams, who’s seen a few, was impressed. “It’s beautiful,” she enthused . “Those fabulous chandeliers — this doesn’t look like your average tennis facility.”","124","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2015/04/07/serena-williams-lets-donald-trump-score-on-her-at-opening-of-trumps-tennis-facility/"
"But Trump wasn’t waiting for anyone else to boast about the new building, or for the golf club itself. That, of course, is a job best left to Trump himself. “It’s considered the best in Washington — the best in the tri-state,” he said, adding that the scenic greens would soon host some “big-big” tournaments.

"Business whiz Donald Trump spoke to Paul Steinhauser of NH1 on Monday, outlining a few more of the impressive, classy planks in the platform of the presidential campaign that he will never actually launch.

"""I will build the best wall, the biggest, the strongest, not penetrable, they won’t be crawling over it, like giving it a little jump and they’re over the wall, it costs us trillions,"" Trump said to Steinhauser. (Seriously. That is not a made-up quote.) Perhaps realizing that committing the entire annual federal budget to making a huge wall wasn't the sort of thing that non-pretend candidates would say, Trump then explained that he would ""have Mexico pay for the wall"" -- which, as any savvy real estate mogul will tell you, is how it works.

"The fight for the top may have been raging among those with names like Bush, Rubio and Walker, but so, too, was the fight just to get some attention.

"There are also plenty of reasons to run for president beyond just winning. Sometimes it’s about trying to move the needle on a particular policy point.

"Trump wanted the news media to report that he got a standing ovation at this particular speech.

"Graham, though, doesn’t think he needs facial hair to get recognized. Even though recent polls found that 55 percent of constituents in his home state of South Carolina wouldn’t vote for him for president, he thinks he can win support on the strength of his hawkish message and his ability to connect on a retail level. He has a powerful life story of growing up in the back room of a liquor store and raising his little sister after his parents died.

"(Updated below with Keshia Knight Pulliam’s response on the “Today” show Monday morning.)","January 5","239","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"“The Celebrity Apprentice” premiere took a strange turn on Sunday night when actress Keshia Knight Pulliam, who served as project manager on the first challenge of the season, was eliminated by host Donald Trump after she didn’t use her connections with Bill Cosby to raise money for her team.","240","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"The subplot was a very significant part of the episode, as Pulliam (most famous for starring as Cosby’s daughter Rudy on NBC’s “The Cosby Show”) was taken to task for not calling Cosby and asking the very wealthy comedian for a charitable donation to her team. But hearing Cosby brought up so many times was extremely jarring and managed to overshadow the episode, considering that Cosby’s name has only been in the news lately as more than two dozen women have alleged they were sexually assaulted by him over the years.","241","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"Another fact to note: NBC delayed this season of “Celebrity Apprentice” for awhile, so the premiere was taped about a year ago, way before the disturbing allegations went mainstream and Cosby’s downfall. But that makes the episode even more bizarre. Given the amount of time the network and producers had to edit, why would they keep Cosby’s name as such an integral part of the storyline — especially when NBC is one of the many places to distance itself from Cosby, dropping his upcoming TV project less than two months ago? No one thought it might seem odd to viewers?","242","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"It all started when Pulliam was named the project manager for her team (this season divided the celebrities into women versus men). The first task of the season in New York City involved the teams baking pies to raise the most money for charity. Since it was a fundraising challenge, all the celebs got to work calling up their most famous friends to donate. Almost immediately, “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star Kenya Moore got on Pulliam’s case about calling Cosby.","243","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"“Have you tried reaching out to Mr. Cosby?” Moore asked.","244","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"“Um, I haven’t reached out to him, I was trying to reach people who are currently in the city,” Pulliam said.","245","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"Cue Moore talking to the cameras. “So let’s talk about the elephant in the room,” Moore complained. “Keshia was a Cosby kid. She was on one of the No. 1 shows of all time and the first person she should be calling is Bill Cosby because I know he has deep pockets.”","246","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"This went on for awhile as Pulliam explained she didn’t want to call Cosby. Moore wasn’t buying it. “We have to have big donations if we want to win. And Keshia, your TV dad is accessible for you and you don’t call him up for a donation? Okay, that’s just crazy,” Moore said.","247","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"It became a much bigger issue in the boardroom at the end of the episode, in which Trump decided which person to fire from the losing team. (The women raised $93,862 and lost to the men, who raised $185,322.) When Trump’s daughter and show advisor, Ivanka, asked who was holding back, Moore brought up the Cosby situation.","248","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"“If I were Rudy Huxtable and I was known for being America’s favorite daughter…I would have called my TV dad for a contribution,” Moore said.","249","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"Throwing a teammate under the bus is typical for the “Celebrity Apprentice” boardroom, but Trump jumped on the fact that Pulliam didn’t tap into every resource. “There is a truth to that,” he said, agreeing with Moore’s point as everyone started bickering. “You could have called him…did you call Bill?”","250","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"“I did not,” Pulliam snapped, exasperated. “I have not talked to Bill Cosby on the phone in, I don’t know how long. So for me to pick up the phone having not talked to you for five years, except for when we run into each other for a Cosby event, I feel like that’s not my place to do.”","251","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"She tried to defend herself, but Trump disagreed. “Doesn’t Kenya bring up a good point that you have this tremendous guy with a tremendous amount of money and with one phone call you could have won the whole task very easily?” he asked.","252","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"In the end, Trump couldn’t get past the fact that Pulliam refused to get Cosby on the phone. So when it came down to firing her, reality star Kate Gosselin, or Olympian snowboarder Jamie Alexander, Trump went with Pulliam.","253","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"“You didn’t make one call that I really believe that if you would have called that gentleman, he would have helped you even if you hadn’t spoken to him in years,” Trump explained sadly. “Because you were an amazing team with one of the most successful shows ever, so I think it would have been a very quick call to make for charity…Keshia, you’re fired.”","254","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"Again — this episode taped months ago, and NBC has made it clear it doesn’t want to be associated with Cosby in any way. Why include his name as a prominent element of the premiere? After the episode aired, Trump apparently didn’t have any problems with it.","255","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"“This show was taped just before the terrible Bill Cosby revelations came to light,” he tweeted. “She still should have asked him for money-goes to charity.”","256","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"UPDATE, Monday morning","257","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"Pulliam stopped by the “Today” show for a few minutes on Monday morning. Co-host Savannah Guthrie brought up the Cosby incident and the fact that Pulliam, again, didn’t call Cosby for money.","258","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"“It’s funny, I know ‘The Cosby Show’ is in reruns and everyone assumes that we’re this family that, like, has dinner every Friday night,” Pulliam explained. “But the reality was, I hadn’t spoken to Mr. Cosby and I felt that it would be kind of tactless, you know, very rude to call someone and be like, ‘Hey, so, let me have some money right now.'”","259","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"Of course, Guthrie also had to bring up the sexual assault allegations against Cosby, though she remained vague. “The other strange part, Keshia, as you well know, is that of course, now Mr. Cosby is facing all manner of allegations,” Guthrie started. “This was taped back in March, this episode, so it didn’t come up then. But, I mean, you’re here. I have to ask. What do you make of those allegations, people coming out and saying this happened to them? Somebody who was such a beloved character for so many years?”","260","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"“What I can say is this. I wasn’t there. No one was there except the two people to know exactly what happened. All I can speak to is the man that I know and I love,” Pulliam said. “That he has been such an example, and you can’t take away from the great that he has done. You know, the millions and millions of dollars that he has given back to colleges and education. And just what he did with ‘The Cosby Show’ and how groundbreaking that was.”","261","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"“Were you shocked by the allegations?” Guthrie asked.","262","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"
"“Ultimately, they’re that, allegations,” Pulliam said. “And it’s very much been played out in the court of public opinion. But, you know, we’re still in America where ultimately you’re innocent til proven guilty and, you know, I wasn’t there. That’s just not the man I know so I can’t speak to it.”","263","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/05/bill-cosbys-name-overshadows-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-in-strange-storyline/"

"In many of his 13 visits since 2010, that has been his theme, and it was captured Monday by the Des Moines Register:","265","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/10/chris-christies-charmless-charm-offensive/"
"Christie also seemed to liken himself Ronald Reagan, saying that Americans always knew where he stood because they felt like they knew him.","266","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/10/chris-christies-charmless-charm-offensive/"
"There's one big problem with this approach: No matter how much he insists that he is their kind of Republican, they aren't buying it.","267","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/10/chris-christies-charmless-charm-offensive/"
"According to the latest Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll, Christie is a known quantity. Among possible GOP 2016 contenders, only 10 percent aren't sure about how they feel about him. Only Mike Huckabee does better on that score.","268","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/10/chris-christies-charmless-charm-offensive/"
"But that familiarity has only led to high unfavorable ratings for Christie. Some 54 percent of likely 2016 GOP caucus-goers have an unfavorable view of the New Jersey governor. That's up from 45 percent in October, and only Donald Trump does worse, with a 68 percent unfavorable rating. (The difference is that Trump isn't running for president, nor is he busy trying to convince people that they should really like him.)","269","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/10/chris-christies-charmless-charm-offensive/"
"Christie does do better in New Hamphire. There, 59 percent give him favorable marks, but his 29 percent unfavorable rating is tied for the highest non-Trump number (with Mike Huckabee). And this is the state that is supposed to be Christie's (a Northeasterner) strength.","270","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/10/chris-christies-charmless-charm-offensive/"
"Christie was once the GOP's knight in shining armor, potentially riding into the 2012 primary at the last minute to save the party. Since then, his brand has taken a turn for the worse, but the message has largely stayed the same.","271","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/10/chris-christies-charmless-charm-offensive/"

"ABOVE SOUTH CAROLINA — Bobby Jindal was on a donor’s private plane, jetting between two cities in South Carolina. He’d been to this state five times since 2013. But, in that time, he had fallen so low in the polls here that he wasn’t in them anymore. South Carolina survey-takers had stopped asking about him.","March 14","273","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/southerner-wonk-immigrants-son-can-bobby-jindal-win-at-every-role/2015/03/14/eda87a74-be94-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html"

"First, he attacked Democrats. “The left . . . doesn’t trust the American people to lead our lives,” he told conservatives in West Columbia. Then he attacked other Republicans: “They need a spine,” Jindal told TV cameras.","275","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/southerner-wonk-immigrants-son-can-bobby-jindal-win-at-every-role/2015/03/14/eda87a74-be94-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html"
"Then, after a day of throwing political bombs, he flew to Greenville and bemoaned the lack of Christian love and charity in American life. “We’re at a moment when we need spiritual revival again,” Jindal told a group of pastors.","276","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/southerner-wonk-immigrants-son-can-bobby-jindal-win-at-every-role/2015/03/14/eda87a74-be94-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html"

"Not long ago, the Louisiana governor was the Republican candidate of the future — the son of immigrants and also a proud product of the Deep South.

"For the first time in a life of wild successes, Jindal looks lost. He has applied his trademark work ethic to the task of becoming a better politician, but he has instead wound up looking as if he’s trying to be every politician at once. A hawk. A wonk.

"After Jindal spoke in Greenville, for instance, the Rev.

"As you may recall, the events in Ferguson led many Republicans to argue that the militarization of police had gone too far, and some expressed sympathy for black residents beset by constant harassment and fines from police.

You may be familiar with what psychologists call the fundamental attribution error, our tendency to view our own actions as the product of circumstance, but other people’s actions as revealing their character (when I cut someone off in traffic, it was an honest mistake, because he was in my blind spot; when you cut someone off in traffic, it’s because you’re an inconsiderate jerk).

"But some prefer to see riots not as an explosion of anger that was produced by police brutality and feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, but purely as an expression of the character of the people in the streets, divorced from any context.

"To deny that this position is tied up in the race of the people rioting requires a truly epic feat of intentional blindness. Perhaps I overlooked it, but I don’t remember too many National Review writers getting angry at the many incidents in which white people have rioted in recent years, with as little provocation as the outcome of a football game. But it’s all there in this one paragraph from Tuttle: the insistence that the riots are only produced by a certain “type of person,” the “thugs” characterized by “animalism.” The way he describes Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake as “Oberlin-alumna,” as though it was her liberal-arts education that set the streets ablaze, is straight from the Republican playbook: When you can’t argue that your side doesn’t represent the economic elite, encourage resentment at a liberal intellectual elite that supposedly coddles and encourages the degenerates of the black underclass.","369","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/28/how-about-a-balanced-response-to-the-baltimore-riots/"

"Jim Pethokoukis at the American Enterprise Institute writes that the flat tax “would raise taxes on middle-class and working-class families and the poor, and worsen some of [the] worst anti-growth aspects of the current code. If the flat tax is the answer for Republicans, what the heck is the question?” The question, I suppose, is what would an ideologically rigid Republican clueless about political reality come up with based on a false assumption that 2015 is just like 1981? The reliance on the 1980s Reaganomics also falsely assumes the Reagan tax cuts paid for themselves.","April 29","464","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/29/reimagining-reaganomics/"
"So what should conservatives be saying about tax reform? Pethokoukis suggests, “The US debt-GDP ratio is three times higher than when Reagan took office, and we are only now feeling the fiscal impact of all those retiring Baby Boomers. So smart tax reform should focus on boosting long-term productivity (and providing middle/working-class tax relief as Reagan did) while also making sure it doesn’t make the red ink flow even faster.” In short, give the middle class some help, move the code in favor of growth and don’t lose a ton of revenue you are not prepared to make up in gigantic spending cuts.","465","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/29/reimagining-reaganomics/"
"There is plenty of room within those parameters — and more if you start looking at the payroll tax — to devise a variety of policy options. To get elected, GOP candidates need to be cognizant of the middle-class squeeze, which worsened under President Obama. Yes, reform of the corporate tax code will increase investment and hopefully job growth, but the supply side of the equation need not be — and from a political side cannot be — the sole solution. Republicans need to think in terms of also increasing middle- and lower-class take-home pay and purchasing power (the demand side, in other words).","466","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/29/reimagining-reaganomics/"
"Moreover, Republicans would be wise not to roll out a laundry list of discrete proposals. Rather, they need to provide voters with their take on the problem and their vision of how to solve it.","467","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/29/reimagining-reaganomics/"
"The solution should include, but not be exclusively about, tax reform. There is tort reform (to lower medical costs), health-care reform (to lower costs and increase choice without hobbling employers), trade and legal immigration (to recruit the high end of the world’s human capital to work, innovate and create jobs here instead of overseas), education reform (which includes school choice but also the promise of better job preparation in public schools, where more than 90 percent of kids are) and budget priorities (more for defense and basic research, less for entitlements for rich people). If you are going to fight for the $40,000 to $100,000 income earners, these policies should all be working in tandem to the benefit of those people. But in a presidential race it is equally important to get the overarching message right. Average voters will want to know a candidate grasps the issues and has plans, but mostly they want to know how the candidate is going to benefit them. That should be the goal for each campaign.","468","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/29/reimagining-reaganomics/"

"The annual celebrity-politico meet-up at the Washington Hilton drew the powerful, the famous and the just plain well-connected to a corner of town Saturday night for an evening of gags and glamour. The black-tie Hollywood-on-the-Potomac party featured fewer big-name stars this year, but more than enough to create the one-of-a-kind mash-up of actors, senators, Supreme Court justices, business types — and, of course, the president and first lady.","471","https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/at-correspondents-dinner-hollywoods-version-meets-reality/2015/04/25/0e3a8f9c-eb91-11e4-9a6a-c1ab95a0600b_story.html"

"In his relatively brief comic turn, Obama likened Hillary Clinton’s nascent presidential campaign to Americans’ lingering uncertainty about the economy. “I had a friend making millions of dollars a year,” he said. “Now she’s living in a van in Iowa.”","473","https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/at-correspondents-dinner-hollywoods-version-meets-reality/2015/04/25/0e3a8f9c-eb91-11e4-9a6a-c1ab95a0600b_story.html"

"Turning serious, Obama paid tribute to journalists Stephen Sotloff and James Foley, who were kidnapped and executed by Islamic State militants, and to Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who was “imprisoned for doing nothing more than writing about the hopes and fears of the Iranian people.

"In her remarks, Strong took aim at some of the same targets as Obama — the media, the candidates and Congress. Of the latter, she said: “It feels so weird being up here.

"The dinner and its preliminaries were telecast live by Fox News, MSNBC and CNN, in addition to C-SPAN.

"Hence the contingent from “Madam Secretary,” a fake secretary of state, Tea Leoni, working the room alongside Madeleine K. Albright, a real-life former secretary of state.

"The star attraction, as always, was the president, whose presence on the dinner’s dais all but guarantees a capacity crowd each year.

"This year, the celebrities were even able to watch the celebrities; at the Thomson Reuters pre-dinner reception, a giant screen loomed over guests that live-streamed the red-carpet arrivals. The Bloomberg News party had its own studio inside the party. At the Yahoo-ABC party, Katie Couric schmoozed with Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and Chris Wallace, a Fox News host.

"What's interesting is how the margins have changed. In presidential years, the results have been closer, but the swings of support for different candidates have been wide.

"The younger Bush isn't toeing the line when it comes to some key conservative litmus-test issues. Among them is the no-new-taxes pledge spearheaded by Grover Norquist. While the pledge is signed by the vast majority of Republicans running for and serving in Congress, Bush hasn't signed it and says he won't.","685","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/03/guess-who-doesnt-much-care-for-that-no-new-tax-pledge-republicans/"

"A 2012 Quinnipiac poll asked whether people thought it would be good or bad ""for a member of Congress to sign a pledge to an anti-tax group to never increase taxes on corporations or the wealthy under any circumstance?"" Just 10 percent said it would be a good idea; 85 percent disagreed.","691","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/03/guess-who-doesnt-much-care-for-that-no-new-tax-pledge-republicans/"
"That question, of course, only mentioned corporations and the wealthy, which could surely skew the results against the pledge. The question from the Post-ABC poll is much more neutral, but it still shows Americans -- and Republicans -- overwhelmingly oppose such a pledge.","692","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/03/guess-who-doesnt-much-care-for-that-no-new-tax-pledge-republicans/"
"CNN in December asked the question in somewhat different fashion, bringing up Bush by name and asking whether his move to decline the pledge makes people less likely to vote for him. Thirty-eight percent said it did, while 19 percent said it made them more likely, and 43 percent said it made no difference.","693","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/03/guess-who-doesnt-much-care-for-that-no-new-tax-pledge-republicans/"
"While not a huge strike against, this poll suggests declining the pledge could be a net-negative -- more so than the Post-ABC poll, at least. But it stands to reason that mentioning Bush by name could bias the question; several polls have shown around four in 10 Republicans are predisposed to vote against Bush in the first place. (Of course, it would also make sense for Bush supporters to say it would make them ""more likely"" to back him.)","694","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/03/guess-who-doesnt-much-care-for-that-no-new-tax-pledge-republicans/"
"And oftentimes on an issue like this, the enthusiasm is on the more conservative (pro-pledge) side. But that's not really the case here. Twenty-three percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents in the Post-ABC poll oppose the no-tax pledge and say it's ""extremely"" or ""very"" important to them -- slightly more than the 18 percent who support it and say the same.","695","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/03/guess-who-doesnt-much-care-for-that-no-new-tax-pledge-republicans/"
"The picture is more pro-pledge among the most conservative Republicans, though. Thirty percent feel strongly about a candidate supporting the pledge; 14 percent feel strongly that the candidate shouldn't sign the pledge. And these voters, we would note, tend to drive the conversation in GOP primaries.","696","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/03/guess-who-doesnt-much-care-for-that-no-new-tax-pledge-republicans/"
"And this poll doesn't mean Republicans will stop signing the pledge.

"The Hill reports, “The rapid growth of the GOP presidential field is causing major headaches for party bosses ahead of a primary debate season that begins this summer. The dilemma for Reince Priebus, Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman, is stark: If the declared field grows to 18 or 20 candidates, as now looks plausible, how can those numbers be winnowed in a way that seems fair and reasonable rather than arbitrary and undemocratic?” One assumes that 10 or even 12, but not more, is a manageable number.","April 30","699","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/how-to-prevent-chaos-at-the-first-gop-debate/"
"It should be noted, however, that many of the candidates thinking about a run have not yet declared their candidacy. It may be that when August rolls around, some currently on that roster of potential candidates do not formally declare. Candidates who have not bothered to take that step can be eliminated, and that may take the number down a bit.","700","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/how-to-prevent-chaos-at-the-first-gop-debate/"
"But if there are, say, 15 official candidates, there can be many ways to qualify: more than 1 percent in national or Iowa polls, more than 20 campaign events in Iowa (sorry, Donald Trump), a campaign presence in 10 or more counties, or participation in a previous multi-candidate forum. If someone can’t meet any of these criteria, he or she really is not a serious candidate, I would suggest.","701","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/how-to-prevent-chaos-at-the-first-gop-debate/"
"If that leaves more than a dozen candidates, I would be surprised. And if so, the debate format can be altered. Everyone gets a minute or so at the opening, but not everyone is asked every question. By random selection, three to four candidates can be assigned to each question and three to four others for rebuttal or response. It’s not ideal, but everyone gets to make an initial introduction.","702","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/how-to-prevent-chaos-at-the-first-gop-debate/"
"If by the next debate (after the straw poll) on Sept. 15 a candidate does not have 1 percent in either a recent Iowa or national poll, it is not unreasonable to eliminate him or her. Right now that criteria would include 11 candidates, according to polls collected by RealClearPolitics. With each debate (one per month leading up to the Iowa caucuses), the percentage to qualify can go up a few percentage points.","703","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/how-to-prevent-chaos-at-the-first-gop-debate/"
"The point here is not to sustain candidates with no popular support. That may distress candidates who have failed to make an impression, but the system is designed to help voters make a choice, not keep candidates going forever. These are supposed to be debates for serious candidates, not casual ones, who are making a significant effort to introduce themselves to Iowa voters.","704","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/how-to-prevent-chaos-at-the-first-gop-debate/"
"Moreover, it is a misnomer that a huge number of debate participants benefits serious but late-blooming candidates. If there are 15 people on the stage and everyone gets just a little time, then the better-known candidates maintain their advantage and the lesser-known candidates don’t get an adequate opportunity to be heard or to force one of the leaders to make a significant blunder. The top candidates have much more to lose in a debate, and the more bodies on the stage, the easier it is for them to avoid intense scrutiny.","705","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/how-to-prevent-chaos-at-the-first-gop-debate/"
"It is also the case that with the plethora of non-debate, multi-candidate events with ample coverage, there is plenty of opportunity for a candidate to get himself or herself in front of voters. Carly Fiorina, who has made an excellent impression at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and many of these events, is a case in point and is already registering in polls.","706","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/how-to-prevent-chaos-at-the-first-gop-debate/"
"The biggest problem, I would suggest, is not too many candidates but rather setting up debates in which candidates are pressed to give substantive answers and forced to withstand tough questions and attacks from opponents. Getting the moderators and the format right is critical; the numbers will sort themselves out.","707","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/how-to-prevent-chaos-at-the-first-gop-debate/"

"In the coming months, the large field of candidates will feel a strong gravitational pull to the right by activists in a party that has become more conservative over the past eight years.

"The lessons of Mitt Romney’s ultimately unsuccessful campaign of 2012 are still fresh in the minds of candidates and strategists.

"Avoiding those kinds of mistakes will be at the top of nearly every candidate’s handbook for running.

"Speakers focused more of their attacks on Obama than on the Democrats’ leading expected 2016 candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

"There was a heavy emphasis on foreign policy throughout the day, and a similarity in the comments.

"Santorum said Republicans should focus policies on working people more than on business owners and entrepreneurs.

"There were few direct criticisms of one or another of the candidates, but businessman Donald Trump drew a wave of applause when he urged Republicans to avoid both Bush and Romney. “It can’t be Mitt, because Mitt ran and failed,” Trump said.

"“Wolf Hall,” the Man Booker Prize-winning historical novel about the court of Henry VIII — and most dramatically, the conflict between Thomas Cromwell and Sir Thomas More — is now a TV series (presented on PBS). It is maddeningly good.","April 30","870","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/men-wielding-power-in-hellish-times/2015/04/30/0e444a04-ef6b-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"Maddening because its history is tendentiously distorted, yet the drama is so brilliantly conceived and executed that you almost don’t care. Faced with an imaginative creation of such brooding, gripping, mordant intensity, you find yourself ready to pay for it in historical inaccuracy.","871","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/men-wielding-power-in-hellish-times/2015/04/30/0e444a04-ef6b-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"And “Wolf Hall’s” revisionism is breathtaking. It inverts the conventional view of the saintly More being undone by the corrupt, amoral, serpentine Cromwell, the king’s chief minister. This is fiction as polemic. Author Hilary Mantel, an ex- and anti-Catholic (“the Catholic Church is not an institution for respectable people”), has set out to rehabilitate Cromwell and defenestrate More, most especially the More of Robert Bolt’s beautiful and hagiographic “A Man for All Seasons.”","872","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/men-wielding-power-in-hellish-times/2015/04/30/0e444a04-ef6b-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"Who’s right? Neither fully, though “Wolf Hall’s” depiction of More as little more than a cruel heretic-burning hypocrite is particularly provocative, if not perverse. To be sure, More worship is somewhat overdrawn, as even the late Cardinal Francis George warned at a 2012 convocation of bishops. More had his flaws. He may have been a man for all seasons, but he was also a man of his times. And in those times of merciless contention between Rome and the Reformation, the pursuit and savage persecution of heresy were the norm.","873","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/men-wielding-power-in-hellish-times/2015/04/30/0e444a04-ef6b-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"Indeed, when Cromwell achieved power, he persecuted Catholics with a zeal and thoroughness that surpassed even More’s persecution of Protestants. “Wolf Hall’s” depiction of Cromwell as a man of great sensitivity and deep feeling is, therefore, even harder to credit. He was cruel and cunning, quite monstrous both in pursuit of personal power and wealth, and in serving the whims and wishes of his royal master.","874","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/men-wielding-power-in-hellish-times/2015/04/30/0e444a04-ef6b-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"Nonetheless, Cromwell’s modern reputation will be enhanced by Mark Rylance’s brilliant and sympathetic cinematic portrayal, featuring a stillness and economy of expression that is at once mesmerizing and humanizing. The nature of the modern audience helps too. In this secular age beset by throat-slashing religious fanatics, we are far more disposed to despise excessive piety and celebrate the pragmatic, if ruthless, modernizer.","875","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/men-wielding-power-in-hellish-times/2015/04/30/0e444a04-ef6b-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"Which Cromwell was, as the chief engineer of Henry’s Reformation. He crushed the Roman church, looted the monasteries and nationalized faith by subordinating clergy to king. That may flatter today’s reflexive anticlericalism.

"It is perhaps unfair to call Cromwell (and Henry) proto-totalitarian, as some critics have suggested, essentially blaming them for what came after. But they did sow the seed.

"After all of the speculation that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in imminent danger of losing the election on Tuesday, he exceeded expectations and came out on top. Many Democrats in Washington hoped for and publicly predicted that Netanyahu would lose. They hoped his visit to Washington to address Congress would backfire. Many Democrats boycotted his speech, liberal commentators rebuked the Republican leadership for inviting him and President Obama made a very public point of not meeting with Netanyahu. But it looks like the prime minister’s address to Congress may have actually boosted Netanyahu’s appeal in Israel.","March 20","897","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/20/the-insiders-why-dont-republicans-get-more-jewish-votes/"
"Voters in Israel seem to share Republican sentiments about Israel’s security and they agree that Netanyahu is an able leader who should have more time in office. So why don’t Republicans get more Jewish votes in our elections? Given the Republicans’ strong support for Netanyahu and how that is obviously in sync with Israeli voters — to say nothing of being the party that respects and promotes entrepreneurs and private business — why aren’t more Jewish voters drawn to the Republican Party? Well, I guess the first and most obvious reason is that Americans’ political motivations are not the same as the Israelis’.","898","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/20/the-insiders-why-dont-republicans-get-more-jewish-votes/"
"But I don’t know why American Jewish support is so lopsided in favor of the Democrats. Republicans are nowhere near splitting the Jewish vote with the Democrats. In 2008, 78 percent of those who identified as Jewish voted for Obama. In 2012, despite Obama’s and the Democrats’ obvious contempt for the popular, powerful incumbent in Israel, 69 percent of Jewish voters cast their vote to reelect the president. Even in the 2014 midterm election, 66 percent of Jewish voters voted for the Democratic candidate. I hoped that percentage would be something closer to fifty.","899","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/20/the-insiders-why-dont-republicans-get-more-jewish-votes/"

"The White House, which never fails to make a bad situation worse, is continuing to insult the prime minister and his voters. Obama waited until Thursday to congratulate Netanyahu on his reelection, and the Democratic leadership in Congress has been relatively muted in their congratulatory statements, particularly when compared with the reactions of their Republican counterparts.

"But, having watched the speech live and gone through the entirety of the transcript afterwards, what's clear is that the Bush riff on his family was totally shoe-horned into the broader address and had virtually nothing to do with what Bush was talking about more generally when it came to his foreign policy vision.","936","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/18/jeb-bushs-speech-really-had-nothing-to-do-with-his-family/"
"The ""family"" portion of the speech came toward the beginning as Bush was laying out his principles in regards foreign policy. Here's the full section as delivered:","937","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/18/jeb-bushs-speech-really-had-nothing-to-do-with-his-family/"
"118 words. Out of a speech -- not counting the question and answer following Bush's remarks -- that ran well over 4,000 words. Roughly two percent of all the words Bush spoke had to do with his family and his own man-ness. Watch the whole speech; I guarantee you that the ""family"" section will feel sort of out of place; kind of like the dream sequence in ""Dumbo"" -- tangentially related to the main plot but barely so. (Sorry. I have young kids. That ""Dumbo"" sequence weirds me out every time.)","938","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/18/jeb-bushs-speech-really-had-nothing-to-do-with-his-family/"
"Given the sort-of-out-of-nowhere nature of what Jeb said on his family -- and the fact that the ""I am my own man"" line was included in the excerpts shipped to reporters (including this one) Tuesday night, it seems very clear what Jeb (and his team) were up to. This was a trial balloon for how (and how much) Jeb will -- and will have to -- talk about the Bush name in the campaign to come. His people are smart and, therefore, were well aware that the lines about his family would dominate coverage and overshadow a speech decidedly light on specifics. That level of press coverage and scrutiny will function, at some level, as a sort of gauge for how much leeway (or not) Bush has to talk about his brother and father (or not talk about his brother and father).","939","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/18/jeb-bushs-speech-really-had-nothing-to-do-with-his-family/"
"Assuming the Bush folks did this on purpose -- and I am very strongly suspicious that they did -- then it's a very smart strategic move. Begin the airing of the major issue for Jeb -- his last name and all it means -- even before he is a candidate in a speech that will draw lots of attention from the politics-starved political media.

He pointed out that, first, the likelihood was small that the difference in age between the Democratic and Republican nominees would be anything unusual -- or, at least, any bigger than in 2008; John McCain was 25 years older than Barack Obama, the widest spread.

"The fast food giant's latest marketing pitch is a series of videos about its french fries. In one (watch it here), actor and former ""MythBuster"" co-host Grant Imahara answers the question no one was asking: What's in McDonald's french fries? He explains that you can trace McDonald's fried potato sticks back to—wait for it—potatoes. In another (watch it below), which is even more perplexing, McDonald's reverses the narrative, by detailing each and every ingredient that goes into its french fries. And there are many. So so many.","949","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/22/there-are-19-ingredients-in-mcdonalds-french-fries/"

"But relax, McDonald's implores, there's a reason. The rest of the nearly 3 minute video is dedicated to explaining why exactly each of those 19 ingredients is essential. Most of the explanations are fine—serving as many french fries as McDonald's does with that level of consistency is a much more difficult task than making them at home. But some of them are strange. Why, for instance, are seven different types of oil needed? And do people really want to know about this one?","951","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/22/there-are-19-ingredients-in-mcdonalds-french-fries/"

"Call it the Trump Challenge: Will the Donald’s GOP rivals be as specific as he has on the question of what should happen to the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country?

"Trump’s GOP rivals are now getting pinned down on the question of whether they agree with him on this and other immigration matters. Here’s a very good example.

"Cruz’s dodge — he says we have to secure the border before we can even discuss Kelly’s question — is very similar to the approach Scott Walker has taken. As I’ve said before, I think Trump’s GOP rivals should be pressed more on whether they agree with his vow to deport 11 million than on whether they agree with him on birthright citizenship, because the problem of what to do about the 11 million is the core dilemma underlying our impasse on this issue. Most of Trump’s GOP rivals continue to fudge on that core question.","1070","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/26/morning-plum-megyn-kelly-nails-it-on-why-donald-trump-matters/"
"But Kelly is absolutely right to note, in the context of the birthright citizenship debate, that Trump has answered questions “explicitly,” while Cruz won’t.

"“It’s funny. My own mother was a housewife all her life. And yet it’s turned out that I’ve hired a lot of women for top jobs, and they’ve been among my best people.

"“The [1997 Miss Universe] pageant in Miami Beach, my first as owner, was a huge success. We’d sold out the house; it was a mob scene. From my position offstage, I was able to glance up to the greenroom occasionally. I could just see Alicia Machado, the current Miss Universe, sitting there plumply. God, what problems I had with this woman. First, she wins. Second, she gains fifty pounds. Third, I urge the committee not to fire her. Fourth, I go to the gym with her, in a show of support. Final act: She trashes me in The Washington Post — after I stood by her the entire time. What’s wrong with this picture? Anyway, the best part about the evening was the knowledge that next year, she would no longer be Miss Universe.” (“Trump: The Art of the Comeback”)","1174","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/"

"“I grew up in a very normal family. I was always of the opinion that aggression, sex drive, and everything that goes along with it was on the man’s part of the table, not the woman’s. As I grew older and witnessed life firsthand from a front-row seat at the great clubs, social events, and parties of the world — I have seen just about everything — I began to realize that women are far stronger than men. Their sex drive makes us look like babies. Some women try to portray themselves as being of the weaker sex, but don’t believe it for a minute.” (“Trump: The Art of the Comeback”)","1176","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/"
"“Women have one of the great acts of all time. The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers. The person who came up with the expression ‘the weaker sex’ was either very naive or had to be kidding. I have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye — or perhaps another body part.” (“Trump: The Art of the Comeback”)","1177","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/"
"“There’s nothing I love more than women, but they’re really a lot different than portrayed. They are far worse than men, far more aggressive, and boy, can they be smart.

"“I was especially carefree [in the early-mid 1970s]. I had a comfortable little studio apartment in Third Avenue in the city, and I maintained a lifestyle that was fairly commonplace then but that now, in an age when people are worried about dying from sex, is hard to even imagine. I didn’t drink or take drugs; as far as stimulants go, I’ve yet to have my first cup of coffee. But I was out four or five nights a week, usually with a different woman each time, and I was enjoying myself immensely.” (“Trump: Surviving at the Top”)","1183","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/"
"“One of the first things I did was join Le Club, which at the time was the hottest club in the city and perhaps the most exclusive — like Studio 54 at its height. It was located on East 54th Street, and its membership included some of the most successful men and the most beautiful women in the world. . . . [I]t turned out to be a great move for me, socially and professionally. I met a lot of beautiful young single women, and I went out almost every night. Actually, I never got involved with any of them very seriously. These were beautiful women, but many of them couldn’t carry on a normal conversation. Some were vain, some were crazy, some were wild, and many of them were phonies. For example, I quickly found out that I couldn’t take these girls back to my apartment, because by their standards, what I had was a disaster, and in their world appearances were everything.” (“Trump: The Art of the Deal”)","1184","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/"

"“I knew from the start that Ivana was different from just about all of the other women I’d been spending time with. Good looks had been my top — and sometimes, to be honest, my only — priority in my man-about-town days. Ivana was gorgeous, but she was also ambitious and intelligent. When I introduced her to friends and associates, I said, “Believe me. This one’s different.” Everyone knew what I meant, and I think everyone sensed that I found the combination of beauty and brains almost unbelievable. I suppose I was a little naive, and perhaps, like a lot of men, I had been taught by Hollywood that one woman couldn’t have both.” (“Trump: Surviving at the Top”)","1187","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/"
"My marriage, it seemed, was the only area of my life in which I was willing to accept something less than perfection. . . . I grew up with the American Dream of sharing life with a wife and children, and that’s not something you just toss aside easily. I also stayed with Ivana because, as in most marriages, there was pressure to keep things intact. . . . There’s nothing wrong, of course, with worrying about the effects of divorce on your children and the other people around you. The problem is that those considerations aren’t enough to keep a marriage together. You can go for counseling, you can have heart-to-heart talks, you can stay together ‘for the sake of the kids.’ But in the end it’s always better for everyone if some couples part.” (“Trump: Surviving at the Top”)","1188","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/"

"“My big mistake with Ivana was taking her out of the role of wife and allowing her to run one of my casinos in Atlantic City, then the Plaza Hotel. The problem was, work was all she wanted to talk about. When I got home at night, rather than talking about the softer subjects of life, she wanted to tell me how well the Plaza was doing, or what a great day the casino had. I really appreciated all her efforts, but it was just too much. . . I will never again give a wife responsibility within my business. Ivana worked very hard, and I appreciated the effort, but I soon began to realize that I was married to a businessperson rather than a wife.” (“Trump: The Art of the Comeback”)","1190","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/"

"“My marriage to Marla lasted three and a half years. Sadly, like so many couples these days, we drifted apart. Our lifestyles became less and less compatible. We wanted different things. Marla was content when it was just her, [their daughter] Tiffany, and me. I, on the other hand, realized that business needed to be taken care of constantly. When two people have such a difference in opinion regarding the lifestyle they want to lead, there is no longer any reason to stay together.” (“Trump: The Art of the Comeback”)","1192","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/"
"“Marla was always wanting me to spend more time with her. ‘Why can’t you be home at five o’clock like other husbands?’ she would ask. Sometimes, when I was in the wrong mood, I would give a very materialistic answer. ‘Look, I like working. You don’t mind traveling around in beautiful helicopters and airplanes, and you don’t mind living at the top of Trump Tower, or at Mar-a-Lago, or traveling to the best hotels, or shopping in the best stores and never having to worry about money, do you? If you want me to be home at five o’clock, maybe these other things wouldn’t happen and you’d be complaining about that, too. Why would you want to take something that I enjoy and change it?” I always viewed her whys as being very selfish. But the fact is, in a marriage both sides have to be happy.’ (“Trump: The Art of the Comeback”)","1193","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/"
"“Often, I will tell friends whose wives are constantly nagging them about this or that that they’re better off leaving and cutting their losses. I’m not a great believer in always trying to work things out, because it just doesn’t happen that way. For a man to be successful he needs support at home, just like my father had from my mother, not someone who is always griping and bitching. When a man has to endure a woman who is not supportive and complains constantly about his not being home enough or not being attentive enough, he will not be very successful unless he is able to cut the cord.” (“Trump: The Art of the Comeback”)","1194","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/"

"“The most difficult aspect of the prenuptial agreement is informing your future wife (or husband): I love you very much, but just in case things don’t work out, this is what you will get in the divorce. There are basically three types of women and reactions. One is the good woman who very much loves her future husband, solely for himself, but refuses to sign the agreement on principle. I fully understand this, but the man should take a pass anyway and find someone else. The other is the calculating woman who refuses to sign the prenuptial agreement because she is expecting to take advantage of the poor, unsuspecting sucker she’s got in her grasp. There is also the woman who will openly and quickly sign a prenuptial agreement in order to make a quick hit and take the money given to her.” (“Trump: The Art of the Comeback”)","1197","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/"

Her husband was sitting on the other side of the table, and we were having a very nice but extremely straight conversation. All of a sudden I felt her hand on my knee, then on my leg. She started petting me in all different ways. I looked at her and asked, ‘Is everything all right?’ I didn’t want to make a scene in a ballroom full of five hundred VIPs. The amazing part about her was who she was — one of the biggest of the big. She then asked me to dance, and I accepted. While we were dancing she became very aggressive, and I said, ‘Look, we have a problem.

Because the actual Donald Trump is wealthy, he can turn himself into an unprecedentedly and incorrigibly vulgar presidential candidate. It is his right to use his riches as he pleases.

"Amending the Constitution is notoriously hard, which is why it has happened only 27 times in American history — 10 of which were passed en masse when our country was founded. It requires either 1) two-thirds approval in the House and Senate, followed by ratification of three-quarters of the states, or 2) the development of amendments at a constitutional convention called by two-thirds of the states and then ratified by three-quarters.

"It's a bit tricky to extrapolate from existing polling about birthright to attitudes about permanently altering the Constitution, so it's also hard to say exactly what might happen if such an amendment were actually proposed. But it's worth noting that the subject of birthright is far more common on the right. The most common form of opposition to birthright citizenship has been against ""anchor babies,"" a term used to refer to children of people who come to the United States, often illegally, to have babies who can then eventually take advantage of the natural-born right to be a citizen.

"Suddenly, according to recent polls, the iconically coiffed mogul has to be taken . . . how, exactly? Obviously it’s not possible to take Trump seriously, since there’s nothing remotely serious about him or his “campaign,” which is nothing more than a reality-show version of an actual campaign.

"Trump’s track record would look a lot better without the corporate bankruptcies, and many doubt he’s worth anything near the $9 billion he claims.

"In his announcement speech, which was really more of an extended improvised riff, Trump gave a description of Mexican immigrants that was both chauvinistic and xenophobic. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said. “They’re bringing drugs.

"Note the magnanimity: Trump, a big man, is willing to take it on faith that some immigrants from Mexico are not rapists. He clearly believes that very many are, however.

"But I digress. The point was how Trump had insulted men and women of Mexican heritage. It’s hard to stay focused when writing about him because there is no thread to grasp.

"To secure better deals or more time to pay off debts, Trump forfeited lucrative ownership stakes and allowed bankers, lawyers and bondholders to feast on his empire.

"“We’ll have the company. We’ll throw it into a chapter. We’ll negotiate with the banks.

"The Trump-tied bankruptcies have all been filed under Chapter 11, a provision allowing troubled companies to stay in business while restructuring their business model or reducing their debts.

"There are also many posh developments bearing the Trump name — including Trump Tower in Manhattan, sprawling condominiums in Istanbul and an upcoming luxury hotel near the White House — that have not headed to bankruptcy court. “Hundreds and hundreds of deals,” he said at the debate, and “four times I’ve taken advantage of the laws.

"A Chapter 11 filing, said Henry Sommer, editor in chief of the legal treatise Collier on Bankruptcy, can be a legitimate, respectable business response to corporate woes such as an industry shift or other nasty surprise — though, he added, it can also stem “from deals that were poorly put together to begin with.”","1399","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/what-trump-didnt-say-about-his-four-big-business-bankruptcies/2015/08/07/bc054e64-3d12-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html"
"Some of the debt Trump’s businesses took on was through bonds sold to the public, meaning bondholders who trusted and invested in the Trump name were left holding the bag.

"The first Trump-tied bankruptcy, in 1991, was of Trump’s biggest Atlantic City casino, the Trump Taj Mahal, whose $1 billion construction was financed by junk bonds at a staggeringly high interest rate of 14 percent.

"For a lower interest rate and more time to make loan payments at the Taj Mahal, Trump struck a deal with his lenders, giving up half his ownership and equity in the casino that bore his name.

"Alan Garten, Trump’s general counsel, said it was not fair to compare those losses, in which he had pledged his personal assets in support of the loans, to a personal bankruptcy.

"For easier repayment terms for those debts, Trump agreed to give up his 49 percent stake to a half-dozen lenders, including Citibank.

"In 2004, Trump faced his third corporate bankruptcy, when his Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts — which controlled the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza and Trump Marina (formerly Trump’s Castle) casinos in Atlantic City, as well as a riverboat casino in Indiana — was buried underneath $1.8 billion in debt.","1409","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/what-trump-didnt-say-about-his-four-big-business-bankruptcies/2015/08/07/bc054e64-3d12-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html"

"Trump brushed off the bankruptcy as “really just a technical thing” that touched only a small fraction of his net worth, telling the Associated Press then, “I don’t think it’s a failure, it’s a success.” But Trump also pumped $72 million of his personal fortune to help keep the restructuring afloat.","1411","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/what-trump-didnt-say-about-his-four-big-business-bankruptcies/2015/08/07/bc054e64-3d12-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html"

"DES MOINES, Iowa -- Shortly after Donald Trump's helicopter touched down in Des Moines on Saturday, a reporter asked him a question about his policies. Trump told her to watch Sunday's ""Meet the Press,"" when he would present a ""very comprehensive"" plan for immigration. That would be followed in a few days by a policy on taxes (""Who knows the system better than me?"") and then others, one after the next.","August 16","1423","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"Good, the reporter said, because ""a lot of voters are saying that they really want to see your policies now."" For which Trump had a remarkable response.","1424","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"""Well, I think the press is more eager to see it than the voters, to be honest,"" he said. ""I think the voters like me, they understand me, they know I'm going to do the job.""","1425","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"Trump added: ""You know, when you put out policy, like a 14-point plan? A lot of times in the first hour of negotiation, that 14-point plan goes astray, but you may end up with a better deal. That's the way it works. That's the way really life works. When I do a deal, I don't say, 'Oh, here's 14 points.' I got out and do it. I don't sit down and talk about 14 points.""","1426","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"

"There's an enormous amount of insight in that statement, about both Trump and about politics.","1428","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"One key advantage that Trump has is that he is unconstrained by the norms of running for office. He doesn't need to spend time raising money because, however much he actually has, it's in the billions -- hundreds of millions of which are liquid and with millions more coming in regularly. He doesn't need to actually win, because he's already accomplished -- and employed. He doesn't need to worry about what he says because so much of his appeal to voters is centered on his not caring what the repercussions are.","1429","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"All of which means that he's unconstrained by campaigning. He doesn't have to prove his chops to you; he's a billionaire. On ""Meet the Press,"" Chuck Todd asked him if he wanted Ukraine to join NATO. Trump told Todd, without mincing words, that he didn't care. ""If it goes in, great,"" Trump said. ""If it doesn't go in, great.""","1430","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"For another candidate, such a statement would reveal a lack of preparedness or seriousness. For Trump, it's barely remarkable. If he'd had a strong opinion on such a nuanced foreign policy question, it would raise more eyebrows than if he hadn't.","1431","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"And let's be honest: Almost no voters care about Ukraine's NATO membership either. Not many people care about the details of any policy, which is why most people don't know those details. Obamacare passed five years ago, and people still don't really know what it is, with notable exceptions at the partisan extremes. When people are considering candidates, most will review top-line policy positions, if they compare policies at all. This is why we have political parties: so that we can have a cheat sheet for what people stand for without having to do a lot of reading and becoming experts in particular issues.","1432","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"When Trump says that only the press cares about detailed policy papers, he's largely right, particularly this early. After all, his stated policies are so loosely formed as to draw derision from most quarters -- and yet he's still leading the Republican field.","1433","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"Trump is also introducing something else new to the campaign process: An explicit reliance on personality. Much of what we do when we choose a candidate is to try to use past actions to predict future behavior. But we're bad at that, both because we can't help but blend our desired outcome into our analysis, and because past action is actually a bad way to predict the future.","1434","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"If you had to predict if Barack Obama would endorse same-sex marriage based on what he'd said and done up to Election Day 2008, you'd have been wrong. But Obama's base was happy with the same-sex marriage decision -- and, in many cases, probably expected it -- because they had an expectation of the sort of liberal Obama was or would be. And that expectation was built, to no small extent, on who Obama was more broadly. On personality.","1435","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"Trump's answer to the reporter in Des Moines was that people trust him, are voting for him based on who he is, not what he'll do. And, again, that so far seems to be the case.","1436","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"But he was also saying something else: That defining specific things he'd do now was silly, since they'd so quickly go out the window. He's made similar arguments in the past, arguments that seem an awful lot like uncertainty or hemming. Sometimes, they probably were. But in responses to certain questions, he says: We'll see. That's not always a crazy idea.","1437","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"(An aside: One problem pundits -- myself included -- have made in analyzing Trump is that we think his failure to campaign with a normal campaign necessarily belies a lack of seriousness. He'll never run; he'll never fill out FEC paperwork; he'll never do retail politicking. In each case, people have overestimated how difficult those things are. Donald Trump walked through a giant crowd of people at the Iowa State Fair in 90-degree heat in a sport jacket for 45 minutes on Saturday, shaking hands and eating a pork chop. Tough stuff. Then he got in his helicopter and went back to his jet to fly home. What's the big deal?)","1438","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"
"On ""Meet the Press,"" Trump and Todd did indeed talk about immigration. Trump's proposal was not very comprehensive, though it did include some apparently new elements: repealing President Obama's executive orders and revoking the clause in the 14th Amendment that grants citizenship to people born in America. It's still a jumbled group of ideas.","1439","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/16/donald-trumps-surprisingly-savvy-comment-about-american-politics/"

If there’s been a policy “theme” to Trump’s campaign — and my colleague David Fahrenthold cogently explains why I put quotes around that word — it’s that past U.S. presidents have been bad trade negotiators and that because of these bad trade deals the rest of the world is somehow fleeing the U.S. manufacturing sector.

"To repeat a point I’ve made before (and will have to make again because this is a powerful myth), the truth is that while a small fraction of American manufacturing jobs migrated overseas over the past few decades, a far greater fraction of manufacturing jobs simply disappeared and are not coming back.

"If you want more evidence, consider Monday’s excellent New York Times story by Hiroko Tabuchi about Chinese textile firms now relocating factories back to the United States.

"While everyone has treated the Trump story as an amusing sideshow to the campaign (which it certainly is), there’s a genuine danger for the GOP in his presence that goes beyond the simple fact that he makes the party look silly (which he certainly does).

"Now let’s be clear: It isn’t as though Trump is going to be a serious contender for the nomination. But he could also go significantly higher than he is now. Just think about what happened in 2012, when one ridiculous candidate after another shot to the front of the Republican primary race. At one point, Rick Perry was in the lead with 32 percent support. Herman Cain once led with 26 percent. Newt Gingrich topped the field with 35 percent. Rick Santorum was No. 1 with 34 percent. The 2016 race may or may not be that volatile, but it will certainly have some ups and downs, as one candidate or another will stumble and another will rise.

"Of course, Jeb Bush or Scott Walker or Marco Rubio don’t bear responsibility for the things Trump says. But Latinos are paying attention to what he’s saying, and it can’t help but taint his fellow Republicans. As you might recall, in his announcement speech, Trump basically called every Mexican immigrant in the United States a low-life. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” In response, Univision pulled out of broadcasting the Miss Universe pageant, which Trump co-owns, and NBC dropped him as well. In Mexico, people are making Trump piñatas.","1514","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/01/donald-trump-is-on-the-rise-and-thats-very-bad-news-for-the-gop/"
"Given the chance to clarify, Trump said in essence that there are perfectly fine people in Mexico, it’s just the ones who come to the United States who are so awful, and also that these dangerous criminals come from other countries, too. “I’m not just saying Mexicans, I’m talking about people that are from all over that are killers and rapists and they’re coming into this country,” he said. So it’s really all immigrants that he has a problem with. Good to have that cleared up.","1515","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/01/donald-trump-is-on-the-rise-and-thats-very-bad-news-for-the-gop/"
"That kind of rhetoric coming from a prominent Republican candidate (who will almost certainly be included in the upcoming debates, by the way) makes it all the more difficult for the party to strike the tricky balance it needs to on the issue of immigration. The nominee will have to make the case for the policies he and every other Republican favors — increased border security above all, and nothing more than the far-distant possibility of a path to some vaguely defined legal status for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the United States — without communicating hostility toward immigrants in general, and through them to all Latinos (and to a lesser but still significant extent, to Asian Americans).","1516","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/01/donald-trump-is-on-the-rise-and-thats-very-bad-news-for-the-gop/"
"Even if all Republicans were acting welcoming and inclusive, it would be hard enough. Those voters are paying attention to the policy positions the candidates take, which means that any Republican, even one with Cuban parents (like Rubio) or one who speaks Spanish fluently and has a Mexican spouse (as Bush does), starts with two strikes against him. Trump may be a comical buffoon who stands almost no chance of getting the nomination, but by the time he’s done, the bile he spews could get his fellow Republicans dirty as well.","1517","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/01/donald-trump-is-on-the-rise-and-thats-very-bad-news-for-the-gop/"

"Moreover, 56 percent of all those surveyed, and 54 percent of Republicans, said Trump does not reflect the “core values” of the Republican Party.

"Keep that in mind the next time someone piously informs you that, whatever else you can say about him, Mr. Trump has touched a nerve, or tapped a feeling, or struck a chord. Frustration with politics transcends party these days, though in the case of Mr. Trump’s campaign, the nerves, feelings and chords in question belong to the much-aggrieved Republican Party “base.” It’s angry, we are told, because it sent a GOP majority to Washington which promptly betrayed its promise to repeal Obamacare and otherwise turn policy to the right.","1538","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-is-an-aimless-angry-leader/2015/08/10/4bb6a33c-3f89-11e5-8d45-d815146f81fa_story.html"
"A couple of points about Mr. Trump’s following and its anger: It does not represent a majority of the GOP, much less the country; 23 percent of Americans identify as Republicans, and Mr. Trump is the choice of about a quarter of them, for now.

"Anyone — we’re tempted to say any moron — can grab a torch and run in front of the mob. What takes talent is what you might call political anger management: to identify legitimate complaints and turn them in a constructive direction, on behalf of a governing prescription.

"To understand what I mean, you have to understand the theory of limit pricing that Paul Milgrom and John Roberts originally articulated more than thirty years ago.

"Sure, Fox News has cornered the market on conservative news coverage on television. But if the network were to ever alienate a significant chunk of its viewers, one could envisage a disintegration of viewership. And while I doubt that a majority of Fox News viewers would leave the network because of Trump, perhaps a significant fraction believes that Kelly or Bret Baier or Chris Wallace or Shepard Smith have gotten too cosmopolitan for their tastes. At a minimum, the blowback that Sherman reports in his story suggests that Ailes was worried about losing his viewers to other cable news channels willing and eager to provide Trump a platform.","1556","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/11/why-donald-trump-got-the-best-of-fox-news/"
"I suspect, however, that Ailes might be even more worried about the long-term fallout of a Donald Trump brought low because of a war with Fox News.

"Imagine, for a second, that you are a billionaire who thinks you are God’s gift to America and suddenly your poll numbers slump because of unrelenting and negative Fox News coverage. What would you do in response? Sure, maybe run as an independent. Or maybe you form your own conservative news network instead? Given the close relationship between Trump and Breitbart News, for example, and the sympathy that the Drudge Report seems to have for Trump, one could envisage an alliance of disgruntled conservatives forming an alternative to Fox News.

"So instead let’s turn this around and ask a question of the rest of the GOP field and the political media that has reported on them. For this entire calendar year, I’ve heard how the current crop of GOP presidential candidates “showcase[s] the party’s deep bench of talent” or that “the Republicans are sitting on the deepest bench they’ve had in decades” or how “a direct comparison with the last Republican primary, in 2012, reveals how strong this bunch of candidates is for the 2016 nomination.”","1568","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/27/the-most-damning-part-of-donald-trumps-political-rise/"
"And, to be fair, this seemed to be a fair analysis. There are no fewer than nine sitting and former governors of big states in the field. If that was off-putting to tea party types who don’t like governing, there were plenty of anti-establishment candidates like Rand Paul or Ted Cruz to get behind. I’ve heard a lot about how the GOP field is younger, more diverse and more politically talented than the Democrats.","1569","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/27/the-most-damning-part-of-donald-trumps-political-rise/"
"And yet, after all the declarations, we’re at a political moment when Trump is clobbering all of these talented politicians in the polls — and doing so by honing the lessons he learned from reality television.","1570","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/27/the-most-damning-part-of-donald-trumps-political-rise/"
"It’s late August, so obviously things will likely change by the time Iowa starts to caucus. But remember, the whole point of this deep GOP bench was supposed to be that it would thwart the absurdity of the 2012 cycle, when Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann were front-runners for a time. And yet in this cycle, it’s gotten to the point where William Kristol has morphed from praising the current crop of “strong candidates” to fretting that “the rest of the field isn’t what it should be” and encouraging Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito to enter the race.","1571","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/27/the-most-damning-part-of-donald-trumps-political-rise/"

"But Trump, it is now clear, will not go away by being ignored. If polling support — really, at this point, vague impressions and name recognition — is the selection criterion for participation in Republican debates, Trump is likely to be part of them. This would not only foster a circus-like atmosphere but also would, by definition, exclude a more serious candidate. Imagine losing Ohio Gov. John Kasich, for example, to make a seat for Trump.

"But doesn’t Trump deserve a chance to make his rambling, egomaniacal case? Some fraction of Republicans might be attracted to a populist, anti-establishment businessman, who, in private settings, is more serious than his cartoonish public image (it would be hard not to be).

"Yet the whole process of applying political scrutiny to Trump is difficult, given his aversion to systematic political thought. He communicates in a series of eruptions, gestures and tweets that generally assert the need for his own leadership while dismissing rivals as fools and worse. He calls Jeb Bush’s intelligence into question and ridicules Rick Perry for excessive sweating. He is a Ted Cruz birther and speculates that Hillary Clinton “can’t satisfy her husband.” His opponents are “losers” and “morally corrupt” and “selling this country down the drain.” They are “clowns” and “stupid people” and often, by his account, physically ugly.","1576","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trumps-politics-by-hammer/2015/06/18/35f4df7e-15df-11e5-9518-f9e0a8959f32_story.html"
"On the issues, we don’t get arguments, we get impulses. “I’ve built a multibillion-dollar empire,” he says, “by using my intuition.” Like many public figures who refuse to use written speeches, he believes that everything crossing his mind is worthy of expression, without being edited or organized for the benefit of others. So we get a spew of Trump’s gut feelings. They tend to be resentful of outsiders; immigrants are depicted as “rapists” and drug runners. They assume that Barack Obama was the beneficiary of affirmative action. “How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?. . . Let him show his records.”","1577","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trumps-politics-by-hammer/2015/06/18/35f4df7e-15df-11e5-9518-f9e0a8959f32_story.html"
"But mostly Trump’s gut tells him (and thus, automatically, us) that political and scientific elites are evil and scheming, both composed of idiots and capable of sophisticated conspiracies. He has falsely and dangerously asserted a connection between vaccines and autism, rooted in practices set by “pharmaceutical companies, because they probably make more money.” He has described a “GLOBAL WARMING” hoax of an extent so vast that it could only be revealed by capital letters. He famously asserted that public officials were engaged in a conspiracy to conceal the circumstances of Obama’s birth. And when one official tragically died, he pressed the claim to her grave. “How amazing,” Trump tweeted, “the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama’s ‘birth certificate’ died in plane crash today. All others lived.”","1578","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trumps-politics-by-hammer/2015/06/18/35f4df7e-15df-11e5-9518-f9e0a8959f32_story.html"

"Trump, we are to infer, knows what he’s doing. Whether this is true in the context of presidential politics isn’t important, apparently.

"One particularly telling moment, I thought, came when Trump was asked about his previous support of Democrats, including likely nominee Hillary Clinton.

"He may not have a shot at becoming president, but Donald Trump has already succeeded in uniting America — one nation, awash in snark.

As longtime Democratic strategist Paul Begala told The Washington Post, “I am a person of faith — and the Donald’s entry into this race can only be attributed to the fact that the good Lord is a Democrat with a sense of humor.” Or, as conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer said on Fox News: “This is the strongest field of Republican candidates in 35 years.

"But writing Trump off is dangerous. The billionaire may play the buffoon, but he is an important one — one whom Americans appear to adore. A USA Today-Suffolk University poll released Tuesday shows him leading all Republican presidential hopefuls. And while establishment candidates in both parties might want to ignore him, or express a milder version of his anti-immigration opinions, an enormous number of voters clearly like his views. Pretending they don’t allows Trump and other immigration firebrands, such as Rick Santorum and Ted Cruz, to resuscitate a century-old nativism that could stick around beyond this election. Given that the United States is undergoing a demographic diversity explosion, our workforce — our very future — is tied to people Trump is rallying support against.","1636","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/stop-laughing-at-donald-trump/2015/07/17/f334f9b6-2bdd-11e5-a250-42bd812efc09_story.html"
"Trump’s message is a call to 1950s American greatness and a simmering, mad-as-hell populism that blames Chinese imports, freeloading Saudis and Mexican immigrants (and Mexico) for the nation’s ills. It appeals to a vein of the U.S. electorate that will remain a significant voting bloc for several election cycles to come: older whites. Trump calls his supporters the “silent majority,” the same name Richard Nixon used to marshal support from a white, middle-class, middle-aged population that felt underappreciated and feared the dramatic social change wrought by activist, antiwar youths and the civil rights movement.","1637","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/stop-laughing-at-donald-trump/2015/07/17/f334f9b6-2bdd-11e5-a250-42bd812efc09_story.html"
"Public opinion polls and recent election results reflect similar views among older whites today. Pew Research Center data from 2012 showed that more than half of white baby boomers and seniors believed that increasing numbers of newcomers from other countries represented a threat to traditional American values. They were less likely than minorities and younger whites to hold a positive opinion of the growing numbers of Hispanics and Asians in the United States. These views translate into negative attitudes toward government programs they see as not benefitting their own children and grandchildren. A 2013 Pew survey showed that, given the choice between a larger government that offered more services and a smaller government that offered fewer, less than a quarter of white baby boomers favored larger government, compared with 7 in 10 minorities of the Gen X and millennial generations.","1638","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/stop-laughing-at-donald-trump/2015/07/17/f334f9b6-2bdd-11e5-a250-42bd812efc09_story.html"
"It is fitting that Arizona was the site of Trump’s biggest splash so far. Last weekend, he held court there with an enthusiastic throng of mostly older supporters after an introduction by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a renowed immigration hard-liner. Arizona leads the nation in an emerging generation gap that reflects both culture and race. Because of its continued draw of mostly white seniors from other parts of the country and its sharp gain in youthful immigrants and U.S.-born minorities over the past 20 years, the state’s over-65 population is far whiter than its child population (82 percent vs. 41 percent white). It has, in many ways, become ground zero for the politics of fear, famous for tamping down ethnic studies in public schools and passing strict immigration measures, such as the law that requires police to ascertain immigration status when they have “reasonable suspicion” that a person is in the country illegally. (When the bill was proposed, it was favored by 65 percent of whites but only 21 percent of Hispanics; 62 percent of those ages 55 and over but only 45 percent of those under age 35.)","1639","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/stop-laughing-at-donald-trump/2015/07/17/f334f9b6-2bdd-11e5-a250-42bd812efc09_story.html"
"As minorities grow as a share of the U.S. population — they are expected to represent more than half of Americans by 2044 — so will the potential for the politics of fear. Most of the states that have sued the president over his recent executive order offering protections to some undocumented immigrants are those with relatively small but climbing immigrant populations, such as Nebraska and West Virginia.","1640","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/stop-laughing-at-donald-trump/2015/07/17/f334f9b6-2bdd-11e5-a250-42bd812efc09_story.html"
"Democrats cannot make the politics of fear go away simply by courting the young-adult and minority voting blocs. While it is true that the supersize turnout and support of those groups helped elect President Obama twice, the white portion of the electorate, which votes strongly Republican, underperformed in support of John McCain in 2008, and white turnout was down in 2012. Rhetoric playing to the fears of older Americans could change that pattern and draw more white voters to the polls in 2016.","1641","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/stop-laughing-at-donald-trump/2015/07/17/f334f9b6-2bdd-11e5-a250-42bd812efc09_story.html"
"While racial minorities now account for 95 percent of U.S. population growth and represent 38 percent of the population, as reported by the Census Bureau last month, there is a sharp lag in diversity between the overall population and the portion that turns out on Election Day. A disproportionate number of Hispanics and Asians are either too young to vote, are not citizens or are not registered, qualities that will not change for several more election cycles. Even in 2012, with strong minority turnout, whites made up 74 percent of all voters. And within the white voting bloc, it is the older electorate — those most greatly fearing change — that will be gaining as baby boomers continue to age. By my calculation, the number of (mostly white) eligible voters over age 45 will be 26 percent larger in 2024 than those under age 45. This disparity will be further widened by the higher turnout of older white voters, who may not determine future elections but will continue to have a strong voice.","1642","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/stop-laughing-at-donald-trump/2015/07/17/f334f9b6-2bdd-11e5-a250-42bd812efc09_story.html"
"Republicans especially need to stop laughing. Their upcoming debates should challenge, not ignore, the unfocused fears of immigration and national diversity raised by Trump and like-minded candidates, and instead present a more nuanced and realistic view of the future, in which the national economy will depend on investment in today’s children and racial minorities. While they are not yet the force on Election Day that they will be in the foreseeable future, racial minorities will represent all of the growth in our labor force for the next 20 years, and their success will translate into economic prosperity and future contributions to Social Security and Medicare. Trump happily appeals to older, more conservative white baby boomers and seniors, but he could do them a favor by showing them the role that our diverse younger generations — many with immigrant roots — will play in our future. Vilifying them cannot be a lasting political strategy for tomorrow. And it cannot be a working national philosophy today.","1643","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/stop-laughing-at-donald-trump/2015/07/17/f334f9b6-2bdd-11e5-a250-42bd812efc09_story.html"

"In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, ""Donald, you don't have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion""? I said, ""I don't need it. I don't want it. And I've been there.

"But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.

"This posed a conundrum for The Fact Checker.

"But Trump’s statement — which he repeatedly has defended — underscores public perceptions that can drive immigration policies. For example, the 2010 murder of a rancher by a suspected smuggler in an Arizona border city fueled public and political pressure on then-Gov.

"Data on immigrants and crime are incomplete, but a range of studies show there is no evidence immigrants commit more crimes than native-born Americans. In fact, first-generation immigrants are predisposed to lower crime rates than native-born Americans.

"Immigration and crime levels have had inverse trajectories since the 1990s: immigration has increased, while crime has decreased.

"In his July 6 statement, Trump clarified that he was referring to cases where undocumented immigrants commit violent crimes or smuggle drugs.

"Trump’s campaign pointed to data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which tracks citizenship of offenders in federal prisons by primary offense, which is the offense with the longest maximum sentence when a person is convicted of multiple offenses. Of 78,022 primary offense cases in fiscal year 2013, 38.6 percent were illegal immigrant offenders. The majority of their cases (76 percent) were immigration related. Of total primary offenses, 17.6 percent of drug trafficking offenses and 3.8 percent of sex abuse were illegal immigrants.

"The Department of Homeland Security in recent years has targeted immigration enforcement to those who committed serious crimes through efforts like Secure Communities, rolled out per county from 2008 through 2012.

"The theory is that immigrants generally have a stronger incentive than native-born Americans to stay out of legal trouble — especially undocumented immigrants, who risk deportation.

"“Immigrants in general — unauthorized immigrants in particular — are a self-selected group who generally come to the U.S. to work. And once they’re here, most of them want to keep their nose down and do their business, and they’re sensitive to the fact that they’re vulnerable,” said Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank.","1939","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/"
"Interestingly, crime rates increase as generations of immigrants assimilate into America.

"It’s difficult to connect any crime with illegal immigration, by its nature. Drug smuggling and violent crimes do exist, but the cases are not indicative of larger trends in the immigrant population. What we do know about crime rates among non-citizens and inmates with unknown or unauthorized immigrant statuses show Trump’s assertions about a crime wave are not accurate.","1941","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/"
"Trump’s repeated statements about immigrants and crime underscore a common public perception that crime is correlated with immigration, especially illegal immigration.

"That's why in 2012, when the presidential debate commission declined to plan a candidate event on Univision or put a non-white moderator at the helm of an event on another network, Univision demanded and got extended sit-downs with GOP nominee Mitt Romney and President Obama.

"What's more, Latino consumers -- the vast majority of of those watching Univision -- were expected to control about $1.5 trillion in consumer buying power this year.

"Latinos -- and particularly Latinas -- represent an absolutely key part of the market for beauty products, goods that other consumers are more likely to view as optional, according to a February Nielsen consumer analysis.

The billionaire real-estate mogul took off his jacket, clicked the oversized satellite television in his plush, cream-colored cabin over to Fox News and closely watched the channel’s coverage.","July 12","2073","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/12/listening-to-donald-trump-swear-and-talk-politics-on-his-private-plane/"

"DONALD TRUMP: Well, for me, conservatism as it pertains to our country is fiscal. We have to be strong and secure and get rid of our debt. The military has to be powerful and not necessarily used but very powerful. I am on the sort of a little bit social side of conservative when it comes-- I want people to be taken care of from a health-care standpoint. But to do that, we have to be strong. I want to save Social Security without cuts. I want a strong country.

"CHUCK TODD: Some of the criticism on you from conservatives is you're not a real conservative.

"DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think they have a point from years ago. But they also have that same point with Ronald Reagan, who was a Democrat absolutely with a liberal bent. And Ronald Reagan became, you know, not only a Republican but a pretty conservative Repub -- not the most, but a pretty conservative Republican. And he's somebody that I actually knew and liked. And he liked me. And I worked with him and helped him. But I think that when you get right down to it, people do evolve on different issues. And, you know, I'm pro-life. And I was begrudgingly the other way. But I have to say when those questions were asked, and that was many, many years ago, I wasn't a politician. And it was, like, a question that was never asked to me. As a real estate developer and as what turned out to be a world-class businessman based on what I've done, you don't ask questions about, ""Gee, are you pro-choice? Are you pro-life?"" It's just something that is not really discussed. As a politician, they discuss it all the time. I've always hated the concept of abortion. Always hated it. And through various things and seeing various things, I've totally evolved on that issue.

"FLINT HILL, Va. — There is a deep economic anxiety driving Republican voters toward the blunt-spoken presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump. It is more than just anger at the political class or rebellion against political correctness. It reflects decades of lost jobs and falling wages for a swath of blue-collar Americans, who saw their opportunities diminish and developed a sense that someone has stolen something from them.","August 5","2782","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/05/why-donald-trump-is-winning/"

"“The Hispanics have taken over the construction industry,” Buchanan, a general contractor, said on a recent afternoon at a gathering of conservative activists near the Shenandoah Valley. “All my drywall guys are Hispanic.

It’s a perspective shared by many of Trump’s supporters, who, polls show, are drawn from a group that has taken an economic beating throughout the 21st century. Those supporters appear to be responding to Trump’s rhetoric against Mexicans, the Chinese and especially establishment Republicans, whom they blame for not doing enough to turn their fortunes around.","2786","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/05/why-donald-trump-is-winning/"

"It perhaps seems hard to believe. But after years of questions about his net worth, Donald Trump appears to be ready to share a hard number, as the Post reported Monday: 9 billion. Donald Trump on Tuesday will outline $9 billion in assets, including valuations on his real estate. There you go.","June 16","2846","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/16/the-wiggle-room-around-donald-trumps-9-billion-revelation/"
"Now, if this is not your first time hearing the name ""Donald Trump,"" you probably are aware that he is a master of sleight of hand. Once, New York was famous for the three-card monte hustlers deceiving rubes in side streets near Times Square. Now, Trump is as good as we've got.","2847","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/16/the-wiggle-room-around-donald-trumps-9-billion-revelation/"
"We reached out to a coterie of experts on personal wealth to explain the ways in which Trump's $9 billion might mean something very different than ""Donald Trump is worth $9 billion.""","2848","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/16/the-wiggle-room-around-donald-trumps-9-billion-revelation/"
"Kieran Osborne is portfolio manager at Mission Wealth Management in California, and he pointed out the first asterisk that should be applied to that number. Forbes pegged Trump's net worth at $4.1 billion. (That's an estimate, which they explain here.) Since net worth is generally the difference between assets and liabilities, if Forbes and Trump's numbers are accurate, Trump holds somewhere near $5 billion in debt. ($9 billion in assets minus $5 billion in liabilities is $4 billion in net worth.)","2849","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/16/the-wiggle-room-around-donald-trumps-9-billion-revelation/"
"Not that net worth tells the whole story. As Steve Stanganelli of Clearview Wealth Advisors explained, net worth itself can be deceiving. ""It would be like your grandmother who has no money in the bank to pay her bills but owns a McMansion that has no mortgage on it,"" he said over e-mail. ""On paper, her net worth is high. But the reality is that grandma still will have trouble paying for groceries since she can’t pay her bills with her net worth.""","2850","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/16/the-wiggle-room-around-donald-trumps-9-billion-revelation/"
"Her house is illiquid, as they say. And that holds for a lot of Trump's net worth, too, given that it's tied up in hotels, housing and office buildings. ""A lot of the stuff is illiquid,"" Osborne said, so ""the value is based on an estimate of what it would sell at on the market."" When it comes to determining those assets, ""obviously, there are going to be some differences.""","2851","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/16/the-wiggle-room-around-donald-trumps-9-billion-revelation/"
"That's the second asterisk. Donald Trump apparently owns 725 Fifth Ave. The value of that building (home to the Gucci store that Trump likes to brag is worth more than Mitt Romney) is somewhat subjective. ""To get that evaluation, they'll look at comps"" -- comparable buildings that have sold -- ""look at the surrounding areas, at property that's traded in the last 12 to 18 months in the same vicinity, and also look at how prices have tracked -- if they've increased or decreased,"" Osborne explained.","2852","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/16/the-wiggle-room-around-donald-trumps-9-billion-revelation/"
"That raises the question of who's doing the valuation. The Post reported that it was Trump's longtime advisers who were putting the figures together. If Trump's goal is to demonstrate his vast wealth, he has an incentive to have them err on the side of more value in his properties. Osborne notes that the numbers will be released publicly and, therefore, be subject to scrutiny, providing a disincentive to inflate too much. As Milad Taghehchian of Pioneer Wealth put it in an e-mail, ""Any financial analyst or accountant will tell you it is easy to manipulate numbers. The roll of analysts is to dig through accounting to determine the real numbers.""","2853","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/16/the-wiggle-room-around-donald-trumps-9-billion-revelation/"

"BIRDSELL: Trump betrays very little sense of a thought process behind what he does and says. I don’t mean that in the sense that he’s not a smart man.

"KIMEL: I personally think that leaving politics aside and approaching Trump from a purely oratorical standpoint, he's a magnetic television personality and a hugely entertaining speaker who is much more fun to watch than the other candidates.

"KIMEL: [Trump's] main drawback as a political orator -- beyond the obvious fact that he often puts his foot in his mouth -- is that while he's great at agitating others and criticizing policies, he's not the most inspiring speaker.

"Saying things in politics that more standard-issue politicians won't say -- whether it's about raising the retirement age, raising taxes, making changes to our entitlement programs, or, yes, solving our immigration problems is of genuine value.

Yet he was a surprisingly ideal brand representative: He was a public figure who had never been seen in shirt sleeves and boasted high name recognition in the mainstream, says Teri Agins, author of “Hijacking the Runway: How Celebrities Are Stealing the Spotlight From Fashion Designers.” Initially, Trump, who wore Brioni suits, saw his brand as on par with Giorgio Armani, Agins says.","3125","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/06/30/700000-protesters-beseech-macys-to-get-rid-of-donald-j-trump-clothing-and-merchandise/"

"We are -- all of us -- living in the summer of Trump. Donald Trump's fireball presidential candidacy went supernova over the weekend when he cast Arizona Sen.

"Trump has spent the last 48 hours insisting he didn't say what he said (and didn't mean what he meant) about McCain. The goal, of course, is to muddy the water enough that his gaffe doesn't look so bad or, more importantly, hurt him as badly as it should among Republicans.","3166","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/20/6-indisputable-truths-about-donald-trump/"
"Amid all of Trump's bluster, it's worth remembering some truths about him and this race.","3167","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/20/6-indisputable-truths-about-donald-trump/"
"1. Trump absolutely said that he didn't think McCain was a war hero. Did Trump use the words ""war hero"" to describe McCain on Saturday in Iowa? Sure -- as former CBS News reporter Sharyll Atkisson noted in a report that Trump is touting as evidence he is being misinterpreted. But, context matters. Twice, Trump said of McCain ""He's a war hero because he got captured."" A third time, Trump said: “I believe, perhaps, he’s a war hero."" I mean, come on. That's like me saying ""I love mayonnaise....not."" I TECHNICALLY SAID I LOVE MAYONAISSE!","3168","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/20/6-indisputable-truths-about-donald-trump/"
"2. Trump was trying for a laugh. If you watch the clip of his Iowa interview with Frank Luntz, it's quite clear that Trump offers his thoughts on McCain's war service as a sort of aside aimed at playing to a crowd who he suspects isn't in love with the Arizona Senator. (McCain is regarded by many conservative activists as insufficiently loyal to core party principles and is facing a challenge from his ideological right in his 2016 reelection race.) Trying to paint his comments -- as Trump has done -- as a broader critique of what McCain has (or hasn't) done for veterans is simply disingenuous. That's not what he was doing. Watch it yourself.","3169","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/20/6-indisputable-truths-about-donald-trump/"
"3. Trump is not a serious candidate for president. Ever since he started flirting with a run for the White House, the Trump people have insisted that he should be taken seriously -- particularly after his recent rise in polls. “Nobody’s asking Jeb Bush if he’s serious about running,” Trump campaign manager Cory Lewandowski told the New York Times last week. “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know which metric you want to measure it by.” The metric is -- or should be -- does this person take the process of running to be one of the most powerful people in the world seriously? Does Trump think before he speaks? Does he understand that words can have consequences well beyond the room in which he is speaking? The answer to those questions appears to be a resounding ""no.""","3170","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/20/6-indisputable-truths-about-donald-trump/"
"4. That's not the media's fault. Reeling from the bad publicity, Trump has taken to blaming the media for purposely misinterpreting his comments about McCain. His interview on the ""Today"" show Monday morning was an epic attempt to blame the press for his problems.","3171","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/20/6-indisputable-truths-about-donald-trump/"
"But, here's the thing: The media didn't make Trump say what he said about McCain. (If you have any doubt what Trump meant to say about McCain, please refer to point #1 above.) Scapegoating the media for ""misunderstanding"" something you said is the easiest way to get out from under saying something dumb. But, that doesn't make it true.","3172","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/20/6-indisputable-truths-about-donald-trump/"
"5. The Republican party needs to get away from Trump -- immediately. Republican establishment types have largely adopted a ""hey, that's just Donald being Donald"" approach to Trump to date. Yes, some condemned him for his comments about Mexicans during his announcement speech but it was clear that they viewed him as a sort of sideshow with which they didn't want to engage. That strategy is no longer operative for Republicans. Trump has reached heights -- in terms of public attention -- that could have a real impact on the Republican brand heading into the 2016 election. And, as his comments about McCain show (or, maybe more accurately, prove) Trump will say almost anything. You can't have someone like that tied closely to your party. That would be like allowing Clint Eastwood to speak unscripted to an empty chair on the final night of your nominating convention. Oh wait.","3173","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/20/6-indisputable-truths-about-donald-trump/"

"I've written before that Trump on the debate stage is a nightmare scenario for Republicans -- and that's more true now than ever. How do the candidates on stage avoid letting the entire storyline in (and after) the debate be about Trump? Even if The Donald doesn't go on the attack (doubtful) he has dominated coverage of the race for more than a month now so the moderators will be hard-pressed not to focus on some (ok, all) of the controversial things that he has said. How the heck does, say, Chris Christie or Rand Paul or Mike Huckabee deal with that reality? Attack Trump to get yourself in the story? Ignore him and hope he goes away?

"The billionaire later allowed Ramos back into the press conference, where the two engaged in several lengthy exchanges that dominated the remainder of the event.

"The lasting image will be that of Ramos -- who serves as Univision's lead anchor and is effectively one of the (if not the) most powerful newsmen on Spanish-language TV -- being hustled out of the room after trying to ask Trump a question.

"It was an evening filled with comments unlikely to endear Latino voters -- or other Americans aware that Trump’s comments about Ramos' emotions amount to an almost-direct reference to an oft-repeated Latino stereotype.

More than a million people attend each year to inspect hundreds of farm animals, listen to live music, ride the Ferris wheel, play games on the midway, have a couple beers or eat several days worth of calories in one meal. The food is a hallmark of the state fair, and this year there are nearly 200 booths competing to take fried delicacies -- especially fried food on a stick, with bonus points for the inclusion of bacon -- to new culinary heights. Menus include deep-fried nacho balls, bacon-wrapped smokies on a stick, deep-fried Twinkies, a double-bacon corn dog, pumpkin-spice funnel cake and something ominously called an ""Ultimate Bacon Brisket Bomb.""

In that laid-back atmosphere -- and with a stomach roiling from consuming who-knows-what -- it's easy to get too casual, too flippant, too funny, too trusting of reporters with cameras. With time have come these lessons: Don't wear a suit. Don't order the corn dog -- and if you do, don't jam it straight into your mouth. Don't cut the line to see the butter cow. Don't get grease stains all over your shirt. And don't say things like: ""Corporations are people.""","3341","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/15/latest-iowa-state-fair-attraction-trump-clinton-sanders-and-a-helicopter/"
"For Clinton, the fair was also a test of her retail-politics skills, another chance to push back at the image critics and rivals have painted of an impersonal and aloof politician who is unable to connect with voters. Her campaign has largely focused on placing her in settings with small groups of voters, although she did attend a Fourth of July parade in New Hampshire last month -- only to have her appearance overshadowed by hecklers and outrage over her staffers using a rope to keep reporters away from the candidate.","3342","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/15/latest-iowa-state-fair-attraction-trump-clinton-sanders-and-a-helicopter/"
"Several other candidates have already made their requisite pilgrimage to the state fair this year. Bush strayed from his strict Paleo diet on Friday, eating a pork chop and deep-fried Snickers bar (both on a stick, of course) and downing a beer well before lunchtime. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R) and his wife sampled some pork on Thursday morning. That afternoon, former Democratic senator from Virginia Jim Webb schmoozed with a George Washington doppelganger and former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley (D) posed for selfies in front of the butter cow.","3343","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/15/latest-iowa-state-fair-attraction-trump-clinton-sanders-and-a-helicopter/"

"Trump and Clinton had already opted out of appearing at the soapbox, a beloved state fair tradition: an opportunity for presidential hopefuls to share their vision for the future of the nation with fair-goers -- and get mercilessly heckled. The risk is high.

"As CBS' John Dickerson pointed out on Twitter, Trump's comment allows establishment Republicans who disagreed with Trump's much more vituperative comments about Mexican immigrants to at last lay into him or write him off. Several of Trump's primary opponents were loathe to respond to his immigration comments with much ferocity. But defending illegal immigrants requires a higher political investment than defending former prisoners of war.

"Anyway, Donald Trump is not a straight shooter. Donald Trump is a loudmouth who says whatever comes into his head. Almost always what comes into his head is something that lies on one of the poles of the ""very good-very bad"" spectrum.

A Republican needs just six syllables to ace that question: An-to-nin Sca-li-a. It's vanishingly rare to hear a candidate asked who, specifically, he would nominate; saying so would open some relatively unexamined judge up to media vetting.

And two men who would later join the GOP race, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) called for investigations. Bush also called on city and state officials to protect law-abiding citizens. And, Paul described the rioting as a result of the “breakdown of the family structure, the lack of fathers, the lack of sort of a moral code.”","3649","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/23/donald-trumps-intriguing-comments-about-sandra-bland-yes-really/"
"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders described the riot in Baltimore and conditions in Ferguson as situations made possible by mass unemployment and poverty. Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley's comments about his home city of Baltimore incorporated both Clinton and Sanders's ideas calling for an investigation into Gray's death and broader investment in cities. But critics also said that O'Malley's support for zero-tolerance policing in American cities, including during his tenure as Baltimore's mayor, fed tensions between police and the residents of some of Baltimore's poorest and overwhelmingly black neighborhoods.","3650","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/23/donald-trumps-intriguing-comments-about-sandra-bland-yes-really/"

"Trump's comments on CNN Wednesday did, however, echo many of the concerns that Black Lives Matter activists have expressed about Bland's arrest.

"In front of a crowd of several thousand people at the Nugget Casino here, Trump took a handful of questions from the audience, but none from reporters as he once regularly did.

"Absent from Trump’s speech was the usual blizzard of barbs about his opponents, such as questioning Carson’s religion, mocking Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for profusely sweating or accusing former Florida governor Jeb Bush of being “low energy.” Trump instead praised Rubio and Sen.

"Behind the scenes, Trump’s campaign is working to sustain his grass-roots support and harness the passion of his fans.

"The effort is well organized in Iowa, where campaign staffers have been coaching crowds at rallies on how to participate in the Feb. 1 caucuses and recruiting caucus captains.

"He also continued his assault on one of his favorite targets: the media.

"Listening in the audience was Christine Knight of Minden, Nev., who has narrowed her choices down to two candidates: Trump or Carson. She likes that Trump “says things like the way they are,” even if he can be a bit over the top in doing so, and that he addresses major issues that other politicians seem to be afraid to touch.

"In an hour-long interview with The Washington Post at his 26th-floor office in Trump Tower, the Republican front-runner ruminated on the many obstacles ahead.

"Trump laid out for the first time in detail the elements of what will be the second chapter of his 2016 bid, signaling an evolution toward a somewhat more traditional campaign.

"Trump, who is mostly self-funding his campaign, said he had originally budgeted up to $20 million through mid-September for television advertising.

"Central to the fall strategy is the release later this month of a book that will serve as a campaign manifesto.

"Trump said he does not believe the next stage of the campaign will require him to change his flamboyant, confrontational style, which has captivated the attention of voters whether they support him or not.

"Of the major candidates, Trump spent the least.

"This was Trump's second rally in less than a week in Iowa. But he returned to a far different landscape than the one he'd left days earlier. Since he was last here, Trump has seen his solid lead in the state evaporate as four new polls reported Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, surging to claim the top spot. Trump was in standard campaign mode as he addressed a crowd of nearly 2,400 and took a few questions — but his usual complaints about illegal immigration, corporate inversion and jobs moving overseas were punctuated with new self-deprecating comments, humanizing details and a plea to voters here for the chance to be their president.","3789","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/27/donald-trump-to-iowa-will-you-get-your-numbers-up-please/"

"Trump told the crowd he's ""a great Christian"" and described his favorite Bible, one inscribed by his mother. Each audience member was given a card showing two black-and-white photos, including one taken at Trump's 1959 confirmation.

He has so much energy that it makes some people ""toss and turn."" He likes winning. He has a sober poker face and is unpredictably strategic.

"It was Del Casale’s fourth Trump event in three states, and for the first time she was going to work as a volunteer for a political campaign.

"Del Casale is a prime example of the superfans who flock to Trump. They drive hours to campaign events and wait in Black Friday-like lines to get a spot close to the front.

"At the rally in Anderson, cars in the parking lot were more likely to have a bumper sticker plugging a university, sports team or honors student than a political campaign.

"Until this year, Del Casale had never really cared about politics. She grew up in a blue-collar family in Brooklyn and was the first in her family to attend college. Early on, she voted for Democrats, including Bill Clinton. But about a decade ago, she became disenchanted with both parties.

"These are the sorts of issues that Del Casale is confident Trump will address. She didn’t know much about him before this summer, having never regularly watched his reality TV show, “The Apprentice.” But she likes that he owns so many companies and has become so wealthy, which she says are signs of his intelligence, courage and leadership.

"Maybe it started with the blowback over Trump's failure to call out a guy who called President Obama a Muslim during an event in New Hampshire. That happened on Thursday. On Friday, Trump skipped a scheduled event, citing a ""significant business transaction.""

"You can see the downturn in the Real Clear Politics polling average. Trump's support dipped a bit, thanks to that CNN poll — but so did his lead. At the end of August, he was up by almost 15 points.

"Trump also repeatedly pushed another poll by John Zogby that came out on Monday. By Monday night, though, he had a new target: Fox News.

"That is an unusual level of fury, even by Trump standards. What's changed? First and foremost, that CNN poll reversed the idea that Trump continues to build on his lead. Second, he had someone to blame for that change: the Club For Growth. Trump hasn't faced much direct criticism or many real roadblocks over the course of the campaign. Now he does. What's more, it seems that the public fascination with his campaign is also fading, potentially making it harder for Trump to rely on free media to prop up his presidential bid.","3846","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/22/donald-trump-sure-is-getting-cranky-now-that-the-polls-dont-look-so-great/"
"Maybe this is a hiccup. I am not saying that Trump is over, because I know better than that by now.

"Inside Trump campaign headquarters, that might sound like a reasonable response. This is, after all, the campaign that began with a speech in which Trump declared undocumented people coming across the U.S.-Mexico border to be rapists and criminals. It is the campaign that surged rather than faltered after Trump disparaged Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and prisoners of war everywhere. This is a campaign in which the candidate joined another in declaring that Asians are the source of America's alleged ""anchor baby"" problem.

What we don't see is what happened in the meantime.","3903","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/27/donald-trump-is-free-to-cherry-pick-his-polls-but-his-decline-is-clear/"

"According to the glimpses of the race we've gotten, Trump was at 19 in July and then surged ahead. He led big. The Washington Post-ABC News poll that was completed Sept. 10 had Trump at 33 points! But recently he's faded back into the pack. Now he's at 21 percent, when NBC took another photo. Doing better than he was in their last photo — but not overall.","3908","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/27/donald-trump-is-free-to-cherry-pick-his-polls-but-his-decline-is-clear/"
"To beat a ... well, to exhaust the analogy, all of these photos are somewhat blurry. That is, the margins of error mean that there are a lot of ways in which candidates might not be exactly where a poll suggests. But again, that's why it's useful to consider the grand sweep of the information at hand. And with all of that information, Trump being up two points since a poll in July is not something that's actually good news for his campaign.","3909","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/27/donald-trump-is-free-to-cherry-pick-his-polls-but-his-decline-is-clear/"

"Considering that Trump hardly shrinks from the name (opening sentence of his 1997 book “Trump: The Art of the Comeback”: “It’s usually fun being The Donald”), you might be surprised that its origins lie in what he’d probably consider enemy territory — a fluke moment of harmonic convergence between the long-estranged wife whose fame once matched his and the legendary, long-defunct magazine that built its reputation by ruthlessly mocking him.","3918","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/09/01/why-does-everyone-call-donald-trump-the-donald-its-an-interesting-story/"

As a shoulder-padded bouffant blonde with a rich Czech accent, the future GOP front-runner’s then-wife cut nearly as flamboyant a profile as her husband in 1980s Manhattan. The article, by writer Jonathan Van Meter, gleefully punctured many of the boasting claims Trump made about his wife — that she was an Olympic skier (sadly untrue) and former top model of Canada (what does that even mean?) — and painted her as an inept CEO of his hotels and casinos.","3919","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/09/01/why-does-everyone-call-donald-trump-the-donald-its-an-interesting-story/"

Some things come easily, some things don’t. And for whatever reason, probably because I was going at my usual turbo speed, I started putting ‘The’ in front of most people’s names.

"Van Meter was a 24-year-old writer who had just moved to New York when he pitched Spy the story about Mrs. Trump, drawing on his contacts from his old job in Atlantic City. “In the tiny hot-house of Atlantic City in the 1980s, Ivana was just kind of accessible” to journalists, he recalled. “It was a small town with big-city things happening.”","3928","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/09/01/why-does-everyone-call-donald-trump-the-donald-its-an-interesting-story/"
"Founded in 1986, Spy was already famous for its scathing takes on New York’s VIP culture; Trump was a favorite target, and the magazine had earlier stuck him with another moniker that lingered for years, “short-fingered vulgarian.” Young as he was, Van Meter couldn’t anticipate just how big a hit the story would be upon release; nor did he quite recognize the comic gold of the sobriquet he was helping to launch in popular culture. He credits Spy’s editors with punching up his story for maximum humor. While he made only passing reference to “The Donald,” the page designers showcased it in droll, bold-type excerpts:","3929","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/09/01/why-does-everyone-call-donald-trump-the-donald-its-an-interesting-story/"
"“Wow, did they run that through the funny mill,” said Van Meter, later the founding editor of Vibe and now a contributing editor at Vogue. “So many of the editors who worked there were like Letterman writers: They knew what’s funny and what’s not.”","3930","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/09/01/why-does-everyone-call-donald-trump-the-donald-its-an-interesting-story/"
"Slowly, the phrase began to catch on with other journalists. Howard Kurtz, then a New York-based correspondent for The Washington Post, was an early adopter. Just weeks after the Spy cover story, Kurtz wrote about Trump’s vicious spat with rival hotelier Leona Helmsley and made several references to him as The Donald (“as he is called by his relentlessly glamorous wife Ivana”).","3931","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/09/01/why-does-everyone-call-donald-trump-the-donald-its-an-interesting-story/"

"“Trump was this flamboyant and over-the-top New York character, but not that widely known by the rest of the country — and he also was saddled with kind of an ordinary first name,” he said. “Making him The Donald kind of captured the singular nature of this media-savvy wheeler-and-dealer.

"It sure came in handy a year later, when the cataclysmic breakup of Donald and Ivana became one of 1990’s biggest celebrity stories. “I was writing so much about the divorce war that the nickname provided some much-needed variety, instead of saying ‘Trump. . . Trump. . . Trump'” said Kurtz. The phrase was picked up by other writers; by 1991, it even made it into the headlines.","3934","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/09/01/why-does-everyone-call-donald-trump-the-donald-its-an-interesting-story/"

"By the end of the decade, the phrase was so popular that the Trumps were fighting over it: In 1999, Ivana attempted to claim a trademark on “The Donald” for a line of lotions, after-shaves and other toiletries. She told the New York Observer at the time that she was filing on behalf of her son, Donald Jr. — but her move drew an angry condemnation from Donald, who filed several competing claims for the trademark. Both parties eventually abandoned their claims, and now it appears to belong to no one — except, of course, for the pundits and headline writers who have made it such a go-to part of their lexicon.","3936","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/09/01/why-does-everyone-call-donald-trump-the-donald-its-an-interesting-story/"

"For Van Meter, the humor lies in the syntax: “I don’t know what it is about the broken English. The misplacement of articles, it’s just funny, I don’t know why” — and, of course, the source: Ivana. She was a woman of the era, a caricature of “Dynasty”-style glamour and bootstrapping Big Apple ambition — a “Saturday Night Live” character waiting to happen — and, briefly, an unlikely media heroine showcased on the covers of Vanity Fair and Vogue in the years after her husband left her for a newer model, whom he would eventually leave as well.","3938","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/09/01/why-does-everyone-call-donald-trump-the-donald-its-an-interesting-story/"

"Trump's net worth has been an object of fascination for a long time, in part because much of his wealth is privately held and because he is enthusiastic about inflating the numbers.

"It's clear that Trump's father, Fred Trump, was positioned to make a loan of $1 million when his son wanted to branch out into New York City's most famous borough. (The Trump family had, at that point, mostly owned properties in Brooklyn and Queens.) When he died in 1999, Fred Trump was worth $250 million. But even when the younger Trump entered the Manhattan market in 1973, Fred had property in the city worth $150 million — generating annual rents of $50 million — according to a contemporaneous New York Times report.","3949","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/26/donald-trump-says-it-hasnt-been-easy-for-him-financially-but-he-omits-a-few-things/"

"Trump apparently did need a loan a bit later on. As the Times's Timothy O'Brien reported in a 2005 look at Trump's net worth, Trump asked for a $10 million loan against his inheritance to bolster his faltering properties. His siblings, who had a stake in the pool of money that would be inherited, grudgingly agreed. A year later, he asked for $20 million more. Trump denies this account.","3951","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/26/donald-trump-says-it-hasnt-been-easy-for-him-financially-but-he-omits-a-few-things/"
"Wherever the truth lies, it's clear that Trump got more than a $1 million loan (paid back with interest) from his father. He got control of his company and, ultimately, a large inheritance (although the where, when and how much on this is murky). And when he was in financial trouble in the early 1990s — being dropped from the Forbes 400 in 1990 — he had his family's wealth as a backstop. Update: So much so that, as our Glenn Kessler pointed out, Fred Trump bought $3.5 million in Trump Castle Casino Resort chips, which he never used to bet. (The purchase was determined to be illegal; the casino had to pay a fine.)","3952","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/26/donald-trump-says-it-hasnt-been-easy-for-him-financially-but-he-omits-a-few-things/"

"Now we’re at the point in this campaign when Trump’s defense for this — and those of his supporters — will be predictable. Trump was just RTing someone else’s lie, so it’s not really his fault.

"Buried in the lies that Trump has told over the past week, however, is a contradictory set of policy positions that he won’t back away from.

"The rest of the interview is depressing reading for any trade policy wonk. He proposes threatening a trade war with China to obtain unspecified concessions from Beijing, a policy that would likely be an economic and political disaster. In the interview, Trump demonstrates zero knowledge about the World Trade Organization specifically or international trade in general. All of this is, unfortunately, consistent with Trump’s Big Lie about the global economy.","3964","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/11/23/donald-trump-is-constantly-lying/"
"So to sum up: Trump has lied so many times about so many things during the past week that it’s difficult to keep track of all of them. But it doesn’t matter whether one focuses on Trump’s attitudes about crime or American Muslims or trade policy. He lies about all of these issues.

"You might have seen new national poll numbers from Fox News, released Wednesday night, that paint a fascinating portrait of the Republican race.

Real estate experts estimate that the penthouse would sell for at least $100 million if it were to go on the market today.","4040","https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/inside-the-fabulous-world-of-donald-trump-where-money-is-no-problem/2015/10/09/e51ae0fc-6161-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
"Like any billionaire, Trump has country retreats. The most luxurious is Mar-a-Lago, the oceanside estate in Palm Beach, Fla., that he bought in 1985 for $10 million. Built in 1927 by heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, the property, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, sits on 20 acres of what many consider the most valuable land in Florida. The mansion has 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms, 12 fireplaces, a spa, a swimming pool, a tennis court, a croquet court and a golf course just minutes away.","4041","https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/inside-the-fabulous-world-of-donald-trump-where-money-is-no-problem/2015/10/09/e51ae0fc-6161-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
"Trump used the mansion as a private home for a decade and hosted his famous friends there (Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley honeymooned at the estate.) In 1995, he turned it into an elite membership club but kept private quarters for his family. After adding a 20,000-square-foot ballroom, he celebrated his marriage to his third wife, Slovenian model Melania Knauss, at the estate in 2005, holding a reception with 500 guests who included Bill and Hillary Clinton, Rudolph W.

"Trump also has a place closer to New York City that his family uses as a weekend retreat. Seven Springs, in Bedford, N.Y., was built in 1919 by Eugene Meyer, the former Federal Reserve chairman and publisher of The Washington Post.

"And, once again proving the art of the deal, Trump snapped up the former Kluge estate in Charlottesville, Va., for a song. The 2,000-acre property was the pride and joy of billionaire John Kluge and his wife, Patricia, who poured millions into the 23,000-square-foot mansion as well as the winery and vineyard. But the enterprise was never a commercial success, and after Kluge’s death, his widow put it on the market for $100 million before the bank seized it. Trump first bought the vineyard and land surrounding the mansion in 2011 for $7.9 million, then got the 45-room mansion for $6.5 million.

"The presidential candidate who has consistently led the Republican field for four months, Donald Trump, has proposed: to forcibly expel 11 million people from the country, requiring a massive apparatus of enforcement, courts and concentration camps; to rewrite or reinterpret the 14th Amendment to end the Civil War-era Republican principle of birthright citizenship; to build a 2,000-mile wall on our southern border while forcing Mexico to pay the cost. He has characterized undocumented Mexican immigrants as rapists and murderers, and opposed the speaking of Spanish in the United States.","November 23","4091","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/setting-the-wrong-direction-for-the-republican-party/2015/11/23/81961934-9203-11e5-8aa0-5d0946560a97_story.html"
"Republican candidates have proposed: to favor the admission of Christian over Muslim refugees from the Middle East; to “send home” Syrian refugees, mainly women and children, into a war zone; to “strongly consider” the shutting down of suspicious mosques; to compile a database of Muslims and (perhaps) force them to carry special identification showing their religion. They have compared Syrian refugees to “rabid dogs,” ruled out the possibility of a Muslim president and warned that Muslim immigration to the United States is really “colonization.”","4092","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/setting-the-wrong-direction-for-the-republican-party/2015/11/23/81961934-9203-11e5-8aa0-5d0946560a97_story.html"
"There are, of course, Republican presidential hopefuls who have vigorously opposed each of these proposals, arguments and stereotypes. But Trump has, so far, set the terms of the primary debate and dragged other candidates in the direction of ethnic and religious exclusion. One effect has been the legitimization of even more extreme views — signaling that it is okay to give voice to sentiments and attitudes that, in previous times, people would have been too embarrassed to share in public. So in Tennessee, the chairman of the state legislature’s GOP caucus has called for the mobilization of the National Guard to round up Syrian refugees and put them in camps. Many Republicans are now on record saying that Islam is inherently violent and inconsistent with constitutional values (while often displaying an ironic and disturbing ignorance of those values).","4093","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/setting-the-wrong-direction-for-the-republican-party/2015/11/23/81961934-9203-11e5-8aa0-5d0946560a97_story.html"
"Vin Weber, a prominent GOP strategist, told me that many Republicans remain in “denial mode” about the possibility of Trump’s nomination. “How can you be the leader in national polls,” Weber says, “and in the early states, and maybe even in money, and be counted out?” In spite of saturation media coverage, Weber thinks the Trump effect on the GOP is “understated.” The attention of commentators has often been focused on the horse race aspect of the campaign or on the narrative of insider vs. outsider, rather than on what Weber calls Trump’s “transformational message.”","4094","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/setting-the-wrong-direction-for-the-republican-party/2015/11/23/81961934-9203-11e5-8aa0-5d0946560a97_story.html"
"That message comes in the context of a long period of political pessimism — more than 10 years in which polls have generally found more than 60 percent of Americans believing that their country is on the wrong track. There has been an angry decline in respect for most social institutions, including government. This has left some Americans more open to radical political answers — more prepared, in Weber’s words, “to roll the dice on the future of the country.”","4095","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/setting-the-wrong-direction-for-the-republican-party/2015/11/23/81961934-9203-11e5-8aa0-5d0946560a97_story.html"

"But in all this, it is easy to miss Trump’s policy ambition. He would spark trade wars with China and Mexico and scrap the world trading system — which Republicans have helped construct since World War II — replacing it with an older kind of mercantilism. He would make the seizure of Middle Eastern oil the centerpiece of his regional strategy — turning a spurious liberal charge into a foreign policy doctrine, and uniting the Arab world in rage and resentment.","4097","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/setting-the-wrong-direction-for-the-republican-party/2015/11/23/81961934-9203-11e5-8aa0-5d0946560a97_story.html"
"And Trump would make — has already half-made — the GOP into an anti-immigrant party. Much of Trump’s appeal is reactionary. He has tapped into a sense that an older America is being lost.

"The media has taken a lot of flak for not stating that he was. Feel free to peruse the Twitter maelstrom, if you wish, but the essence is simple. Fact-checkers, like our own Glenn Kessler, have found no evidence of anything even close to what Trump claimed. Why, then, can't we simply say he's lying?","4163","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/"
"One reason is embedded in the library/Library question above. If Donald Trump believes that he saw what he says he saw, is he lying?","4164","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/"
"Let's say that Trump, like Ben Carson, remembers seeing people celebrating the terror attacks in the Middle East but -- unlike Carson -- still thinks they were on the streets of Jersey City. In that case, Trump isn't telling a lie. He's incorrect, and it's not a great look for a presidential candidate, but he's not intentionally being deceptive. He's not lying, he's just wrong.","4165","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/"
"The problem that arises is that we can't know his intentionality. Unless Trump comes out and says something equivalent to, ""I was trying to deceive people,"" we can't say with certainty that this was his intention -- no matter how obvious it may seem and no matter how many times in the past we've wondered about his intentionality. One time, the boy who cried wolf actually saw wolves.","4166","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/"
"There's also the question of exaggeration. In the wake of his comments, defenders of Trump (who are legion) have pointed to other reports of celebrations at different times, in different places and at different scales. If Trump was referring to some other event on another day and at a different scale, was he lying? If he inflated his story to some degree to reinforce his apparent strategy of engendering fear among Republican voters, is that a lie or is it rhetoric?","4167","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/"
"This overlaps with the practical reason that it's tricky for the media to say that Trump is lying. It is imperative that the media maintain the trust of its audience, however much that trust continues to erode. Declaring that Trump is lying because his words don't match the facts is a judgment call, and a risky one.","4168","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/"
"Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Ben Carson's story about receiving a monetary award for honesty while at Yale couldn't be verified. This was on the heels of other stories raising questions about Carson's famous biography and reinforced the idea that Carson had repeatedly made up portions of his life story.","4169","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/"
"Carson blasted the media, cobbling together bits of evidence that weren't entirely convincing. It wasn't until BuzzFeed tracked down someone familiar with the story that the question was resolved: Carson appeared to misremember (or misrepresent) details of the story, but it was essentially accurate.","4170","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/"
"That doesn't make the Wall Street Journal wrong. The Journal looked for evidence and, given what they had to work with, couldn't find any. So they presented the known facts and let readers draw contrasts. They didn't call him a liar. Not that it did the Journal much good: Carson continued -- and continues -- to blast the media for its coverage of him.","4171","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/"
"It's important to remember that the media is in a different position than the one it occupied three decades ago. The emergence of the Internet and social media has made the traditional media one of many outlets for information. Candidates and their supporters can have nearly as much reach as, say, a newspaper. In that world, the word of a newspaper is often simply treated as one opinion in an ocean of them.","4172","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/"
"That the media tries to present as fair a picture as possible, to use nuance in its assessments has repeatedly been shown to be insufficient armor against attacks from those being criticized, their fans and their allies. The media now has to contend with a subsection of the media itself determined to undermine the public's confidence in what it's reading. That's new. But making judgment calls in reporting wouldn't make that position stronger. If the Journal had called Carson a liar, it wouldn't now be more respected.","4173","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/"
"Saying Trump is lying, then, offers only downside. It's valid to have an opinion on the issue, but it's important also to present the evidence at hand as completely and quickly as possible, allowing those interested in making up their own minds to do so. What the media can and should do is note that Trump has a habit of manufacturing questionable stories, allowing people to decide for themselves whether or not Trump is lying. But only one man on this Earth knows for certain if Donald Trump is lying when he tells that story, however obvious it might seem to others that he is.","4174","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/"
"For the media to call him a liar might please those who already dislike Trump, but it doesn't do the media much good. Lying is more complicated than simply stating an untrue fact.","4175","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/"

"This exchange demonstrates the folly of trying to fact-check Donald Trump. Even when confronted with contrary information — “police say it didn’t happen” — he insists that with his own eyes he saw “thousands and thousands” of cheering Arabs in New Jersey celebrating as the World Trade Center collapsed during the Sept. 11 attacks.","4189","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"

"Trump says that he saw this with his own eyes on television and that it was well covered. But an extensive examination of news clips from that period turns up nothing. There were some reports of celebrations overseas, in Muslim countries, but nothing that we can find involving the Arab populations of New Jersey except for unconfirmed reports. (Some conspiracy Web sites cite a column by controversial blogger and commentator Debbie Schlussel, who is highly critical of Muslims, that makes a reference to an MTV broadcast of protests and riots in Paterson, N.J.; this claim has never been authenticated.) As the Newark Star-Ledger put it in an article on Sept. 18, 2001, “rumors of rooftop celebrations of the attack by Muslims here proved unfounded.”","4192","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"Neither can we find any examples of Trump previously talking about this. Here, for example, is an article in the New York Post interviewing Trump just eight days after the attack; he makes no mention of having witnessed the alleged celebrations. And in a foreword for a book titled “Where Were You On 9/11?,” Trump makes no mention of this: “I was in my apartment in the Trump Tower [on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001]. I knew what was happening because I can see downtown to the Financial district.”","4193","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"

"Fulop, who is a possible Democratic candidate for governor in 2017, said in a statement that Trump was “shamefully politicizing an emotionally charged issue.” He added: “No one in Jersey City cheered on Sept. 11. We were actually among the first to provide responders to help in lower Manhattan.”","4195","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"George Pataki, the governor of New York at the time and another GOP presidential hopeful, also tweeted this response to Trump’s remarks on ABC:","4196","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is also seeking the GOP nomination, told reporters that he also did not recall seeing what Trump claimed. “I do not remember that, and so it’s not something that was part of my recollection,” he said. “I think if it had happened, I would remember it, but, you know, there could be things I forget, too.”","4197","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"Since Trump on ABC News suggested that celebrations might have happened elsewhere in New Jersey, we also contacted Jerry Speziale, the police commissioner of Paterson, which has the second-largest Muslim population in the United States — numbering nearly 30,000. He minced few words, even using a barnyard epithet, while giving his response.","4198","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"“That is totally false. That is patently false,” Speziale said. “That never happened. There were no flags burning, no one was dancing. That is [barnyard epithet].” He said the main concern after the attacks was that the U.S. Muslim population would face retaliation, and so law enforcement officials worked with the community to ensure that did not happen. “They’ve been very helpful and law-abiding.”","4199","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"

"Update: Some readers have tweeted to The Fact Checker a Washington Post article from Sept. 18, 2001, as evidence of Trump’s claim. The article, which appeared on page 6, described FBI probes in northern New Jersey after the attacks, saying in the 15th paragraph that “law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.”","4201","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"Of course, “a number of people” obviously does not equal “thousands” — and “allegedly” indicates there is no video footage or other proof that celebrations actually took place. Recall that Trump claimed he saw this on television — and that it was “well covered at the time.” This newspaper article appeared days later.","4202","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"The reporters who wrote the story do not recall whether the allegations were ever confirmed. “I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating,” said Serge Kovaleski, one of the reporters. “That was not the case, as best as I can remember.”","4203","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"Fredrick Kunkle, the other reporter, added: “I specifically visited the Jersey City building and neighborhood where the celebrations were purported to have happened. But I could never verify that report.”","4204","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"(The right-leaning Powerline blog made a big deal about this sentence–as did Trump later–but as the reporters’ comments make clear, there is no evidence the alleged celebration ever took place.)","4205","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"Irfan Khawaja, an assistant professor of philosophy at Felician College in New Jersey, extensively attempted to trace the rumors of celebrations by Muslims in New Jersey and after months of inquiry (in an article with Gary Fine) came up with only the possibility that “a few Arab-American adolescents briefly relieved their political frustration in front of a library in South Paterson, a way that might be defined as celebrating.”","4206","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"In an interview, Khawaja said that after extensive research, it was possible that maybe six to 12 teenagers had something akin to a celebration on the morning of 9/11 in Paterson, but they quickly dispersed. But even that is doubtful. “The evidence is very, very sparse that anything took place,” he said. “The bottom line is that Donald Trump is lying, if you look at what he said.”","4207","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"Khawaja elaborated on his findings in a blog post. In the comment section, he specifically addresses how Powerline used his writings to come up with the wrong conclusion: “Contrary to what Powerline would have its readers believe, I should not be construed as saying that celebrations were confirmed by the JCPD. They were not confirmed.”","4208","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"Further Update: We heard from many readers who are convinced they saw this on television but from their description they are referring to reports (linked above) of Palestinians celebrating on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Here is the video again:","4209","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"As you can see, this is not in New Jersey. No one disputes that there were some scenes of celebration overseas. A former aide to a New Jersey senator at the time wrote The Fact Checker to say most letters the office received concerning alleged celebrations by Muslims were traced to this particular clip.","4210","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"We also heard from some readers who claim to have heard this story from neighbors or friends or, in a handful of cases, said they personally saw some some people celebrating. (Matthew H. Rudd, an attorney, said he left the courthouse in Paterson midday three days after the attacks and saw “half a dozen cars full of young Arabic-looking men drove by blaring Arabic music and cheering loudly. I do not have any recordings or photos, but I can tell you that it was a very disturbing and unsettling sight.”) These accounts are of course only anecdotal, do not involve thousands of people and were not filmed. In the case of Rudd’s description, this did not take place on 9/11 but a few days later.","4211","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"We also heard from many other readers who were in New Jersey at the time and said nothing happened on the day of the attacks. One man who said he walked up and down through Jersey City on 9/11 wrote: “At no time did I see anyone celebrating. It did not happen. Not thousands — not hundreds — not dozens — not one. At no time did I meet anyone who claimed to have seen any celebrations. It’s also worth noting that I saw no TV-news vans who might have shot footage of celebrations. They did not show up until the next day.”","4212","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"Yet another update, Nov. 25: Jim Dwyer of The New York Times interviewed John J. Farmer Jr., at the time the New Jersey attorney general and the state’s chief law enforcement officer, and he emphatically said Trump was wrong. He said at the time he was worried about possible riots, especially because of a rumor that Muslims were dancing on the rooftops and in the streets of Jersey City and Paterson, but none of the tips turned out. “The word came back quickly from Jersey City, later from Paterson,” he said. “False report. Never happened.”","4213","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"
"But Walter Zalisko, a former police officer in Jersey City, contacted The Fact Checker to say Farmer was wrong. He says he heard on the radio dispatch at the time that officers had found Middle Easterners “clapping and laughing” on a number of rooftops, even in one case knocking down a cardboard version of the Twin Towers. But he does not think a police report was filed. “It was at most a hundred people doing this,” he said, saying Trump’s description of “thousands and thousands” was an exaggeration. As for Farmer’s account, Zalisko said: “John was holed up in his office and he didn’t know what was going on.”","4214","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"

"(The movie in question appears to be a November 2001 MTV News documentary titled “Fight for Your Rights: Aftermath of Terror.” It is not available in digital. IMBD says it “follows the lives of some young adults in Paterson, NJ in the months following the attacks of 9/11. Paterson NJ is a multicultural community, home to a large Muslim community, and also to friends and family of 9/11 victims.” A discussion guide for the film mentions a rumor allegedly spread by anti-crime Curtis Sliwa that people in Paterson were “having parties” in the streets.)","4217","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/"

"Donald Trump began to take off in GOP primary polls at around the time he really began cranking up the demagoguery about immigration with his suggestion that Mexican immigrants are drug dealers and “rapists.” It’s hard to know whether Trump’s rise was due to the content of his remarks or more to the media attention and notoriety that they produced, but polls did subsequently show that many GOP voters seemed to agree with him on the substance.","November 24","4226","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/24/why-donald-trumps-demagoguery-is-winning-over-gop-voters-in-one-chart/"
"More recently, after the Paris attacks, Trump again drew a massive wave of negative national press attention to his remarks about Syrian refugees and Muslims. That also may also have only helped him.","4227","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/24/why-donald-trumps-demagoguery-is-winning-over-gop-voters-in-one-chart/"
"Previously-unreleased data from the new Washington Post/ABC News poll suggest that there may be a link in his supporters’ minds between Trump’s demagoguing about immigration and his demagoguing about Syrian refugees and Muslims. Jim Tankersley and Scott Clement have a fascinating breakdown of the new data, which is illustrated in the chart below.","4228","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/24/why-donald-trumps-demagoguery-is-winning-over-gop-voters-in-one-chart/"
"Nearly half of Republican and GOP-leaning voters — 47 percent — both support the deportation of undocumented immigrants and oppose the acceptance of refugees from Syria or other conflicts in the Mideast. For shorthand purposes, let’s classify those GOP voters as Yes-Deportation-No-Refugees Republicans, or YeDeNoRe Republicans.","4229","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/24/why-donald-trumps-demagoguery-is-winning-over-gop-voters-in-one-chart/"

"Slicing the numbers another way, Tankersley and Clement note that these YeDeNoRe Republicans “account for almost three-quarters of Trump’s support.” What’s more, the data also show that those GOP voters who support deportation are overwhelmingly likely to oppose the entry of refugees. As Tankersley and Clement conclude, all this shows “how linked those issues are for Republican voters this year,” and that the two linked issues “differentiate Trump supporters from other Republicans.”","4232","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/24/why-donald-trumps-demagoguery-is-winning-over-gop-voters-in-one-chart/"
"How much will this matter once the voting starts? It’s obviously very hard to know for sure, since very few voters are paying attention; and (as noted above) a lot of Trump’s support could primarily reflect media attention; and we don’t know which Republican voters will turn out in these contests. But this might be a sobering bit of data for Republicans (the phrase “immigrant/refugee group” refers to YeDeNoRe Republicans):","4233","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/24/why-donald-trumps-demagoguery-is-winning-over-gop-voters-in-one-chart/"
"So YeDeNoRe Republicans are following the election as closely as other voters and they say they are as likely to vote. And the poll also finds that a majority of Republicans who support deportations think Trump is the most electable Republican in a general election. In other words, they don’t appear to see these positions as compromising Trump’s electability.","4234","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/24/why-donald-trumps-demagoguery-is-winning-over-gop-voters-in-one-chart/"

"Ted Cruz appears to be positioning himself as the guy who should inherit those voters. He’s attacked Rubio as soft on “amnesty,” an area where conservatives are still suspicious of Rubio. While Rubio is chasing Cruz to the right to minimize differences between them, Cruz may now be surging in Iowa. Cruz has also come out forcefully against admitting the Syrian refugees, initially suggesting that Muslim refugees in particular should be barred. While Rubio has also opposed the Syrian refugees’ entry, he appears to have softened his stance a bit, opening the door to accepting refugee orphans and widows.","4236","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/24/why-donald-trumps-demagoguery-is-winning-over-gop-voters-in-one-chart/"
"Rubio has also tiptoed around Trump’s call for closing mosques, perhaps in an effort to avoid offending Trump supporters, though he appears to have softened here, too, subsequently suggesting he might only want to increase our monitoring of all places where “people are being radicalized,” not just mosques.","4237","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/24/why-donald-trumps-demagoguery-is-winning-over-gop-voters-in-one-chart/"
"It’s true that Rubio has tried to get to Cruz’s right when it comes to terrorism, blasting the Texas Senator for supporting reforms to NSA surveillance. But on balance, Cruz would seem to have a fairer claim on the YeDeNoRe Republicans than Rubio does.","4238","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/24/why-donald-trumps-demagoguery-is-winning-over-gop-voters-in-one-chart/"
"Of course, it’s still early, and there’s still a lot that remains thoroughly unpredictable. We don’t know what issues will ultimately motivate these voters. We don’t know for certain that Trump will fade, though that still seems likely. However, right now, we do know that Trump seems to draw a great deal of his support from Republican voters who both favor deportations and, in the wake of the Paris attacks, oppose the entry of Syrian refugees — support that shows no immediate signs of waning even as his rhetoric veers into truly crazy and reckless territory. That alone underscores how foolish it was to imagine that the attacks were more likely to hurt Trump, by getting GOP voters to turn towards more “serious” candidates, than to make him stronger.","4239","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/24/why-donald-trumps-demagoguery-is-winning-over-gop-voters-in-one-chart/"

"""Another thing that I predicted is terrorism,"" Trump told a crowd of several thousand people. Trump said this prediction was made in one of his books, and his foresight was recently pointed out by a ""very political"" friend. ""Because I can feel it.

"During a speech that lasted more than 75 minutes, Trump hammered on his usual campaign-trail talking points, with a heavy emphasis on bringing more jobs back to the United States and fighting Islamic State terrorists. Trump told the crowd he predicted the threat of bin Laden in one of his books, published more than a year before the 9/11 attacks. Trump says if bin Laden was taken out at that point, the attacks on the World Trade Center would not have happened.","4243","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/24/donald-trump-touts-his-ability-to-predict-world-events-including-terrorism/"

"Trump said bin Laden ultimately would not have been killed in 2011 if the United States did not use waterboarding, the controversial interrogation technique that the Obama administration considers torture and no longer uses. An exhaustive 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report deemed that harsh interrogation measures like waterboarding do not work and did not produce breakthrough intelligence in the hunt for bin Laden, assertions that the CIA and former officers vehemently dispute. Trump has said he would resume waterboarding and approve even more aggressive techniques.","4245","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/24/donald-trump-touts-his-ability-to-predict-world-events-including-terrorism/"

"In the five months that the billionaire businessman has spent on the presidential campaign trail, his inflammatory missiles toward women have prompted charges of sexism, even misogyny. His obsession with physical appearance — such as speculating that Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton was wearing a wig — drew charges of bullying from the candidate vying to be the country’s first female president.

Confronted the next day by ABC’s George Stephanopoulos with the reality that there was no evidence this ever happened, Trump doubled down, “It was on television. I saw it. … There were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey, where you have large Arab populations. They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down. I know it might be not politically correct for you to talk about it, but there were people cheering.” Afterward, he retweeted a phony chart that exaggerated the odds that the killer of a white person would be black by a modest 65 percent. Not to be outdone, on Monday Ben Carson backed up Trump, saying he too “saw the film” of New Jerseyans cheering the falling towers.","4355","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/11/23/donald-trump-and-21st-century-mccarthyism/"

Joe McCarthy never revealed where he got that list; the number changed from 205 all the way down to seven, and he never provided any concrete evidence. But, as Trump knows, McCarthy’s lack of evidence was no hindrance to tapping into the fears of a portion of the U.S. electorate. In those days, communists were coming for you; now, Muslims and immigrants are, and in both cases, the U.S. government won’t stop them. The message remains: Be afraid.

"As you’ve probably heard by now, Donald Trump had quite a weekend. First he claimed on Saturday that “I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as [the World Trade Center] was coming down.” Confronted with the fact that this is completely false, Trump insisted on Sunday, “There were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey where you have large Arab populations…that tells you something.”","November 23","4438","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/23/why-the-media-cant-figure-out-how-to-handle-donald-trumps-race-baiting/"
"Then on Sunday he (or someone from his campaign) tweeted out a graphic with phony statistics purporting to show how murderous black people are (and illustrated with a picture of a young black man with a bandana over his face, pointing a gun sideways, gangster-style).","4439","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/23/why-the-media-cant-figure-out-how-to-handle-donald-trumps-race-baiting/"
"Both of these happenings are receiving plenty of attention in the media today. The problem is that the media doesn’t know how to handle this kind of blatant race-baiting from a leading politician.","4440","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/23/why-the-media-cant-figure-out-how-to-handle-donald-trumps-race-baiting/"
"And just to be clear, it is race-baiting, and nothing else. In neither case is there even the remotest connection to some kind of legitimate policy question. When Trump says falsely that thousands of people in Jersey City (which has a large Muslim population) were celebrating the destruction of the World Trade Center, he isn’t making an argument about Syrian refugees. He’s simply saying that you should hate and fear Muslim Americans. When he tries to convince people that most white murder victims are killed by black thugs (again, false), he isn’t arguing for some policy approach. He’s just trying to foment racism and convince racists that he’s their guy.","4441","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/23/why-the-media-cant-figure-out-how-to-handle-donald-trumps-race-baiting/"
"So how do the media deal with this? One thing they don’t do is call it by its name. The first approach is to report on it as just another campaign controversy (“Trump takes heat for tweet about black murder rates“). That kind of story sticks to the who-what-where-when approach: Trump tweeted this, he was criticized for it, here’s how it was inaccurate, here’s Trump’s response. Any value judgments that appear will be spoken by Trump’s critics (though not his primary opponents, who for the most part are dancing around any criticism of what Trump said).","4442","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/23/why-the-media-cant-figure-out-how-to-handle-donald-trumps-race-baiting/"
"The second approach the media takes is to address Trump’s comments through fact-checking, something we have gotten pretty good at. Interestingly enough, fact-checking as a formal genre of journalism can be traced to another campaign that prominently featured Republican race-baiting, the 1988 election. In the wake of that election, many news outlets felt they had been manipulated by George H.W. Bush’s campaign into not only focusing on distracting issues that had little or nothing to do with the presidency, but also into becoming a conduit for ugly attacks with little basis in fact. Over the following few years, many decided to institutionalize fact-checks, at first for television ads in particular, and later for all kinds of claims made in politics. Eventually sites like Politifact and FactCheck.org were created, and major news organizations like this one devoted staff solely to fact-checking.","4443","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/23/why-the-media-cant-figure-out-how-to-handle-donald-trumps-race-baiting/"
"In the process, journalists acquired both an understanding of how to separate the accurate from the inaccurate from the subjective, and a language to talk about different kinds of claims. While there’s plenty of slippage — you still see claims that have been proven false referred to as “controversial” or “questionable” — the existence of the fact-checking enterprise has allowed reporters to be clearer with their audiences about what is and isn’t true.","4444","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/23/why-the-media-cant-figure-out-how-to-handle-donald-trumps-race-baiting/"
"So if you want a fact-check of Trump’s claims, you’ll have no trouble finding it (here’s the Post’s). What you’ll have to look harder for is reporting that puts what Trump said in a context that goes much deeper than the campaign controversy of the week.","4445","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/23/why-the-media-cant-figure-out-how-to-handle-donald-trumps-race-baiting/"
"To be clear, I’m not arguing that there’s a simple template reporters should follow, one that will allow them to easily separate the merely “controversial” from the clearly racist (though wherever the line is, passing on phony statistics about murderous black people from neo-Nazis is definitely on the other side of it). But they wouldn’t violate any reasonable conception of objectivity by making the nature of Trump’s arguments clear.","4446","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/23/why-the-media-cant-figure-out-how-to-handle-donald-trumps-race-baiting/"
"When David Duke nearly won the governorship of Louisiana in 1991, it was reported in the national media as a story about racism, with a former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan garnering a majority of the white vote as he lost a runoff election. Few in the media hesitated to call Duke a racist, in large part because even at the time he was perceived as representing yesterday’s racism, antiquated for its explicitness (even if Duke did try to clean up his views for the campaign).","4447","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/23/why-the-media-cant-figure-out-how-to-handle-donald-trumps-race-baiting/"
"Trump represents one face of today’s racism (though not by any means the only face). It simultaneously insists that Muslims can be good Americans, and accuses them of hating America and says their places of worship ought to be kept under government surveillance. It says that some Mexican-Americans are good people, and says most of them are rapists and drug dealers. It says “I think I’ll win the African-American vote” and then tries to convince voters that black people are murdering white people everywhere. In every case, Trump proclaims that he’s no racist while tapping into longstanding racist stereotypes and narratives of the alleged threat posed by minorities to white people.","4448","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/23/why-the-media-cant-figure-out-how-to-handle-donald-trumps-race-baiting/"
"Since I can’t read minds, I don’t know whether Donald Trump is a racist deep in his heart. But he is without question making himself into the racist’s candidate for president. And that’s a subject the media needs to explore in more depth.","4449","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/23/why-the-media-cant-figure-out-how-to-handle-donald-trumps-race-baiting/"

"The fact that Trump felt the need to spend only $2 million to date will reinforce the idea, rampant among the frustrated Republican establishment, that the media is Trump's best friend and is largely responsible for his rise.

"As for Trump? “When it comes to cheating, he’s an 11 on a scale of one to 10,” Reilly said.","4473","https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/does-donald-trump-cheat-at-golf-a-washington-post-investigation/2015/09/02/f8a940b2-50c4-11e5-9812-92d5948a40f8_story.html"
"Reilly told The Washington Post about an afternoon when Trump wrote down scores he didn’t actually achieve on his scorecard, conceded putts to himself by raking the ball into the hole with his putter rather than striking it properly (“He rakes like my gardener!”), and even called a gimme — something a player might claim for a two-foot putt — on what should have been a chip shot.","4474","https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/does-donald-trump-cheat-at-golf-a-washington-post-investigation/2015/09/02/f8a940b2-50c4-11e5-9812-92d5948a40f8_story.html"
"“He took the world’s first gimme chip-in,” Reilly said. At one point, Trump, after taking a number of second shots, told Reilly to “make sure you write that I play my first ball. You don’t get a second ball in life.” In life, it may or may not be true that a person gets a second chance; and yet, as Reilly wrote, on holes 1, 13 and 17, Trump did indeed get a second ball.","4475","https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/does-donald-trump-cheat-at-golf-a-washington-post-investigation/2015/09/02/f8a940b2-50c4-11e5-9812-92d5948a40f8_story.html"
"Trump disputes Reilly’s entire story as well: “I always thought he was a terrible writer,” he said. “I absolutely killed him, and he wrote very inaccurately. I would say that he’s a very dishonest writer. . . . I never took a gimme chip shot. . . . I don’t do gimme chip shots. If I asked his approval, that’s not cheating, number one.

"But Reilly noted something else about playing with Trump that is echoed by others who have golfed with him: He had an amazing time.

"Jonathan Carr spent the 2007 and 2008 golf seasons caddying at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J.

"Obama showed his best face in Tuesday’s news conference with visiting French President François Hollande. Obama was cool and restrained, analytically clear, and appropriately apolitical in describing how the United States will work with France in combating the Islamic State. He avoided inflaming the delicate and potentially dangerous situation following the shoot-down of a Russian military jet by Turkey.","4492","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-undermines-our-fight-against-the-islamic-state/2015/11/24/d03c8eb6-92f2-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6_story.html"
"Perhaps most important, Obama embodied America’s best self by combating the panicky, anti-Muslim sentiment that’s loose in the country following the Paris attacks. In voicing the welcome to immigrants that’s chiseled on the Statue of Liberty, he reminded us where America’s real strength lies.","4493","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-undermines-our-fight-against-the-islamic-state/2015/11/24/d03c8eb6-92f2-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6_story.html"
"Obama has often misfired on Syria and the Islamic State. I wish he had been a more aggressive leader since this crisis began four years ago.

"Now look at Trump’s behavior over the past few days. He has displayed a level of irresponsibility that borders on recklessness. This is a time when the essence of leadership is clarity and restraint — when even politicians should put aside their usual braggadocio and self-aggrandizement for the good of the country.","4495","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-undermines-our-fight-against-the-islamic-state/2015/11/24/d03c8eb6-92f2-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6_story.html"
"Trump has done the opposite. He appears to be inflaming the situation deliberately, to advance his presidential campaign. It’s rare that we see this level of demagoguery in U.S. politics, but it’s frightening. His divisive comments play so directly into the polarizing strategies of our terrorist adversaries — who want to foment Western-Muslim hatred — that a case can be made that he has put the country at greater risk.","4496","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-undermines-our-fight-against-the-islamic-state/2015/11/24/d03c8eb6-92f2-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6_story.html"
"Trump tosses hand grenades of rumor, slander and intolerance. He makes inflammatory statements with no factual support, such as his assertion Nov. 14 that “our president wants to take in 250,000 [refugees] from Syria,” or his claim Saturday that “thousands and thousands of people were cheering” in Muslim neighborhoods in New Jersey when the twin towers fell.","4497","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-undermines-our-fight-against-the-islamic-state/2015/11/24/d03c8eb6-92f2-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6_story.html"

"Trump’s comments Monday on waterboarding were also damaging to this country. Remember, this is a technique that the United States (and most of the rest of the world) now regards as an illegal form of torture. “Would I approve waterboarding? You bet your ass I would. . . . And I would approve more than that. . . . Believe me, it works. And you know what? If it doesn’t work, they deserve it anyway, for what they’re doing.”","4499","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-undermines-our-fight-against-the-islamic-state/2015/11/24/d03c8eb6-92f2-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6_story.html"

"Are Trump’s comments really making us less safe? I fear that’s so: Professional counterterrorism experts say that the United States has had relatively few “lone wolf” attacks partly because Muslim Americans believe they are part of the national community. They have a stake in the United States and its security. The FBI and local law enforcement agencies work 24/7 to build this sense of trust and cooperation so that when Muslim communities see extremists in their midst, they will report them to authorities.","4501","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-undermines-our-fight-against-the-islamic-state/2015/11/24/d03c8eb6-92f2-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6_story.html"
"These essential threads of interdependence are what Trump is ripping apart. Try to read his words as a Muslim neighbor would, when Trump said Nov. 17, “We’re going to have to look at the mosques. We’re going to have to look very, very carefully.” Or when he responded to a question two days later about creating databases to track Muslims, “certainly” and “absolutely.” Trump’s defenders say he misspoke, or was responding to a question — but that’s precisely the point. He wasn’t being clear and careful, on a subject where clarity is essential in this moment of crisis.","4502","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-undermines-our-fight-against-the-islamic-state/2015/11/24/d03c8eb6-92f2-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6_story.html"
"Let’s state the problem in the simplest terms: If Muslim Americans come to believe that prominent leaders (such as the top GOP presidential candidate) view them as less worthy of rights and protections than others, then the job of the Islamic State’s recruiters will become easier. The work of intelligence officers, cops and soldiers who have been trying to stop our terrorist adversaries will become more difficult.","4503","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-undermines-our-fight-against-the-islamic-state/2015/11/24/d03c8eb6-92f2-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6_story.html"
"It’s hard to imagine that someone would put the country at greater risk for personal political benefit. But that’s exactly what Trump has been doing. It’s outrageous behavior, and responsible Republicans must insist that it stop.","4504","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-undermines-our-fight-against-the-islamic-state/2015/11/24/d03c8eb6-92f2-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6_story.html"

The escalation came after Trump released an aggressive video Monday that flashed mug shots of men charged with or convicted of murder as Bush’s comments that undocumented immigrants enter the United States as “an act of love” played in the background.","4685","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/its-on-jeb-bush-embraces-a-fight-with-donald-trump/2015/09/01/4094c69a-50c9-11e5-8c19-0b6825aa4a3a_story.html"

"Bush faces other perils as well. One is that his attacks will overshadow the positive elements of his message. They also could strengthen Trump by heaping even more attention on his campaign, which has thrived under the spotlight.

"Although Bush remains the GOP establishment favorite, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker could emerge as alternatives if Bush struggles.

"In case he gets blamed for saying something incongruent with the 1st Amendment, Trump added that closing mosques is ""something that many people — not me — it's something that many people are considering and that many people are going to do."" But still, the message from Trump here is clear: The world is a dangerous place, and the only way to stay safe is to elect a president who can protect — and to a large degree, insulate — America from it.","4720","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/16/donald-trump-closing-mosques-and-the-massive-political-power-of-fear/"
"By playing up many Americans' fears — about national security, about economic security, about the world in general — Trump is trying to convince Americans he's just the guy to do that. And while others are certainly paying attention to fears of refugees — some Republican governors are now closing their borders to them — Trump has always been willing to take things a step further.

"Going back to Sept. 11, 2001, mosques have become a symbol of fear among many on the right — a physical manifestation of the fact that there are people in the world who claim to use a religious ideology as justification to commit terror against Americans. Some even view them as sanctuaries where attacks could be plotted.","4723","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/16/donald-trump-closing-mosques-and-the-massive-political-power-of-fear/"

"Then, this summer, when a San Francisco woman was shot and killed, allegedly by an illegal immigrant, Trump talked about it repeatedly for a week.

"When Obama announced that the U.S. will take in 10,000 Syrian refugees, Trump said he'd kick them all out when he got to the White House. Since then, he's used language describing the millions of refugees from the Middle East less as if they were people fleeing terrorism and a civil war and more as if they are people traveling to the West to commit terrorism.","4728","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/16/donald-trump-closing-mosques-and-the-massive-political-power-of-fear/"

"Trump isn't backing off his penchant for hyperbole, and he feels no urgency to; he still stands among the top of the polls in the GOP race.

"Let’s start with the hat. “Make America Great Again,” it reads. Four words that connote past glory, present squalor, future strength — all stamped on that most American chunk of real estate, the baseball cap. It’s the perfect Donald Trump campaign slogan, its banality somehow making it memorable.","4742","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"
"But there is a contradiction in Trump’s rallying cry: Throughout his public and private life, Trump has personified, in extreme form, many of the qualities and experiences that have defined America over the past half-century.","4743","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"

"The Trumpification of America, or the Americanness of Donald Trump, is rarely far from the surface in “Never Enough,” a new biography of the billionaire by journalist Michael D’Antonio. Born in 1946, the first burst of the baby boom, Trump came of age with the narcissism of the 1970s and made his name and fortune during the “greed is good” 1980s. He endured a tabloid sex scandal in the 1990s and morphed into a reality-TV star in the 2000s. Today, The Donald is a social-media fiend running a superficial, divisive and improbably successful presidential campaign, one in which insults supplant insights and high poll numbers become, tautologically, the candidate’s best argument in his favor.","4745","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"
"“For all of his excesses, Donald Trump is a man perfectly adapted to his time,” D’Antonio writes. “Trump is not a man apart. He is, instead, merely one of us writ large.”","4746","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"

"Originally scheduled for early 2016, D’Antonio’s biography was rushed to publication to indulge the national infatuation with its subject. You can tell, too — stray words and occasional typos pop up just often enough to be distracting — but it is still a brisk and entertaining read, drawing on interviews and documents and distilling decades’ worth of news coverage to tell the story of Trump’s childhood, family, business deals and political forays.","4748","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"
"D’Antonio gets some remarkable quotes from Trump, though these days that happens whenever the candidate opens his mouth. “When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I’m basically the same,” Trump tells him. “The temperament is not that different.” Also, Trump compares his time at the New York Military Academy, a privileged prep school, to actual military experience, even if one of his most daring missions took place when young Donald was able to cut in front of Catholic schoolgirls so the NYMA could march first in a Columbus Day parade. “Maje, leave this to me,” he told his supervisor confidently.","4749","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"

"Trump learned the real estate business from his father, Fred Trump, a wealthy and prolific builder in New York’s outer boroughs. D’Antonio recounts how the two visited construction sites together; the elder Trump was so focused on his work that tagging along was sometimes the best way for his kids to spend time with him. Donald also studied real estate at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, but his father’s tactics seemed to influence him most. Fred sought free publicity however he could, deploying news releases and pitching nonevents (such as a company picnic) as newsworthy. And while remaining on the right side of the law, he manipulated the system, as when he created independent companies to buy used construction equipment, which he then leased to a Trump construction project at many times the true cost. “Be a killer,” Trump’s father told Donald repeatedly, an expression that still recurs in the son’s public statements.","4751","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"
"Trump launched his solo developer career — with frequent assists from his father — in the 1970s, an era that Tom Wolfe branded the Me Decade and that Christopher Lasch dissected in his 1979 book, “The Culture of Narcissism.” Making it couldn’t simply mean earning a lot of money. “Success in our society,” Lasch wrote, “has to be ratified by publicity.”","4752","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"
"Trump would become a master of this, from joining Manhattan’s Le Club — where the point was “to be noticed as powerful or beautiful and to be photographed alongside a celebrity and thereby become one yourself” — to courting beautiful women and magazine covers with equal zeal. In 1983, he was featured on the first episode of Robin Leach’s “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,” along with Cher and Princess Diana. Playgirl magazine dubbed him one of the 10 sexiest men in America, helping him achieve what the author calls the trifecta of celebrity: wealth, fame and sex appeal.","4753","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"
"“No one in the world of business — not Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or Warren Buffett — has been as famous as Trump for as long,” D’Antonio writes.","4754","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"
"Trump’s 1987 book, “The Art of the Deal,” became part of his persona, portraying him as a masterful negotiator and market sage. In his description of Trump’s business deals, however, D’Antonio dwells on the less-savory aspects of the developer’s work: sucking up to politicians, manipulating public opinion, bullying opponents. “If this was art,” D’Antonio writes, “then it was a kind of performance art that depended on his ability to manipulate, schmooze, and cajole.” For a while, Trump even created a fake corporate spokesman, “John Baron,” who would deliver some of the more outlandish statements to reporters. (Now there’s a fantasy for every White House press secretary.)","4755","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"
"Trump’s marriage to his first wife, Ivana, became tabloid fodder at a time when the private lives of public figures were under greater scrutiny, especially after the sex scandal that destroyed Gary Hart’s presidential bid in 1988. When Trump’s relationship with Marla Maples became public knowledge, Playboy offered her $2 million to pose nude, and she had the chance to launch a lingerie line called “The Other Woman.” (She turned down those offers, though she did endorse a brand of jeans called “No Excuses.”) D’Antonio details some of Trump’s marital spats, including battles over prenuptial agreements. In one instance, a discussion with Ivana got so intense that she bolted the room, “and only returned after Donald chased her to the sidewalk and persuaded her to keep talking.”","4756","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"

"It is hard to separate the reality of Trump from the lore. The name has come to signify “more than just the wealth, opu­lence, and excitement he hoped it would evoke,” D’Antonio writes, but also “an unseemly level of self-regard and exaggeration.” Trump never seems satisfied with his status. In a particularly tacky move, he frequently called the editors of Forbes, who publish the annual list of the richest Americans, “to say that he should be included when he was not, or that his fortune was bigger than they reported,” D’Antonio reports.","4758","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"
"Trump’s dalliance with Obama birtherism during the 2012 campaign tapped into baser American instincts, but it was in keeping with his history of crude attention-seeking. In the 1970s, he complained about having to rent properties to welfare recipients; in the 1980s, he inserted himself into the controversy surrounding the murder of a Central Park jogger and called for the death penalty for supposed “roving bands of wild criminals”; today he depicts Mexican immigrants as rapists and lawbreakers. Trump’s approach is “consistent with a long tradition of divisive and extreme rhetoric in American politics,” D’Antonio writes, but he gives Trump the benefit of the doubt, suggesting that he is guilty of insensitivity rather than outright bigotry.","4759","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"
"During Trump’s prior flirtations with presidential politics, his overall rhetoric was not all that different from today’s. In a 1987 ad he put in the Boston Globe, the New York Times and The Washington Post laying out his foreign policy views, Trump concluded: “Let’s not let our great country be laughed at anymore.” Sound familiar? And in a New Hampshire speech that year, he delivered the same apocalyptic warnings that pepper his current addresses: “If the right man doesn’t get into office, you’re going to see a catastrophe in this country in the next four years like you’re never going to believe.” The enemies back then were Japan and the Soviet Union; now, sub in China, Russia and the Islamic State.","4760","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"
"When he made noise about a possible 2000 presidential bid, reporters “tended to dwell more on the idea of his candidacy rather than on the ideas he would advocate,” D’Antonio writes. We could say much the same of today’s coverage. The idea of Trump is what tantalizes, because it is, in many ways, the American idea.","4761","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"
"“In his wealth and fame he is truly a man for our time, the ultimate expression of certain aspects of the American spirit,” D’Antonio concludes. “Donald Trump may blow his horn a little louder than other Americans, but he is playing the right tune.”","4762","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/09/11/donald-trump-vain-greedy-and-all-american/"

During the GOP debate on Fox, when Megyn Kelly famously queried him about his attitude toward women (whom he has called “fat pigs,” “dogs,” “slobs” and “animals”) he hit back by threatening the questioner: “I’ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me.

"Bad enough to alienate women in this way, but there’s even more insidious political crime here: attacking the First Amendment’s protection of a free press by menacing journalists. “I wouldn’t do that,” he said coyly.

"Later, after Trump had blamed her attitude on her menstrual cycle, Kelly went on what Fox says was a planned vacation. Nevertheless, Trump suggested he may have been the cause. What kind of candidate takes credit for bullying the media? And last week, Trump allowed Univision reporter Jorge Ramos to be ejected from a press conference for asking questions about immigration without being called upon. Ramos was later readmitted and permitted to ask about immigration, during which he said Trump could still deport immigrants compassionately. “I have a bigger heart than you do,” Trump replied. Trump’s non-specific answer to the question ended with a personal insult directed at the reporter.","4771","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/02/kareem-abdul-jabbar-this-is-the-difference-between-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders/"

"Trump’s rationale for avoiding Kelly’s debate question – that neither he nor America has time for “political correctness” – taps into a popular boogeyman. The term “political correctness” is so general that to most people it simply means a discomfort with changing times and attitudes, an attack on the traditions of how we were raised. (It’s an emotional challenge every generation has had to go through.) What it really means is nothing more than sensitizing people to the fact that some old-fashioned words, attitudes and actions may be harmful or insulting to others. Naturally, people are angry about that because it makes them feel stupid or mean when they really aren’t. But when times change, we need to change with them in areas that strengthen our society.","4775","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/02/kareem-abdul-jabbar-this-is-the-difference-between-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders/"

Instead of bullying their voices into silence or ridiculing them as losers, pigs or bimbos, Sanders left. After all, it was not his event; he was a guest. Besides, his voice was not silenced, but came back booming even louder: The next day, Sanders posted a sweeping policy of reform to fight racial inequality.

"Almost every political commentator in America has now written at least one piece attempting to explain the mystery of Donald Trump's appeal.

"Everybody senses that Trump doesn't speak like other politicians. But how is his speech different, exactly? Is it just the swagger, the dismissive tone and clipped accent? Maybe in part. Trump does seem emotionally engaged in a way none of his competitors do; he is perpetually annoyed — exasperated that things aren't as they should be — but somehow also good-humored about it. (Chris Christie and John Kasich seem perpetually annoyed, too, but there is nothing funny or cheerful about their versions.)","4800","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/how-trump-speak-has-pushed-the-donald-into-first-place/"
"To get at what makes Trump’s language different, take a look at the shape of his sentences.

"That’s rare among modern politicians, and not simply because they lack Trump’s showmanship or comedic gifts. It’s rare because most successful modern politicians are habitually careful with their language. They are keenly aware of the ways in which any word they speak may be interpreted or misinterpreted by journalists and partisan groups and constituencies and demographic groups.","4802","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/how-trump-speak-has-pushed-the-donald-into-first-place/"
"And so in important situations — situations in which they know a lot depends on what they say or don’t say — their language takes on (at least) two peculiar characteristics. First, their syntax tends to abstraction. They speak less about particular things and people — bills, countries, identifiable officials — and more about “legislation” and “the international community” and “officials” and “industry” and “Washington” and “government.”","4803","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/how-trump-speak-has-pushed-the-donald-into-first-place/"
"Second, their sentences take on a higher number of subordinate clauses and qualifying phrases — “over the last several years,” “in general,” “in effect,” “what people are telling me,” and so on. This is the kind of language you use when you’re aware that your words might be misinterpreted or used against you.","4804","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/how-trump-speak-has-pushed-the-donald-into-first-place/"
"When used well, it conveys competence and assures listeners that the speaker thinks coherent thoughts and holds reasonable positions. It suggests that the speaker cares about the truth of his claims. But politicians are frequently too careful with their language, and this conscientiousness can begin to sound like deceit or cowardice. When they rely too heavily on abstractions, when they avoid concrete nouns, when all their statements seem always hedged by qualifying phrases, they sound like politicians, in the worst sense of the word. To my ear, anyway, Hillary Clinton sounds this way almost all the time.","4805","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/how-trump-speak-has-pushed-the-donald-into-first-place/"
"Whether used well or poorly, however, the language of a typical modern politician has a distinctive sound to it. It sounds complex and careful -- sometimes sophisticated, sometimes emotive, sometimes artificial or over-scripted, but always circumspect and inevitably disingenuous.","4806","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/how-trump-speak-has-pushed-the-donald-into-first-place/"
"Trump’s language is from another rhetorical tradition entirely. Consider his hour-long media availability on Sept. 3, just after he’d signed a “loyalty pledge” that he wouldn’t run as a third-party candidate if he loses the GOP nomination. Some of his answers last only a few seconds, some are slightly longer, but almost all consist of simple sentences, grammatically and conceptually, and most of them withhold their most important word or phrase until the very end. Trump’s sentences end with a pop, and he seems to know instinctively where to put the emphasis in each one.","4807","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/how-trump-speak-has-pushed-the-donald-into-first-place/"

"Someone asks Trump about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s (R) remark that he, Christie, didn’t need the chairman of the Republican National Committee to meet with him in order to beg him to sign a loyalty pledge.

"Trump’s lengthier answers, too, involve mostly short, grammatically uncomplicated sentences, with very few of the complicating phrases you hear from an ordinary politician who’s trying hard not to say something obviously false or stupid.

"His sentences get even shorter when he lapses into his campaign boilerplate. Politicians do this all the time.

"Trump makes no effort — or seems to make no effort — to measure the effect of his propositions on different constituencies. He seems genuinely unaware that anybody might try to pick them apart. He makes no effort to hedge his statements or phrase them in such a way that they are at least defensible. Indeed, you don’t feel you’re listening to a politician at all. You feel you’re listening to a man who has rejected the conventions of electoral politics altogether -- someone who’s opted out of the whole charade.","4817","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/how-trump-speak-has-pushed-the-donald-into-first-place/"
"The result, for probably the great majority of people who follow politics, is alternately comical and horrifying.

I don’t share their view, but I find it hard to blame them.","4818","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/how-trump-speak-has-pushed-the-donald-into-first-place/"

"The lessons of Italian history ought to make Americans a lot more nervous about Donald Trump than they seem to be. Calculated buffoonery is a longstanding tactic for right-wing demagogues looking to alter national political calculations to their own advantage — masking as farce the tragedy they portend.","September 21","4921","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"Ask Italian voters, who spent a total of nine years between 1994 and 2011 being governed by Silvio Berlusconi. Italy’s longest-serving prime minister, Berlusconi started out as a wealthy demagogue on the brink of bankruptcy, whose celebrity was — like Trump’s — rooted in both real estate and popular entertainment culture. Berlusconi presented himself as Italy’s strongman, speaking like a barman, selling demonstrably false promises of wealth and grandeur for all. He made the electorate laugh while stoking fears of communists and liberals stripping privileges and increasing taxes. Presaging Trump, the Italian media mogul cast himself as the only viable savior of a struggling nation: the political outsider promising to sweep in and clean up from the vanquished left and restore the country to its lost international stature. “I am the Jesus Christ of politics. I sacrifice myself for everyone,” Berlusconi said. Now we find Trump promising “to make America great again,” pledging to become the “greatest jobs president […] ever created.”","4922","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"Like Berlusconi, Trump is running on his claim of being a rich, successful businessman, despite the fact that he was the owner of at least four bankrupt companies — just as Berlusconi promised Italians to make them as rich as he was, while in reality his companies were deeply in debt at the time he first ran, as extensively documented in Marco Travaglio’s book “Clean Hands.” Both men exploited voters’ rage at a discredited, gridlocked political establishment. Trump encourages voters’ fearful nativism and legitimizes racist and sexist anxieties called forth by claims to equality for women and minorities. He styles himself as the man willing to bluntly state “truths” held to be self-evident by fearful white conservatives, abandoning the politeness and political correctness of mainstream candidates who know they can’t win elections if they sound too much like Archie Bunker.","4923","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"Like Berlusconi in Italy, Trump has built a political campaign employing unvarnished language and jaundiced humor, which has succeeded in the United States, a country that — embarrassingly — ranks second among wealthy industrialized nations, only behind Italy, in terms of being uninformed on key issues of the world.","4924","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"Trump’s crude attacks on female candidates and journalists — such as characterizing Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly as having “blood coming out of her… wherever” and attacking presidential candidate and opponent Carly Fiorina’s appearance — are reminiscent of Berlusconi’s history of misogyny. He once dismissed opponents as “too ugly to be taken seriously” and insulted a fellow European leader during a conversation with a newspaper editor, referring to German Chancellor Angela Merkel as “an unf—able fat bitch.” (Il Giornale, Berlusconi’s own newspaper, characterized the allegation as “gossip.”) Berlusconi was known to advise U.S. businessmen to invest in Italy because they have “beautiful secretaries … superb girls.”","4925","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"Like Trump, Berlusconi relied on the fact that Italy’s liberal mainstream would treat him as a joke, using his ugly gaffes as an effective, disruptive campaign strategy to distract both from his lack of well-thought-out policy ideas, as well as his dangerous ignorance on foreign policy. That seems to be Trump’s plan, too. They both turned the jokes on the political elite by stirring up the electorate’s disdain for their critics. Challenged about his complicated personal life, the twice-divorced Berlusconi contemptuously and proudly stated, “it’s better to be fond of beautiful girls than to be gay.” Meanwhile, Trump, who has been twice divorced and thrice married, opposes gay marriage on the grounds that it’s not traditional.","4926","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"Berlusconi sold an impossible dream, convincing Italian voters that all that stood between them and the sort of wealth and grandeur he enjoyed was a hapless, self-serving political class. He promised to amend the constitution, deregulate markets and shrink government, thus packaging a billionaire’s dream agenda as if it offered salvation to “the average Giuseppe.” Trump has been vague about his economic policies, other than to bluster that his business experience means voters should trust him. But, like Berlusconi, he responds to tough questions with scandalous insults so as to focus the conversation on those insults rather than on his platform.","4927","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"Trump’s political path has been carved by a media culture that favors entertainment over news. Political debate and discussion on TV have been reduced to mud-wrestling, with the recent “Trump vs. Rest of GOP” debates being a perfect illustration. Berlusconi’s opponents fell into his PR trap in the same way in Italy, rushing to condemn his gaffes and his deliberately provocative statements calculated to rouse the far right. Like Berlusconi, Trump has already succeeded in making himself the center of the conversation.","4928","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"Berlusconi may have been even more shameless than Trump. In 2005, I was one of five journalists from the Middle East invited to brief Berlusconi on how to improve his relationship with the Muslim world — whose civilization he had dismissed as inferior and backward. Berlusconi feared that Italy would be targeted for terrorist attacks similar to those seen in London and Madrid, the latter of which immediately preceded the ouster by Spanish voters of Berlusconi’s ideological analog, José María Aznar. My journalist colleagues and I unanimously advised him to distance himself from the Iraq invasion, of which he had been an enthusiastic backer. The following day, Berlusconi appeared on my TV news show and proceeded to deny having ever supported the Iraqi war, going as far as to claim that he had tried — in vain — to dissuade President George W. Bush from undertaking the ill-fated venture. If necessary to avoid a potential pitfall, Berlusconi was willing to deny in the evening precisely what he had stated that same morning.","4929","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"Before the interview, in an apparent effort to ingratiate himself to me, Berlusconi cited the fact that he had dated Arab women as “proof” that he did not actually believe Muslims to be inferiors. (That was before it was made public that one of those Arab women was “Ruby the Heartstealer,” an underage Moroccan prostitute whose services Berlusconi had previously engaged.)","4930","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"As with Trump, Berlusconi’s antics make mockery of the idea of politicians being guided by convictions. Nonetheless, Italians were endlessly entertained by the comedy he brought to politics. Trump’s bullying of Univision’s Jorge Ramos also has a Berlusconi antecedent — Italy’s best journalists, such as Marco Travaglio, Michelle Santoro and Enzo Biagi, were either sued or fired from their jobs because they dared to challenge Berlusconi’s policies. Even comedians like Daniele Luttazzi were not spared. Trump, meanwhile, sued HBO’s Bill Maher for mocking the tycoon’s hairdo.","4931","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"It is precisely that authoritarian demagoguery wrapped in comedy that Trump has brought to American politics. So it’s now urgent that America learns the lessons taught (and havoc wrought) when Italy’s political and media establishment underestimated Berlusconi. They viewed him as a joke, an ignorant buffoon, and he was widely dismissed as a comical figure, unfit to lead a serious country. None of that stopped him.","4932","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"Trump has managed to tap into real anger and disillusionment with an American political class owned by billionaires like him. He’s taken populism to new depths, tacitly embracing a call to “get rid of” all American Muslims. Even worse, he communicates his backward views with a tone and tenor that screams of rejection and disregard of America’s civil rights achievements of the past century. The gridlocked political system is incapable of taking action to relieve the plight of middle class Americans, much less help the poor.","4933","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"In Italy, it was their own poor reputations in voters’ eyes that prevented established politicians from fending off Berlusconi’s challenge. They were viewed as inept, corrupt, boring and uninterested in the concerns of ordinary Italians. Berlusconi appealed to their most base instincts and sanctified their prejudices, rendering them willing to overlook the obvious hypocrisy and fallacy of his promises. So effective was Berlusconi’s narrative that the electorate was willing to forgive — repeatedly — his utter failure to deliver on his economic promises.","4934","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"Ultimately, it was the leaders of the European Union who forced him to resign, in exchange for rescuing Italy’s tanking economy during the debt crisis. Berlusconi stepped aside amid fears that the Italian economy, the third largest in Europe, was headed the same way as Greece.","4935","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"
"It would be a terrible mistake for America’s political establishment to dismiss Trump’s populist appeal and presume him unelectable. Even if he doesn’t win, he’s already done damage: Laughing at, or simply ignoring his rhetorical, xenophobic bellowing can, perversely, further kindle Trump’s resentment-based politics, allowing them to fester unchallenged. The poisonous impact his campaign and antics are having on the country’s politics are exploiting and galvanizing broad, deep-seated, toxic resentment of the status quo, which has already defined this campaign — and which may well outlive Trump’s candidacy.","4936","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/21/donald-trump-is-americas-silvio-berlusconi/"

"In the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll, Trump leads among most demographic groups. He leads with men by 10 points, with women by 11. He leads among the ""very conservative"" by one point (within the margin of error) but among moderates by 16. He leads among those with a college degree by two and among those without one by 14.

"Part of that is certainly that Carson has plummeted. Since the day before the Paris terrorist attacks, Carson's polling average has fallen nearly five points, from 24.4 to 19.8.

"It's hard not to think that Trump's hard line on everything has benefited him since the attacks in Paris. In the Post/ABC poll, white non-college graduates — one of the groups among which Trump does the best — were 38 points more likely to say that they opposed resettling Syrian refugees in the United States. Among those who say they favor deporting undocumented immigrants, Trump leads by 25. Trump has spent the past week embroiled in a very public conversation about just how far he wants to go in cracking down on refugees, immigrants and terrorists — which is not likely to hurt him with his core base of support. As we noted last week, foreign policy was a noted point of weakness for Carson even before the attacks.","4944","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/22/the-paris-attacks-appear-to-have-vaulted-donald-trump-higher-in-the-polls/"

"This is a very plausible hypothesis, but one with little comprehensive evidence to date. Now, thanks to a collection of survey data from YouGov, we can show how, and how much, voters’ concern about immigration has helped Trump.","4948","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/how-anti-immigrant-attitudes-are-fueling-support-for-donald-trump/"
"The YouGov data includes 14 surveys that were conducted every week or every other week between June 13 and Nov. 9.

"Republicans clearly agree that the issue of immigration is important: around 60 percent consistently say it is “very important.” And believing that immigration is important is correlated with more conservative views on immigration. Among Republicans, those who believe immigration is very important are much more opposed to immigration policies like a path to citizenship — according to data in the Nov. 5-9 YouGov poll.","4950","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/how-anti-immigrant-attitudes-are-fueling-support-for-donald-trump/"
"So if Trump’s appeal is partly about his conservative stands on immigration, his support should be particularly strong among Republicans who say that immigration is important.","4951","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/how-anti-immigrant-attitudes-are-fueling-support-for-donald-trump/"
"That’s exactly what these data suggest:","4952","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/how-anti-immigrant-attitudes-are-fueling-support-for-donald-trump/"
"Before Trump announced his candidacy back in June, opinions about immigration had little influence on support for him.

"Although his support has increased among other Republicans as well, those who prioritize immigration continue to be his strongest supporters. Indeed, since September Trump’s support has actually declined among other Republicans, but not among those who prioritize immigration. People who think immigration is very important are now 25 points more likely to support Donald Trump than other Republicans (42 percent to 17 percent).","4954","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/how-anti-immigrant-attitudes-are-fueling-support-for-donald-trump/"
"The YouGov/Economist survey also included several other questions about immigration and immigrants, such as (1) How serious of a problem is illegal immigration? (2) Are immigrants more or less likely to commit crimes? (3) Are immigrants good or bad for the economy? (4) And should undocumented immigrants in the United States be deported?","4955","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/how-anti-immigrant-attitudes-are-fueling-support-for-donald-trump/"

"The red line suggests that the Republicans most opposed to immigration (27 percent of the Republican sample) are about 50 percentage points more likely to support Trump than the small minority of the party who are strongly sympathetic to immigrants. This does not change even after accounting for other factors, such as self-reported ideology on the liberal-conservative scale, religiosity and other demographics.","4957","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/how-anti-immigrant-attitudes-are-fueling-support-for-donald-trump/"

"Of course, there is a chicken-and-egg question here. Are concerns about immigration helping drive Trump support, or did people decide to support Trump for other reasons and only then align their views on immigration with his views? Americans often change their issue positions and the importance they place on issues based on the positions and priorities of their preferred candidates.","4959","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/how-anti-immigrant-attitudes-are-fueling-support-for-donald-trump/"
"But some evidence suggests that opposition to immigration really is driving support for Trump. In these YouGov polls, there are some respondents who are interviewed more than once. I focused on individuals who were interviewed by YouGov both before and after Trump announced his candidacy. People’s views about immigration before Trump even announced his candidacy should not be directly influenced by their views about Trump.","4960","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/how-anti-immigrant-attitudes-are-fueling-support-for-donald-trump/"

"These findings are also consistent with a variety of social science research. Attitudes toward minority groups have long been potent predictors of Americans’ political beliefs. Opposition to immigration in particular may have driven whites from the Democratic Party in recent years. And campaign appeals to racial and ethnic anxieties have often succeeded in activating support for politicians.","4962","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/how-anti-immigrant-attitudes-are-fueling-support-for-donald-trump/"
"Moreover, Larry Bartels’ venerable account of presidential primaries contends that as voters acquire more information about candidates, “the public comes to increasingly evaluate candidates on their political merits, in accordance with longstanding political predispositions.” Attitudes toward immigrants should therefore have become more strongly linked to support for Trump as the intense media coverage of his campaign highlighted his immigration positions.","4963","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/how-anti-immigrant-attitudes-are-fueling-support-for-donald-trump/"

"Donald Trump's bizarre performance at a rally in Fort Dodge, Iowa, on Thursday night — insulting his opponents, swearing, inviting someone to try to stab him — has prompted a new round of ""has he gone too far"" questioning. (Which is somewhat unusual: The media, which asked that question repeatedly in July and August, is now much more timid about speculating on Trump's political demise for obvious reasons.) It is perfectly possible that he has Gone Too Far™, at long last — perhaps because his tone was noticeably different (as Jeff Blehar of the conservative blog Ace of Spades notes).","November 13","5009","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"But for this to be Trump's ""gone too far"" moment, people needed to have seen it or heard about it. Which raises an interesting question in an age of fragmented media: How many people will actually watch or hear about Trump's speech?","5010","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"We can start with at least one hard number: The people in the room. Our Jenna Johnson was covering the event (and wrote an amazing article about it). Via e-mail, she told me how many people witnessed it firsthand: With 1,200 in the theater, plus people standing, people on-stage and people in an overflow room, she figured there were about 1,500 people who saw it live.","5011","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"As Trump spoke, people in attendance (including Johnson and other reporters) were tweeting out tidbits as they happened. Tweets are one of the purest forms of the sound bite — tiny, easily transmittable chunks of text. Prompting an aside: When we question whether Trump has ""gone too far"" we're really asking if Trump has said or done something that will change the minds of people who support him. That doesn't require watching the full speech; a tweet about the speech could prompt that reaction.","5012","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"Johnson's most popular tweet from the event dealt with Trump's assertions of his military expertise.","5013","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"According to Twitter's analytics, that tweet resulted in over 53,000 ""impressions,"" a count of the number of times the tweet was seen on Twitter. Johnson had a number of other tweets, too, including quoting Trump asking, ""How stupid are the people of Iowa?"" It wasn't seen as often, yielding 25,000 impressions. That quote was tweeted frequently in the moment (see here, here, here and here, for example) given its disparagement of the people Trump was talking to, but most of those tweets only got a few dozen retweets.","5014","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"So let's say that, in the moment, the real-time tweets of Trump's speech were seen 500,000 times in total. This is probably low, but since a lot of those views were probably seen by the same people — followers of the people tweeting — we'll use that as an estimate.","5015","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"Of course, there's another point about the ""gone too far"" moment: It's impossible to tell what will tip the scales. Trump's fans have proven remarkably adept at forgiving what the outside world sees as transgressions. Even last night, as Johnson reported, ""[a] few of Trump's fans learned about the speech on Twitter and accused reporters of fabricating the quotes and tweeting them out in unison."" Even if those tweets were seen hundreds of thousands of times, it doesn't mean they had an effect.","5016","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"The story rippled outward. Johnson filed her piece for The Post and then added a longer, more-fleshed-out one. Since each went live on the site, they've been viewed by a combined 400,000 unique visitors. But only a small fraction of those viewers are in Iowa or New Hampshire, and — since not everyone is like you and reads deep into articles — not everyone may have seen something that changed their minds about Trump.","5017","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"(On Facebook, some 430 people have ""liked"" Johnson's article, but the number of readers is included in the figures above.)","5018","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"Of course, other media outlets also ran stories, some based on reporters at the scene and some based on reports like Johnson's. It's impossible to know how many people read those articles after they went up, but it's safe to assume that it was in the millions, total — say 2 million, just to have a number — with the same caveats as above.","5019","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"It took very little time for video from Trump's speech to make it onto television. CNN's Don Lemon had the footage in short order, airing it shortly before midnight.","5020","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"

"On Monday, 417,000 people watched Lemon's show, about 150,000 of whom were aged 25 to 54.","5022","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"But that was just the start of the television broadcasts. CBS featured the story (and Johnson's story in particular) on its ""This Morning"" program early Friday. That show attracted an average of 3.6 million viewers last week. It was also on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" (5 million average viewers), NBC's ""Today"" (4.8 million) and the less-watched programs MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" and CNN's ""New Day."" According to the media-monitoring site TVEyes.com, the phrase ""How stupid are the people of Iowa"" has aired 37 different times since midnight — on Al Jazeera, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, Bloomberg and Fox Business. That's hundreds of thousands of more people who saw at least that clip — if not Trump's comments about the military or about Ben Carson.","5023","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"It also aired in Iowa. The network affiliates ran the morning shows, as you'd expect. But the CBS affiliate (KCCI) included Trump's comments in their own local newscast (""one of the Republican candidates is not sure we are getting it right"") as did the NBC affiliation (WHO) last night at 10 p.m. The viewership of those broadcasts doesn't get into the millions, but they are obviously much more focused on the voters of the state.","5024","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"Of course, video isn't only shown on TV anymore, Grandpa. KCCI's clip of Trump's Iowa comments is on YouTube, with a modest number of viewers.","5025","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"There are a number of other versions of the clip, totaling a few thousand views. There are undoubtedly versions on Snapchat and Vine and wherever else, but in many cases those are even harder to suss out. (We looked at the problem with Snapchat earlier this year.)","5026","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"And then there are all of the other outlets. Morning e-mail newsletters, like The Post's Daily 202. People sharing articles over e-mail to try and convince their relatives one way or the other. Or good old word of mouth. A hard figure is very hard to determine.","5027","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"But we'll take a stab anyway. Totaling the figures above gives us something like this: 1,500 + 500,000 + 400,000 + 2,000,000 + 417,000 + 13,500,000 — or 16.8 million people. Well, not people, actually, since I saw a lot of the tweets and articles and TV broadcasts.

"Is that a lot? Is it a little? It's actually hard to say. Clearly it's one of the dominant political stories of the day — but on a Friday in November when a lot of people aren't paying much attention to politics. ​It’s also only about 12 hours after the fact. Who knows what happens over the next week.​ The only way to really know the extent to which a story like this has penetrated the public awareness is with polling, but once you're polling people in Iowa, you can just go ahead and ask them if they support Donald Trump. Skip a step.","5029","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/how-many-people-actually-saw-donald-trumps-bizarre-iowa-speech-anyway/"
"Donald Trump might have gone too far on Thursday. He certainly did for some voters. But how many know at this point what he said and how many will have their minds changed is very difficult to calculate.

"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are separated by a narrow three points in a potential 2016 match-up, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, with 46 percent of registered voters choosing Clinton to 43 percent picking Trump.","September 13","5031","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/13/donald-trump-now-running-neck-and-neck-with-hillary-clinton/"

"The data come a long 14 months from the general election and before either party picks its nominee — Clinton is looking less likely to be the Democratic nominee than before and Trump more likely as the GOP one — but they demonstrate the power of partisanship, which bring the less-popular Trump into a once-unthinkable position of nipping at Clinton's heels.","5033","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/13/donald-trump-now-running-neck-and-neck-with-hillary-clinton/"
"","5034","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/13/donald-trump-now-running-neck-and-neck-with-hillary-clinton/"
"Trump's improved performance against Clinton among registered voters isn't unexpected, given that Democrats have a harder time turning out their supporters and usually fare better among broader samples of Americans. Their advantage is typically smaller still among actual voters in general elections.","5035","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/13/donald-trump-now-running-neck-and-neck-with-hillary-clinton/"
"The vote shifts between adults and voters are small and generally within the poll's margin of error. But the shifts in the marginal results are most apparent among political independents. Clinton has a very narrow advantage among all independents, at 45-39 — a six-point difference that is within the poll's error margin. But among registered independents, the slight advantage flips to Trump, 44-39.","5036","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/13/donald-trump-now-running-neck-and-neck-with-hillary-clinton/"
"","5037","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/13/donald-trump-now-running-neck-and-neck-with-hillary-clinton/"
"Clinton and Trump are very solid among their bases of Democrats and Republicans. Clinton gets the support of 83 percent of all Democrats and 82 percent of registered Democrats, with vote margins of 70 and 67 points, respectively.","5038","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/13/donald-trump-now-running-neck-and-neck-with-hillary-clinton/"
"Likewise, Trump gets 73 percent support from all Republicans and 76 percent for registered Republicans. Trump's overwhelming partisan support indicates Republicans are willing to rally against Clinton even while having reservations about Trump. Nearly 4-in-10 Republicans had an unfavorable impression of Trump in a separate Post-ABC poll last week; only half as many Democrats held negative impressions of Clinton in that survey — 18 percent.","5039","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/13/donald-trump-now-running-neck-and-neck-with-hillary-clinton/"
"But what about Hispanic Americans who have expressed overwhelmingly negative views of Trump? Among all adults, Hispanics break 69 percent for Clinton and 21 percent for Trump. The 48-point margin is not far from Barack Obama's 44-point winning margin over Mitt Romney among Hispanic voters in 2012, according to national exit poll.","5040","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/13/donald-trump-now-running-neck-and-neck-with-hillary-clinton/"
"Clinton maintains an advantage among all registered voters in this poll even though independents tilt toward Trump because there are more people who identify as Democrats than Republicans, and those Democrats are more firmly behind Clinton. This phenomenon was apparent in the 2012 election, when Mitt Romney topped Barack Obama by five points among independents, but still lost by four percentage points.","5041","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/13/donald-trump-now-running-neck-and-neck-with-hillary-clinton/"

"But Trump doesn’t have a case here. Political criticism of this sort — even political criticism that’s sold for money — isn’t covered by trademark law, even when the subject’s name is a valid trademark (because it has been used for commercial purposes, or even registered as a trademark). Nor would it be covered by the so-called “right of publicity,” which in most states limits certain uses of a person’s name or likeness; and to the extent that any right of publicity statute or trademark rule would try to restrict such criticism, the First Amendment protects the criticism.","5044","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/09/23/donald-trump-threatens-to-sue-over-stoptrump-us-t-shirts-but-he-doesnt-have-a-case/"

"1. Trademark confusion: The federal trademark statute bars uses of a trademark that are “likely to cause confusion” as to who is selling a work. If I sell T-shirts with Justin Bieber’s name on them, he could sue me on the grounds that buyers might think the shirts are authorized by Bieber. But no reasonable person would assume that “StopTrump” T-shirts are authorized by Trump himself.","5046","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/09/23/donald-trump-threatens-to-sue-over-stoptrump-us-t-shirts-but-he-doesnt-have-a-case/"
"2. Trademark dilution: The statute bans even non-confusing uses of trademarks that tend to dilute a sufficiently famous mark. The classic example is Godiva dog biscuits, which may dilute the distinctiveness of the trademark “Godiva” as a mark for luxury goods, even if no one thinks the dog biscuits are made by Godiva. But the dilution provision expressly exempts uses of a trademark for “identifying and parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon the famous mark owner or the goods or services of the famous mark owner.”","5047","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/09/23/donald-trump-threatens-to-sue-over-stoptrump-us-t-shirts-but-he-doesnt-have-a-case/"
"3. Trademark cybersquatting: The statute also bans certain uses of trademarks in domain names. But it’s limited to uses of trademarks that are likely to confuse people about whether the site is endorsed by the trademark owner, or likely to dilute the trademark — for reasons given above, that element can’t be shown here. And in any event, the cybersquatting law excludes cases where “the person believed and had reasonable grounds to believe that the use of the domain name was a fair use.” Criticism is a classic example of fair use.","5048","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/09/23/donald-trump-threatens-to-sue-over-stoptrump-us-t-shirts-but-he-doesnt-have-a-case/"
"Trump’s letter relies on the confusion and cybersquatting theories; but even if a lawsuit is brought on all these theories, it would lose. There are lots of cases on all this, such as Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc. (9th Cir. 2002), which held that a band’s commercial release of the song “Barbie Girl” — which criticized Barbie — didn’t infringe Mattel’s trademark. But in any event, both the statute and the case law under it are quite clearly against Trump.","5049","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/09/23/donald-trump-threatens-to-sue-over-stoptrump-us-t-shirts-but-he-doesnt-have-a-case/"
"Of course, such cease and desist letters often frighten defendants into submission, since they may be reluctant to spend money on lawyers even if they will win in the end. But here, I’m pretty sure that the StopTrump people will get many offers of free legal help; and the lawsuit is pure publicity gold for the business. What a brilliant marketing tactic by the T-shirt people — but why is the Trump campaign playing along?","5050","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/09/23/donald-trump-threatens-to-sue-over-stoptrump-us-t-shirts-but-he-doesnt-have-a-case/"

"During a recent campaign rally in Worcester, Mass., Donald Trump did his best to rile his audience with vulgarity and insults.

"Trump has hurled a lot of meanness, but mocking someone’s weight cuts at the core of personal appearance, societal prejudices and a fraught sense of insecurity that by all rights should not exist but stubbornly does. It is a fashion insult — of the pettiest sort. Which means that it is a visceral, intimate insult. It is one that Trump knows the sting of all too well because he is a man exceedingly concerned with how he looks — specifically whether he looks fat, not simply whether he looks good. During an interview in 1999, when he was a political dabbler in the Reform Party, Trump peppered a Washington Post photographer with questions about the type of lens she was using to snap his portrait: Was it a wide angle? It better not be a wide angle! He was still distressed about a two-year-old photo that had run in another publication that made him look a bit chubby. “I looked like I weighed 500 pounds!” he lamented.","5076","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/11/20/donald-trump-thinks-hes-a-fashion-critic-heres-what-our-fashion-critic-thinks-about-him/"

"So Trump’s fat-shaming of a protester begs one to consider Trump’s own appearance. He’s known for a swaggering businessman’s style that offers little in the way of a statement on personal aesthetics or even rareified taste. His clothes are really just a perfunctory set of uniforms. His suits — he has leaned towards Brioni over the years — are cut from conservative but quality fabric yet lack an attention to fit. They are always a little too roomy, the sleeves a tad too long. So much so that they look cheap — or more diplomatically, they look a lot like the mass-market suits that bore his name and were once sold at Macy’s until the department store shuttered the line after his derogatory remarks about Mexicans.","5078","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/11/20/donald-trump-thinks-hes-a-fashion-critic-heres-what-our-fashion-critic-thinks-about-him/"

"For a man who is quick to tout his financial status, Trump’s style doesn’t telegraph money. It doesn’t look luxurious; it’s hardly elevated. For a man with a love of braggadocio, it’s surprising that he would not pay more attention to his attire, that his clothes would not exude confidence and certainty. After all, he’s surrounded by family — women, at least — with an eye for style and certainly for fit.

"Trump helps the perception by sounding buffoonish. “I say, not in a braggadocious way, I’ve made billions,” he announced Wednesday. “I’m number one in every polls [sic] by a lot,” he further declared, and at another point asserted that “I’m a very militaristic person.” Asked about a Hugh Hewitt radio interview in which he confused the Kurds with the Iranian Quds Force and seemed not to recognize the name of Quds Force leader Qasem Soleimani, Trump explained that “Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name.” (Soleimani is not an Arab.)","5099","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-donald-trump/2015/09/17/fb6b737e-5d53-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html"

"I am General Counsel to Donald J. Trump. We recently had the opportunity to view your television commercial entitled ""Politician"" together with your accompanying statements in the media concerning my client's views (collectively, your ""Attack Ad"") and, quite frankly, are dismayed by the depths special interest groups like yours will go to in an attempt to materially mislead the public for the personal benefit of you and your financial backers.","5114","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/22/donald-trumps-cease-and-desist-letter-annotated/"
"Simply stated, your Attack Ad is not only completely disingenuous, but replete with outright lies, false, defamatory and destructive statements and downright fabrications which you fully know to be untrue, thereby exposing you and your so-called ""club"" to liability for damages and other tortious harm. For example, while your Attack Ad blatantly misrepresents to the public that Mr. Trump ""supports higher taxes"", nothing could be further from the truth. To be clear, Mr. Trump's tax plan, which is scheduled to be released later this week, supports a lowering of taxes.","5115","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/22/donald-trumps-cease-and-desist-letter-annotated/"
"Not surprisingly, a closer look at your Attack Ad reveals that your supposed ""source"" for this statement is -- according to the small print on your website -- nothing more than a single article published in the Advocate on February 15, 2000 which quoted Mr. Trump as supposedly saying he would ""impose a one-time net worth tax of 14.25% on the superwealthy ... to pay off the national debt."" That's it. While a reputable organization would have at least had the decency to disclose its source — and the fact that the source article is more than 15 years old -- your pitiful little group conveniently chose to leave that information out in a deliberate attempt to mislead the public into believing that it is reflective of Mr. Trump's current position — when, unquestionably, it is not. Making matters worse, you then chose to appear on several talk shows, including, MSNBC's Morning Joe, in which you furthered the erroneous notion that Mr. Trump ""supports higher taxes"" even though you have absolutely no factual support for that statement. In other words, you lied. Mr. Trump does not support higher taxes. This is the very definition of libel.","5116","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/22/donald-trumps-cease-and-desist-letter-annotated/"
"Sadly, the deplorable actions of your organization are not the least bit surprising. As I am sure you recall, it was only a few short months ago that you very openly and shamelessly attempted to extort Mr. Trump to the tune of $1 million in exchange for your political support. Indeed, you were not even the least bit discreet about your motives in that, after meeting with Mr. Trump, you immediately followed up with a June 2, 2015 letter requesting a ""contribution of $1 million"" in exchange for an endorsement by your organization's political action committee. ""This contribution,"" you proclaimed, ""would have a dramatically positive impact on the Club's ability to identify future free-enterprise champions."" When Mr. Trump, however, presumably unlike many of the other candidates, refused to succumb to your extortionist demands, your only response was to oppose his inclusion in the August 6, 2015 Fox News Republican Presidential Debate, launch a series of misleading Attack Ads targeting Mr. Trump and, ultimately, endorse certain other candidates. Though your website states that donations to ""Club for Growth ... are NOT publicly disclosed"", one can only assume that the candidates you are endorsing paid handsomely for your support. American politics at its worst. If that is not a ""shake-down"", I do not know what is.","5117","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/22/donald-trumps-cease-and-desist-letter-annotated/"
"Rest assured, however, we will not sit idly by and allow special interest groups and political action committees like yours to defame Mr. Trump and cause damage to his reputation and business interests by intentionally disseminating libelous statements you fully know to be untrue and, even worse, continue to purposely mislead the American people for your own financial gain. Toward that end, Mr. Trump has authorized our legal team to take all necessary and appropriate actions to bring an immediate halt to your defamatory Attack Ads. In the interest of avoiding what will certainly be a costly litigation process, we are prepared to offer you the one-time opportunity to rectify this matter by providing us with your prompt written assurances that (i) you have stopped running the Attack Ads; and (ii) you will not generate or disseminate any misleading or inaccurate information or make any factually baseless accusations you know to be untrue with respect to my client at any point in the future. In the event, however, we do not promptly receive these assurances, please be advised that we will commence a multi-million dollar lawsuit against you personally and your organization for your false and defamatory statements and the damage you have intentionally caused to my client's interests as well as pursue all other remedies available to us at law or in equity.","5118","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/22/donald-trumps-cease-and-desist-letter-annotated/"

"The Trump critics included many Hispanics, while the pro-Trump forces were almost uniformly white — with at least one exception: Raul Rodriguez Jr., the son of a Mexican immigrant and an avowed fan of The Donald and his controversial immigration policies.","5126","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/18/meet-a-latino-supporter-of-donald-trump/"
"“I've lived in this country my whole life, I speak the language, and I respect the laws of the land,” said Rodriguez, 72, carrying a sign that read, ""Legal Not Illegal!!"" “I've assimilated — I think those people on the other side of the street need to learn something about what that means.”","5127","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/18/meet-a-latino-supporter-of-donald-trump/"
"Rodriguez was born in El Paso, Tex., and has deep ties to Mexico. His father immigrated from Mexico to the United States at 18, and his mother was born to two Mexican immigrants. He said his support of Trump has ostracized him from his community as the national debate over immigration continues to galvanize Latino voters. But he said he feels strongly about the issue.","5128","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/18/meet-a-latino-supporter-of-donald-trump/"

"From the start of his campaign in June, Trump has dominated the Republican race and fired up conservatives with calls for a massive wall on the border with Mexico and mass deportation of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. He has also repeatedly claimed that Mexico is purposely sending ""rapists"" and other dangerous criminals across the border.","5131","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/18/meet-a-latino-supporter-of-donald-trump/"
"As a result, most Hispanics strongly oppose him. A Washington Post-ABC News Poll in late August found that only 15 percent of Hispanics had a favorable view of Trump, with 68 percent strongly unfavorable. Another Post-ABC poll this week showed that 75 percent of Hispanics oppose his immigration proposals.","5132","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/18/meet-a-latino-supporter-of-donald-trump/"
"Those numbers — while potentially disastrous in a general election — mean that some Latinos like what they are hearing from Trump. During a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in July, Trump was cheered on by Luis Villegas, a 28-year-old Border Patrol agent who said was galvanized by the mogul’s stance on immigration. “I believe in what he’s throwing out there,” Villegas said.","5133","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/18/meet-a-latino-supporter-of-donald-trump/"
"Here in Simi Valley, Rodriguez said he has been politically active all his life, starting out as a young man attending labor union rallies but later becoming a conservative admirer of Ronald Reagan.

"“During his announcement speech, when he made that statement about rapists, I think it was taken out of context,” Rodriguez said. “The point that he was trying to make is that a lot of people are being killed by illegals, including women and children, and a lot of them are being raped — this is all true.”","5136","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/18/meet-a-latino-supporter-of-donald-trump/"

"Rodriguez said he holds no animosity toward Mexico. For a number of years, he said he took mission trips to the country's poorest areas to build homes for Mexicans living in poverty. But he condemns those who cross the border illegally, and believes immigrants should be required to take English language classes and courses on American culture.","5138","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/18/meet-a-latino-supporter-of-donald-trump/"
"“They take too much pride in the culture they left,” Rodriguez said, shaking his head at the anti-Trump protesters cross the street Wednesday night. “It's one thing to take pride in being Latino — it's another thing to take for granted being an American.”","5139","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/18/meet-a-latino-supporter-of-donald-trump/"

"What’s more immediately relevant here is the challenge this represents to Trump’s fellow Republicans — and to the GOP. After Barack Obama defeated Mitt Romney in part by casting him as a plutocrats’ dream candidate, Republicans launched an ambitious effort to rebrand the party as deeply concerned with stagnating wages, stalled economic mobility, and soaring inequality. Paul Ryan, who’d emerged as the GOP’s guiding light on economic matters by crafting a vision that would massively redistribute wealth upwards, “quietly” launched a poverty tour that wasn’t quite quiet enough to stay out of the newspapers. Marco Rubio gave high profile speeches about poverty and the middle class. Jeb Bush’s first big economic speech waxed lyrical about the moral scourge of stunted opportunity.","5212","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/morning-plum-donald-trump-is-in-on-the-joke-and-the-jokes-on-you/"
"We have now seen tax plans from the GOP candidates, and despite their “populist” packaging, it turns out, as Ramesh Ponnuru puts it, that “all of them would also ensure that the top one percent comes out way ahead.” The Rubio and Bush plans contain middle class tax relief, but when viewed in the larger context of who would benefit most from them, it has the feel of political window dressing, as Ponnuru concludes: “Republicans would probably be better off in the general election next year if their plans weren’t quite so favorable to the rich.”","5213","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/morning-plum-donald-trump-is-in-on-the-joke-and-the-jokes-on-you/"
"The GOP candidates apparently think they can cite their plans’ middle class tax relief — combined with soothing supply-side sweet-nothings — to make the cuts for the rich more palatable in a general election. Bush’s campaign has road-tested the argument that his plan would result in top earners paying a larger share of the overall tax burden, which is a diversion. Rubio has gamely suggested that his plan’s elimination of taxes on capital gains and dividends would help create jobs for bartenders like his father.","5214","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/morning-plum-donald-trump-is-in-on-the-joke-and-the-jokes-on-you/"

"As we’ve noted, those complaints carried the usual Trump trifecta of baselessness, thin-skinnedness and narcissism. This back-and-forth between Trump and Fox News is entering another round — perhaps its third or fourth. It all started after Fox News host Megyn Kelly on Aug. 6 asked Trump an excellent question about his history of misogyny at the network’s touted Republican presidential debate. Trump went on the offensive, going so far as to suggest the following in a CNN interview: “You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever.”","5288","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/09/23/big-news-donald-trump-boycotting-fox-news/"
"A truce was struck. Then it was broken later in August, when Trump couldn’t stop himself from attacking Kelly after she’d returned from a vacation.

Though the regular gig went away once Trump became a presidential candidate, “Fox & Friends” has still managed to secure occasional chats with the Republican front-runner.

"Between July 1 and Sept. 30, Trump's campaign says it received 73,942 unsolicited donations, pumping $3.8 million into his campaign coffers. The average contribution was about $50, and 71 percent of the money came from donors giving less than $200.

"But Trump's paperwork reveals that he has constructed a massive network to support his campaign. The report lists more than 50 consulting firms or individuals being paid by the campaign -- nearly all of whom are labeled as being a consultant of some sort. He has hired an ""event staging consulting"" group and several individuals who provide ""administrative consulting."" Trump labels his lead spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, as providing “communications consulting.” Although Trump presents himself as an independent operator who comes up with his own policy ideas and doesn't pay attention to expert opinions, he has hired a number of strategy or policy consultants.

"While other campaigns have been sinking money into television ads, direct mail and other traditional ways to reach voters, Trump's biggest expenses thus far appear to be the renting out large venues to host elaborate events that attract thousands and campaign swag.

"How the world actually works: Cable television has much more latitude than radio or regular TV with regard to what can be said on its programs. And it's up to FCC officials, not you, to decide when someone has gone too far. Also, Lowry's metaphor, while perhaps a little graphic, is pretty tame compared to a lot of stuff you'd see in that time slot.

"How the world actually works: Fox says that Trump was actually upset that the network had canceled his appearance on ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" which my colleague Philip Bump said sounds about right. But threatening the media doesn't work all that well in the United States. In fact, not at all. We'll let a Fox spokesperson's statement take it from here: ""He doesn’t seem to grasp that candidates telling journalists what to ask is not how the media works in this country.”","5322","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/24/donald-trump-apparently-wants-to-sue-and-complain-his-way-to-the-presidency/"

"So why are Trump’s polling numbers declining? As I’ve argued before, changes in people’s preferences almost always require changes in the information they’re receiving.

Now, media coverage is arguably motivating his decline.","5329","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/29/why-is-donald-trump-declining-in-the-polls-the-media-strike-again/"

"You can see the correlation. An initial surge in news coverage after Trump announced his candidacy on June 16 creates an initial surge in polling. Then, further increases in news coverage coincide with increases in Trump’s polling numbers — likely in a self-reinforcing cycle. But right before his apparent decline in the polls, there was a decline in his share of news coverage.","5331","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/29/why-is-donald-trump-declining-in-the-polls-the-media-strike-again/"

"So why is Trump’s coverage declining? At least partially responsible is a series of events that have brought other candidates into the spotlight. For example, Fiorina’s share jumped on Sept. 10 when Trump criticized her appearance, and again after the Sept. 16 debate. Rick Perry’s and Scott Walker’s shares jumped when they each dropped out of the race. Carson’s share of coverage increased after his controversial remarks about Muslims. Rubio’s share of coverage shot up when he took on Trump.","5335","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/29/why-is-donald-trump-declining-in-the-polls-the-media-strike-again/"
"Another theory would be that it’s not so much the decline in coverage but that the coverage itself became more critical. For example, both Matthew Yglesias and Jack Shafer have criticized my emphasis on news coverage by noting that coverage of Trump has often been negative. To them, it seems odd that negative coverage could help a candidate.","5336","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/29/why-is-donald-trump-declining-in-the-polls-the-media-strike-again/"
"Here’s some data that speaks to this. Crimson Hexagon codes each news story as positive, negative or neutral. So we can figure out whether stories that mention Trump are positive, negative or neutral. The graph below subtracts the percentage of stories that are positive from the percentage that are negative, comparing Trump to the average of other GOP candidates.","5337","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/29/why-is-donald-trump-declining-in-the-polls-the-media-strike-again/"
"The graph poses a few problems for the notion that the negativity of coverage should be hurting Trump. One problem, as I noted before, is that coverage of Trump isn’t so “starkly negative” (Shafer’s phrase) compared to the other candidates. It’s only somewhat more negative, at most.","5338","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/29/why-is-donald-trump-declining-in-the-polls-the-media-strike-again/"
"The second problem is that the tone of coverage mentioning Trump hasn’t changed much in the past three week.

"The third problem is that during this time period, the tone of coverage appears to matter much less than the volume.

Clinton has been well known to Democratic voters across the country as a public official for over two decades, as a First Lady, Senator, presidential candidate (the first time), Secretary of State, and, now, as a presidential candidate for the second time. Clinton’s national favorable numbers have fluctuated up and down over the years, and are currently on a downswing as she re-enters the political arena; meanwhile, it’s not surprising that her personal numbers among Democrats remain high, since she has that long history as a public official and is widely seen as the likely Dem nominee.","5366","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/14/republicans-think-donald-trump-is-trustworthy-empathetic-and-well-suited-to-presidency/"

"This may mainly reflect the fact that Trump gets a lot of media attention, so he’s getting far more exposure among Republican voters than his rivals are. That media attention regularly broadcasts images of Trump spewing vaguely Republican-sounding talking points (most of the time, anyway) about things like immigration and China (in addition to all of the insults), which could be helping to create generally positive attitudes towards him. Or perhaps Republican voters just like the show Trump is putting on as he publicly torments the GOP establishment and “tells it like it is” (a quality Republican voters keep telling reporters they admire in him).","5368","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/14/republicans-think-donald-trump-is-trustworthy-empathetic-and-well-suited-to-presidency/"

Also on the list of concerns: loss of jobs to China, cyberattacks, China's human rights record and our trade deficit.","5411","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/10/why-donald-trump-is-smart-to-talk-about-china-china-china/"
"Not included on the list is the issue that might make Hillary Rodham Clinton and her party most nervous. On Tuesday, Citigroup warned that it saw a global recession within the next few years as more likely than not -- a recession spurred by decreased demand from emerging countries including China. China's booming economy has recently shown public signs of struggling -- prompting, among other things, a precipitous two-day drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. If Chinese trade slows or the country starts getting rid of American debt, Citigroup said, there could be large effects on international markets.","5412","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/10/why-donald-trump-is-smart-to-talk-about-china-china-china/"
"Why might this make Democrats nervous? Because there's a strong link between how the economy does and the fate of the incumbent party in presidential elections. If the economy slows significantly, Americans will be more likely to vote for a Republican in 2016.","5413","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/10/why-donald-trump-is-smart-to-talk-about-china-china-china/"

"That said, Democrats view China more favorably than do Republicans. Half of Democrats view the country unfavorably, compared to 63 percent of the GOP. The GOP is also more likely to be worried about nearly all of the issues Pew asked about -- they're more worried about the debt, about cyberattacks and about the trade deficit.","5415","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/10/why-donald-trump-is-smart-to-talk-about-china-china-china/"
"Meaning that, once again, Trump's rhetoric is reinforced by after-the-fact polling. What's more, 59 percent of Republicans think that the trade deficit is a serious problem, compared to 46 percent of Democrats. That's 59 percent of Republicans who probably think we're getting beaten by China all the time.","5416","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/10/why-donald-trump-is-smart-to-talk-about-china-china-china/"
