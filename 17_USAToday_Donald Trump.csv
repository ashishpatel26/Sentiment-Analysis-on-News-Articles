"Just as Marco Rubio makes his presidential announcement, the day after Hillary Clinton launched her long-awaited ""official"" campaign announcement of her 2016 presidential candidacy, fans of the HBO fantasy epic Game of Thrones are atwitter over last night's fifth season premier. Coincidence? I think not.

"Granted, there are major differences between modern-day America and pseudo-medieval Westeros, the series' main location. In Westeros, stepping over dead bodies on your way up is a much more literal thing. In America, losers in the game of power are exiled to cushy private-sector jobs and the lecture circuit, not to a snowy, zombie-infested wasteland on the edge of the realm. And we have no public executions, except on Twitter. But surely in a larger sense, the game of power knows no place or time.","94","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"

"Ted Cruz —","96","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"A hardcore, literal-minded, combative champion of old-fashioned ways — in that regard, no one on Game of Thrones could equal the leader of the ironborn, Balon Greyjoy (father to the hapless Theon Greyjoy). Like Balon, whose folkways dictate that the only decorations he can wear are ones stripped from the bodies of slaughtered enemies, Cruz is not one to shy away from confrontation, and his detractors say he is much better-suited to fighting than governing. On the other hand, Cruz is known for verbal cleverness and smooth personality, qualities in which the senior Greyjoy is conspicuously lacking. Add a touch of Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish's smoothness and King Joffrey's penchant for shock value, and we've got our candidate.","97","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"Marco Rubio —","98","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"The young, charismatic, dynamic leader with lots of energy and pizzazz — it's got to be the sexy Baratheon brother, Renly. And the similarities don't end there! Renly was challenging his older brother Stannis in the war of succession that broke out in the show's second season and in the book series' second novel; Rubio is challenging his old mentor and friend, fellow Florida Republican and former governor Jeb Bush, in his quest for the GOP nomination. Of course, Rubio is also a man of ideas and numbers, not really Renly's strong suit as far as we can tell; then again, he never really got a shot at governance, and his (nominal) wife Margaery proved to have something of a knack for reform when she married Joffrey after Renly's unnatural demise. Who's to say they didn't have that in common?","99","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"Jeb Bush —","100","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"Obviously, the Stannis Baratheon to Rubio's Renly (minus the murder-by-witchcraft part). No one in this race could be a more consummate dynastic candidate than Jeb — who, just like Stannis, seeks the top executive post once held by his elder brother. Who's the would-be king most concerned with the defense of Westeros borders? Stannis. Who's the Republican contender who has co-written a book on the immigration wars? Jeb Bush. And then there's the faith factor. Stannis, who has converted from Westeros' dominant seven-god religion to the worship of the God of Light, makes a major point of being guided by religious zeal in his campaign. Jeb, who converted to Catholicism 20 years ago, has said that ""As it relates to making decisions as a public leader, one's faith should guide you.""","101","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"Rand Paul —","102","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"A libertarian Republican with strong pro-free market views who is also critical of national security surveillance, the war on drugs, and hawkish foreign policy, the Senator from Kentucky could have been the honorable Eddard ""Ned"" Stark of the GOP field — the man who will stand by his principles even if it kills him. But now, he has mellowed to ""libertarian-ish,"" favors increased military spending, and has not spoken up for marijuana legalization. Some libertarians are branding him a sellout. Others say he brings as much of a pro-liberty message to the contest as any viable candidate could. Let's not forget that even Ned Stark eventually tried to compromise — when it was too late. Could Rand be a Ned who lived?","103","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"Chris Christie —","104","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"As Republican governor of a blue state, Christie has to have a talent for being many things to many people. He's pro-life (a switch from his earlier views) but says he won't push that agenda. He vetoed a same-sex marriage bill but quickly stopped fighting when a court overturned that veto, and has long backed strong protections for civil unions. He warmly embraced President Obama over Hurricane Sandy disaster relief in 2012, then assailed his handling of flood insurance claims in 2014. Sound like anyone from Game of Thrones? Well, there's ruthless Roose Bolton, strong regional lord and master of navigating between the Lannisters and the Starks. Not that Christie would engineer a wedding massacre of his enemies, but his underlings did close that bridge in apparent punishment of an unsupportive mayor…What if that mayor had done something worse?","105","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"Scott Walker —","106","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"A no-nonsense chief executive known for his controversial budget-tightening policies and for quelling rebellions by public-sector unions, Walker could be the field's Tywin Lannister — the tough leader whom many hate but whose effectiveness no one can deny. (Granted, Tywin's family motto is ""A Lannister always pays his debts,"" while Wisconsin under Walker's stewardship will skip $108 million in debt payments because of the budget shortfall.) But lately, Walker's campaign has been plagued by missteps that have drawn fire from both the left and the right: dodging questions on evolution, flip-flopping on ethanol subsidies, firing a well-liked Republican campaign consultant. Maybe Walker is actually Robb Stark, the ""King in the North"" who isn't quite ready for the national stage.","107","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"

"Remember Viserys Targaryen, the obnoxious blond guy from Season 1? Daenerys's brother? The one who sold her in marriage to a nomad warlord from whom he expected help in his quest for kingship, and courted a very unpleasant fate by demanding his crown one time too many? Rather like Viserys, The Donald is all bluster and no substance: He acts like he's a contender — not to mention royalty — even though everyone in the audience knows he's doomed. Oh, and Viserys fervently believes the current leader is a usurper who doesn't have the birthright to his exalted post. Case closed.","110","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"Ben Carson —","111","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"A retired neurosurgeon, philanthropist and author, Carson is probably the nicest person among the presidential hopefuls — except that ""hopeless"" would be a far more fitting word in his case. As such, he is probably the Bran Stark of this campaign: a sympathetic character with a distant connection to the struggle for the throne (Bran is, after all, King Robb's younger brother) and zero chance of winning. Also like Bran, he has a subplot that you can skip with no real detriment to the story.","112","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"Carly Fiorina —","113","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"The former Hewlett-Packard CEO and Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, Fiorina is currently the longest shot in the field — but in an election in which the Democrats are quite likely to have a woman at the top of the ticket, she might yet surprise us all. In Game of Thrones terms, that makes her Sansa, the Stark daughter who her fans believe will somehow turn out to be the surprise winner of the big game. Sansa may have started out as a naïve spoiled child (unlike Fiorina), but she has weathered her share of disasters (not unlike Fiorina, who was forced into a tumultuous exit from HP) and started to show true political savvy.","114","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"Rick Santorum —","115","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"Yes, the former Pennsylvania Senator is eyeing another presidential run. His Game of Thrones counterpart? Beric Dondarrion, the devout warrior for faith who keeps coming back from the dead.

"Another candidacy that should be dead, but isn't. Meet the real-life version of Lady Stoneheart — in the books, the post-death persona of Catelyn Stark, murdered at the Red Wedding and revived by Dondarrion's zealots. She's back, she's badly damaged, and she's got revenge on her mind. According to Game of Thrones producers, Lady Stoneheart will not be in the series. Is this a clue that Palin will not be in the race?","118","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"
"There are, of course, more potential contenders to match to Game of Thrones and the Song of Ice and Fire books, which have a cast of characters large enough to fill seventy-page appendices. Luckily, our methods of choosing our leaders are far less violent than in Westeros. But in both cases, only one man or woman will be left standing — while a large portion of the audience will be grumbling that no one deserves to win.","119","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/13/republican-president-game-thrones-column/25673597/"

"Oklahoma and Nebraska argue that the flow of marijuana out of Colorado is hurting their states, filling their jails and clogging their court systems with offenders illegally exporting pot across state borders. In a strongly worded response, Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman said Oklahoma and Nebraska shouldn't blame Colorado for trying to regulate a substance whose use is ""staggeringly widespread.""","323","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/27/colorado-marijuana-lawsuit/70567208/"

"""At bottom, then, the plaintiff states' quarrel is not with Colorado but with the federal government's 'relaxed view of (federal) enforcement obligations under the CSA',"" Coffman argued. ""Indeed, it is Colorado's sovereignty that is at stake here: Nebraska and Oklahoma filed this case in the attempts to reach across their borders and selectively invalidate state laws with which they disagree.""","325","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/27/colorado-marijuana-lawsuit/70567208/"

"""Though federal law has long prohibited the manufacture, distribution, and use of certain drugs, states have always been on the front lines of making and enforcing drug policy, particularly as to marijuana,"" the Washington and Oregon attorneys general said. ""And in recent decades, states have been challenged to respond to changing public attitudes towards marijuana. Decades ago, the idea that marijuana had medicinal properties was a fringe view. Even more extreme was the idea of removing criminal prohibitions on marijuana use. Today, these views are commonplace.""","331","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/27/colorado-marijuana-lawsuit/70567208/"

""If they really want to stop illicit trafficking and cut enforcement costs, as they say in their lawsuit, they too will move to end prohibition one day. They should do that sooner rather than later, and in the meantime should at least stop trying to prevent other states from enacting effective, modern marijuana policies.""","333","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/27/colorado-marijuana-lawsuit/70567208/"

"So far, however, through three rounds of the World Golf Championships-Cadillac Championship, the master blaster from Kentucky is beating the field and the terrifying Blue Monster course at Trump National Doral Miami into submission.","796","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"
"Helps when you begin the tournament with a record-tying 62 on a wind-swept Thursday, which was 11.5 shots better than the field average. The round was so good you have to think that maybe you can win the tournament on the first day, especially on this course that doubles as a roadblock to comebacks.","797","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"
"It helps when you hit drives 350 yards and putt out of your mind. Now toss in an ace from 207 yards on the fourth hole using a 7-iron in Saturday's third round and it's no wonder Holmes, who talks softly and carries a big TaylorMade R15 driver, is in a prime spot to win his first WGC title.","798","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"
"On a wild and at times rainy day – Dustin Johnson also made an ace on the fourth hole with a 7-iron; there were four hole-outs for eagles on other parts of the course, and world No. 1 Rory McIlroy didn't replace the 3-iron he threw into the lake on Friday and played with 13 clubs – Holmes fired a 2-under-par 70 to open up a 5-shot lead.","799","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"
"""I'm not going to change my game plan,"" Holmes said about his big lead. ""Obviously if you're trying to catch up, you have to hit at a few more flags, but that just gets you in trouble out here. So you've just got to be patient and try to make some pars and minimize the big numbers.""","800","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"
"Through 13 holes, Holmes looked staggered and desperate and up against the ropes of trouble on the Monster, save for the ace on the fourth. But just when the course and its sharp teeth and troublesome edges seemed to have the upper hand and others at the top of the leaderboard felt they had a chance, Holmes unleashed four consecutive birdies.","801","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"
"Even with a final-hole bogey, he's 11 under and leads Johnson and Bubba Watson by five and Ryan Moore by six.","802","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"
"And he's doing this against the toughest field of the year – the top 50 are at Donald Trump's renovated palace – and on a course he doesn't exactly relish. After Friday's second round, when he hit two perfect shots on the first hole only to see the ball trickle into the water – one of four water balls during his round of 73 – Holmes talked of his displeasure with the opening hole. His thoughts on the first didn't improve on Saturday when he three-putted from 5-feet for a bogey.","803","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"
"""I hit a 350 yard drive and hit a 6 iron straight up in the air, and it landed three feet off the left edge of the green and five feet on it and it goes in the water on the right side of the green,"" Holmes said of his dealings with the first hole on Friday. ""I mean, that's not hard. That's stupid. That's unfair.""","804","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"
"But he also said he enjoys the challenge of taking on a difficult course. With his firepower, he's also confident he has an advantage on most of the field.","805","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"
"""You've got to think your way around the golf course, and it's really a ball striker's golf course,"" he said. ""And definitely there's a few holes where you can take advantage of it; if you can get the driver and get it to go over a few bunkers depending on what the wind is, definitely can be an advantage.","806","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"
"""It's a long golf course to start with.""","807","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"
"This would be Holmes' fourth PGA Tour title. There was a time it looked as if he would finish his career with just two. After winning in Phoenix in 2006 and 2008, Holmes had brain surgery in 2011 to relieve pressure caused by Chiari malformations at the base of his brain — which are structural defects in the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance and can cause problems related to headaches, coordination, dizziness and vision.","808","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"

"But this win wouldn't mean more than the others, he said, despite the huge paycheck and the years of exemptions coming his way.","811","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"
"""A win's a win, so if that happens tomorrow, then that would be great,"" he said. ""That's what you play out here for. That's what I work really hard to do. But I'm just going to go out tomorrow and control what I control and do my routines and have fun and whatever happens, happens.""","812","http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2015/03/07/jb-holmes-blue-monster-doral/24578565/"

"The case involves potentially major health and environmental benefits from the reduction of mercury and other airborne toxins — as well as potentially huge costs for power plants and, ultimately, consumers.","815","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/supreme-court-clean-air/70445030/"
"But while the Environmental Protection Agency considered the pollution problem and the potential benefits when finalizing its sweeping regulation in 2012, it did not consider costs. Therein, the rub.","816","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/supreme-court-clean-air/70445030/"
"In 1990, Congress ordered the EPA to regulate coal- and oil-fired plants if the agency considered it ""appropriate and necessary.""

"Twenty states led by Michigan, along with utility companies and the nation's coal mining association, challenged the decision to regulate mercury, arsenic and other pollutants without costs estimates.

"""I would think it's classic arbitrary and capricious agency action for an agency to command something that is outrageously expensive and ­­in which the expense vastly exceeds whatever public benefit can be achieved,"" Justice Antonin Scalia said.","819","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/supreme-court-clean-air/70445030/"
"But while the estimated annual cost of $9.6 billion is not widely disputed, the cost-benefit ratio is. Opponents say the benefits are as low as $4 million a year. Proponents say when all pollutants are considered, they're as high as $90 billion.","820","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/supreme-court-clean-air/70445030/"
"The government says the regulations will prevent premature deaths and illnesses from asthma, cancer and heart disease, as well protecting pregnant women and their unborn children whose fetal brain development can be harmed by overexposure to mercury. Environmental groups say 4,200 to 11,000 lives can be saved each year.","821","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/supreme-court-clean-air/70445030/"
"Among the losers would be coal plants, many of which are clustered in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic states, that have not improved their technology to reduce toxic emissions. Some would be forced to close, which would reduce generating capacity and raise the cost of electricity.","822","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/supreme-court-clean-air/70445030/"
"The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the mercury regulations in a 2-1 ruling in December 2013. The majority said the EPA acted reasonably when it declared the emissions hazardous and capable of being controlled. Consideration of costs, it said, could be delayed until specific standards for cutting pollution were set.","823","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/supreme-court-clean-air/70445030/"
"During Wednesday's oral argument, the court's liberal justices argued that opponents were trying to force the agency's hand before it can make sense of the cost estimates. Only later, when specific standards for pollution reduction are set, can the EPA do that, they said.","824","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/supreme-court-clean-air/70445030/"
"""The word 'appropriate,' I think, is commonly used to indicate that the expert agency will do what it finds fit, based on its expertise,"" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said.","825","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/supreme-court-clean-air/70445030/"
"But Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose vote could turn out to be pivotal, said under that standard the government could justify regulation just by pointing to the emissions.

"1. Legacy building: Stanton has plenty of political capital riding on the fate of the city's transportation ballot question facing voters in the Aug. 25 election. Expect him to make the economic case for a more robust light-rail and bus system. Stanton is urging support for the 0.7 percent sales tax — an increase over Phoenix's current 0.4 percent transportation tax that's set to expire in 2020.","1037","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/04/07/stanton-give-phoenix-state-city-speech-wednesday/25415789/"
"The tax hike would fund road repairs and an expansion of the city's light-rail and bus systems over 35 years. The $31.7 billion price tag of the plan, with local and federal funds, has been a political wedge, and critics say it unwisely spends billions on light rail. Watch to see whether Stanton directly addresses concerns about the cost.","1038","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/04/07/stanton-give-phoenix-state-city-speech-wednesday/25415789/"
"2. Playing the centrist card: In past State of the City speeches, Stanton has played to his base in the Democratic Party, emphasizing hot-button issues, from gun safety to gay rights. But Stanton's agenda has taken a more centrist turn in the past year, starting with his 2014 State of the City speech, which focused on creating an ideas-based economy. Don't expect him to check his party colors at the door, but the economy and transportation infrastructure likely will take center stage.","1039","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/04/07/stanton-give-phoenix-state-city-speech-wednesday/25415789/"

"3. Fiscal reality check: Will Stanton mention the city's troubled financial state? As pension costs soar, Phoenix projects it could face years of budget deficits starting in the 2016-17 fiscal year. The city expects a balanced budget in the upcoming fiscal year only because City Manager Ed Zuercher has proposed putting off making the city's full payments to the state public-safety pension system — a move that would cost taxpayers millions more over the long run. Stanton didn't address the city's strained finances during last year's speech. If he passes on the issue again, criticism from his opponents could be swift and sharp.","1041","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/04/07/stanton-give-phoenix-state-city-speech-wednesday/25415789/"
"4. Surprise announcements: Stanton has tried to spice up his past State of the City speeches with high-profile announcements about economic development or initiatives coming to the city. Two years ago, for example, he announced that the Police Department would conduct the largest gun buyback in Arizona history. There could be several announcements in the hopper this year, particularly as the city focuses on business recruitment and efforts to increase exports.","1042","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/04/07/stanton-give-phoenix-state-city-speech-wednesday/25415789/"
"5. Friendly shout-outs, or fiery shutouts: Watch for Stanton to heap praise on some of his City Council colleagues. Stanton is likely to have kind words for council allies, such as Daniel Valenzuela, Kate Gallego and Laura Pastor. But who he doesn't mention can say even more about the status of relations within City Hall. Also, don't be surprised if the mayor has some critical words for political leaders at the state level. As one of the most visible Democrats in the state, Stanton has often opposed the state's position on issues such as immigration, gay rights and the environment.","1043","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/04/07/stanton-give-phoenix-state-city-speech-wednesday/25415789/"

"Those pushing the case argue that language in the law limits help to pay for insurance to residents of states that have established their own health insurance exchanges.

"Still, putting something on the front burner does not guarantee it will get done. Republicans have been vowing to ""repeal and replace"" the Affordable Care Act almost since it became law in 2010.

"WASHINGTON — Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker sketched the outlines Friday of what will no doubt be the theme of his presumptive campaign for the presidency in 2016: sending money and power back to the states from the federal government.","2:47 p.m. EST January 30, 2015","1170","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/01/30/scott-walker-2016-dc/22579435/"
"Before an audience of policy wonks and reporters, Walker delivered a similar message in a well-received speech in Iowa last week. This time he ramped up his attacks on President Obama, who he accused of wanting mainly to improve the economy in Washington, whose region includes six of the top 10 richest counties in the United States.","1171","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/01/30/scott-walker-2016-dc/22579435/"
"""To me, that suggests there's a disconnect between those who want to grow government in Washington and the rest of us who want to grow the economy out with real people in cities and towns and villages all across this great country,"" Walker said. ""And so that's where 'our American revival' that we've talked about is really about transferring that power from Washington back to the people.""","1172","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/01/30/scott-walker-2016-dc/22579435/"

"On Friday, Walker called for a tougher foreign policy than Obama's, a better balance between the economy and environmental concerns and fiscal policy. It's a ""false choice,"" he said, to believe that taxes must be raised or government services slashed. Instead he said government leaders need to deliver services more efficiently.","1174","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/01/30/scott-walker-2016-dc/22579435/"

"Walker touted his roll back of bargaining rights for public worker unions in Wisconsin, which led to a labor-inspired 2012 recall effort that he fought off. He said taking people receiving government assistance and putting them into employment readiness programs has helped transform the assistance program from a ""hammock"" into a back-to-work program.","1177","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/01/30/scott-walker-2016-dc/22579435/"
"Despite all the Washington-bashing, Walker did wax romantic about the city itself as he recounted flying in Thursday and being awed by the ""beautiful"" sites on the ground below — the National Cathedral, the Kennedy Center, the Washington Monument and the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials on the National Mall.","1178","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/01/30/scott-walker-2016-dc/22579435/"
"""It's just, there's something wonderful about coming in fresh to our nation's capital, and over the years it's never, I've never, lost that — looking at those great monuments and thinking about the great leaders of our time in this country,"" he said.","1179","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/01/30/scott-walker-2016-dc/22579435/"
"But he quickly switched gears, slamming the actions of politicians and bureaucrats in the capital and hailing the experience of returning to Wisconsin and outside the ""68 square miles surrounded by reality.""","1180","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/01/30/scott-walker-2016-dc/22579435/"
"Walker did not take questions from the about 40 attendees at the American Action Forum.

"Americans may describe the billionaire businessman's behavior in many ways, but psychologists and experts told USA TODAY that textbook bullying shouldn't be one of them.

"Trump has singled out Kelly, one of the nation's most-watched cable news hosts, ever since she pointedly questioned him during a Fox News debate.

"A number of his targets have also been women. According to a 2011 column from New York Times opinion writer Gail Collins, Trump sent her a copy of one of her previous articles, in which she had taken a jab at his business record.

"• Candor. ""He says what everyone else thinks but is afraid to say because they want to be politically correct,'' says Barbara Cope of Elmwood Park, N.J., a typical Trump supporter: an older (66), more conservative Republican who feels the country's on the wrong track. ""For every candidate who is pushed and prodded by political consultants and polls,'' says Baick, who teaches at Western New England University in Springfield, Mass., ""there is a Trump sound bite not in keeping with our increasingly homogenized politics.''","1324","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"
"• Leadership. ""We're not standing up in the world, we're backing down. Other nations are laughing at us,'' says Cope. ""Obama bows to them. He apologizes. And now (immigrants) are coming here to tell us what to do. Trump is saying: Stop!'' It's an old story, says Natalie Davis, who teaches politics at Birmingham-Southern College: ""When people feel things are not going well, that politics is not delivering, that 'I have no power,' they look for an authoritarian personality.''","1325","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"
"• Independence and incorruptibility. ""Trump's not in it for the money,'' says Eugene Dunn, 52, a limo driver and Long Island Republican Party member who took his son out of school to attend Trump's candidacy announcement last month. ""He doesn't have to pander to donors, because he's paying for his campaign himself. He just wants to fix the country.''","1326","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"

"• The outsider. At a time when politicians are distrusted and Washington resented, a vote for Trump ""is a vote of no confidence in the Beltway ruling class,'' writes former insurgent GOP candidate Pat Buchanan. ""All these politicians do is talk,'' says Ron Becker, a retired small-business owner who lives in Hollywood, Fla. ""Trump will rip Washington apart. He'll get politics out of the Oval Office.''","1328","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"
"• The negotiator. Trump has used bankruptcy (four times!) to reorganize his companies and renegotiated deals with everyone from his ghost writer to his construction contractor. As president, says Dunn, he'll deal effectively with foreign rivals like the Chinese: ""He knows how they operate. We owe them a lot of money, and Trump knows how to take advantage of that. He'll play hardball.''","1329","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"
"• The populist. Trump appeals to voters threatened not only by competition from immigrant labor or foreign manufacturers, but by what Zogby calls ""the death rattle of an older, whiter America.'' To Baick, ""Trump represents the ID of Republican politics at a time when society is undergoing a transformation that may rival the '60s.''","1330","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"
"• The celebrity. Thanks to The Apprentice and years of tabloid exposure, Trump is like a character fans can root for as he battles villains like the entitled Jeb Bush or the holier-than-thou Mike Huckabee. With his scowl and bombast, he reminds Baick of a pro wrestler or a cartoon character – ''Trump as The Incredible Hulk.''","1331","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"

"• Candor makes enemies. Chronically off script — or with none to begin with — Trump ""will eventually say something destructive to his candidacy,'' predicts Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin and Marshall College Poll. But how candid is he? In his 1987 best seller, Trump: The Art of the Deal, he wrote: ""I play to people's fantasies. … A little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular."" And the website FactCheck.org cited a half-dozen statements in Trump's announcement speech that were mistaken, false or misleading.","1333","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"

Trump mocks and insults his opponents, from Mitt Romney (who he says is worth less than Trump's Gucci store) to Rosie O'Donnell, whom Trump called ""Fat little Rosie"" during a feud.","1334","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"
"• Why replace a Washington politician with a New York developer? Trump is a landlord from what some regard as America's Sodom and Gomorrah — hardly a typical recipe for national electoral success. And while he says he's running against Washington, notes Quinnipiac's Peter Brown, ""he's also running against Macy's and NBC and Univision and Serta'' — all of whom canceled business links with Trump over his immigration comments. (And on Tuesday, PGA of America announced it's moving its Grand Slam of Golf from Trump's course in Los Angeles.)","1335","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"
"• Feelings don't win elections. ""Primary season is when people get to vent their feelings,'' says Madonna, but usually they sober up and vote for someone with policies more specific than any articulated by Trump, who once wrote that he built his empire on ""intuition'' and now says he has a plan to defeat the Islamic State he can't reveal.","1336","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"
"For these and other reasons, most political analysts see Trump as this year's version of Herman Cain or Michele Bachmann four years ago — flavors of the month. (Trump was a flavor then, too; in 2011, before he decided not to run, he tied Huckabee in a CNN poll of likely Republican voters with 19%.)","1337","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"
"Even if he survives the winnowing of the 16-odd-candidate GOP field, Trump seems doomed. Brown: ""If you ask Republican voters, 'Is there someone you can't or won't support?' Trump wins that one going away.'' In Quinnipiac's Iowa poll, more than a quarter asked about Trump's candidacy said ""no way.''","1338","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"
"And that's with Trump's post-announcement bounce. In the past, he's expressed controversial views that, in the furor over his charge that many Latin Americans who enter the U.S. illegally are rapists and murders, have been overlooked: that autism is linked to vaccinations; that global warming is a hoax; that officials conspired to conceal Barack Obama's true place of birth.","1339","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"
"Trump probably can't overcome such obstacles unless he can renegotiate the laws of political science. As Paul Kirk used to say when he was chairman of the Democratic National Committee, ""You never get a second chance to make a first impression.'' Davis, the Birmingham-Southern political scientist, says it's inevitable: ""He's going to be taken down.''","1340","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2015/07/07/donald-trump-2016-presidential-race/29816483/"

"He’s right. The rise — and, for that matter, the fall, if fall it is — of Trump is an indictment of the GOP establishment and, for that matter, of the American political establishment in general. And that failure bodes poorly for the future, regardless of what happens to Trump.","1353","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/09/trump-american-ruling-class-tyranny-column/31371813/"
"Trump’s rise is, like that of his Democratic counterpart Bernie Sanders, a sign that a large number of voters don’t feel represented by more mainstream politicians. On many issues, ranging from immigration reform, which many critics view as tantamount to open borders, to bailouts for bankers, the Republican and Democratic establishments agree, while a large number (quite possibly a majority) of Americans across the political spectrum feel otherwise. But when no “respectable” figure will push these views, then less-respectable figures such as Trump or Sanders (a lifelong socialist who once wrote that women dream of gang rape, and that cervical cancer results from too few orgasms) will arise to fill the need.","1354","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/09/trump-american-ruling-class-tyranny-column/31371813/"
"But Trump and Sanders are just symptoms. The real disease is in the ruling class that takes such important subjects out of political play, in its own interest. As Angelo Codevilla wrote in an influential essay in 2010, today’s ruling class is a monoculture that has little in common with the rest of the nation:","1355","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/09/trump-american-ruling-class-tyranny-column/31371813/"
"“Never has there been so little diversity within America's upper crust. Always, in America as elsewhere, some people have been wealthier and more powerful than others. But until our own time, America's upper crust was a mixture of people who had gained prominence in a variety of ways, who drew their money and status from different sources and were not predictably of one mind on any given matter. The Boston Brahmins, the New York financiers, the land barons of California, Texas and Florida, the industrialists of Pittsburgh, the Southern aristocracy and the hardscrabble politicians who made it big in Chicago or Memphis had little contact with one another.","1356","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/09/trump-american-ruling-class-tyranny-column/31371813/"
"“Today's ruling class, from Boston to San Diego, was formed by an educational system that exposed them to the same ideas and gave them remarkably uniform guidance, as well as tastes and habits. These amount to a social canon of judgments about good and evil, complete with secular sacred history, sins (against minorities and the environment), and saints. Using the right words and avoiding the wrong ones when referring to such matters — speaking the ‘in’ language — serves as a badge of identity. Regardless of what business or profession they are in, their road up included government channels and government money because, as government has grown, its boundary with the rest of American life has become indistinct. Many began their careers in government and leveraged their way into the private sector.”","1357","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/09/trump-american-ruling-class-tyranny-column/31371813/"
"To this ruling class, the rest of the country is sometimes an annoyance or obstacle, sometimes a source of necessary funds or votes, but always the “other” — not our kind, dear. Too ignorant, too unpolished, too unconnected to the right institutions and pieties to really count. With ruling-class Republicans having more in common with ruling-class Democrats than with the people they rule, it’s unsurprising that, as Codevilla predicted in a later essay, millions of voters feel orphaned. Democracy doesn’t do much for technocratically set policy that always seems to reflect ruling-class preferences, and people feel they’ve lost control of their own fates.","1358","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/09/trump-american-ruling-class-tyranny-column/31371813/"
"Of course, orphaned voters aren’t a bug but a feature for a ruling class that would prefer to rule without them.

"So where does Trump get his 18% to 21% range? The highest number we found from any economist comes from Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland, who has argued that the ""real"" rate is ""at least 18%."" In addition to categories included in the U-6 measure, Morici counts what he calls ""the effects of immigration.""

"Trump made the misleading claim that health care premium ""costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49 and even 55%."" He's talking about proposed rate increases for 2016 for some plans on the individual market, but it's unclear whether such increases will be approved by state insurance regulators. And other plans have proposed decreases in rates, or single-digit increases that didn't have to be submitted for review.","1411","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/fact-check-donald-trump/28828017/"
"The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to submit any proposed rate increase above 10% for individual and small-group market plans to state and federal regulators for review. Insurers must publicly disclose the proposed increases and explain why they are necessary.","1412","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/fact-check-donald-trump/28828017/"
"These plans would be sold on the state and federal exchanges, as well as through insurance brokers for individuals buying their own plans.

"The average annual family-plan premium for employer-sponsored policies went up 3% from 2013 to 2014, according to the latest annual employer survey from the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research & Educational Trust. The press release on the survey noted: ""Premiums increased more slowly over the past five years than the preceding five years (26% vs. 34%) and well below the annual double-digit increases recorded in the late 1990s and early 2000s.""","1414","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/fact-check-donald-trump/28828017/"
"But the individual market is different, and how premiums can be priced has changed under the ACA. Insurers must now accept anyone who wants insurance, and they can't charge policyholders more based on health status. Plans also must cover certain minimum benefit standards.","1415","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/fact-check-donald-trump/28828017/"
"In early June, as the Associated Press explained, the federal government released the rate increase proposals for the individual market, and indeed, some of them are quite high. ""Dozens of health insurers say higher-than-expected care costs and other expenses blindsided them this year, and they're going to have to hike premiums for individual policies well-beyond 10 percent for 2016,"" the AP reported, citing a 26% increase sought by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, and about 20% increases proposed by plans in Illinois, Florida and other states.","1416","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/fact-check-donald-trump/28828017/"
"Trump cites a 55% increase, and, in fact, there are plans that have requested increases that high, and even above. In New Mexico, one Blue Cross Blue Shield plan is proposing a 65% increase; the same plan decreased its premium rate by nearly 2% for 2015. Another New Mexico BCBS plan that dropped rates by 2.37% for 2015 is seeking a 58.75% increase for next year. This information is available on HealthCare.gov, where people can search for their specific health plan to see if their insurer has proposed an increase above 10%.","1417","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/fact-check-donald-trump/28828017/"
"Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico said that ""the main driver"" of the proposed increase is that the claims were ""significantly higher than expected.""","1418","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/fact-check-donald-trump/28828017/"
"Minnesota is another state in which some plans are requesting very high increases, above 50%. Other plans in the state have proposed increases around 20% or 10%.","1419","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/fact-check-donald-trump/28828017/"
"The actual rate increases could be lower. As the AP story said, ""Regulators in many states have the power to reject price increases, and many who don't are expected to at least pressure insurers to soften their plans.""","1420","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/fact-check-donald-trump/28828017/"
"Some states, like New Mexico and Minnesota, also are experiencing more extreme proposals than others. In Ohio, for instance, only two of the 16 rate request increases exceed 20%.","1421","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/fact-check-donald-trump/28828017/"
"And, again, these proposals only include plans that are seeking increases above 10%. The Indianapolis Star published a story on June 15, showing that four of the nine insurance companies on the ACA exchange in Indiana are proposing to decrease premiums for 2016, some by double-digit percentages. Anthem of Indianapolis, which does the most business on the exchange for the state, has proposed a 3.8% rate increase.","1422","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/fact-check-donald-trump/28828017/"
"Individuals also can switch to lower-cost plans. As we wrote last year, the New York Times analyzed premium data for the exchanges for 2015 and found that many who stuck with the same plan could see increases, as high as 20%. But not if they shopped around. ""In a typical county, the price will rise 5 percent for the cheapest silver plan and 4 percent for the second cheapest,"" the Times wrote.","1423","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/fact-check-donald-trump/28828017/"

"Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, said Trump may have a ceiling of support.

"In the meantime, Nyhan said traditional Republicans must engage in a ""delicate dance"" with the maverick billionaire and his supporters.

"Donald Trump, your newly minted official Republican presidential candidate, is in one sense a godsend for the media in an era dominated by the frantic quest for page views.

"Trump released his plan in mid-August, calling for a wall to be built across the southern U.S. border (paid for by Mexico) and other measures to step up enforcement and limit immigration, both illegal and legal. Among the proposals: He says he wants to “end birthright citizenship,” saying it “remains the biggest magnet for illegal immigration.” That’s contradicted by research that shows jobs and economic opportunity are the biggest draws for those coming to the U.S. illegally.","1644","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, an independent think tank, told us that research has consistently found that economic factors are the big determinants of illegal immigration. “If you read a few hundred academic articles, I don’t think you’ll find one that identifies the desire to have children in the U.S. … as a significant factor in people’s thinking,” he said.","1645","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"Birthright citizenship refers to the fact that a child born on U.S. soil is a U.S. citizen under the Constitution, even if both of the parents are not in the country legally.

"There is ample evidence that the health of the U.S. economy, and therefore the availability of jobs, is what primarily drives immigration. The number of immigrants with illegal status has remained around 11.3 million for the past five years, according to the Pew Research Center’s Hispanic Trends project, a period of slow economic recovery. The center, a self-described “fact tank” that provides research and public opinion polling, notes that this population “dropped sharply during the Great Recession of 2007-09, mainly because of a decrease in immigration from Mexico.”","1648","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"The Migration Policy Institute has similar estimates on the number of immigrants here illegally, and its figures, too, show an ebb and flow with the economy. “During the 1990s, the unauthorized population rose substantially, doubling from 3.5 million to 7 million. It continued to increase during the 2000s, reaching a peak of 12.2 million in 2007, then fell to 11 million during and after the recession,” the institute said in an August 2015 report.","1649","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"Longtime historical trends for both legal and illegal immigration also reflect what has happened in the economy. We spoke with Audrey Singer, senior fellow at the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, about this last year, and she told us the trend in the percentage of foreign-born living in the U.S. largely mirrors job opportunities. The percentage of the population that was foreign-born was above 10% from 1860 to 1930, and then again from 2000 to 2010. The industrial revolution and high economic growth before the recent recession were the reasons, she said. The job sectors are very different, “but the root causes of immigration are very similar,” Singer said.","1650","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"If the “biggest magnet for illegal immigration” was the ability to get citizenship for a child born here, we would expect to see as many, if not more, women than men among those living in the country illegally.

"There has been an increase in the percentage of those here illegally living with U.S.-born children, going from 30% in 2000 to 38% in 2012. However, Pew attributes that to a sizable increase in the share who have lived in the U.S. long-term.

"“There’s a lot of work showing that’s partly the changing nature of border enforcement,” Rosenblum says of an increase in U.S.-born children over the last few decades. Immigrants used to come for short periods of time and return home — as in seasonal workers — but as it has become more difficult to cross the border, “that has faded in favor of permanent settlement.” There have been more families in the country illegally, too, he says as labor markets have expanded for women.","1653","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"Emily Ryo, an assistant professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California, conducts research on illegal immigration and has specifically examined why migrants decide to cross the border illegally. She told us via email that while much of her research focuses on male migrants, she also has interviewed females. “None of those female migrants have ever mentioned the desire for birthright citizenship for their children as the reason for their decision to migrate to the U.S.,” she said. “[I]nstead, lack of employment opportunities and/or violence in their home communities, and family reunification have been the most frequently cited reasons among my research subjects.”","1654","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"

"Rosenblum, at the Migration Policy Institute, told us that there’s likely a net benefit at the federal level, since immigrants here illegally would pay more in federal taxes than they would receive in federal benefits.

"The study determined that on an annual basis, the net fiscal national cost imposed by all immigrant-headed households on native households was $14.77 billion (based on New Jersey’s budget) to $20.16 billion (based on California’s). See table 6.5. Immigrants from Latin America, however, were the only ones to contribute a negative net annual fiscal impact, which offset the positive net annual impacts of Canadians, Europeans, Asians and other immigrants.

"The NRC report cautioned against a “simplistic use” of this annual estimate, noting that the demographics of the immigrant population would change over time, and, among other factors, children who were consuming services then would grow up to be tax-paying adults. Over the long run, and including the contribution of descendants, the NRC report found an overall positive impact by immigrants, an average net $80,000 for an immigrant over his or her lifetime (in 1996 dollars). “Under most scenarios, the long-run fiscal impact is strongly positive at the federal level, but substantially negative at the state and local level. The federal impact is shared evenly across the population, but these negative state and local impacts are concentrated in the few states that receive most of the immigrants,” the report said.","1665","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"

Moreover, it appears that by the second generation, immigrants have simply caught up to their native-born counterparts in respect to their offending.”","1680","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"

"Trump said that until Mexico paid for a wall across the southern border, he would, among other measures, increase fees on border crossing cards issued to Mexicans and NAFTA worker visas from Mexico, both of which he called a “major source of visa overstays.” But we could find no evidence that these were major sources of overstays.","1682","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"Robert Warren, a senior visiting fellow with the Center for Migration Studies and former director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service’s statistics division, has studied and written about unauthorized immigration for decades. He told us he doesn’t have any data on overstays due to border crossing cards or NAFTA visas. “I’m pretty certain of one thing, though,” he wrote in an email, “nobody else has any data on this, including DHS, Donald Trump, or his staff.”","1683","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"A 2014 Congressional Research Service report said that “reliable estimates of the number of nonimmigrant overstays are not available,” because the Department of Homeland Security “does not have reliable data on emigration and nonimmigrant departures.” Indeed, when we contacted DHS’ Office of Immigration Statistics, we were told that it didn’t have any statistics on visa overstays.","1684","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"However, the scant research that does exist suggests that border crossing cards have not been a major source of visa overstays in the past. That may have changed in recent years, but there’s no data to show it. With NAFTA work visas, so few are issued each year in comparison with other visas, it’s doubtful they would be a major source of overstays.","1685","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"Border crossing cards are valid for 10 years after being issued, except for some children under the age of 15. They are considered the same as a B1/B2 visitor’s visa and are issued to those with Mexican citizenship and residency, a Mexican passport, and demonstrated ties to Mexico that would compel them to return. The fee is $160 for those 15 and over. NAFTA professional work visas, which have the same fee amount, are issued to Canadian or Mexican citizens with prearranged employment in certain NAFTA professions in the United States.","1686","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"The best, and most recent, estimate on overstays appears to be a 2006 Pew Research Center fact sheet. In 2010, John Morton, assistant secretary for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, cited in congressional testimony Pew’s 2006 estimates, and a footnote to his testimony said that the Office of Immigration Statistics “agrees the Pew analysis is the best existing estimate on the visa overstay population.” The Pew Research Center told us that it did not have a more recent report.","1687","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"Pew’s 2006 fact sheet said: “As much as 45% of the total unauthorized migrant population entered the country with visas that allowed them to visit or reside in the U.S. for a limited amount of time.” Pew put the number of visa overstays, mostly for tourist or business visas, it said, at 4 million to 5.5 million for 2005. It said that those violating the terms of border crossing cards was another 250,000 to 500,000 people.","1688","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"All told that would make violators of border crossing cards 4% to 12% of all those who entered legally but now reside illegally in the U.S. At the time, Pew estimated the total unauthorized population at 11.5 million to 12 million, which is slightly larger than Pew’s current estimate of 11.3 million for 2014.","1689","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"That would indicate that the border crossing card is not a major source of visa overstays. These numbers are quite dated, but they are the best we have.","1690","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"The conservative immigration group FAIR cites a congressional study from the 1980s on its website. That study, which surveyed immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who were able to apply for legal status under a 1986 immigration law, found just 3% of them had violated the terms of a border crossing card. FAIR also notes that “there are no reliable data” on visa overstays.","1691","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"Trump said that the U.S. issues “about 1 million [border crossing cards] to Mexican nationals each year,” and that’s accurate. State Department figures show more than 1 million border crossing cards were issued annually from 2011 through 2014, with 1.2 million being issued last year. That represents most of the visas that were issued from offices in Mexico: The total number of visas issued for 2014 in Mexico was 1,484,180, according to the State Department.","1692","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"The Migration Policy Institute’s Rosenblum told us the problem with border crossing cards wasn’t technically overstays but document fraud — people will use someone else’s card to cross the border. But we “don’t know exactly how big that problem is.” Rosenblum said that the conventional wisdom was that tourist visas were a big share of overstays, and that overstayers were more likely to be non-Mexicans — Europeans, Asians and South Americans.","1693","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"As for NAFTA visas, not many are issued in comparison with other visas. In 2014, a total of 18,578 NAFTA professional visas were issued, which would include those to both Mexican and Canadian citizens. (In 2010, the number was only about 6,000.) There were a total of 9.9 million visas issued in 2014, with the largest category by far being B1/B2 tourist and business visas (6.3 million), followed by border crossing cards. This makes it highly doubtful that the small number of NAFTA visas issued would then be a “major source” of visa overstays, as Trump claimed. But, as we’ve explained, we do not have detailed or recent enough data to precisely determine the exact sources of visa overstays.","1694","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"
"The annual number of visa overstays may have dropped in recent years. The 2014 CRS report highlighted 2013studies, conducted by Robert Warren and University of Minnesota sociology professor John Robert Warren, which found that the annual number of visa overstays from 2000 to 2009 fell 73%, from 705,000 per year to 190,000 per year. They cautioned, however, that these were estimates and “[n]o direct information” on overstays was available.","1695","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/20/fact-check-donald-trump-immigration-plan/32073893/"

(Click here to watch the RedState event live) In a scathing blog post late Friday night, Erickson said that he had given a lot of latitude to Trump due to his reputation as a “blunt talker” and not being a professional politician. However, Erickson says, there is a line of decency that Trump crossed during a CNN interview Friday night with comments about Fox News commentator Megyn Kelly. “You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes,” Trump said during the Friday night prime time interview with Don Lemon. “Blood was coming out of her wherever.”","1744","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/08/donald-trump-disinvited-redstate-gathering-after-cnn-interview/31329655/"

Erickson says he has invited Kelly to attend in Trump’s place Saturday night.

"First, let's specify that Trump isn't going to be the Republican nominee. Even most Republicans say they wouldn't vote for him. But he is a magnet for cameras. He commands attention for himself and his other enterprises. Which, of course, may be the real point.","1777","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/why-it-matters-donald-trump-is-running-2016/71024880/"
"Second, he is likely to make the cut to participate in the televised debates. The key to making it into the primary debates is scoring in national polls, and that is determined in large part by name recognition. If there's one thing you can say about The Donald, Americans generally do know his name.","1778","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/why-it-matters-donald-trump-is-running-2016/71024880/"
"Third, when Trump takes positions that are frivolous or extreme, he can create complications for the others — forcing them to respond to questions about, say, whether they believe President Obama was born in the United States.","1779","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/why-it-matters-donald-trump-is-running-2016/71024880/"

"The question of which candidates warrant being taken seriously as prospective nominees is one confronting strategists, journalists and debate sponsors. Fox News, which is hosting the first GOP debate in three weeks, has announced it will limit participation to those who rank among the top 10 in national polls. That metric is likely to exclude two sitting governors and a sitting senator as well as the runner-up for the nomination last time around.","1785","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"

"Walker was considerably less well-known than other major contenders, including former Florida governor Jeb Bush (unknown by 2%), former Arkansas governor and Fox News talk-show host Mike Huckabee (1%) and even another relative newcomer, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (8%).","1790","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"

"For Trump, his skill at commanding attention by expounding extreme views may be a prime asset, but it's also contributed to his status as someone who can affect the nomination debate but not win it. Voters already have made up their minds about Trump, and two-thirds of Republicans already say they can't see themselves supporting him for president. There's a ceiling on his standing, even as the GOP field eventually gets smaller.","1792","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"
"For Walker, only one in five now say they couldn't see themselves supporting him. Among Americans generally, national polls show four or five in 10 don't know enough about the Wisconsin governor to have an opinion, favorable or otherwise.","1793","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"

"J. Ann Selzer, an Iowa-based pollster who conducts surveys for The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg News, last month unveiled a more complicated calculation to assess the standing and potential of the candidates. It weighs several factors, including whether voters choose a candidate as a first choice or a second choice and whether they could see themselves supporting him or her or not.","1795","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"
"By that measure, Bush ranked first nationwide, Rubio second and Walker third. Trump didn't make the top 10.","1796","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"
"Walker, 47, is taken seriously for reasons historic and geographic. The historic: In 2012, he became the first governor in U.S. history to survive a recall election. Liberals and labor groups launched the recall in outrage over his efforts to curb the clout of public-employee unions. His landmark victory then and re-election two years later has made him a hero to conservative activists and given him a national fundraising base.","1797","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"
"Last week, his team posted a video titled ""Recall the Recall,"" in case anybody had forgotten about it. He chose to formally announce his candidacy at the Waukesha County Expo Center, the venue where he had celebrated his recall victory.","1798","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"
"Then there's the geographic. Wisconsin shares a border with Iowa, which holds the opening caucuses early next year, and he spent part of his childhood in tiny Plainfield, Iowa, where his father was pastor at the First Baptist Church. Walker's Midwestern mien is a good fit with the Hawkeye State.","1799","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"
"He led the field in Iowa in the most recent Register poll, at 17%, with four others essentially tied for second at 9% or 10%, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Bush and Huckabee.","1800","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"
"""The reason he's considered in the top tier nationally even though he falls behind a fistful of other candidates is because he's running so strongly in Iowa for the moment,"" Selzer says of Walker. ""The most important thing a candidate can do is win something, and the first thing they can win is Iowa. We know Iowa can propel someone who's not that well-known — President Jimmy Carter — into the White House.""","1801","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"
"That said, Walker's risk is that a misstep could make his first impression among voters a negative one. He has seemed uncertain addressing foreign-policy questions, including during a trip to London in February. He was mocked for suggesting at the Conservative Political Action Conference that dealing with union protesters in Madison had prepared him to face down Islamic State terrorists.","1802","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"
"And his efforts to appeal to Iowa's social conservatives, which have included hardening his stance on immigration and same-sex marriage, have raised questions about his consistency and could complicate his efforts to reach more moderate voters down the road.","1803","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"

"Thanks to Donald Trump’s 6-page campaign immigration reform plan, two big things have changed. One is political. The other is economic.","11:44 a.m. EDT August 25, 2015","1855","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/25/presidential-candidates-trump-immigration-reform/32060331/"
"First, the pundits were proven wrong. The Trump plan is no puff piece. It’s substantive as any other candidate has produced. It educates any voter willing to click and read. It has some compelling ideas. Most are revolutionary, and some are good.","1856","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/25/presidential-candidates-trump-immigration-reform/32060331/"
"Second, anyone who thinks Trump is defining the right-wing of conservatism doesn’t understand conservatism. The real estate mogul may be a Republican, but he’s not a right winger. In fact, Trump isn’t a conservative at all. His immigration plan is deeply nationalist, unabashedly populist, and based on total faith in big government. Under Trump, the federal government will take over private labor markets. The new and improved Department of Labor will have ultimate power to tell private companies who they can hire and what wages they will pay for every occupation. Real conservatives have been fighting wage-setting for federal contractors for nearly a century, but Trump wants to take it to a whole new level.","1857","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/25/presidential-candidates-trump-immigration-reform/32060331/"
"And you thought Barack Obama’s executive action was an overreach.","1858","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/25/presidential-candidates-trump-immigration-reform/32060331/"
"The two men are similar in another way. For the past two years, the Hoover Institution has been conducting a regular survey of immigration scholars. Until the Sunday Trump's plan was released, it looked as if Obama and Trump had embraced the same immigration reform policy that 83% of experts in our survey recommend. Not deportation. Not a pathway to citizenship. And certainly not the chimera of comprehensive legislation. The policy is “legal status” for migrant workers.","1859","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/25/presidential-candidates-trump-immigration-reform/32060331/"
"Of course, White House officials won’t admit they’ve given up on a comprehensive bill because they relish the base-motivating optics of it. But facts are facts. Two weeks after the 2014 midterms, just before last Thanksgiving, the Obama administration issued executive memoranda that attempted to change immigration policy. With that move, the chimera was given up for good. But look closely at the executive actions, despite the judicial stay and their likely unconstitutional fate. On substance, none of the executive memos grant citizenship to illegal aliens, nor any kind of pathway. No, they offer legal status. And it is a temporary (3 year) legal status at that.","1860","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/25/presidential-candidates-trump-immigration-reform/32060331/"
"If undocumented immigrants were given legal status to work in the United States but not get welfare, everyone wins. Farmers and businesses get relief, and tax revenues will rise, too. The border becomes much more secure because illegal crossings for economic reasons taper off. And migrants are safe from exploitation in the shadows. The only losers are the race-baiters on the fringe right and left who are defanged.","1861","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/25/presidential-candidates-trump-immigration-reform/32060331/"
"Before his recent 6-page plan for undocumented immigrants, Trump actually said that the “good ones” should be allowed to stay. And yes, he said the words “legal status.”","1862","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/25/presidential-candidates-trump-immigration-reform/32060331/"
"So how would granting legal status actually work? Critics, including the shamelessly flip-flopping Hillary Clinton who has been on all sides of immigration debates during her public life, say that legal status amounts to second-class citizenship. But what do the immigrants think? Maybe we should ask the millions who apply every year to get non-citizenship work visas under existing programs in the United States. Has our former Secretary of State not heard of the H-1B for tech workers? The H-2A for seasonal ag workers?","1863","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/25/presidential-candidates-trump-immigration-reform/32060331/"
"The point is, of course, America already has programs that govern legal status for migrant workers. Non-citizenship legal status was granted to 9,932,480 nonimmigrant foreign tourists, businessmen and workers who come to America in 2014. Expanding that kind of status to illegal immigrants would get them registered. It would also protect them from exploitation by coyotes and corrupt businesses.","1864","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/25/presidential-candidates-trump-immigration-reform/32060331/"
"In a democracy, the quiet compromises generate more profound change than epic battles. Immigration reform seemed to be shifting from the latter to the former, as the endless fight over amnesty gave way to the quiet consensus on legal status. No longer. Hillary Clinton wants the immigration fight to go on for another eight years. And thanks to his immigration plan, Americans know three words that will never describe Trump. Quiet. Pragmatic. Conservative.","1865","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/25/presidential-candidates-trump-immigration-reform/32060331/"

"So that actually happened. Tuesday night, Donald Trump threw one of the world’s most influential Latin-American journalists out of his news conference. After Univision anchor Jorge Ramos stood and began questioning The Donald about his immigration proposals, Trump responded, “Excuse me … you weren’t called. … Sit down … sit down.” When Ramos continued speaking, Trump said, “No, you don’t. You haven’t been called. Go back to Univision.” A security guard then removed Ramos from the news conference.","5:22 p.m. EDT August 26, 2015","1904","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/trumps-ejects-ramos-news-conference-column/32395979/"
"This unbelievable scene has already created a firestorm in mainstream and Spanish-language news media — and rightly so. Even for him, Trump’s disrespect for Ramos was shocking. Most important, it will only ensure endless headaches for the GOP as the party tries to move beyond the summer of Trump.","1905","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/trumps-ejects-ramos-news-conference-column/32395979/"
"It is difficult to understate the importance of Ramos in the Hispanic community. He has been profiled by The New York Times and called “the Walter Cronkite of Latino America” by NPR. He is the face of Univision, the fifth largest TV network in the country. He hosts a nightly newscast that has been known to beat the ratings of the major three English-language news shows. He also helms a Sunday morning political show (Al Punto) and a show on the cable network Fusion. During the 2012 election, he hosted separate sit-down interviews with both President Obama and Mitt Romney. None of this, apparently, matters to Trump. Seeing him dismiss a man trusted and admired by millions of Hispanic Americans was a distasteful display of the GOP front-runner’s callous, boorish nature. If anyone needed reminding that Trump is far from presidential, that moment has arrived. Again.","1906","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/trumps-ejects-ramos-news-conference-column/32395979/"
"After Ramos was ejected from the news conference, Trump proceeded to malign him with a tired stereotype. Trump referred to Ramos as “obviously a very emotional person,” although he admitted that he did not know him. This remark plays to the cliché that Latinos are hot-tempered and ignores the reality that Ramos was courteous (if dogged) in his line of questioning. He was doing his job as a journalist.","1907","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/trumps-ejects-ramos-news-conference-column/32395979/"
"Trump’s snapping, “Go back to Univision,” carries echoes of the loaded phrase “go back to where you came from.” Yet coming from the man who has called Mexican immigrants “rapists” and made insulting remarks about Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, we shouldn’t really be surprised. At this point, the only question regarding Trump’s behavior is: How low can he go?","1908","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/trumps-ejects-ramos-news-conference-column/32395979/"
"At this bizarre news conference, Trump claimed that he enjoyed tremendous support from Latinos. “Do you know how many Latinos work for me? Do you know how many Hispanics are working for me?” he said. “They love me.” Aside from the obvious fact that working for someone does not necessarily equate to loving — let alone voting for — him, Trump is delusional. In a Gallup poll of U.S. Hispanics out this week, Trump scored the highest net negative of any of the Republican 2016 contenders, a staggering minus 51. Similarly, a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Telemundo poll found that 75% of Hispanics had a negative view of Trump.","1909","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/trumps-ejects-ramos-news-conference-column/32395979/"
"Trump eventually let Ramos back into his news conference and engaged in a back-and-forth debate with him on Trump's immigration plan. But the damage was done. The takeaway from this event was Trump’s wholly unacceptable treatment of a distinguished Latino newsman. This is nothing short of a disaster for the Republican Party, which desperately needs a rebranding among Hispanics. Consider that one prominent Latino polling firm has estimated that whoever the GOP nominee is, he or she will have to win over more Hispanic voters than ever before.","1910","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/trumps-ejects-ramos-news-conference-column/32395979/"
"Sure, this was Trump’s news conference, and he had the right to run it as he pleased. He probably doesn’t care how badly this plays among a growing demographic. However, if he doesn’t, the Republican Party should. When Trump insults Hispanics, it is deeply personal to us. Whether he is denigrating the higher (Ramos) or the lower (“illegals”) among us, we all are aware of the ugly sentiments behind such comments and actions. Now is the time for the other presidential candidates to denounce Trump in no uncertain terms — and quickly. And does Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus still believe that Trump has been “a net positive” for his party?","1911","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/trumps-ejects-ramos-news-conference-column/32395979/"

"The controversy exploded July 18 when Trump, the celebrity real-estate titan, told an Iowa audience that McCain is “a war hero because he was captured” and that Trump likes “people that weren’t captured.” McCain earlier had stoked the feud by telling the New Yorker magazine that Trump had “fired up the crazies” at his July 11 rally in downtown Phoenix.","2016","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/politics/2015/07/25/john-mccain-interview/30649917/"

"ANSWER: “He said I haven’t done a, quote, damn thing. Look, we have 28 veterans a day who commit suicide, OK? At the behest of the families, we did the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act. He said the legislation that we passed was, I believe he said was a disaster. The vote was 93 to 3 on the VA reform bill that I worked with Senator (Bernie) Sanders on. We have pending, generally speaking, 600 veterans cases per day that we are working on for veterans from all over America. Usually, when any issue comes before us from someone who lives outside of Arizona, we refer it to the senator from that state. Veterans issues? Anybody in America who’s got a problem, we take on that case. We have five staff people whose only job is to handle veterans issues. Probably the most heart-warming thing about this whole fiasco is that my fellow POWs and veterans, all over America, we are hearing from in a flood of calls, e-mails and letters. That’s the state of affairs, and that’s what it is, and any allegation that somehow veterans are not wholeheartedly behind me does not bear scrutiny. As I’ve said before, on (MSNBC’s) ‘Morning Joe,’ I guess, he doesn’t owe me an apology. I’m in the arena. But he does owe an apology to every single veteran who was captured and was a prisoner of war.","2020","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/politics/2015/07/25/john-mccain-interview/30649917/"

"A: “It is, and it’s our responsibility, too, to pass legislation that would help to fix the problems that the executive branch, obviously, isn’t fixing. And that’s why the major aspect of this legislation we passed is the Choice Card, so that veterans who live a certain distance away from a VA facility can have a card so that they go to the health-care provider of their choice. In Arizona, it’s particularly relevant. And, by the way, the VA is fighting that every step of the way. You know, they had this cost overrun at this hospital up in Denver: a $1.7 billion cost overrun. Guess where they wanted to take the money from to make up for that?

"A: “Especially in Arizona. Because we do not have secure borders. There are people in the southern part of our state, ranchers, who have people crossing their border every night. That is the reason why we had to fix it. I campaigned on fixing it the last time around, and that’s why I passed with seven others, Republicans and Democrats, a solution. That solution was to spend six-and-a-half billion dollars on border security, guarantee 20,000 additional Border Patrol, and achieve a goal of 90 percent effective control of our border. That was the (2013 ‘Gang of Eight’) legislation we passed. I could not force the House of Representatives to act. I think it was a terrific mistake that they didn’t act. But as a senator, I said that I would get legislation passed that would secure the border.

And that’s one of the major reasons why sanctuary cities are absolutely, totally, unconstitutional and, if allowed to continue, could lead to anarchy.

"From following the news, you’d think that immigration was strictly a U.S. problem, one brought to the fore by Donald Trump. But although Trump has certainly moved the debate to a new level here at home, other parts of the world are facing an immigration crisis that is, if anything, worse. And there are lessons in that.","1:36 p.m. EDT August 26, 2015","2055","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/open-borders-europe-migrants-column/32333153/"
"The European Union, for example, is now beset with a flood of “migrants,” mostly from Africa and the Middle East. Some of them are fleeing war and civil strife; others are heading for a place with more economic opportunity — or, at least, with welfare benefits that dwarf what they could earn at home through hard work.","2056","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/open-borders-europe-migrants-column/32333153/"
"Most of Europe operates under what’s called the Schengen Agreement, which abolished border controls among 26 European nations. Once within the Schengen Area, “any person, irrespective of nationality, may cross the internal borders without being subjected to border checks.”","2057","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/open-borders-europe-migrants-column/32333153/"
"This worked tolerably well for a while, but now, with hundreds of thousands (maybe millions) of migrants in Europe or on the way, some European nations are beginning to have second thoughts. These have redoubled in the wake of last weeks attempted terrorist attack on a Paris to Amsterdam train, staged by a supposed Moroccan migrant. Although the European Union has so far ruled out any change to the Schengen agreement, officials from France, Germany and Belgium are talking about changes. The problem is that, right now, once migrants get into the EU, they can easily travel to where benefits are the highest, overwhelming locals. Germany, the most popular destination, is straining to accommodate all the arrivals. It’s reached the point that a German mayor, Boris Palmer, is talking about seizing private homes to accommodate migrants, a measure that is about as popular among citizens as you might expect.","2058","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/open-borders-europe-migrants-column/32333153/"
"One nation that isn’t part of the Schengen Agreement is Britain; to get from the rest of Europe into Britain you still have to show a passport and (depending on your home country) a visa. This policy, combined with Britain’s better economy, has led to refugees piling up across the Channel in France. Refugee camps (The New Republic refers to a migrant “jungle”) have bloomed in Calais, where the Channel Tunnel connects to Britain, and migrants have rioted, broken into trucks, and stowed away on trains in an effort to get to the English promised land.","2059","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/open-borders-europe-migrants-column/32333153/"
"This has led the British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, to suggest that they need to be sent home. With the gap in living standards between Europe and Africa, Hammond said, the motivation to migrate would otherwise be insuperable. (Histories of the 19th-century colonial era talk about “Europe’s scramble for Africa.” That has led wags, such as Ross Douthat, to talk about today in terms of ""Africa’s scramble for Europe."" In both cases, the motivation is money.)","2060","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/open-borders-europe-migrants-column/32333153/"
"Meanwhile, as Americans talk of a border fence, Bulgaria is building one, with razor wire and steel 12 feet high. And Slovakia is flat-out refusing to accept Muslim migrants, viewing them as dangerous and destabilizing. Migrants have massed at the Macedonian border and are creating tensions between Serbia and Hungary. Hungary is building a fence too. Norwegian politicians are suggesting that Norway should do something similar to Australia, which is sending unwelcome refugees to New Guinea or to prison.","2061","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/open-borders-europe-migrants-column/32333153/"
"As the numbers of migrants climb, and countries become weary of accommodating them, expect these tensions to grow.","2062","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/open-borders-europe-migrants-column/32333153/"
"So it’s good news and bad news. The good news is that immigration concerns aren’t just a problem for the United States. The bad news is that they’re a problem for the entire First World. What to do about it? Nobody seems sure. But although open borders are a nice idea, the fact is that countries differ in economics, in culture and in politics. No country can accept and assimilate an unlimited number of outsiders, and when the number exceeds a threshold, a backlash is certain. Thresholds are being exceeded, and backlashes are building, all over the world.","2063","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/open-borders-europe-migrants-column/32333153/"
"So it’s not just Trump. America, like the rest of the world, will have to decide what it wants to do about the fact that more people want to live here than we can accept. It is simple political reality that the problem can’t be ignored forever.","2064","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/26/open-borders-europe-migrants-column/32333153/"

"In a dozen interviews with likely Iowa voters — a number of them conducted in a Walmart parking lot outside Des Moines — many pointed to his general leadership attributes, including a tell-it-like-it-is style and business acumen.

"Yet in a Nov. 10 debate in Milwaukee, Trump went beyond opposing an increase in the hourly rate, arguing that wages are too high and that U.S. workers just “have to work really hard” to elevate themselves.

"For a few years, a bipartisan polling team has been conducting focus groups of Walmart moms.

"An immediate boost for the lowest-earning workers seems to speak directly to these concerns.

"Like Harkins, Linda Storms, a Republican voter from Des Moines, supports a $3-per-hour minimum wage increase. Yet, she said, Trump’s immigration stance is more important to creating jobs.

It's doubtful that she sees the danger in that sort of assumption: In the less and less unlikely event that Trump is the Republican nominee, she might as easily become the joke and he the epochal figure — an idea, however ridiculous, whose time has come.","2506","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2015/09/04/wolff-theres-one-obvious-trump-slayer/71634682/"
"Trump's rise as political variable and media superstar is as contrast gainer to a set of people whose legitimacy and authenticity is undermined by their unwillingness or inability to express the central force that transparently motivates them, their own desperate ambition. That is, of course, the precise attribute that Trump most revels in. Trump is honest Abe, and all others are out-of-touch dissemblers.","2507","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2015/09/04/wolff-theres-one-obvious-trump-slayer/71634682/"
"None more so than Hillary. It is a part of our shared understanding of the modern world that both Bill and Hillary represent one of the most naked, cutthroat, unreconstructed examples of succeed-or-die ambition in our time. Bill Clinton has accounted for this in his public persona — he's the flawed striver in need of constant love. But Hillary has been in constant public denial of her essential and obvious nature. That has always made her look suspect and occasionally sinister — and not a little unhappy, too.","2508","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2015/09/04/wolff-theres-one-obvious-trump-slayer/71634682/"

"That may be the Trump accomplishment. He's transformed the fundamental assumption that American politicians have to be everyday Joes into a truer acknowledgement that they are egomaniacs, dour or joyful. He has altered the premise that a position on the issues — no matter how dull, rote and insincere, or how passionately held — means you stand for something, to a higher order in which your singularity and audacity, even your cruelty, mean you have the mettle to stand for something (even if we don't know what it is).","2510","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2015/09/04/wolff-theres-one-obvious-trump-slayer/71634682/"

"Those who lived through the Great Depression held a lifelong aversion to borrowing. To the extent this is a good thing – banking and credit crises were rare in the decades after – harsh bankruptcy laws kept people out of trouble. Truman never waded back into debt-fueled life.

"And no one should want borrowers who are able to pay their debts to walk away because it's convenient, like we saw in the housing crash. Companies owned by private equity firms do this, too. Lenders can price in the odds of a business failing. It's far more difficult to price in the odds of greed exploiting a loophole. And the cost is ultimately paid by more honorable borrowers. Strict laws here make a lot of sense.","2659","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2015/11/20/donald-trump-harry-truman-and-how-bankruptcy-has-changed/76129568/"
"But every smart invention was the result of an experiment, not all of which are successful. For capitalism to work, the whole system – entrepreneurs, investors, bankers, consumers – has to accept that failure is not only an option, but desirable. We're doing something terribly wrong if lots of companies aren't going down in flames each year, and something far worse if we're not giving their former owners a second chance. A forgiving bankruptcy code helps that process. There's a positive correlation between loose bankruptcy laws and entrepreneurship. So much of why America innovates better than other countries is because we accept that a failed business doesn't mean a failed person, or even a failed idea. Everyone gets a second shot. And that's a great thing.","2660","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2015/11/20/donald-trump-harry-truman-and-how-bankruptcy-has-changed/76129568/"

"Trump called GOP strategist Karl Rove “dopey,” conservative activist Erick Erickson “a major sleaze and buffoon” and Republican pollster Frank Luntz a “clown” and “low-class slob.” As for Fox News’ Megyn Kelly, he retweeted a follower who called her a “bimbo,” he said she “bombed” and her show, “The Kelly File,” was better without her.","3133","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/04/republican-rep-reid-ribble-assails-trump-carnival-says-gop-candidates-should-ignore-him/71719146/"
