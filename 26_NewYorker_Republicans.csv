"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s planned speech to Congress on Iran has been widely criticized, in Israel and in the United States. The unimportant criticism focusses on the way the event was concocted: House Speaker John Boehner and Ron Dermer, the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., planned it in secret for weeks, then sprang it on the State Department and White House (which gave Dermer an opening to blame the Speaker’s office “for not notifying” the Administration). President Obama has declined to meet with Netanyahu; Secretary of State John Kerry has not condescended to meet with Dermer. The speech is scheduled for March 3rd, two weeks before the Israeli election, and will coincide with the yearly mega-conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), where Netanyahu, as in past years, will be received as a champion.","February 4, 2015","10","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"

"The more important criticism of Boehner’s invitation rests on a fiction: that Netanyahu, the leader of an embattled ally, must depend on bipartisan American support for his country to confront its regional enemies. Netanyahu, in this story, has been reckless in making common cause with Republicans, a move that has inadvertently strengthened Obama’s hand in opposing a new Iran-sanctions bill. Democratic senators who had indicated support for the bill—which its largely Republican sponsors had hoped to pass over Obama’s objections, while negotiations with Iran are still ongoing—are now rallying to the President. Obama now almost certainly has enough votes to prevent an override of his veto, should it come to that. Vice-President Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Minority Leader of the House, are hinting that they and many other Democrats may not even show up for Netanyahu’s speech. The moral of this story, presumably, is that the U.S. and Israel have distinct interests when it comes to Iran, and that both Netanyahu and his Republican hosts have erred in trying to blur them. Above all, they should not have defied a sitting President, who has the constitutional authority to manage foreign policy.","12","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"Some of the commentators you’d most expect to support Netanyahu have expressed shock at the planned speech (although they sound a little like Captain Renault discovering gambling at Rick’s Café). Fox News’s Chris Wallace complained, “For Netanyahu to come here and side with Boehner against Obama on Iran seems to me like very dicey politics.” Jeffrey Goldberg, who made the case for the imminence of Iranian nuclear capacity, is now skeptical: “His recent actions suggest he doesn’t quite know what he’s doing.” Other new Netanyahu critics believe that he does. Dan Margalit, most often a Netanyahu cheerleader at the tabloid Israel Hayom, told Israel’s Channel 10 that Netanyahu’s “trip is not being taken for the sake of the interests of the state of Israel—rather for the needs of Benjamin Netanyahu and the Likud, for the Likud election campaign.” According to these observers, Netanyahu is injecting partisanship into what should be a bipartisan issue in both Israel and the United States, and is doing harm to Israel by showing the American Presidency disrespect.","13","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"There is a measure of truth to this story, but it obscures a more significant reality. In their wars of ideas and political networks, Netanyahu’s Likud and his American supporters are an integral part of the Republican Party’s camp, and Israel is too involved in the American political landscape and defense establishment for Netanyahu to be considered as distant as a foreign leader. Netanyahu and Obama are at odds not only diplomatically, in their positions on Iran, but in their affiliated political parties and overarching strategic visions. Dermer once worked for the Republican strategist Frank Luntz; before moving to Israel, he helped to design the Contract With America. Netanyahu has been a member of the Republicans’ neoconservative circle since the Reagan years; when I interviewed him in 1998, during his first term as Prime Minister, he took up the first ten minutes reading me a column by Charles Krauthammer.","14","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"Before the 2012 U.S. election, Netanyahu received Mitt Romney in Jerusalem in a series of encounters arranged by his adviser Dan Senor, once a spokesman for George W. Bush’s Iraq czar, L. Paul Bremer, and the co-author of a gushing book about Israel’s entrepreneurial economy. These encounters were clearly calculated to undermine the President’s reëlection efforts. Netanyahu, moreover, openly solicits financial support from Sheldon Adelson, who is estimated to have donated at least a hundred million dollars to Romney’s electoral efforts, and who has spent tens of millions subsidizing the freely distributed Israel Hayom, which boosts Netanyahu and tears down his opponents. Netanyahu may fancy himself a Winston Churchill, warning the U.S. about Hitler’s threat to Britain. Instead, all this makes you wonder if he isn’t more like Texas Governor Rick Perry, warning about the threat posed to his state by the President’s executive order on immigration.","15","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"AIPAC has historically prided itself on fostering bipartisanship, and its conference in March will feature Democratic and Administration officials eager to remain in its good graces. (AIPAC members distribute roughly twenty-five million dollars in campaign contributions.) But, as Connie Bruck reported in the magazine last fall, its ability to present support for Netanyahu’s government as a bipartisan issue has been compromised. Polls by J Street, an advocacy group founded, in 2008, as a liberal counterbalance to AIPAC, have shown that seventy per cent of American Jews persist in voting Democratic, and that about an equal number would be open to Obama pressuring Israel, as well as Palestinians, to reach an agreement. Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told me that when he advanced negotiations with Mahmoud Abbas, AIPAC worked to undermine him. AIPAC is now sponsoring an effort to cut funding to the Palestinian Authority, on the grounds that Abbas’s efforts to force Hamas to join a unity government make him complicit with the group.","16","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"AIPAC itself isn’t fully responsible for its conservative tilt, J Street President Jeremy Ben-Ami told me. “What you have here is a group of partisan operatives, only loosely affiliated with AIPAC,” Ben-Ami said. “They are pulling threads that bind the Republicans and the Likud together.” “By simply echoing successive Likud governments that call for toughness and that engage in anti-Palestinian rhetoric,” AIPAC has ended up “in opposition to Obama and a good part of the Democratic Party, lining up with Republican policies, regardless of partisan intent.”","17","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"Netanyahu’s invitation to speak before Congress has precipitated a crisis with the White House, but the clarity it offers comes as a relief. The strategic conflict is not between American and Israeli interests but rather between rival conceptions of how the two countries should exert and coördinate their respective national powers, the United States globally, and Israel regionally. Each conception has organized advocates in each country—roughly, the Likud with Republicans and Israeli center-left parties with Democrats. One leftist Israeli party is petitioning the election commission to prevent Netanyahu’s speech from being broadcast.","18","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"Obama has kept Netanyahu from bombing Iran, but their differences have hardly been resolved. Increasingly, these conform to party lines. Obama and Kerry take what Steven Simon, the former senior director for Middle East and North Africa affairs in the Obama White House, has called a classically realist approach to global affairs. “Obama was both willing to deal with Egyptian President Morsi and also refused to label his overthrow as a coup, subordinating his concerns about Egyptian domestic political arrangements to a strategic concern for regional stability,” Simon told me. Similarly, the realist move for Israel, with regard to the Palestinian territories, would be to strike a deal that reduces the risk of their being inflamed by neighboring conflicts. Obama, Kerry, and many Democrats are joined in these views not only by Labor Party and centrist leaders but also by former Mossad leaders Efraim Halevy, Meir Dagan, and Amiram Levin, and by Yuval Diskin and Yaakov Perry, former heads of the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency.","19","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"Simon adds that Obama’s realism is reflected in his management of the Iranian threat, which isn’t popular in Netanyahu’s circle but is certainly understood by many Israelis. All Israelis are insistent that Iran’s proxy Hezbollah not threaten Israeli positions on the Golan Heights. But, on the question of how to respond to Iran’s nuclear program, there are differences of degree. Realists generally suppose that the value of nuclear weapons lies in deterring their use by others; they don’t consider them useful for much else, although, Simon added, “One cannot be sure that Iranian officials will think them valueless during the period when they adjust to having them.” In fact, Iran may be emboldened to act rashly, believing that its nuclear capability gives it some sort of immunity against a punishing conventional response from Israel, which could spin out of control. Obama’s repeated assertions that the U.S. would not permit Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon reflect this concern.","20","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"Obama seems sincerely determined to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear capacity, which would trigger a regional arms race. Unlike Netanyahu and the Republicans, however, he wants to play out the negotiations without undermining his interlocutors’ standing with Iranian hardliners. He knows that the other side has hardliners—that is, an internal politics to which he needs to be sensitive. He obviously supposes, but cannot be so undiplomatic as to say, that the best way to lower the flame under Iran’s nuclear program, and eventually to undermine the regime’s Islamist xenophobia, is to penetrate the country with Western investment (as happened in China in the seventies). Netanyahu says that he is adamantly against Iran gaining a “threshold” capability. Obama, reasonably, is less concerned. He knows that he has the military means to prevent an Iranian bomb, even at the eleventh hour. Why bring things to the point of war before it becomes absolutely necessary?","21","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"“I think there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says, unless you adopt an unwavering, pro-Likud approach to Israel, that you are anti-Israel—and that can’t be the measure of our friendship,” Obama told a Cleveland audience in 2008. He has not said anything so sharp since then. What’s stopping him now? The Netanyahu speech has brought the Likud alliance with the Republicans into the open, and to his doorstep. Why shouldn’t the Obama Administration and the Democratic leadership make their alliance with Netanyahu’s opponents just as plain?","22","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"
"The Israeli election is six weeks away, tight as a drum, and will be decided by unaffiliated and not very subtle voters. As I wrote in December, Netanyahu is stoking swing voters’ fear of Arab enmity. His chief opponents, Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, are provoking their concern about global isolation and wrecked relations with Washington. Hezbollah and Hamas are inadvertently helping Netanyahu. Are not Obama, Kerry, and the Democrats—by holding to the fiction of bipartisanship, and refusing to embrace European initiatives to pressure Netanyahu’s benighted government—unnecessarily doing the same?","23","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans"

"Friday’s employment report for January confirmed what has been clear to objective observers since the middle of last year: the American economy is growing strongly, with employers creating jobs at a healthy clip in most major industries. As always, one month’s figures shouldn’t be overemphasized: the payroll number is a volatile data series with a large standard error. But the longer-term trends, which even out month-to-month variation, are also very positive.","February 6, 2015","48","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"After revising its payroll estimates upward for November and December, the Labor Department now reckons that the economy has created about three hundred and thirty-six thousand jobs a month, on average, since the end of October. In the past year, job growth has averaged more than two hundred and thirty thousand jobs a month; today there are about 3.2 million more Americans working than there were this time last year. Compared to January of 2013, there are about 5.6 million more jobs.","49","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"

"Given the lacklustre rates of job growth that we saw in the early stages of recovering from the 2007–09 recession and in the recovery from the dot-com bust of 2000–01, under the Bush Administration, that’s quite an achievement. Employment growth is “astonishingly strong,” Ian Shepherdson, a Wall Street economist, commented.","51","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"So, what does all this mean?","52","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"For Americans looking for work—and with the unemployment rate at 5.7 per cent, there are still nine million of them—it’s obviously a welcome development. It’s also good news for people with jobs. More vacancies means more competition for workers, which should eventually lead to a sustained increase in wages. Indeed, contrary to popular perception, wages are already rising more than prices. Not by much, it is true, but in the year leading up to January, according to the Labor Department, average hourly earnings in outside the farm sector rose by 2.2 per cent. With energy prices falling, the over-all rate of consumer price inflation is just 0.8 per cent.","53","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"For investors, the immediate issue is what the job figures imply for Federal Reserve policy. (The obvious and correct answer is that it makes an early rise in interest rates somewhat more likely.) For economists, there is the tricky task of reconciling the surge in employment with the latest G.D.P. report, which showed the rate of economic growth slowing down a bit during the last three months of 2014. (My guess is that the G.D.P. figures will be revised upward.)","54","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"As for the political implications: What impact will a stronger economy have on the 2016 Presidential election?","55","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"History (and James Carville) teaches us that it is likely to be a big one. If healthy employment growth continues throughout this year—which is a big if, to be sure—the G.O.P. will be robbed of one of the most potent arguments any political party challenging for power can have: that the incumbents have screwed up the economy. Should trends continue, 2016 could end up looking more like 1988, when George H. W. Bush scored a third successive victory for the Republicans, or 2000, when the Democrats, under Al Gore, won the popular vote for the third time in row. And it would look a lot less like 2008, when John McCain, burdened by a recession, failed to pull off a party three-peat.","56","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"To oversimplify things a bit, Bush, Sr., and Gore both promised voters more of the same, but with a different face in the White House. In 2008, with the economy in recession, McCain didn’t have the option of running on his predecessor’s domestic legacy, and he had great difficulty articulating a coherent alternative. Of course, many other factors affected the race, including George W. Bush’s disastrous war in Iraq and McCain’s shortcomings as a candidate, but the comatose economy was a big burden on the Republicans, just as it would be on the Democrats in 2016 if job growth were still lagging.","57","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"A buoyant economy changes the whole environment. If Hillary Clinton (assuming she gets the Democratic nomination) can wholeheartedly embrace President Obama’s domestic record rather than have to equivocate and point out what, if anything, she would have done differently, her task will be much easier. The Democrats aren’t there yet, but things are going in the right direction for them, and the improved economic situation is already having an impact on public opinion.","58","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"During the past few months, there has been a notable uptick in Presidential Obama’s approval rating. The numbers vary from survey to survey, but the Real Clear Politics poll average shows Obama’s rating rising from a low of 41.3 per cent in October to a high of 46.2 per cent on February 2nd. One or two individual polls have seen the President hit fifty per cent. If the economic news stays positive, the upward move will almost certainly continue. “Americans’ ratings of Obama appear to be catching up with their improved economic views,” Gallup’s Lydia Saad noted.","59","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"The economic argument shouldn’t be pushed too far, however. In 1988, Bush, Sr., was facing an uninspiring opponent in Michael Dukakis. In 2000, Gore, for all his success in winning the popular vote, still lost the election (with the assistance of the Supreme Court). Plus, the electoral environment is changing. A new update from Gallup shows that Americans are more polarized than ever where the Presidency is concerned. The gap in Obama’s approval rating among Republicans and Democrats has averaged seventy per cent, higher than George W. Bush’s average of sixty-one per cent, Clinton’s fifty-six, and Reagan’s fifty-two. Come 2016, there may be fewer centrist voters who will cast their ballots on the basis of their own material welfare.","60","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"

"The brief apparition of a third Mitt Romney Presidential bid vanished last Friday, with a conference call to several of his supporters. “You can’t imagine how hard it is for Ann and me to step aside,” Romney told them. He added that he thought he would have won the Republican nomination again, and that he’d had the “best chance,” this time, to win the Presidency. There was a surprising reason for this optimism, which he had alluded to a couple of weeks earlier, during a speech at the Republican National Committee’s winter meeting, on board the U.S.S. Midway. Despite his previous campaigns, people had not come to know the real Mitt Romney. He had been seen “as a business guy and a political guy.” Neither of those identities had worked—perhaps, although he didn’t say so, because they weren’t consistent with each other or with his record. Ann Romney, however, saw how he had “served as a pastor for a congregation and for groups of congregations,” a reference to his work as a lay bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If voters didn’t know this side of him, it was largely because he and his advisers had treated his Mormon faith as a liability, hardly to be spoken of, in part out of fear that it would alienate evangelicals in the Party’s base. But now Romney seemed ready to be the religious guy. “That’s the authentic Mitt,” a family friend in Utah told the Washington Post. The report added that members of Romney’s political circle “said they are considering making Salt Lake City, the cradle of Mormonism, his 2016 campaign headquarters.”","65","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"As it turned out, Romney’s faith and his sense of mission may have been most useful in explaining why he’d entertained the idea of what even many Republicans saw as an exercise in futility. Yet one aspect of it is worth examining further, owing to its implications for his Party. In his R.N.C. speech, Romney mentioned his pastoral work “with people who are very poor, to get them help and subsistence,” and he said that Republicans had to position themselves as opponents of inequality if they were to win the White House. He may be right, but it will be hard for the G.O.P. to shake the sense that Romney was being more true to his party’s principles three years ago when he said, of the so-called forty-seven per cent, “I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.” This is a Republican dilemma, not a Mormon one.","66","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"Indeed, other potential G.O.P. candidates are now having to recalculate how another religion figures into the equation. There has never been a Catholic Republican nominee for the White House (the Mormons, interestingly, got there first), although there may be one this year, with a field that includes Rick Santorum, Chris Christie, and Jeb Bush, who converted to Catholicism, his wife’s faith, some twenty years ago. For them, the issue is not one of religious bigotry, such as John F. Kennedy faced in his 1960 campaign, with insinuations of adherence to secret Papist instructions. In a way, it’s the opposite: the very public agenda of the all too authentic Pope Francis.","67","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"Early signs of trouble came in the summer of 2013, when the new Pope, speaking with reporters about gays in the Church, asked, “Who am I to judge?” The conservative wing of the Party had relied on his predecessors to do just that. Then he proved much less reticent about issuing a verdict on capitalism. In an apostolic exhortation issued at the end of 2013, he labelled trickle-down economic theories “crude and naïve.” The problems of the poor, he said, had to be “radically resolved by rejecting the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and by attacking the structural causes of inequality.” That went quite a ways beyond the sort of tepid proposals for job creation and “family formation” that Romney made on the Midway, and the response from Republicans has involved a certain amount of rationalization. “The guy is from Argentina—they haven’t had real capitalism,” Paul Ryan, Romney’s former running mate, and a Catholic, said.","68","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"“It’s sometimes very difficult to listen to the Pope,” Santorum noted last month, after Francis, in remarks about “responsible parenting”—widely interpreted as an opening for a discussion on family planning—said that there was no need for Catholics to be “like rabbits.” Santorum echoed Ryan’s suggestion that Argentine exceptionalism might be at work: “I don’t know what the Pope was referring to there. Maybe he’s speaking to people in the Third World.” On that front, when it emerged that Francis had been instrumental in the diplomatic breakthrough with Cuba, Jeb Bush criticized the deal, and Senator Marco Rubio, also a Catholic, said that he’d like the Pope to “take up the cause of freedom and democracy.”","69","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"As if all that weren’t enough, His Holiness is preparing an encyclical on climate change, to be released in advance of his visit to the United States later this year. In January, he said of global warming, “For the most part, it is man who continuously slaps down nature.” Stephen Moore, of the Heritage Foundation, has written, “On the environment, the pope has allied himself with the far left.” Actually, Francis is very much in the center in terms of scientific opinion, but the leading potential G.O.P. contenders, with the possible exception of Christie, sit somewhere on the climate-change-denial-passivity spectrum—Jeb Bush has said that he is a “skeptic” as to whether the problem is man-made.","70","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"In recent decades, liberal Catholic politicians were the ones with a papal problem; both Mario Cuomo and John Kerry had to reckon with the prospect of excommunication for their support of abortion-rights laws. John Paul II, meanwhile, was a favorite of conservatives; despite his often subtle views, he became at times little more than a symbol of anti-Communism and a certain set of social strictures. He cemented an alliance, in the political realm, between conservative Catholics and evangelicals. (Rubio also attends an evangelical church.) Abortion was a significant part of that story. By contrast, the Franciscan moment will push some Republican candidates to make decisions and to have conversations that they would rather avoid.","71","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"It will also offer a chance to address the knotty American idea that faith is an incontrovertible component of political authenticity. (Why is the Romney who thinks about God the “real” one?) The corollary should be that nothing is as inauthentic as faith that is only opportunistically professed, something that this Pope, who has extended a hand to atheists, seems to know. Still, the campaign will be defined not by theological questions but by political ones, prominent among them inequality and climate change. Both can have spiritual dimensions and speak to moral issues, such as our obligations to one another. But neither can be solved by faith alone. ♦","72","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"“Republicans, when they’re backed into a corner, their natural tendency is to call for tax cuts. I’ve been thinking for a while that that’s the way that this campaign is going to go,” says The New Yorker staff writer John Cassidy. Cassidy joins fellow staff writer Jeffrey Toobin and host Dorothy Wickenden on this week’s Political Scene podcast to talk about the House Republicans’ proposed budget and the coming debates over the economy. They discuss the G.O.P.’s arguments for repealing the Affordable Care Act, consider the Earned Income Tax Credit program as a bipartisan method of tackling poverty, and talk about Hillary Clinton’s still undeclared political positions in the 2016 election. “Especially compared to, say, Barack Obama, in 2008, where you knew that he was running on health care and ending the war in Iraq, it’s pretty opaque at this point what Hillary Clinton’s agenda is,” says Toobin.","March 19, 2015","73","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-political-scene-the-republican-budget"

"President Obama was in Ohio on Wednesday, and, let’s be up front about this, he sounded a little cocky. Speaking at the City Club of Cleveland, he had some fun at the expense of his Republican critics and their alarmist predictions about the disastrous impact his policies would have on the U.S. economy.","March 19, 2015","75","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"“One Republican in Congress warned our policies would diminish employment and diminish stock prices. Diminish stock prices,” the President said, summoning his most dismissive tone. “The stock market has doubled since I came into office. Corporate profits are—corporate balance sheets are stronger than they have ever been—because of my terrible business policies.” At this point, Obama was interrupted by laughter, but he was only getting started. “One Republican senator claimed we faced trillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see,” he went on. “Another predicted my reëlection would spike gas prices to $6.60 a gallon. I don’t know how he came up with that figure: $6.60.”","76","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"The President didn’t pause to point out that, since late last year, gas prices have been below $2.50 in many parts of the country. He was too busy jabbing at Mitt Romney and John Boehner. “My opponent in that last election pledged that he could bring down the unemployment rate to six per cent by 2016—next year,” Obama said. “It’s 5.5 now. And right here in Cleveland, the leader of the House Republicans—a good friend of mine—he captured his party’s economic theories by critiquing mine with a very simple question: ‘Where are the jobs?’ he said. ‘Where are the jobs?’ I’m sure there was a headline in the Plain Dealer or one of the papers—‘Where Are the Jobs?’ ”","77","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"The answer, of course, is that they are being created at a rate not seen since the late nineteen-nineties, which just happens to be the last time a Democrat occupied the White House. Since 2010, twelve million new jobs have been created—Obama didn’t omit to cite that figure—and the unemployment rate has dropped from 9.9 per cent to 5.5 per cent. And that’s not the end of it.","78","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"Even accounting for the roughly five million jobs that were lost during the Great Recession and its aftermath, about seven million more Americans now have work than when the President took office, in January, 2009. The budget deficit sits at 2.8 per cent of G.D.P., less than it was in the last year of the Bush Administration, when it was 3.1 per cent. Stock prices and corporate profits, as Obama pointed out, have never been higher. To be sure, he didn’t create the surge in U.S. energy production that prompted Saudi Arabia to let the price of oil plummet, thereby putting smiles on the faces of American motorists. But nor did he do anything to prevent it, despite calls from environmentalists to do so. Republican claims that his policies would send gas prices soaring turned out to be wrong, and it was fair for Obama to remind people of that fact.","79","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"In short, the President has earned his lap of honor, even if he is taking it a bit early. He seemed to speak with a purpose that went beyond grandstanding, though, which came through when he called out Republicans for their dogged refusal to move with the times. “Their theory does not change,” he said. “It really doesn’t. It’s a theory that says, ‘If we do little more than just cut taxes for those at the very top, if we strip out regulations and let special interests write their own rules, prosperity trickles down to the rest of us.’ ”","80","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"Perhaps Obama was laying it on a bit thick. But in highlighting Republican obstreperousness, he was also highlighting the political reality in Washington and laying down some foundations for the 2016 Presidential race. For all the talk of a new generation of “reformicons” emerging within the G.O.P. to advocate for new thinking on economic policy, and despite some Republican politicians acknowledging that they need to have something to say about income stagnation and rising inequality, the bulk of the Party—and that includes most its candidates for 2016—seems to be stuck in a Reaganite time warp.","81","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"Exhibit A: Jeb Bush. Speaking in Detroit last month, the former Florida governor made an early pitch to middle-class voters, saying, “Far too many Americans live on the edge of economic ruin. And many more feel like they’re stuck in place: Working longer, and harder, even as they’re losing ground.” But Bush didn’t present any new policy proposals, and, speaking in South Carolina on Tuesday, he said he’s in favor of abolishing the federal minimum wage, arguing that the existence of a national wage floor makes it “harder and harder for the first rung of the ladder to be reached, particularly for young people, particularly for people that have less education.”","82","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"Now, declaring opposition to minimum-wage laws—or proposing leaving them to the states, which seems to be what Bush is calling for—isn’t an outlandish position for a G.O.P. Presidential candidate to take. Indeed, ever since 1962, when Milton Friedman argued, in his book “Capitalism and Freedom,” that the consequences of minimum-wage laws “are precisely the opposite of those intended by the men of good will who support it,” this has been a point of agreement among conservative Republicans. But that’s Obama’s point: The Republicans don’t change. They just reheat the old sauce.","83","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"Exhibit B: the new House G.O.P. budget, which, its sponsors say, would balance the budget in ten years. I won’t bore you with the details of this measure, which, on Thursday, got the approval of the Budget Committee. But take it from me, or, rather from Howard Gleckman, an analyst at the non-partisan Tax Policy Center: “It is impossible.”","84","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"That means it’s mathematically impossible, not politically impossible—although, with Obama in the White House, it’s that too. The new proposal incorporates big tax cuts skewed toward the rich, unspecified cuts in spending, flaky revenue estimates, and a massive and implausible overhaul of Medicaid and Medicare—not to mention the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. It closely resembles previous Republican budgets that weren’t serious tax-and-spending proposals either, but broad political manifestoes hewed out of the tattered old doctrine of supply-side economics.","85","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"In his speech in Cleveland, Obama made fun of this, too. He recalled how one Republican had told him that “she couldn’t agree with me more that we need to be helping working moms and dads more. Another wrote a policy memo saying that Republicans must define themselves as the party of the American worker, the party of higher wages.” The problem the Republicans have, the President went on, is that “the rhetoric doesn’t match the reality. The walk doesn’t sync up with the talk. And all you have to do is look at the budget that House Republicans put forward just yesterday,” which “doubles-down on trickle down.”","86","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"

Speaking in Detroit last month, Jeb Bush said, “Far too many Americans live on the edge of economic ruin, and many more feel like they’re stuck in place, working longer and harder, even as they’re losing ground.” According to numerous reports, Bush is now working toward an economic plan, in anticipation of his expected run for the G.O.P.

"In certain Republican quarters, there is even talk of the Party downplaying its commitment to trickle-down economics: the old mantra of cutting taxes, primarily on the rich. “Bush and any other Republican running needs to do a better job … of talking about economic issues in a very different way than Republicans have in the past,” Tony Fratto, a deputy press secretary in George W. Bush’s Administration, told Politico’s Ben White. “If you go to Americans and ask them what their greatest fears are, they won’t say it’s that their taxes are too high. They will talk about things like technology removing the need for hands-on workers and their children not receiving the skills and education to allow them to compete in the global economy.”","90","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"A few Republicans have put forth some actual proposals to address inequality, such as Senator Marco Rubio’s idea to convert the earned-income tax credit, one of the few redistributive programs that enjoys bipartisan support, into a universal subsidy for low-wage workers. One of the shortcomings of the earned-income credit is that it is targeted to low-income families; low-paid workers who don’t have children receive much smaller credits. Rubio’s reform could conceivably address this problem. But still, whenever I hear talk that the Republicans intend to tackle inequality, I can’t help thinking of Deep Throat’s adage: follow the money.","91","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"As E. J. Dionne, Jr., has pointed out, in the journal Democracy, Rubio’s wage-subsidy proposal would be far more interesting if the senator would explain how he would pay for it without hurting the current beneficiaries of the earned-income tax credit. More broadly, it is difficult to take seriously the idea that the Republican Party is changing its ways when its elected officials are simultaneously seeking to bestow more tax cuts on the richest of the rich and slash programs aimed at the poor and the middle class.","92","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"On Wednesday, the G.O.P.-dominated House Ways and Means Committee voted to repeal the federal estate tax, which Republicans have, for years, been labelling a “death tax” that ravages the bequests of ordinary Americans. “This tax doesn’t just hit the big guy,” the committee’s chairman, Paul Ryan, said. “It hits the little guy—like the small business and the family farm.”","93","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"The facts? Since George W. Bush entered office, in 2001, the estate tax has already been reformed several times, and it now applies only to inheritances valued at more than $5.4 million. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, in 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, about 0.2 per cent of estates—that’s two in a thousand, or fewer than four thousand estates in total—owed the estate tax. As Congressman Jim McDermott, a Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee, pointed out, “You cannot call twenty-three-thousand acres a family farm.” A repeal of the estate tax, he said, would amount to a “massive unfunded tax break” for the very wealthiest people in the country. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the move will raise the budget deficit by about two hundred and seventy billion dollars over the next ten years.","94","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"On the same day that this attempted exercise in upward income redistribution was going on in Ryan’s committee, just down the hall, in the main chamber of the House, Republican representatives were approving a new budget that, according to its primary sponsor, Tom Price, the chairman of the Budget Committee, would balance the budget within ten years, primarily by cutting expenditures by nearly $5.5 trillion, as compared with the projected costs of current policies. Who would be most hurt by those spending reductions? You guessed it.","95","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"An analysis by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that more than two-thirds of the proposed spending cuts would come from programs that serve low-income and middle-income Americans. Almost three trillion dollars (yes, trillion) would be saved by repealing Obamacare, which provides income-based subsidies for the purchase of private insurance plans, and by slashing funding for Medicaid, the federal health-care system for the poor, which would be converted to a block-grant program and handed over to the states. The Price budget would also cut spending on food stamps by more than a third between 2021 and 2025. It would allow some existing tax credits for low-income and middle-income families to expire over the next few years. And it would significantly reduce funding for Pell Grants, which help students from families of modest means to afford college.","96","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"In one sense, of course, none of this congressional maneuvering matters. As long as a Democrat occupies the White House, there’s practically no chance that G.O.P. spending cuts will be enacted, marking the Price budget as more of a political wish list than an actual funding bill. But wish lists matter, too, especially for a Party that is supposedly trying to change its public image. And in 2015, it seems, the most that the Republicans can hope for is to shower more gifts on the wealthiest households in America, while depriving poor families of health care, food stamps, and college tuition.","97","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"

With Ross sitting beside him, Fennebresque insisted, in effect, that he had been fired for no reason. Ross had been successful in every way, he told reporters: “exemplary” in his handling of recent athletic scandals, and a model of “work ethic” and “perfect integrity.” “There was no precipitating event,” Fennebresque, who looked by turns mournful and defensive during the twenty-minute exchange, said. “He’s been wonderful.”","March 19, 2015","98","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-politics-at-the-university-of-north-carolina"

Ross, a former judge, once headed the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation, a major funder of progressive causes in North Carolina. Since Republicans, many of them affiliated with the Tea Party movement, took over the North Carolina General Assembly in 2010, the board of governors has become a Republican redoubt.

"For several years, there have been indications that the state’s new leaders want to change the mission of public higher education in North Carolina. In 2013, the Republican governor, Pat McCrory, told William Bennett, a conservative talk-show host and former Secretary of Education, that the state shouldn’t “subsidize” courses in gender studies or Swahili (that is, offer them at public universities). The following year, he laid out his agenda in a speech at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Using the language of business schools, he urged his audience to “reform and adapt the U.N.C. brand to the ever-changing competitive environment of the twenty-first century” and to “[hone] in on skills and subjects employers need.” McCrory also had a warning for faculty members whose subjects could be understood as political: “Our universities should not be used to indoctrinate our students to become liberals or conservatives, but should teach a diversity of opinions which will allow our future leaders to decide for themselves.”","101","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-politics-at-the-university-of-north-carolina"
"On February 27th, the board, which had conducted a five-month-long review of all two hundred and forty centers and institutes at U.N.C., voted to eliminate three of them. Although the board has legal authority to govern U.N.C. as it sees fit, university policy and tradition had reserved this sort of decision for the schools. One of the closed centers was dedicated to the environment, another to voter engagement. The third, which many faculty members describe as the real target, was the Center on Poverty, Work, and Opportunity, run by Gene Nichol, a law professor and a vituperative critic of the Republican legislature. In one of a series of opinion pieces criticizing spending cuts, published in Raleigh’s News & Observer, he had referred to the legislature’s “unforgivable war on poor people.” Nichol has no doubt that the closing of the center was intended as punishment. On several occasions, “my dean was compelled to call me into his office and relate threats received from Republican leaders of the General Assembly if I didn’t stop writing articles for the News & Observer,” he wrote in an e-mail. “The center would be closed, or I’d be fired.”","102","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-politics-at-the-university-of-north-carolina"
"Nichol, who has tenure, still holds his teaching position, and more than a hundred faculty members have signed a statement supporting him, but both the closing of his center and Ross’s dismissal have created an atmosphere of anxiety and caution. “People are telling me not to use their work e-mail, to call on their cell phone, if we’re going to talk about anything controversial,” Tamar Birckhead, an associate professor at the law school, told me. An untenured member of the humanities faculty, who requested anonymity, wrote in an e-mail, “I am constantly aware of the state’s charged political atmosphere and the scrutiny of the university’s political enemies. I know there are certain subjects I simply cannot write about in a public forum and topics I must handle gingerly in my teaching.” Other faculty members spoke of receiving phone calls from legislators and requests to review syllabi from conservative advocacy groups. Donald Raleigh, a history professor, said that one of those groups, the John William Pope Center for Higher Education Policy, requested the syllabus for his course “Gorbachev, the Collapse of the Soviet Union, and the Rise of the New Russia.” The syllabus was freely available online, but the Pope Center wrote to the university legal office to request it under the state’s open-records law. “I really don’t know why they wanted the syllabus for this fairly conventional course, nor do I know what they did with it,” Raleigh said.","103","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-politics-at-the-university-of-north-carolina"
"Republican politics in North Carolina are characterized by a tight interweaving of elected officials with think tanks and advocacy groups. At the center of this network is Art Pope, who funds the Pope Center for Higher Education as well as several other conservative think tanks. Pope, a discount-store magnate, with his family reportedly gave almost a quarter of a million dollars in support of North Carolina Republican candidates in the 2010 election; advocacy groups with close ties to Pope gave more than two million dollars to those candidates. (Jane Mayer wrote about Pope’s political activism for the magazine in 2011.) After Pope’s family donated a reported two hundred and nineteen thousand dollars to Republican candidates and political groups in 2012, and his companies gave a reported four hundred and fifty thousand dollars, contributing to the party’s takeover of the governorship and the state legislature, Pope served as co-chair of Governor McCrory’s transition team and then as his budget director. Pope, who has served as a board member of Americans for Prosperity, is also a link between North Carolina’s Republican Party and leading national conservatives.","104","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-politics-at-the-university-of-north-carolina"
"The Pope Center defines its mission as to “increase the diversity of ideas” on campus and “encourage respect for the institutions that underlie economic prosperity,” including “private property,” “competition,” and “limits on government.” It also deplores, as McCrory did in his speech at Chapel Hill, that “universities allow teaching to become shallow and trendy, failing to challenge students intellectually and disparaging traditional principles of justice, ethics, and liberal education.” Much of the center’s work is producing strategic documents setting out a conservative model of higher education.","105","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-politics-at-the-university-of-north-carolina"
"The most interesting Pope Center materials sketch a two-pronged attack on public higher education as currently practiced. On the one hand, Pope Center researchers say that higher education should be regarded as an economic good like any other, and that low tuition rates “subsidize” it and distort the market. Based on this theory, the Pope Center argues for raising tuition in the U.N.C. system and shifting public funding to tuition grants for students attending private colleges, eroding the distinction between public and private institutions. Of course, increasing the financial burden on students in the U.N.C. system would likely cause them to cluster in safe pre-professional majors. This would be just fine, according to higher education’s market reformers, because those are the programs that provide returns on investment. (The Pope Center declined to comment on its reports for this piece.)","106","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-politics-at-the-university-of-north-carolina"
"The other reformist front is a call to revive the Great Books model of humanities education: literature and philosophy as a source of eternal truths, dating back to Plato, passing through John Locke, and perfected by Ayn Rand and the libertarian economist Friedrich Hayek. A Pope Center research paper published this year describes a “renewal in the university” through privately funded programs dedicated to teaching the great books untainted by relativism. The report devotes a great deal of attention to programs dedicated to “the morality of capitalism,” which have been founded at sixty-two public and private colleges and universities. Many of these programs, which are often housed within business schools or economics or political science departments, were funded over the past fifteen years by North Carolina-based BB&T Bank, under its former president John Allison, who is now the C.E.O. of the Cato Institute. In a 2012 statement, Allison explained that he funded the programs to “retake the universities” from “statist/collectivist ideas.” He also noted that training students in the morality of capitalism is “clearly in our shareholders’ long-term best interest.”","107","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-politics-at-the-university-of-north-carolina"
"The Cato Institute recently hosted a forum on the private donors’ so-called “renewal” agenda, featuring Jay Schalin, the author of the Pope Center report, along with the former BB&T president John Allison and C. Bradley Thompson, the director of the BB&T-funded Institute for the Study of Capitalism at Clemson University. Thompson was eager to emphasize the role that donor-funded teaching programs like his play in the conservative movement. “I meet too many very smart businessmen and women who are giving millions of dollars every year to political candidates, and I have to ask the question ‘How has that worked out for you?’ And the answer has to be, ‘It hasn’t worked out very well at all,’” he said.","108","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-politics-at-the-university-of-north-carolina"
"Once a round of supportive laughter died down, Thompson continued, “If they really want to change the culture long-term in this country, it’s not going to happen through politics.

"Some version of a cost-benefit calculus for learning is inevitable in a precarious economy with expensive, debt-funded education. But to reconceive of public universities as the meeting place of two markets—students investing in their own “human capital” and private investors looking to influence curricula—is another thing altogether. The point of humanities education is to foster independent, critical thought and broad historical perspective, both in students and in university culture. A successful humanities education makes the obvious questionable and shows that the present is neither eternal nor inevitable. These are not goals designed to pass market tests or bend to the ideologies of wealthy donors.","110","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-politics-at-the-university-of-north-carolina"
"After decades of funding cuts, rising tuition, and growing economic inequality, the old idea of higher education would be under pressure even if universities were not political targets. A twenty-first-century version of the idea that education is more a public good than a private investment will not arise without a politics behind it. Recent protests against tuition increases at the University of California and student-debt strikes by graduates of for-profit institutions are the merest glimmer of what those politics might look like. At the University of California, student protesters have hoisted signs reading, “Education is a right.” The new fights over public universities will help to determine whether education will in fact be a right, a privilege, or, as John Allison and others would have it, a commodity to be bought and sold by students and donors alike.","111","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-politics-at-the-university-of-north-carolina"
"Forty-seven senators, all of them Republicans, have sent a letter to Tehran that might be summarized this way: Dear Iran, Please don’t agree to halt your nuclear-weapons program, because we don’t like Barack Obama and, anyway, he’ll be gone soon. That may be shorthand, but it is not an exaggeration of either the tone or the intent of the letter, which was signed by the Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, as well as John McCain, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul. The signature drive was organized by Senator Tom Cotton. He is a thirty-seven-year-old Republican, who entered the Senate two months ago, from the state of Arkansas. Senators, as the letter helpfully informs the Iranians—this is an actual quote—“may serve an unlimited number of 6-year terms. As applied today, for instance, President Obama will leave office in January 2017, while most of us will remain in office well beyond then—perhaps decades.” (Or, of course, a third of the Senate could be voted out every two years.)","March 9, 2015","112","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/congress-letter-iran-nuclear-negotiations-netanyahu"

"The letter opens, “It has come to our attention while observing your nuclear negotiations with our government that you may not fully understand our constitutional system.” As the letter writers tell it, “The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen, and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time.” It is a bit more complicated than that: Presidents can make commitments that are difficult to get out of (unless one wants to provoke a crisis), and Congress, instead of just being able to merrily modify, has to deal with things like vetoes. What is more extraordinary is the intent behind this tinny civics lesson—to tell a foreign power, one with which the United States is at odds, not to listen to the American President.","114","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/congress-letter-iran-nuclear-negotiations-netanyahu"
"What is the source of the crying need that certain members of Congress, particularly Republicans, feel to make sure that everybody, and every last mullah, knows that they are much more important than some guy named Barack Obama? One pictures Tom Cotton walking through the streets of Montreux, where John Kerry, the Secretary of State, has been doing his best to negotiate a deal that will keep Iran from getting the bomb, asking random strangers with briefcases, “Don’t you know who I am?” Iran and the United States have been in an intimate, often hostile embrace for half a century. The Iranians have been watching us pretty closely, through coups and revolutions and wars and hostage negotiations and the imposition of sanctions. (I wrote about the current talks, which resume this Sunday, in the magazine this week.) The Iranians were adept enough in their knowledge of American electoral politics to time the release of the American Embassy hostages, in January, 1981, to Ronald Reagan’s completion of his Inaugural Address. (Split screens in the news coverage showed a tired-looking Jimmy Carter, who had actually negotiated the deal, on the phone, while Nancy Reagan waved at the crowd.) They probably know that they would be signing an executive agreement, not a treaty that the Senate would ratify.","115","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/congress-letter-iran-nuclear-negotiations-netanyahu"
"Indeed, Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian Foreign Minister, said that the letter has “no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy.” He added that he found it “interesting” that certain groups should be so opposed to a deal that “they resort to unconventional methods, unprecedented in diplomatic history.”","116","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/congress-letter-iran-nuclear-negotiations-netanyahu"
"Is that the reaction that the Republicans were hoping for? Perhaps they don’t care if the United States is embarrassed in front of the other members of the U.N. Security Council—which, along with Germany, are the parties to the talks—as long as they have something that they can boast about on Fox News. The prospect of Iran getting a nuclear bomb is a grave threat to world peace. The Obama Administration, which is trying to stop that from happening, has only a certain number of cards to play, and yet the Republicans are doing whatever they can to weaken its hand. (Their rationale is that key provisions of the deal on the table would reportedly last for only ten or fifteen years—even though a decade is a lot longer than the possible alternative of no years between now and an Iranian drive to build a bomb.) As with the invitation that John Boehner, the Speaker of the House, extended to Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, to speak before Congress, it is not clear whether the primary impetus has to do with foreign policy or with partisan theatrics. Is the intention to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, without regard for the ugliness that it brings to our politics? Or is it to humiliate and insult President Obama, no matter the cost to the goal of nuclear nonproliferation—even if it means another bomb in the world?","117","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/congress-letter-iran-nuclear-negotiations-netanyahu"
"By issuing a preliminary injunction blocking President Obama’s new immigration policy just a couple of days before it was due to go into effect, Judge Andrew S. Hanen, a conservative George W. Bush appointee who sits on a federal court in Brownsville, Texas, has dented the hopes of millions of undocumented aliens and turned himself into a hero of the right.","February 17, 2015","118","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"“President Obama abdicated his responsibility to uphold the United States Constitution when he attempted to circumvent the laws passed by Congress via executive fiat, and Judge Hanen’s decision rightly stops the President’s overreach in its tracks,” Greg Abbott, the new Republican governor of Texas, said in a statement hailing the ruling. “The District Court’s ruling is very clear—it prevents the President from implementing the policies in ‘any and all aspects.’ ” Late last year, when Abbott was serving as the state attorney general, he filed a lawsuit in which Texas and sixteen other states challenged the President’s announcement that the federal government would no longer seek to deport undocumented parents of children born in the United States—a policy shift that would have lifted the threat of forced removal from about four million people. (The number of states involved in the suit eventually rose to twenty-six, mostly G.O.P. run.) Ted Cruz, the junior senator from Texas, echoed Abbott’s comments, saying, “The Texas court decision … is a major turning point in the fight to stop Obama’s lawless amnesty…. Last summer, we saw a humanitarian crisis on our southern border that was a direct consequence of Obama’s previous amnesty. Republicans are now standing together to try to insure that it never happens again.”","119","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"

"If that last sentence was a shout-out to Judge Hanen, who was appointed to the bench in 2002, it was surely justified. Known in Texas as a vigorous enforcer of immigration laws, Hanen, contrary to Abbott’s suggestion, was careful not to get drawn into the question of whether President Obama has the constitutional authority to enact a big change in immigration policy without the approval of Congress. As I pointed out when Obama initially announced the plan, last November, most legal experts believed that the White House was on firm ground, constitutionally speaking.","121","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"Rather than ruling on whether Obama violated the Constitution, Hanen based his opinion, which runs to a hundred and twenty-three pages, on a much narrower issue: Did the Department of Homeland Security, in preparing to enact the President’s policy change, fully follow the laws governing the introduction of important new administrative rules by federal agencies? No, Hanen said, and argued that by failing to provide for a public comment period about the new deportation procedures, in which interested parties could register their support or their concerns, the department had violated the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. Therefore, the new procedures had to be halted before they went into effect.","122","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"On the basis of this narrow ruling, immigration policy is now on hold for an indefinite period. The Administration’s appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, could take many months to resolve, and whichever way that court rules the case may well go all the way to the Supreme Court. If D.H.S. decides to hold public hearings about the new policy, as Hanen says it should have done, it could take up to a year.","123","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"In Washington, where every day provides another opportunity to wage partisan warfare, twelve months is an eternity. The ruling had barely been issued when attention shifted to the battle du jour, which just happens to be over immigration reform and the funding of the Department of Homeland Security. Fearful that the new rules about deportations would go into effect before Hanen or anybody else had a chance to stop them, the Republicans have been threatening to defund the entire department unless the new funding bill includes measures designed to gut immigration reforms. Democrats, relying on a filibuster, have refused to allow such a proposal to advance.","124","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"On the basis of what passes for common sense outside the Beltway, you might suspect that the Republicans, once Judge Hanen had done their work for them, would declare victory and move onto other issues. But no. “We will continue to follow the case as it moves through the legal process,” Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. “Hopefully, Senate Democrats who claim to oppose this executive overreach will now let the Senate begin debate on a bill to fund the Homeland Security department.” Translated into English, this means that Republicans are still threatening to close down the department at the end of next week if they don’t get their way. Or, in the words of Ted Cruz, “At a time when we face grave national-security threats, at home and abroad, it is the height of irresponsibility for the Democrats to block this funding in an extreme attempt to save Obama’s amnesty, which a federal judge has just declared illegal.”","125","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"Only in the upside-down world of Washington does refusing to accept “you win” as an answer make sense. Boehner may have been reëlected handily at the start of the year, but he still needs the support of rank-and-file G.O.P. members, many of whom campaigned vigorously against any suggestion of amnesty for the undocumented. Just a few weeks into a new term, the Speaker can’t risk being outflanked on the right. And so it’s onward into battle.","126","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"It barely needs saying that, from a longer-term perspective, the Republicans’ attitude toward immigration policy is mightily self-destructive. If they shut down the Department of Homeland Security, an arm of government that a Republican President created to protect the citizenry from terrorist attacks, the public backlash will be immediate and savage. And if Republicans, in the months ahead, stick with a posture toward undocumented immigrants that Hispanics and other minority groups perceive as unremittingly hostile, they will be gravely undermining their prospects in 2016. The hopes of the Democratic candidate, whether it is Hillary Clinton or somebody else, rest on getting a big turnout. And in Hispanic areas, there is no surer way of generating a big turnout than by stoking concerns about immigration policy.","127","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"Many Republicans know this, of course. Jeb Bush, reacting to Judge Hanen’s ruling on his Facebook page (which serves as the principal communication vehicle for his nascent campaign), sought to shift the blame to Obama, accusing him of overstepping his authority and failing the leadership test. “The millions of families affected across the country deserve better,” Bush said. “Now, more than ever, we need President Obama to work with Congress to secure the border and fix our broken immigration system.”","128","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"The G.O.P. front-runner will need to do better than that. Back in June, 2013, the Senate, with the encouragement and involvement of the White House, passed a comprehensive immigration bill that had the support of fourteen Republicans, including John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Marco Rubio. The legislation included funds for twenty thousand new border-patrol agents and seven hundred miles of electric fencing. And it provided a convoluted, thirteen-year pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who could show that they had obeyed the law and paid their taxes. It died in the House of Representatives, and eventually the White House looked for a way to do an end-run around Congress.","129","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"If Boehner and his colleagues resurrected and passed the Senate bill tomorrow, Obama would sign it in an instant. It’s not going to happen, of course, and that’s why Hanen’s ruling, although it has given Republicans something to cheer about, could end up helping to deprive them of the White House. If the new deportation system were to go into effect as planned, it would have been up and running for more than eighteen months come Election Day, and there wouldn’t have been any real prospect of it being reversed. Like Obamacare, another Republican hate object, it would have become a fact on the ground.","130","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"

"One of the ironies of the Republican takeover of the Senate is that it has made President Barack Obama more of a central player in Washington’s legislative debates than he had been before. In the last Congress, when the House was under Republican control and Democrats ran the Senate, the House Republicans easily passed dozens of bills on party-line votes that were then ignored by the Senate. When the Senate occasionally mustered the ability to advance legislation, the House repaid the favor.

"Obama learned that publicly campaigning for the few bills that did have some life, like comprehensive immigration reform, actually made them less likely to pass. At one point during the immigration debate, Democratic senators begged Obama not to make a high-profile speech on the issue. And so, increasingly, he remained publicly absent from the negotiations. Nobody was really in charge and nothing got done: it was the least productive Congress in modern history.","133","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"

"The lines of authority are a little clearer now, even if John Boehner, the Speaker of the House, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, have the continuing challenge of dealing with their right flanks. They also have a strong incentive to work together to move legislation: going into 2016, they want to show that the G.O.P. is unified and capable of governing. But after those bills pass both chambers, they will reach Obama’s desk. Obama and his veto have replaced Harry Reid, who has now been reduced to the role of minority leader, as the crucial blocking tool for Democrats.","135","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"The first test of whether this new dynamic will lead to a more productive Congress comes this week, with the debate over Keystone XL, the Canadian pipeline project that has been mired in political controversy for six years. Republicans in both the House and Senate declared that approving Keystone XL, which would carry oil from Alberta, Canada, to U.S. refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, would be their first order of business, and the House approved its version of the legislation on Friday afternoon.","136","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"At first glance, it’s absurd that approval of a Canadian corporation’s pipeline project is the new Republican Congress’s highest priority. The benefit to the U.S. economy from the construction of the pipeline would be modest—a few thousand temporary jobs created during its construction and a few dozen permanent jobs once it’s up and running. Republicans have long argued that the pipeline would help reduce fuel prices, a tenuous claim that is now beside the point because the price of a gallon of gas is at a five-year low.","137","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"Still, there is a scenario in which Boehner and McConnell’s decision to start with Keystone might be encouraging. The Obama Administration immediately announced that the President would veto the legislation. But the veto statement was silent on the merits of the project itself. Obama simply objected to Congress interfering with the pipeline-approval process, which has historically been left to the executive branch. The President’s exclusive right to approve cross-border pipelines may be such a fundamental principle to the Administration that the veto statement is the beginning and end of the debate. (Republicans don’t have the necessary sixty-seven votes to overturn an Obama veto.)","138","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"But what if the White House saw the fight over Keystone as an opportunity for a larger deal? Keystone XL is one of the few G.O.P. priorities in which the philosophical gulf between Obama and congressional Republicans is relatively narrow. In private, Obama has been dismissive of environmentalist claims that building Keystone XL would significantly affect climate change, and his State Department, with some caveats, came to the same conclusion in an environmental-impact statement. In U.S. and Canadian diplomatic circles, officials regularly discuss whether there could be some kind of a deal between the two countries. For example, Canada might make a more ambitious pledge to reduce carbon pollution in return for U.S. approval of the Keystone XL pipeline.","139","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"So why doesn’t Obama have that discussion with Congress instead? What would the G.O.P. be willing to trade to get Keystone approved? A carbon tax? A large infrastructure project? Codifying the E.P.A.’s climate regulations into law? From the White House’s perspective, the Keystone XL pipeline should be an ideal policy to give away in a trade: it’s a major issue that Republicans care a great deal about but one that Obama seems to view as a sideshow. (And if world oil prices remain low, Keystone may be entirely moot because production in the expensive-to-develop Canadian oil sands might not be economically viable.)","140","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"Obama’s final decision on the matter is fast approaching. The last major bureaucratic step is a State Department review of the “national interest” in the project, which had been postponed while a Nebraska court considered a challenge to the route of the pipeline through that state. On Friday, the court ratified that route, clearing the way for the State Department to complete its work. It is possible, and perhaps even more likely than not, that soon after Obama vetoed congressional legislation forcing approval of Keystone XL he would then approve the project on his own. But will he get anything in return? If the Republican Congress and President Obama can’t figure out a way to cut a deal on this issue, don’t expect the next two years to look much different from the last two.","141","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"

Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, not only won his own reëlection but assumed the role of Majority Leader, which he had long sought. McConnell is the perfect Senate leader for the modern Republican Party. Though he began his political life as a moderate, he has evolved into a fierce conservative warrior, dedicated to obstructing the President’s agenda in every possible way.

"In the last days of his tenure as Majority Leader of the Democrats, Harry Reid grew so frustrated with Republican obstruction that he changed the Senate rules, doing away with filibusters on lower-court judicial and Administration appointees, like cabinet members. This destroyed what little was left of the once-famous comity of the Senate, where the right to filibuster (for better or worse) has usually been regarded with reverence. Still, Reid’s move was enormously effective, too.

In more than three months, the Senate has approved just a single judicial nominee, a district judge from Texas.","164","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"

His broader agenda consists entirely of afflicting Democrats rather than passing legislation.","165","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/loretta-lynch-and-the-dysfunctional-senate"
"But McConnell’s cramped vision is well suited to his current post. In one way, this has worked to Obama’s advantage. McConnell, like most Republicans, has been intensely critical of the Administration’s preliminary accord with Iran. But McConnell and his Republican colleagues are also reluctant to take responsibility for killing the deal altogether. Despite all of their complaints about the deal, their actual legislation on the subject, in the end, looks as though it will not really limit the President’s authority at all.

"Last month, before a flight from Toronto to LaGuardia, I spent an hour waiting in line while United States Border Patrol and Customs officials questioned passengers. The line kept growing longer, the number of officials remained woefully inadequate, and as I stared at all the empty posts I imagined indifferent federal employees taking extra-long coffee breaks in a hidden room somewhere. When my turn finally came, a few terse questions from the guy in the blue uniform brought out that I was a journalist. He gave me a look with no trace of good humor. “You should do a report about this,” the official said, waving at the room. He briefly described what he saw as the long hours, the understaffing, the stress, the complaining passengers. Slightly ashamed, I agreed that it was an important story. He handed me back my passport. “Have a good trip home.”","February 25, 2015","168","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/threats-homeland-security"

"You know the story—by now it’s what people in the news business call an evergreen. Congressional Republicans want something that they can’t get through the standard legislative process—this time, it’s the revoking of President Obama’s executive action temporarily exempting four million illegal immigrants from deportation. So a large faction of Republican legislators decides to hold a routine funding bill hostage to their demands. In this case, the House has passed a bill that would keep the D.H.S. from closing down only if the President’s immigration order is killed at the same time. Republicans on Capitol Hill are, as usual, divided between those who want to blow everything up and those who “understand” why their colleagues might be driven to threaten legislative suicide bombing but disagree with their tactics. The new Senate Republican majority’s fourth attempt at cloture failed on Monday, forty-seven to forty-six. That’s not even enough votes to pass the chamber bill by simple majority, which used to be the way legislation was enacted in the Senate, until Mitch McConnell, as minority leader, made the filibuster an everyday weapon. McConnell, now the majority leader, isn’t the first insurgent-turned-ruler to find himself cornered by his own history of abuses. Yes, the Democrats currently deploying the filibuster that they once denounced can be accused of hypocrisy.

For years, ideological extremism fuelled by organized money has degraded our political system, and that brings troubles as serious and lasting as external threats—which are serious enough, and all the harder to confront intelligently in an atmosphere like the one that prevails in Washington. These internal forces have steadily weakened the defenses of the body politic, leaving a demoralized federal work force, a routinization of poor working conditions and inadequate services, a strategy of total war on every issue that comes before Congress, and a national government that is the last place you’d look to for solutions to the country’s most corrosive problems.","172","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/threats-homeland-security"

After that shutdown, the public’s trust in government plummeted, to a record low of nineteen per cent.

But this effect tainted congressional Democrats and President Obama as well as the Republicans who brought it on.

No doubt Republicans can already imagine the ads that await them next year—a clever thirty-second spot could nail them for being soft on terrorism and anti-Latino.

"Kenji Yoshino, a professor of constitutional law at N.Y.U., writes in his new book, “Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial,” that when he and his husband, Ron Stoneham, were getting ready for their wedding, in 2009, they learned that, these days, most couples leave out “that tremulous moment where the officiant states, ‘If any of you can show just cause why these two may not be married, speak now, or else forever hold your peace.’ ” The phrase in its traditional form, from the Book of Common Prayer, is actually “why these two may not be lawfully married,” and it is meant to allow for the discovery of, say, a wife in another town, and not, outside of a romantic comedy, for the groom’s brother to announce that he thinks the groom really loves someone else—or, God forbid, for a filibuster by Ted Cruz. But Yoshino and Stoneham asked Judge Guido Calabresi, who officiated at their very lawful Connecticut wedding, to keep the line in, as “a subtle reminder to ourselves and our guests that many of our fellow citizens felt they had just cause to object to our marriage.” Yoshino adds that he was quite sure no one would jump up, “though I did think wildly of that scene in Jane Eyre, when a stranger declares: ‘The marriage cannot go on.’ ”","April 23, 2015","177","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/marriage-proposals-for-republican-candidates"

"Perhaps the various Republicans considering a Presidential run, who have lately been asked if they would attend a same-sex wedding, have been engaging with similar thoughts. The question—which Jorge Ramos, of Fusion TV, first posed to Marco Rubio, and was then picked up by the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt—is a good one, as evidenced by the answers, which have ranged in tone from dogmatically alarmed (Rick Santorum) and sourly crimped (Cruz) to contorted (Scott Walker), upbeat but vague (Rick Perry), genial (Rubio), and fairly forthright (John Kasich), and have been consistently revealing. Perry said that he would “probably” go to one, but that he resented being asked what he and others have called a “gotcha” question—a description that is accurate only if “gotcha” has become a synonym for “requires candidate to think.” More than that, the question requires politicians to think about what both their rhetoric and our laws mean in real life. It says something about Cruz, for instance, that he first dodged and then attacked the question, saying that liberals were trying to “twist the question of marriage” into a matter of “emotions and personalities”—something presumably distant from the institution. Liberals were also claiming that conservatives “must hate people who are gay,” Cruz said, adding, “As you know, that has nothing to do with the operative legal question.” Asking a politician how he thinks people should be treated is a pretty basic one; Jeb Bush, Rand Paul, and Chris Christie have avoided it this week, but they should make a point of saying how they would R.S.V.P.","179","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/marriage-proposals-for-republican-candidates"
"For Santorum, a Catholic, attending a gay wedding is out of the question, because it would be “a violation of my faith.” The puzzling thing is that, as a wedding guest, he wouldn’t be required to do anything but watch; he wouldn’t even have to deliver the flowers, which has been the complaint of gay-marriage-opposed florists pushing for “religious freedom” laws in various states. If just witnessing behavior that he views as dishonorable is against his religion, how did he ever manage to spend so much time in the halls of Congress? The question that Hewitt put to him was whether he would attend, specifically, the wedding “of a loved one or a family friend or anyone who you were close to”—not a casual acquaintance. Surely, Santorum has attended weddings of people who are not Catholics without feeling that the vow cast a spell on him, or induced him to engage in heresy. (Marco Rubio, who in response to Ramos’s question said he would show up, pointed out that, although he is Catholic, he goes to the weddings of divorced people all the time.) And yet it is the speaking of vows that seems to be the focus of anxiety: Scott Walker told reporters that, when one of his relatives had a same-sex wedding, he and his wife went to the reception, but he made a point of saying that they had skipped the ceremony.","180","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/marriage-proposals-for-republican-candidates"
"Advocates of same-sex marriage might say that the centrality of the vow is precisely the point. The vow—the lawful vow—is the important thing to witness. Marriage is a state that is different from being unmarried, and it transforms and shelters a family, both parents and children, legally and socially. That is why civil unions and even the state-sanctioned marriages that, before the Defense of Marriage Act was overturned, lacked federal recognition—what Ruth Bader Ginsberg called “skim-milk marriage”—are inadequate. People like Walker might be willing to dance to a same-sex couple’s music and eat their cake, but if one of the partners falls ill, for example, just having had a reception won’t get the other one into the hospital room, or give him or her full parental rights to children they might raise together. Those circumstances are why several of the plaintiffs in the cases that the Supreme Court will hear next Tuesday brought their suits.","181","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/marriage-proposals-for-republican-candidates"
"And that’s why Rubio’s answer, though far more open than Cruz’s or Santorum’s, was only a starting point. Rubio said that “of course” he’d go to the wedding—weddings are for going to, after all—an answer that underscores his instinct for connectedness, which may be his greatest political asset. He added, “Ultimately, if someone that you care for and is part of your family has decided to move in one direction or another, or feels that way because of who they love, you respect that because you love them.” He chose to say “who they love” rather than “who they are”—he has said that he thinks homosexuality is a behavioral choice, and strongly opposes same-sex marriage. It is good to know that, unlike Cruz, Rubio sees love as a factor in how you deal with people. But he is more likely to lead people who oppose gay marriage, and who saw the interview, to question their opposition than he is to moderate his own position. To an extent, that is true of all of the major Republican candidates (even when they attend events hosted by gay businessmen, as Cruz did on Monday). They are still fighting marriage equality.","182","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/marriage-proposals-for-republican-candidates"
"When is a piece of wedding cake just a wedge of sugar and cream and conviviality rather than a wedge issue? As I’ve written before, one of the big things that the marriage-equality argument has on its side, besides basic justice, is that people like going to weddings. They are a good thing in life. (It is a tragedy of cultural timing that the masterful montage scene in “The Wedding Crashers,” which came out in 2005, just a year after Massachusetts became the first state with marriage equality, includes no same-sex weddings.) An invitation sets in motion a logical and emotional process. Weddings make you think about what marriage means; is that something that Santorum and other non-attenders are afraid of? John Kasich told CNN that when a close friend who is gay invited him to his wedding he said that he had to think about it. That involved, sensibly enough, consulting his wife. He said he asked her, “‘What do you think? You wanna go?’ She goes, ‘Oh, I’m absolutely going.’ ” Kasich still opposes same-sex marriage, but, as far as going to a wedding, suddenly it was “pretty simple. I care about him. He cares about me. He invited me to something. I’m going to go do it. It’s not that complicated.” And so, Kasich continued, “I called him today and said, ‘Hey, just let me know what time it is.’ ” A time for him and the rest of us to mark in the calendar would be next Tuesday, at around ten in the morning, when the Supreme Court is called into session, and the Justices ask the lawyers what it means to be married. Afterward, there may be cake.","183","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/marriage-proposals-for-republican-candidates"
"“I just didn’t even realize until this weekend that it had the kind of momentum that it had,” Senator Bob Corker, a Republican of Tennessee, told The Hill yesterday. He was talking about the letter “to the Leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran” that had been signed by forty-seven Republican senators, including Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, who led the effort. It was an open attempt to disrupt the Obama Administration’s negotiations with Iran on nuclear policy by telling the mullahs that the President of the United States wasn’t someone they should trouble themselves with. Even some Republicans seem a little embarrassed about it now. Megyn Kelly, of Fox News, reflecting conservative criticisms, asked Cotton what the point could be of corresponding with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. (He said that “experts” told him that the Iranians didn’t understand the American Constitution.) No Democrats signed the letter. Corker was one of only seven Republican senators who didn’t.","March 12, 2015","184","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"

"The other Republican non-signers were Susan Collins, of Maine; Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee; Dan Coats, of Indiana; Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska; Jeff Flake, of Arizona; and Thad Cochran, of Mississippi. There was a certain amount of curiosity about why they hadn’t—as if sending a Dear Ayatollah letter was a fun group activity that they had skipped out on. Collins’s answer was fairly sensible: “I don’t think that the ayatollah is going to be particularly convinced by a letter from members of the Senate.” Others, meanwhile, were more circumspect. “I just didn’t think it was appropriate” (Flake). “I just don’t think we ought to be discussing it in public” (Cochran). Maybe they just didn’t think that the Republican Party had become quite so lacking in leadership. The real question, though, isn’t why the seven didn’t sign, but how Cotton, a freshman senator with a well-known habit of engaging in flights of destructive rhetoric, had persuaded forty-six colleagues to join him.","186","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"As he often points out, Cotton, who is thirty-seven, is both a veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq and a graduate of Harvard Law School. In 2006, when the Times published a piece revealing that the government, in the name of fighting terrorism, had collected the private financial information of Americans who had nothing to do with terrorism, Cotton, then an Army lieutenant stationed in Baghdad, sent a letter to the newspaper, saying that the editors should be put “behind bars.” The “next time I hear that familiar explosion—or next time I feel it,” he wrote, “I will wonder whether we could have stopped that bomb had you not instructed terrorists how to evade our financial surveillance.” He added, “I am well-versed in the espionage laws” that could be used to prosecute people at the paper. The Times didn’t publish the letter, but the conservative Web site Power Line did.

(Last September, the Atlantic ran a profile of Cotton entitled “The Making of a Conservative Superstar.”)","188","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"Cotton campaigned by opposing abortion rights and Obamacare, and by appealing to fellow veterans and foreign-policy hawks, while touring the state, as the AP reported, “in a bus decorated with a giant boot print on the front, the Arkansas flag and camouflage.” Last spring, on “Morning Joe,” when asked about suggestions that he was “extreme,” Cotton replied with a reference to Pryor’s record: “The only thing that’s extreme is casting the decisive vote for Obamacare five years ago.” He beat Pryor by seventeen points. In addition to trying to scuttle the Iran talks, during the two months that Cotton has been in the Senate he has attempted to block the release of any more detainees held at Guantánamo, even though nearly half of them have been determined to pose no threat to the United States. Cotton’s recommendation was that the prisoners should “rot in hell.”","189","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"Something seems to be out of kilter in the political marketplace that yielded Tom Cotton. How are younger legislators with assets like military experience—something in too short supply in Congress—deployed and, more crucially, developed, and which talents are rewarded? In last year’s campaign, Cotton had to answer charges that he was “reckless.” Recklessness now seems to be treated as a charm. Extremism, clumsiness, anger—other Republican members of the Senate, with a few hundred years of tenure between them, took a look and jumped on board. What was so appealing? Or what were they afraid of?","190","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"John McCain told Politico, “I saw the letter, I saw that it looked reasonable to me and I signed it, that’s all. I sign lots of letters”—as if he didn’t have to worry about anyone actually reading them. McCain told Greta Van Susteren, of Fox, that the Iranians needed to know that Congress had a serious role, but conceded, with what might be taken as a hint of regret, that the letter “maybe … wasn’t the best way to do that.” Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, said that he wished that he could sign Cotton’s letter and that he hoped that other potential 2016 Presidential candidates would, too. Senators Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz, of course, already have.","191","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"Cotton reportedly lobbied the senators personally and strenuously. And yet perhaps it wouldn’t have taken much for someone to stop him. Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declined to sign the letter because he had been trying to organize a bill that would undermine the Iran talks in a more dignified way. (“I just don’t view that as where I need to be today,” he told Politico. “My goal is to get 67 or more people on something that will affect the outcome.”) His fellow-Tennessean, Lamar Alexander, told the Knoxville News-Sentinel that he was guided by his colleague’s expertise. Murkowski’s spokesman noted that she was co-sponsoring the Corker bill. It may be relevant that, last year, Thad Cochran, though by traditional measures an archconservative, was targetted by Tea Partiers during a bitter campaign that involved a break-in at his wife’s nursing home and a suicide. Then again, the non-signers might just have had a sensible conversation on the subject before saying yes. If that were the case, perhaps it’s no surprise that so many others signed.

"All too often in recent decades, Presidents have flouted this legal requirement, relying on flimsy arguments about executive authority or, since 2001, on the overly broad mandate that Congress granted President George W. Bush to pursue his war on terrorism. Indeed, according to many constitutional scholars, the actions that the Obama Administration has already taken against the Islamic State, which have included launching air strikes by U.S. fighter-bombers, have gone beyond the law. “The war against the Islamic State is now illegal,” Bruce Ackerman, of Yale Law School, wrote on November 7th. “The War Powers Resolution of 1973 gave President Obama 60 days to gain consent from Congress and required him to end ‘hostilities’ within 30 days if he failed to do so. This 90-day clock expired last night.”","195","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"As a former lecturer on constitutional law, Obama knows this stuff all too well. During a press conference in November, he asked Congress to grant him a new legal authorization. Commendably, if a bit belatedly, his Administration has now sent a written request up to Capitol Hill. On Wednesday morning, the White House released the text of its resolution, which would authorize “the limited use of the United States Armed Forces against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.” The group, it says, “poses a grave threat to the people and territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria, regional stability, and the national security interests of the United States and its allies and partners.”","196","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"Despite the Administration’s use of the word “limited,” the resolution is a broad one. It would authorize military action for up to three years, contain few geographic restrictions, and approve the deployment of Americans on the ground. More specifically, the resolution says that, subject to some limitations, “The President is authorized … to use the Armed Forces of the United States as the President determines to be necessary and appropriate against ISIL or associated persons or forces.”","197","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"In fact, the only limitation spelled out in the resolution is that it “does not authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces in enduring offensive ground combat operations.” Clearly, this phrase stops well short of restricting the use of U.S. ground troops, or even placing any limitations on their numbers. Current and former military officials have been warning for months that, even if the Administration persists with the idea of using the Iraqi Army to attack ISIS, the battle plan would demand the extensive involvement on the ground of U.S. target spotters, trainers, and logistics personnel. The suggested resolution would clearly allow this. Indeed, it seems like it would allow the President to deploy entire battalions of U.S. infantry troops, should the Iraqi Army struggle to advance, which is what some military experts think is likely to happen. As long as the U.S. offensive operations were intended to be short-lived, the resolution would appear to cover them.","198","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"As written, it would also grant the President the power to extend the fight against the Islamic State beyond Iraq and Syria, and even to take the war to other entities. Referring back to the request for authority to strike ISIS and “associated persons or forces,” Section 5 of the resolution says that this “means individuals and organizations fighting for, on behalf of, or alongside ISIL or any closely-related successor entity in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.” But to what and where is this language referring? An official told the Times that it is meant to cover the possibility of striking at members of ISIS or allied groups in Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Yemen, or other unnamed Middle Eastern and North African countries.","199","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"If this resolution doesn’t amount to granting the President a free hand, it comes close. And it goes beyond what some senators and Congress members seem inclined to approve. In response to the Administration’s request, Speaker John Boehner issued a statement saying that he would organize hearings, adding, “Ultimately, our objective is to show the world that the United States is resolute in our commitment to destroy” the Islamic State. Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who serves on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees, welcomed the resolution, telling the Washington Post, “We’re in our seventh month of war, and we’re going to finally have this discussion.” But Kaine added that the language about ground troops “is too vague for me. We learned from the 2001 authorization that vagueness is bad.”","200","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"Kaine’s points are well taken. In the coming weeks, Republicans and Democrats will be forced to approve, strike down, or modify the Administration’s request, which is what is supposed to happen. (The would-be Presidential candidates in 2016, by virtue of their ambitions, will also have to adopt a public stance.) Right now, Congress seems likely to end up approving some sort of resolution. Still, the debates will provide an opportunity for people to consider the stakes, and to think hard about the conflict. A ground war against ISIS is likely to be bloody and extended. And, even if it succeeds militarily, the United States and its allies will face the same task they goofed up the last time around: putting together a stable and democratic Iraq.","201","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"The politics of all this aren’t entirely clear-cut. On the one hand, there is little enthusiasm in the country, or in Congress, for another extended war in the Middle East. In a recent poll carried out by researchers at the University of Maryland and the research firm Gfk, fifty-seven per cent of respondents opposed sending ground troops to fight ISIS, even if air strikes fail to dislodge Islamist forces. That isn’t the entire story, though.","202","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"
"Given the widespread revulsion at ISIS’s murderous tactics, and the group’s apparent eagerness to bait the United States and its allies, the public is eager to see it destroyed. Indeed, the same poll that showed that fifty-seven per cent of respondents were opposed to a ground war also found that fifty-seven per cent of respondents said that the United States should “do whatever is necessary” to defeat ISIS. (Thirty-nine per cent said that the United States should “stay out of the conflict.”) Seemingly, most Americans agree with Republican Senator Mark Kirk, of Illinois, who told the Times that, despite having some reservations, “I think it’s the right thing to do to take these guys out.”","203","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-war-isis-debate-begin"

Congress passed a resolution permitting President Franklin Roosevelt to impose an embargo on arms shipments to both countries, and he did. Prosecutors later charged the Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation with running guns to Bolivia. The company challenged the resolution, but, in 1936, the Supreme Court issued a thumping endorsement of a President’s prerogative to lead foreign policy. “In this vast external realm, with its important, complicated, delicate and manifold problems,” the majority wrote, only the President “has the power to speak or listen as a representative of the nation. . . .

They have meddled in unprecedented fashion to undermine President Obama’s nuclear diplomacy with Iran, as he seeks—with Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China—to cap Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.

"Is Congress within its rights to insist on a vote? The Constitution states that the Senate must approve treaties, but the Iran deal would not be a treaty; it’s a political agreement. Congress has voted on some political agreements involving nuclear issues as a matter of course. Yet the specifics of the Iran deal make it more closely resemble the scores of diplomatic bargains short of treaties that Congress has ignored, including such important arms-control deals as the one that created the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The Foreign Relations Committee act is a measured one—it may allow only for speechmaking and largely symbolic votes. That’s why the Administration went along with it. Nonetheless, it reflects a large measure of cynical partisanship.","208","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/dangerous-gamesmanship"
"It’s true that America’s faltering strategy in the Middle East could benefit from a more open and informed debate, but the increasing willingness of Republicans to entangle foreign policy in political gamesmanship has opened a new chapter in the fragmentation of American power. During the Tea Party era, Republicans in Congress have adapted to unbridled, grassroots-fuelled campaigning on domestic issues like Obamacare and the debt ceiling. This collapse of inhibition is now leaching into the Party’s position on matters of war and peace, from Benghazi and the Islamic State to Iran.","209","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/dangerous-gamesmanship"
"Last month, Senator John McCain said that Secretary of State John Kerry’s explanation of his negotiations with Iran was less trustworthy than that of Iran’s leaders. Kerry and McCain were once friendly Senate colleagues. “That’s an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries,” President Obama said, of McCain’s remarks. “It needs to stop.” It probably won’t, although that may not matter in the short run. Obama is constrained by his congressional opposition, but, with less than two years left in office and no more elections to win, he is also freer to defy it.","210","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/dangerous-gamesmanship"
"Last Tuesday, the President informed Congress that he intends to remove Cuba from the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, a further step toward the normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations. According to the State Department, although Cuba harbors some violent fugitives, including a former Black Panther convicted of murdering a New Jersey state trooper, it no longer arms or funds terrorists. Since December, when Obama outlined steps to ease travel restrictions and other aspects of the anachronistic embargo on Cuba, he has outflanked his critics. American businesses want the embargo lifted, and many second-generation Cuban immigrants are open to policy change, as many Republicans well understand.","211","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/dangerous-gamesmanship"
"Obama’s announcement that he was taking Cuba off the list triggered a forty-five-day period during which Congress can vote to reverse his decision. The White House is in a position to prevail: Obama can veto any congressional resolution he doesn’t like, on either Cuba or Iran. If he does issue a veto, the White House would need the votes of only a third plus one of the members of the House or the Senate to uphold it. Still, departures in American foreign policy as momentous as making peace with the Castro regime or resetting nuclear diplomacy with Iran ought not to be constructed on narrow vote margins in Congress. U.S. v. Curtiss-Wright helped to establish what was referred to during the Cold War as the One Voice Doctrine. That is, despite shifting disagreements between Presidents and Congress, the country should seek to project unity abroad, in order to reassure allies and deter enemies. The doctrine has flaws; it can be used to rationalize an imperial Presidency during national crises, among other things. Yet cohesion in foreign policy is surely preferable to senators sending freelance missives to declared enemies of the state.","212","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/dangerous-gamesmanship"
"The collapse of comity and common sense in Congress is not just a fountainhead of divisive politics. It is also a threat to the Constitution. The United States, founded on the hope that its three branches of government would evolve in roughly equal states of health, is not likely to manage successfully risks on the scale of China’s rise or the Middle East’s chaos if members of Congress continue to degrade and paralyze their institution. The Edward Snowden revelations provided only the latest reminder that protecting civil rights and liberty at home requires congressional oversight of the national-security state that is well resourced, expert, and unhindered by partisan opportunism. On the present evidence, it is hard to imagine Congress meeting that burden. ♦","213","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/dangerous-gamesmanship"
"“It is a good deal,” President Barack Obama said on Thursday, after the framework of an agreement to keep Iran from getting a nuclear bomb was announced. If it is good—and that will depend on getting the final settlement done and signed between now and June—it will be in large part because the President avoided the temptations of resentment and self-pity. And Republicans in Congress will have failed to thwart it because they embraced them. The G.O.P. did everything that it could to scuttle this deal. Forty-seven Republican senators sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader that will go down in the annals of diplomatic sabotage, and made it harder for American negotiators to demand a deal that the White House itself would find acceptable. They did so even though their ostensible goal—keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power—was the same as the President’s. It would have been easy, on Tuesday, when the original deadline for the talks expired, for the American negotiators to walk away—and for Obama to blame it all on the Republicans and just say that they had made it too difficult to reach an agreement. He’s done that in the past. (Guantánamo.) But the President told John Kerry—whose efforts he referred to in his statement on Thursday as “tireless, and I mean tireless”—to keep going, and Kerry and his fellow diplomats seem to have come up with something that, while not perfect, does look pretty good.","April 2, 2015","214","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/on-iran-obama-gets-his-breakthrough"

"“Found solutions. Ready to start drafting immediately,” Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, tweeted just before noon. In the past few days, when it looked like things might not work out, there was talk of something that would be less than a success but not quite a failure: a vague outline, a commitment to getting it right, and the hope that, somehow, it would all fall into place by June. As Zarif suggested, that is not what this deal is. It has more detail than most observers expected, which will hopefully mean that the drafting of the actual accord will truly be a technical process and not a deferred round of diplomacy. The deal, which is between Iran and the P5+1 (the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany) covers all the life stages of a bomb. For example, during the next twenty-five years, inspectors will be able to enter mines known to contain raw uranium ore. One sticking point had been Iran’s unwillingness to completely do away with any of its existing facilities; the negotiators had talked about this as a matter of national pride. But the Arak nuclear plant, which was designed with the sort of reactor that could produce plutonium for bombs, was not one whose operations could simply be slowed down—there’d still be plutonium. So under the deal, according to the White House’s fact sheet, the “original core of the reactor” would be “destroyed or removed from the country.” A different, safer sort of reactor would be put in its place. There would still be an Arak facility but, from a proliferation perspective, it would be a shell of itself; this is the sort of middle territory that diplomacy can find. Arak was one of the targets that John Bolton, the U.S. representative to the U.N. under George W. Bush, suggested bombing in an Op-Ed in the Times last week.","216","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/on-iran-obama-gets-his-breakthrough"
"Centrifuges can be used to produce highly enriched uranium for bombs. The deal will reduce the number of centrifuges that Iran has, from close to twenty thousand now to just over six thousand—keeping only its oldest models, rather than the newest and best ones—and for the next ten years it will only be able to operate five thousand of them. Stockpiles of enriched uranium that Iran already has will be reduced—with the excess sent abroad—and kept at the lower level for fifteen years.","217","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/on-iran-obama-gets-his-breakthrough"
"Iran gets something for all this: the removal of American and international sanctions when it becomes clear—and inspectors verify—that it is keeping its side of the bargain. How to ascertain exactly when this happens may be a point still to be negotiated. But a robust part of the deal, from an American perspective, is its “snap-back” provisions. Sanctions will not actually be removed but suspended, and what the fact-sheet refers to as their “architecture” will remain in place for quick reactivation if necessary. (“And while it is always a possibility that Iran may try to cheat on the deal in the future, this framework of inspections and transparency makes it far more likely that we’ll know about it if they try to cheat,” Obama said.) Also, the non-nuclear-related sanctions on Iran, for things like its support of terrorism, will remain.","218","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/on-iran-obama-gets-his-breakthrough"
"That raises an objection to the deal: Iran will still be Iran. Twenty minutes after Zarif’s tweet signalled a breakthrough, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted, “Any deal must significantly roll back Iran’s nuclear capabilities and stop its terrorism and aggression.” It was never likely, as desirable as it would be, that Kerry was going to get the Iranians to sign something saying that they would no longer be aggressive. It would have been a little like demanding that there could be no missile-reduction deal with the Soviet Union until the Russians stopped quoting Lenin all the time. Having this deal needn’t, shouldn’t, and surely won’t mean never challenging Iran about anything else again.","219","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/on-iran-obama-gets-his-breakthrough"
"There are multiple time frames in the deal: no enrichment research at the Fordow facility for fifteen years; no inspections at bellows-production facilities for twenty years; adherence to certain enhanced nonproliferation protocols forever. One of the criticisms of the deal, in the past few months, has been that it would “sunset” in ten years—that Iran would get a free decade without sanctions, grow rich and strong, and then start building a bomb the moment that the time was up. Kerry, speaking in Switzerland, said that there was “no sunset.” That was somewhat a matter of semantics; there are, at least, mini-eclipses at certain intervals. But it is true that significant aspects of the deal have an indefinite life. (And that may be more than can be said about the Iranian regime itself, which could change in less time than it takes to get inspectors out of the uranium mines.)","220","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/on-iran-obama-gets-his-breakthrough"
"Obama said on Thursday that the current estimates indicated that Iran could have the materials for a bomb, if it wanted to, in two to three months. Under the deal, that “break out” time—the minimum post-cheating bomb-acquisition interval—would be at least a year, for the next decade. He continued, “So when you hear the inevitable critics of the deal sound off, ask them a simple question: Do you really think that this verifiable deal, if fully implemented, backed by the world’s major powers, is a worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East? Is it worse than doing what we’ve done for almost two decades with Iran moving forward with its nuclear program and without robust inspections? I think the answer will be clear.” Those critics talk as though it’s just as clear that he’s wrong. John Boehner, on Thursday, said that the deal appeared to be “an alarming departure” from what Obama had said his goals were. Obama didn’t agree.","221","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/on-iran-obama-gets-his-breakthrough"
"“Iran is not going to simply dismantle its program because we demand it to do so,” the President said. “That’s not how the world works. And that’s not what history shows us.” Is that cynicism or optimism? The world is not a place where you can simply look tough and your enemies will crumble; but it is a place where, with some work and some luck, you can try to get something done.","222","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/on-iran-obama-gets-his-breakthrough"
"Last fall, George Pataki, the former governor of New York, announced that he was considering a run for President. Since then, he’s been making the rounds on Fox News, taking shots at his rivals for the Republican nomination and, with nine visits to New Hampshire since October and another scheduled for next month, establishing himself as a regular on the state’s first-in-the-nation primary circuit. “I have no doubt in my mind that I have the ability to run this country well,” Pataki told the Daily News.","April 23, 2015","223","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"

"The country is less than convinced. To the extent that a possible Pataki candidacy has been noticed at all, it has been roundly panned. “In politics, you never say never,” the Democratic consultant George Arzt said. “Here, you can say never.” Pataki is not well known outside of his home state, hasn’t held elected office in eight years, and will turn seventy this summer. And yet he seems to be genuinely considering a run. The question, as when Pataki flirted with a bid four years ago, is why. “Pataki—I’m puzzled about this,” Larry J. Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, told me. “I don’t even know what he’s been doing. Has he been on corporate boards?”","225","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"The 2016 G.O.P. field is bursting with candidates who have practically no chance of victory. Sabato’s influential Crystal Ball report, which tracks political races across the country, currently counts nineteen potential candidates for the Republican Presidential nomination. Twelve of them have no shot at winning, Sabato said, adding, “and I’m being generous to some of the other seven.” (His generosity does not extend to a perennially rumored candidate whose name is absent from the list. “We couldn’t include Donald Trump and live with ourselves,” he said.)","226","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Sabato’s Crystal Ball has broken down the Republican field into four tiers. At the top are the “Leading Contenders,” who include the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, and the Florida senator Marco Rubio. Sabato estimates that there’s a seventy-five to eighty per cent chance that the nominee will come from that tier. Pataki is one of seven candidates crowded into the “Gadflies and Golden Oldies” tier, at the bottom. He’s joined there by, among others, the former Hewlett-Packard C.E.O. Carly Fiorina (“Largely unknown,” the Crystal Ball notes. “No base of support”), the former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore (“Jim who?”), the onetime Maryland governor Bob Ehrlich (“No rationale for candidacy”), and the former United Nations ambassador John Bolton (“No electoral experience or donor base”). “Even if a lot of the people talking about it today don’t wind up running, we could still be looking at a record number of candidates,” Sabato said.","227","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Why are so many experienced people lining up for a race that they cannot possibly win? For some, there’s a genuine call to serve, or a desire to influence the Party’s platform. And, to be sure, the absence of a clear Republican front-runner gives hope to dreamers everywhere. “They start wondering, Maybe I can catch lightening in bottle,” Sabato said. He told me that a candidate in the bottom tier had called him recently and said, “Just wait till I get on that debate stage!”","228","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"For a number of the candidates, however, the chances of actually securing the nomination don’t appear to factor into the decision to run. It is now so easy and so lucrative to mount a campaign for President that, even given the current historically crowded field, it’s a wonder that still more people aren’t running. “The primary process is a spectacle now, and that’s a relatively new development,” Sean McKinley, a Ph.D. student in the politics department at Brandeis University who researches the rewards of unsuccessful campaigns for President, said. “There are increased incentives for people to run, and there are fewer downsides, so why wouldn’t you run?”","229","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"McKinley researched Presidential races between 1976 and 2008, and found that losing candidates benefitted enormously simply from having run. Senators who had only narrowly won earlier elections suddenly found themselves retaining their seats by comfortable margins, despite not having shown well in the Presidential race. For example, in 1970, Lloyd Bentsen, a Democrat, won a relatively close Senate race in Texas against the future President George H. W. Bush. Six years later, when Bentsen ran both for President and for reëlection to his Senate seat, he was clobbered by Jimmy Carter in the Presidential primaries but won his Senate seat by fifteen points. He was reëlected to the Senate twice more by comfortable margins, and was Michael Dukakis’s nominee for Vice-President in 1988.","230","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Participating in the public-speaking circuit has emerged as an especially profitable side benefit of running for President. It was reported last year that Hillary Clinton was earning as much as three hundred thousand dollars per appearance at colleges and universities. It’s unlikely, of course, that a middling politician who lacked Clinton’s fame would command such a figure simply for having lost a bid for the White House, but Clinton’s rising tide is widely understood to have lifted all fees. Some of McKinley’s research has focussed on candidates who wound up signing with speaking-engagement agencies after failed runs for President. Gary Bauer, for instance, saw his run, in 2000, as a social-conservative candidate founder after disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire, but he is still available for bookings through the All American Speakers bureau. For many similar candidates, McKinley said, “the only thing they really had on their C.V. was that they had run for President. So if you’re a politician reaching the end of your career, and maybe you haven’t earned as much as you could have in another field, maybe you consider running for President to raise your profile for the speaking tours.”","231","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"That comment brought Pataki to mind, but McKinley points in his research to an even more obscure example: Mike Gravel, a former Democratic senator from Alaska who last served in 1981. After Gravel, who is now eighty-five, announced in 2006 that he would run for President in 2008, he managed to land a book deal. Then, despite a largely ignored campaign, in which he ran first as a Democrat and at the end as a Libertarian, he was able to sign for a time with the Harry Walker Agency, a prestigious speakers’ bureau.","232","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"It would probably be unfair to characterize Gravel’s run for President as having been about personal enrichment. He has spent much of his career working on the issues that motivated his campaign—political empowerment for everyday citizens, the war on drugs, the entanglement of military spending and bellicose foreign policy—but the run did wind up benefitting him financially. These days, he is the president and C.E.O. of a company called KUSH, which plans to produce marijuana-infused products, such as lozenges. “There’s no question that running for President helped me get the job with KUSH,” Gravel told me. “It probably was window dressing to have a Senator and a former candidate for President.” He told me that he doesn’t receive a salary, but did get stock in the company, which is a subsidiary of Cannabis Sativa, Inc., on whose board he also sits. (The C.E.O. of that company, by the way, is Gary Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico, who ran for President as a Libertarian in 2012.) “There are people who are much, much beyond their prime of effectiveness who are running for President for the visibility,” Gravel said.","233","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard C.E.O., appears to be elevating the personal-enrichment campaign strategy to a kind of performance art. She was cited in a poll, released earlier this week, as only two per cent of Republicans’ first choice for President, but will announce her candidacy on May 4th, a day before the release of her new book, “Rising to the Challenge: My Leadership Journey.” “She may win the Newt Gingrich Award for 2016,” Sabato said, and gave Fiorina no chance of actually winning the nomination. “Newt was definitely seeing his book sales go up during his 2012 run—it almost seemed like that was the point of his run, and then he got on a roll and won South Carolina! It was almost by accident.”","234","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Today’s media cycle presents even marginal candidates with endless opportunities to generate headlines that burnish their brands. “There are shades of Marshall McLuhan,” David Michaelson, whose firm, David Michaelson & Company, is a leading authority on the effectiveness of communications and public relations, said. “The medium is the message. Think of a campaign not as a run for office but as an opportunity to tell a story. Think of a campaign as not a campaign but a media platform for your issues or your brand.” And the brand that you’ve built follows you long after you’ve abandoned your campaign. Michaelson cited the example of the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who earned a reputation during his unsuccessful 2008 run as a folksy, conservative truth-teller, an identity that helped him land a talk show on Fox—which he recently left in order to explore a 2016 campaign.","235","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Underscoring—and underwriting—all of this is the fact that it has never been easier to raise the money required for a run. Changes in campaign-finance laws now allow rich donors to essentially give unlimited amounts of money to support a favored candidate. The former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, for example, ran as a kind of boutique candidate for the Wyoming mutual-fund operator Foster Friess. Though he struggled to raise money elsewhere, Santorum was able to win eleven primaries and caucuses thanks largely to the more than two million dollars in donations he received from Friess. The pair are reportedly considering a second act in 2016.","236","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"“Campaign finance is going to continue to change the shape of politics, as people realize how permissive the laws are,” McKinley said.

You may have to solicit money from only a couple dozen people.”","237","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"What this means in practice is that some candidates who are hoping to last only long enough in the primaries to cash in later on will no longer have to engage in the unpleasant act of begging lots of people for relatively small amounts of money. “You have to be the kind of person who’s willing to do the kinds of things required of a person running for President—kissing babies and asking people for money—that many of us would find distasteful,” McKinley said. “But even those things are getting easier.

Priebus’s memories of 2012, when the competition was intense and curiously entertaining, are by his own admission a little nightmarish.

"Why then should there be a feeling of angst? It may be because, despite Priebus’s brave hope to “contain” the process, the perpetual-political-motion machine—the Iowa caucuses, the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, the attempts to “front load” early voting—will run with or without much direction from a legacy political party. The idea that the major parties should have a role as gatekeepers, as a shield against the excesses and illusions of pure democracy, seems almost quaint when the largest field ever may be at the starting gate.

Sometimes, they prevailed. In “The United States of Ambition: Politicians, Power, and the Pursuit of Office,” Ehrenhalt focussed on state and local races, but his argument encompassed national candidates, too, and as a general rule it could describe many people in politics who have ambition, a lot of free time, communication skills, a personal fortune or wealthy backers, and no obvious qualifications (either by training or experience) to deal with the real world beyond America’s borders.","242","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"

In the commercial world, positioning means showing why the attributes of Tide have a broader appeal than the promises of Wisk.

Rick Perry’s main theme, since he ran for President in 2012, has been making the borders less porous, but he’s also made an effort to protect his position with Latino voters. In a Q&A with the Wall Street Journal the other day, he said, “Americans want to have a thoughtful process in place, following the rule of law to allow people to immigrate to this country . . . in a legal way”—a position with which it’s hard to take issue. Marco Rubio, who has modified if not changed his position, now emphasizes the borders, too. Rubio may emerge as the grandmaster of positioning in general; not long ago, he spoke to CBS and said, “The future is now. It’s here. It has arrived.

With a number of Democratic congressmen missing the leadership vote to attend Cuomo’s funeral, in New York, the Speaker could have lost as many as thirty-five G.O.P. members and still achieved a majority—this according to the tallies of the folks at the Washington Post’s The Fix and at Politico, anyway.

The Republicans, and the rest of us, are stuck with him.","249","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"Which, perhaps, isn’t the worst possible outcome. Although Boehner is hardly in the tradition of Henry Clay, Sam Rayburn, and Tip O’Neill, he isn’t nearly as bad as some of the possible alternatives, such as Louie Gohmert, the Texas congressman who announced over the weekend that he would offer himself as a candidate for Speaker. (He ultimately received three votes, including his own.) If you haven’t been watching Fox News and C-SPAN closely, Gohmert’s contributions to the civic discourse may have passed you by. They include comparing President Obama to Hitler, calling for higher taxes for the poor, claiming that America is being infiltrated by “terror babies,” and warning that the U.S. military is allowing gay soldiers to sit around all day and massage each other, thereby courting ruin. (No, really, he did say that, in a television interview. A helpful post at Mother Jones details this and other Gohmert contributions.)","250","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"Compared to Gohmert and his ilk, Boehner seems like a conservative but ultimately rational member of the Rotary Club. To be sure, he mouths all the usual G.O.P. lines about President Obama usurping the constitution with his immigration reforms, and about the Affordable Care Act destroying the economy. But he has shown little enthusiasm for responding to points of contention with the drastic measures that some Republican ultras favor, such as impeachment or shutting down the government. “I don’t do anger,” he told Politico’s Glenn Thrush, whose new profile of Boehner is well worth reading.","251","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"That quote sounds a bit self-serving, but it’s hard to have entirely negative feelings about someone who grew up working at his family’s bar, dresses like an extra from “Mad Men,” spends much of his time being harried by wingnuts, and, perhaps as a consequence, seems determined to smoke himself to an early grave. Boehner’s cancer stick of choice is a filtered Camel 99, and, according to Thrush, he “smokes more or less constantly when he’s out of the public eye.” He’s also on record as saying that he likes an occasional tipple. Who doesn’t?","252","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"The question, of course, is to what end the Speaker will exercise his reconfirmed authority, such as it is. In November’s midterm elections, the Republicans picked up another thirteen House seats. They now have a majority of more than fifty, the biggest margin in almost seventy years. Moreover, many of Boehner’s members, new and old, regard the election as a referendum on President Obama’s policies. There will be immediate pressure on him to secure some policy victories over the White House.","253","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"In all likelihood, the first showdown will come over the Keystone XL pipeline, an issue on which the Republicans rightly sense indecision in the White House. The House could pass a bill authorizing construction as early as Friday. Such a bill also seems certain to pass the Senate, which now has fifty-four Republican members. Obama would then be left with the decision of whether to veto it, and Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said on Tuesday that the President would, indeed, do that.","254","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"For Boehner, Keystone is an easy one. He’s a longtime supporter of the pipeline, and he knows it also has the support of a majority of Americans, including a fair number of Democrats, particularly in southern and western states. (Last April, eleven Democratic senators sent a letter to the White House urging approval of the pipeline.) But the Keystone votes are only the beginning. Republicans in the House won’t be content with pushing for an oil pipeline, and Boehner knows it. Before long, he will be facing calls to confront the White House on Obamacare, immigration, the debt limit, and other issues that animate the conservative base of the party. And urged on by the rabble-rousers like Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, the wingers will be in no mood to compromise.","255","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"After four years as Speaker, Boehner is under no illusions about any of this. Recounting a meeting in his office in late 2013, following the government shutdown, Thrush quotes the Ohioan as saying, “We got stampeded into a fight we tried to avoid. . . . These [Tea Party] people are crazy, crazy. . . . They just want a fight.” On that front, nothing has changed.","256","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"The optimistic take is that the Speaker and the President, each of whom is seeking to create a legacy for himself, will get together and make deals on issues like trade, infrastructure, and corporate taxation. The reality, however, is one of acute polarization on most issues, which leaves party leaders with little room to maneuver. If either one, but particularly Boehner, is seen to be compromising with the other side, the furies will descend on him.","257","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"

"Hillary Clinton’s official announcement that she is running for President comes almost ten months to the day that she set out on a book tour to promote “Hard Choices,” a memoir of her four years as Secretary of State. Much has happened since that day, when supporters lined up for hours to get into the Barnes and Noble in Manhattan’s Union Square, where Clinton was signing copies, and some of it will work to her advantage.","April 11, 2015","263","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"With Elizabeth Warren’s refusal to jump into the Democratic primary, Clinton still lacks effective competition, whereas early indications that the Republican contest would turn into a slugfest have been confirmed, with at least half a dozen serious candidates entering, or preparing to enter, the race. In the past year or so, the U.S. economic situation has improved—job growth has picked up (with the exception of last month), and the number of people without health insurance has continued to fall as the effects of the Affordable Care Act have taken hold. Assuming Clinton wins the nomination, both of these things will make it easier for her to defend President Obama’s legacy, and to point to the potential folly, with things improving, of the economy coming under the tutelage of extremist Republicans.","264","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"","265","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Doubtless, the Republican candidates will subject Clinton to virulent attacks on all manner of subjects, but that could well help her to unite the Democratic Party behind her, and to rally the activists whose support she will need to get out the vote in places such as Florida and Ohio. Moreover, the electoral map remains favorable to the Democrats. If Clinton can carry all of the eighteen states, plus the District of Columbia, that have gone blue in every election since her husband’s first victory, in 1992, she will have two hundred and forty-two electoral votes, leaving her within striking distance of victory. As always, the contest is likely to come down a few battleground states, including Florida, Ohio, and Virginia. If Clinton can hold together the “Obama coalition” of young voters, women, and minorities, she has a very good chance of winning. (On the online-betting sites, she is the firm favorite.)","266","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"While the external circumstances favor Clinton, the preparations for her campaign have been anything but smooth. Her book tour was marred by a series of mini-gaffes—or that’s what the media perceived them to be, anyway. Earlier this year, it emerged that the Clintons’ charitable foundation, which was recently renamed the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, had taken donations from foreign governments, including repressive ones such as the monarchies that rule Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Then came the news that, during her time at the State Department, Clinton set up and operated a private e-mail system, whose server was subsequently wiped clean at her request. Clinton insisted that she had preserved all of the work-related e-mails on her server, about thirty thousand of them, and forwarded copies of them to Congress, but Republicans on Capitol Hill (and on the campaign trail) are unlikely to let the matter drop.","267","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"To be sure, many Democratic strategists insist that the furor over the Clinton Foundation donations and the e-mails are inside-the-Beltway affairs that won’t have any lasting impact on her campaign. But recent opinion polls tell a somewhat different story. In a Gallup poll carried out in early June, 2014, Clinton’s approval rating was fifty-four per cent, and her disapproval rating was forty-three per cent. Now, according to the Huffington Post’s poll-of-polls, her approval rating is forty-eight per cent and her disapproval rating is 46.2 per cent. And two recent polls, from Public Policy Polling and from Fox, show Clinton’s unfavorability rating moving above fifty per cent.","268","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"In the aftermath of the e-mails story, the Republicans also appeared to be eating into Clinton’s putative lead over various G.O.P. candidates in a number of battleground states—gaps that, until recently, had been holding steady. A poll from Quinnipiac University, released a few days ago, showed Clinton tied (statistically speaking) in Colorado and in Iowa with seven Republicans: Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, and Ted Cruz. (In Colorado, Walker, Paul, and Rubio were actually leading Clinton, but all of their leads were within the poll’s margin of error.) In Virginia, Clinton still seems to be holding her ground. According to the poll, she leads the Republicans by margins that vary from four points to ten points. But over all, the survey’s message was a worrying one for her campaign: “It is difficult to see Secretary Clinton’s slippage as anything other than a further toll on her image from the furor over her e-mail,” the assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll, Peter A. Brown, said.","269","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Of course, it is very early, and the polling data shouldn’t be taken too seriously. In the old days—I’m talking twenty or thirty years ago—a disapproval rating of more than forty per cent was considered a serious handicap to any candidate, but things have changed. In the current, highly polarized environment, Republicans rarely say they approve of Democrats, or vice versa. At the start of 2012, President Obama’s disapproval rating sat at about fifty per cent, according to Gallup, yet, he handily won reëlection. The key to victory isn’t being popular. It’s being less unpopular than the other candidate and getting your supporters to turn out.","270","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"With a formidable Democratic campaign apparatus to call on and a bruising Republican primary ahead, Clinton shouldn’t have much trouble raising the alarm about the prospect of the G.O.P. controlling the White House, as well as Congress. But, of course, it will be a tough race. The Republicans are coming off a strong performance in the midterms, and the Democrats have occupied the White House for eight years. As Al Gore discovered, in 2000, winning a third Presidential term for your party isn’t easy, even if you win the popular vote.","271","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Clinton’s first task is to switch the focus away from the e-mails story, which has clearly had an adverse effect on her reputation. Until now, her strategy has been to try to tough it out and move on. But she must be aware that the explanation she provided for setting up her own e-mail operation—it was all a matter of convenience—was a flimsy one, and that it didn’t persuade a lot of people. Referring to the Quinnipiac poll in Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia, Brown said,“In all three of these states, more, and in Colorado many more, registered voters say she is not honest and trustworthy. Voters do think she is a strong leader—a key metric—but unless she can change the honesty perception, running as a competent but dishonest candidate has serious potential problems.”","272","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Having offered up her version of the e-mails story, Clinton could hardly change tack, but she had to do something to arrest the decline in her numbers. Hence, surely, the decision to launch her campaign now, and then, reportedly, to travel to Iowa in the coming days and, later this month, to New Hampshire. That was clearly the right thing to do. Now Clinton needs to demonstrate that, at the age of sixty-seven, after more than twenty years in the public spotlight, she represents a brighter future rather than a fractious past.","273","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"An important part of her message, and one that the all-male Republican field may well have trouble countering, is that it’s high time for America to elect a female President. But if Clinton is to follow the examples of Margaret Thatcher, Angela Merkel, and Dilma Rousseff, she will also have to project a powerful message about where she wants to lead the country. In policy terms, all indications are that she will run a traditional Democratic campaign, promoting social mobility and emphasizing the interests of the middle class. That’s what Bill Clinton did in 1992; it’s what she did in 2008; and it’s what Obama did in 2012. Given the enduring problems of wage stagnation and rising inequality, it is the appropriate and right agenda.","274","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"The task is to make it sound fresh and convincing. I well recall Michael Dukakis campaigning on his version of the “middle-class agenda,” and it wasn’t enough to carry him to victory over George H. W. Bush. But things have changed since 1988, when the full scale of the economic challenge facing ordinary Americans was only beginning to be understood. Today there is hardly a policy-oriented economist in the country who isn’t concerned, in some way, about issues relating to wage stagnation and inequality. To tackle these problems and to promote what is often referred to as “inclusive prosperity,” Clinton can call on a wide range of experts, and a number of detailed proposals that Democratic think tanks, such as the centrist Center for American Progress and the liberal Economic Policy Institute have laid out in recent reports. The ideas range from raising the minimum wage and encouraging the growth of trade unions, to changing the tax code and investing in infrastructure.","275","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Policy wonks, myself included, will be watching closely to see what proposals Clinton adopts and which experts she chooses to rely on. (So far, she’s covering all her bases. A few weeks ago, she spoke at a Center for American Progress event. Last week, she attended a meeting organized by the progressive Roosevelt Institute.) But from the broader perspective of her campaign, the imperative is that she taps into the deep economic insecurity that many Americans feel, and that she is seen to have a credible and sensible agenda for tackling it. And on top of that, of course, she will need to craft a foreign-policy message that addresses Americans’ concerns about the chaos they see enveloping many parts of the world, but that hopefully also goes beyond the hawkish stance that she sometimes adopted in the Senate.","276","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Can she do it? It won’t necessarily be easy and, almost certainly, it won’t be pleasant to watch. Barring something unexpected, the former Secretary of State and First Lady will be engaged in the fight of her life for the next nineteen months. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned about her over the years, it’s that she’s a battler.","277","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"“Who do you think President Obama could appoint at this very day, given the boundaries that we have?” Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in Elle last fall, after being asked yet again if she would consider retiring from the Supreme Court. “If I resign any time this year, he could not successfully appoint anyone I would like to see in the court.” Plenty of people said that Ginsburg was wrong. Things were bad, but not that bad. Republicans knew that they’d have to confirm someone from the universe of people that Obama would be willing to nominate—that is, someone more or less like Ginsburg, not Antonin Scalia.","March 20, 2015","278","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/if-not-loretta-lynch-then-who"
"The Senate’s treatment of Loretta Lynch, Obama’s nominee for Attorney General, suggests, though, that Ginsburg may have actually underestimated the pathology at work. On November 8, 2014, the President sent her name to the Senate as a replacement for Eric Holder, and she has yet to be confirmed—the Republican leadership has simply failed to put her nomination up for a vote by the full Senate. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, made vague, wiggly gestures about getting it done this week, but he didn’t, and unless something remarkable happens over the weekend his next opportunity will be three weeks from now. The Senate is talking about the budget next week, and will take all its time to pretend that it is making a serious effort to do something about the nation’s finances; after that comes one of those mysterious two-week congressional recesses.","279","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/if-not-loretta-lynch-then-who"
"Lynch’s confirmation shouldn’t have been a stretch. She has spent years as a prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York, and her relations with the law-enforcement community are excellent—so excellent that on Friday Rudy Giuliani, of all people, was raging about the need to confirm her. (He called her not only qualified but “over-qualified” for the job.) She seems to be more conservative than Holder. She is the daughter of a minister and a librarian, and it appears, from her many confirmation hearings, that she has a reputation for probity. She has undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard. During her confirmation hearings, her sister members of Delta Sigma Theta sat in the audience, wearing the sorority’s signature red. It took until February to get her name through the judiciary committee, but she made it, with a 12-8 vote. At the moment, various reports suggest that she will be confirmed narrowly, with the votes of the forty-six Democratic senators, four Republicans (Jeff Flake, Orrin Hatch, Lindsey Graham, and Susan Collins), and Vice President Joe Biden, who would cast the tie-breaking vote. This is what it looks like when Obama proposes a nominee for a place in his own cabinet, who won’t be on the job any longer than he is, and who is a picture of moderation. What would it look like if he went for a radical choice—or even an outspoken liberal like Ruth Bader Ginsburg?","280","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/if-not-loretta-lynch-then-who"
"Indeed, what if this were a Supreme Court nomination? Would the Senate act senatorial? Elena Kagan was confirmed in 2010, but Washington has only descended since then.

"The four months since Lynch’s nomination is not a normal interval. Ed Meese had a longer lag before his confirmation, in 1985, counting various stops and starts, but what held him up was a need to complete a couple of ethics investigations. (And there may have been more to find: another ethics problem led to Meese’s resignation before the end of Reagan’s second term.) According to FiveThirtyEight there have been only a couple of nominees in the past four decades who’ve had to wait as long. (One of them was Gina McCarthy, now the Environmental Protection Agency’s administrator, in 2013.) The ostensible delay this week was because the Democrats noticed that the Republicans had slipped a passage into an anti-human-trafficking bill stating that, if victims got money from a compensation fund, they couldn’t use it to terminate a pregnancy. That has nothing to do with Lynch, or with anything that she might be asked to adjudicate as Attorney General; but, when the Democrats asked for a change, the Republicans said that they couldn’t have one—or a vote on Lynch until the bill went through unchanged. Before that, it was immigration: Lynch wouldn’t tell the Senate that the President had run roughshod over the Constitution by deferring the deportation of so-called DREAMers—young people who had been brought to America illegally as children and built lives here—and the President wouldn’t revoke that order to get her a vote. On Thursday, The Hill reported that the gun lobby was mobilizing against Lynch. The National Rifle Association sent out an alert, talking about “the damage an Obama-appointed, agenda-driven, anti-gun Attorney General can do to our rights and freedoms as Americans.” Dudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, told The Hill, “Given her close personal and professional ties to this lawless administration, gun owners fully expect her to be Eric Holder 2.0.”","282","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/if-not-loretta-lynch-then-who"
"The vehemence of some of the opposition to Lynch, unmoored from anything about her record or her résumé, raises the question of who her opponents see when they look at her. (“Eric Holder in a skirt,” a draft letter from the Gun Owners of America, obtained by The Hill, said.) Senator Dick Durbin, of Illinois, said Wednesday, “Loretta Lynch, the first African-American woman nominated to be Attorney General, is asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar. That is unfair. It’s unjust.” Senator John McCain replied that Durbin’s remark was “beneath the decorum of the United States Senate,” and “serves no purpose but to further divide us.” Some commentators who are supportive of Lynch worried that Durbin was being tactically unwise. And focussing on Lynch’s race assumes that the Republicans would have let a white nominee with her qualifications breeze through—as though, if only the President had made them feel a bit more comfortable, everything would have been fine. It is no compliment to them to say that they are so frenzied in their obstructionism that they might, indeed, have stalled then, too. On Friday, Eric Holder said on MSNBC that “My guess is that there is probably not a huge racial component to this, that this is really just D.C. politics, Washington at its worst.” He recognized his own odd position—though hated by Republicans, he is still on the job because of their stubbornness, and may be for a while. It was, Holder said, “a little strange.”","283","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/if-not-loretta-lynch-then-who"

"1. The American economic model is back. Repent, all ye declinists and secular stagnationists: the U.S. economy is growing at an annual rate of more than four per cent, leaving other advanced economies, and also many developing ones, in its wake. Hiring is accelerating, corporate capital spending is rising, and the long-awaited escape velocity required to emerge from recession has been achieved. Although productivity and wage growth have been disappointing, these indicators may pick up in 2015, as the unemployment rate falls toward five per cent.","286","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"
"2. Monetary policy works. If a central bank keeps the cost of lending low enough, for long enough, a depressed capitalist economy will eventually regain its strength—especially if the authorities supplement rock-bottom interest rates with direct injections of money into the financial markets via quantitative easing. Several years ago, this would have been a controversial claim. Even today, some economists dispute it. But the Bernanke-Yellen recovery in the United States, which has already lasted five and a half years, has surely settled the issue.","287","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"
"3. The markets aren’t experiencing a bubble. On March 9, 2009, the Dow closed at 6,547.05. It closed out 2014 at 17,983.07. The market has risen for six years in a row, and there hasn’t been a significant correction (a fall of at least ten per cent) in more than three years. On the Nasdaq, technology I.P.O.s are coming thick and fast following the September début of Alibaba, which was the biggest Internet I.P.O. yet. However, this doesn’t all amount to a bubble.

"4. Cheap gasoline is here to stay. Thanks to the shale-oil boom, the days when oil traded at a hundred dollars a barrel are gone for good. OPEC can no longer control the output of its own members, let alone that of other big producers, such as the United States and Brazil. By the time the cartel regains the power to control the world’s oil supply and set prices, technological changes, such as the development of electric cars, may well have fatally undermined its power. The age of OPEC is at an end.","289","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"

Thanks to an outmoded rulebook and a lack of leadership, about all that stands between the nineteen-member currency zone and ruin is Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. But with Greece once again in crisis and the German government seemingly determined to prevent Draghi from following the example of the Federal Reserve and start buying government bonds in large quantities, it’s far from clear that the urbane Italian will be able to save the euro zone. The optimistic scenario is for continued stagnation and another lost half decade; a disorderly breakup remains a serious possibility.","290","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"
"6. Abenomics is a bust. Despite the reëlection last month of Shinzo Abe, the reformist Prime Minister, Japan’s bold experiment in Keynesian economics has failed to halt two decades of economic stagnation. Abe has already fired two of the three arrows in his quiver: a fiscal stimulus and large-scale monetary expansion. The third element of his policy strategy, structural reform of Japan’s moribund economy, remains an aspiration rather than a reality. While Abe’s decision to postpone another increase in the national sales tax may enable G.D.P. growth to pick up a bit—the first increase, last spring, knocked the economy back into recession—hopes of a U.S.-style rebound are fast dissipating.","291","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"
"7. Russia is Saudi Arabia with nukes and snow. The imposition of Western sanctions, which followed Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea, hobbled the Russian economy, which had previously enjoyed a decade of strong growth. But it was the collapse in the oil price that illuminated Moscow’s real weakness. For all his bluster, Putin still presides over an economy that is dangerously dependent on oil and other commodities. Talk of diversifying into manufacturing and services proved to be just that. Now that the commodity boom has turned into a bust, the Russian economy is heading for a deep recession, or, possibly, a depression.","292","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"

In Iraq and Syria, Americans, Iranians, and personnel from many other countries are coöperating in a military campaign that has arrested the advance of the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). This year, at some point, the allies will probably go on the attack, in support of a counter-offensive by the forces of the Iraqi government and the Kurds. In West Africa, meanwhile, a long overdue international effort to tackle the Ebola outbreak is having some success. According to the latest update from the Word Health Organization, incidences of the disease are declining in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Under the leadership of Nigel Farage, a privately educated former commodities trader who portrays himself as a beer-supping everyman, UKIP is taking votes from both major parties. But the Conservative Party, which, with its junior coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats, currently holds power, stands to lose the most from a right-wing populist revolt.

In politics, demography may well be destiny, but the Republican Party, which, only a couple of years ago, was being written off as too white, too reactionary, and too old, is defying reports of its imminent demise. Following November’s midterm elections, the Republicans control both houses of Congress, thirty-one governors’ mansions (including those in Maryland and Massachusetts), and sixty-seven of ninety-eight state legislative chambers (a record). And although the G.O.P. still faces a formidable task in winning the Presidency in 2016, when high turnout will favor the Democrats, the Republican candidate Democrats fear most, Jeb Bush, has already all but entered the race.","295","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"

Today, things look very different. According to the latest official figures, about 6.7 million people had signed up for new plans by the middle of October, which is pretty close to the Obama Administration’s target figure. The proportion of Americans who are uninsured has fallen sharply—by close to five percentage points, according to Gallup.

In his year-end press conference, he promised more of the same in 2015. Doubtless, he will spend a lot of time tussling with the Republicans and vetoing some of their loonier pieces of legislation. But the fact that the Republicans know that he is willing and able to defy them will strengthen his bargaining position and enable him to push through one or two of his own legislative priorities.","297","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/twelve-lessons-2015"

"In early November, Loretta Lynch, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, was nominated by President Barack Obama to be the next Attorney General. The Senate Judiciary Committee has taken its sweet time considering Lynch, who would be the first African-American woman to serve as the nation’s chief law-enforcement officer. She has made the most of the interlude by meeting privately with all twenty of the senators on the committee—both Republicans who have already declared their opposition to her confirmation and those who are more favorably disposed. Given her strong support among the committee’s Democrats, she needs only two Republican votes for her nomination to move forward. She seems to have those votes. Still, it is unclear when, or even if, her nomination will reach the Senate floor. On Tuesday, Ted Cruz, Republican Senator of Texas and a member of the committee, demanded that Lynch’s nomination be blocked until the Administration changes its immigration policies.","February 5, 2015","299","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"

"The new Senate majority, despite its stated intention to show that Republicans can govern, seems to be off to a wobbly start. At the same time that Cruz was defying a promise made by the new majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, to give Loretta Lynch “the courtesy of a vote on the floor,” the House of Representatives, with its large Republican majority, was sending up a Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill that had attached to it provisions that would reverse the President’s most significant executive actions on immigration. Senate Democrats, rediscovering a fondness for the filibuster, killed the bill, leaving Republicans with the unhappy prospect of having Homeland Security go broke on their watch before the end of February. Governing is not for the fainthearted. House Speaker John Boehner’s troops continued to not show the way on Tuesday, by voting to repeal Obamacare for the fifty-sixth time.","301","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"
"There were, finally, two days of committee hearings on Lynch’s nomination last week. The proceedings had their circus touches. No fewer than three of the witnesses called by Republican senators are pursuing litigation against the Administration. One of them, Sharyl Attkisson, a conservative investigative journalist, is seeking thirty-five million dollars in damages from the Department of Justice and Eric Holder, the present Attorney General, for allegedly hacking into her phone and computer. Another, Catherine Engelbrecht, the founder of an election-watchdog group called True the Vote, is suing the Internal Revenue Service for allegedly targeting her for her political views. The testimony of such witnesses seemed to have little to do with Loretta Lynch. At least the Baptist minister from her North Carolina home town, called by her supporters on the committee, knew her family.","302","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"
"“You’re not Eric Holder, are you?” Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, asked her. Lynch smiled, and said, “No, I’m not, sir.” If confirmed, she added, “I will be Loretta Lynch.”","303","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"
"Still, actual serious questions were raised in the hearings. Republican senators were intent on establishing the degree of Lynch’s independence from the President who nominated her. Did she differ from Obama on any issue? This question, although it can be posed as pure partisan gotcha—and Lynch did her best to avoid answering it—actually goes to the heart of the Attorney General’s dual role: Presidential adviser and cabinet member on one hand, impartial law officer on the other. (Holder infuriated his conservative critics by describing himself as Obama’s “wingman.”) Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, finally succeeded in creating some daylight between Lynch and the President by quoting from remarks that Obama made last year, to this magazine, about his youthful pot smoking and the fact that he doesn’t consider marijuana any more dangerous than alcohol. Lynch the federal prosecutor firmly disagreed with that last bit. She also expressed an old-fashioned belief in the effectiveness of the death penalty.","304","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"
"But the main topic of the confirmation hearings was immigration policy. Did Lynch believe that President Obama’s executive action, in November, 2014, to defer the arrest and deportation of large categories of undocumented immigrants—which Cruz, Sessions, and their fellow would-be minutemen call “unconstitutional amnesty”—was legal? Lynch, unable to dodge this question, which came at her from many angles, said that she found the opinion issued on the matter by the Justice Department, analyzing the government’s powers with respect to deportation enforcement, “a reasonable discussion of legal precedent.” That was not good enough. If Lynch did not intend to defend the Constitution, her nomination would not receive the votes of the hard-liners on the Judiciary Committee. To Cruz, Lynch’s rather mild allusions to prosecutorial discretion amounted to an alarming assertion that any category of lawbreaker might be arbitrarily amnestied under the rogue regime that the Obama Administration has become.","305","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"
"Of course, Ted Cruz is running, more floridly than most potential candidates, for President. After the first day of hearings, he told CQ Roll Call, “She could not give any instance of a limit on the President’s authority. That is profoundly dangerous to have [in] an Attorney General, who, by her own testimony, is prepared to rubber stamp unconstitutional conduct by the President.” Well, maybe that wasn’t Lynch’s testimony exactly, Senator. But we take your point. This nomination shall be blocked for as long as you need to get a few more wild remarks off your chest.","306","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-stopping-loretta-lynch"

"Early today, my editor e-mailed to ask if I’d write about Mitt Romney’s upcoming announcement. The e-mail contained a link to a story from Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin, which said that Romney was planning to hold an 11 A.M. conference call with some financial donors, to “update” them on his thoughts about running for President a third time.","309","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Halperin wisely avoided reaching a definitive conclusion on whether Romney was going to confirm his entry to the 2016 contest. He did suggest, however, that this was the likeliest reason for the conference call: “Based on all the conversations I have had with Romney World this week, I would bet that Mitt and Ann Romney’s proposition, that if he runs he will become the Republican nominee, is about to be tested.”","310","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"","311","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"By the time I’d had breakfast and subjected my Twitter followers to a few thoughts about the new G.D.P. figures, the online mulching machine had converted Halperin’s qualified wager into a general consensus that Romney was all in. The Daily Beast, evidently convinced that it had the inside track, published a story headlined “Romney Will Run For President,” which it tweeted out with an “EXCLUSIVE” label.","312","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"The Daily Beast story was picked up everywhere, and as eleven o’clock approached, the tension was palpable. (O.K., I made up that last bit.) What, exactly, would Romney say? On January 9th, he had said—to another group of donors, of course—“I want to be President.” A few days after that appearance, the Washington Post reported that he was “almost certain” to enter the race. Just this past Wednesday, talking at Mississippi State University, he took a jab at Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, noting, “How can Secretary Clinton provide opportunity for all if she doesn’t know where the jobs come from in the first place?”","313","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Reading all of this, it would be just about possible to imagine, if you tried hard enough—or if you were a Republican political operative looking for another well-paid gig—that the idea of Romney entering the G.O.P. race and winning the nomination for a second time was a realistic proposition rather than a fantasy.","314","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"To take this position, you would have had to convince yourself that New Romney would be able to live down his “forty-seven per cent” comment and the fourteen-per-cent tax rate he paid in 2011; that Jeb Bush hadn’t already occupied the role of wise establishment elder; and that it was of no consequence that many influential people connected with the Republican Party regard Romney as an out-of-touch loser, whose presence on the ticket would guarantee the Democrats another victory in 2016. (Rupert Murdoch, in describing Romney a few weeks ago as “a terrible candidate,” was only voicing publicly what many other Republicans were saying privately. Just this week, David Kochel, one of Romney’s key operatives in 2012, joined Bush’s political-action committee.)","315","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Romney, during his long and successful business career, wasn’t known for flights of fancy. These days, though, he’s a semi-retired but still ambitious politician. Perhaps he had convinced himself to give us wretches in the press corps what we so badly wanted: a Mitt–Jeb showdown.","316","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Alas, it was not to be. About ten minutes before eleven, Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio presenter, posted on his Web site the very remarks that Romney was about to deliver. They began with a few sentences of thanks for the people around the country who had encouraged him to run. Then came the lede: “After putting considerable thought into making another run for president, I’ve decided it is best to give other leaders in the Party the opportunity to become our next nominee.”","317","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"So that was that, then? Not quite. In fact, Romney’s statement went on for another eight paragraphs. After citing a poll showing him leading the other putative G.O.P. contenders by nearly two to one, the statement said, “So I am convinced that we could win the nomination.” It went on, “I also believe . . . I would have the best chance of beating the eventual Democrat nominee.”","318","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Why, then, wasn’t he running? Because it was time to make way for the young—or for the younger, anyway: “I believe that one of our next generation of Republican leaders, one who may not be as well known as I am today, one who has not yet taken their message across the country, one who is just getting started, may well emerge as being better able to defeat the Democrat nominee. In fact, I expect and hope that to be the case.”","319","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"If you interpret that paragraph as a parting shot at Jeb, who is already in his sixties, you weren’t the only one. With several minutes still left until Romney was due to speak, the Twitter hordes, myself included, were already busy parsing the text and handicapping the remaining G.O.P. field, which, despite the sad departure of the Mittster, appears to be growing by the day. Mostly, though, we were trying to make jokes at Romney’s expense.","320","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Eric Boehlert, of Media Matters, tweeted, “Team Mitt: the US is dangerously off course. US under attack around the globe and US economy cratering…but Mitt doesn’t feel like running.” The political analyst Jeff Greenfield offered, “So Romney’s not running; this really opens the door for George Pataki….” And, from John Podhoretz, of the New York Post: “Mitt Romney could also have won the Super Bowl but he decided to let other, younger people deflate the balls.”","321","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"In fact, Romney made the only sensible decision, for both himself and his party.","322","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"On a personal level, Romney’s chance of becoming President came and went in 2012; running again would merely have subjected him to more torment. From the Republican Party’s perspective, the 2016 race is already shaping up to be another extended exercise in the art of drilling a circular firing squad. Adding a Romney-versus-Bush element to the emerging narrative would have benefited only the media and the Democrats. On Thursday, we learned, via a leak to Politico’s Mike Allen, that Hillary Clinton is considering waiting until July to announce her candidacy. That’s smart. With little serious opposition on the Democratic side, why not sit back for a while, and join the peanut gallery watching the Republicans go at each other?","323","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"

Often, the people sitting with the First Lady in the speaker’s gallery are more compelling than the policy proposals contained in the address—which, given the gridlock in the capital, usually come to naught. Last year, there was Cory Remsburg, a young Army sergeant who had undergone a dozen surgeries after a roadside bomb in Iraq left him maimed, voiceless, and partly paralyzed. As Remsburg’s father helped him to his feet to recognize the thunderous applause ringing around the chamber, it was possible to imagine, for a brief moment, that unity and common purpose reigned in the Republic.","January 19, 2015","325","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"

"On Tuesday night, for once, the policy contents of the speech may well dominate things. Over the weekend, White House aides let it be known that President Obama will propose raising taxes on the very rich, to pay for tax breaks for the middle class. More specifically, he wants to increase the tax rate on capital gains for high earners, from 23.5 per cent to twenty-eight per cent, and he also wants to remove the so-called “step up in basis” loophole, which allows rich families to reduce, often greatly, the amount of taxes they pay on their estates. The money generated by these changes would be used for a variety of purposes, including a modest tax cut for middle-class married couples, an expansion in wage subsidies to low-paid workers, and an expansion of tax credits for students in higher education.","327","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"This is a good plan. Explaining the thinking behind it, Dan Pfeiffer, a senior White House official, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” “It’s the simple proposition that, now that the economy is in a stronger place than it’s been in a very long time, we need to double down on our efforts to deal with wage stagnation and declining economic mobility.”","328","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"Of course, with the Republicans in control of the House and the Senate, the chances of the proposals being enacted anytime soon are practically nil. Speaker John Boehner immediately dismissed them as old-fashioned tax-and-spend liberalism. Since the plan isn’t going anywhere, it’s perhaps tempting to dismiss it as meaningless. But that would be an error. Simply advocating tax cuts for the masses will reshape the politics of the next couple of years, and, particularly, the 2016 Presidential election.","329","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton, assuming she gets the nomination, will come under pressure to match and top the White House proposals. After all, she can hardly run for President while saying that her big idea is to carry out a plan proposed by her predecessor. I would be willing to wager that Clinton, or any other Democratic candidate, will subsume the President’s proposals in a bigger and bolder plan to help the sagging middle class. And there is plenty of room to expand upon Obama’s ideas. In a seventeen-and-a-half-trillion-dollar economy, thirty-two billion dollars a year, on average—which is roughly the sum that tax hikes and a new levy on big banks would raise, according to Obama Administration officials—is a very modest sum. In fact, it’s equivalent to only about a fifth of one per cent of G.D.P. Any Democratic candidate who is flying around the country talking about the need to offset decades of rampant growth in inequality will surely be tempted to increase the stakes.","330","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"But perhaps the most interesting aspect of Obama’s plan is what it augurs for the G.O.P. nomination fight. To be sure, there’s very little chance that any of the Republican candidates will embrace the idea of raising tax levies on the rich. Many of those expected to run have signed Grover Norquist’s pledge never to raise taxes under any circumstances; reneging would plunge them into an unholy war with the right. “Raising taxes on people that are successful is not going to make people that are struggling more successful,” Senator Marco Rubio, who also appeared on “Face the Nation,” said. “The good news about free enterprise is that everyone can succeed without punishing anyone.”","331","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"But just because Rubio and his fellow Presidential hopefuls won’t support the first half of Obama’s plan doesn’t mean they can’t embrace the tax-cutting half. To the contrary, it’s easy to imagine middle-class tax cuts emerging as a central issue in the G.O.P. primaries, with the candidates vying to outdo one another. And, unlike Hillary and her economic advisers, the G.O.P. hopefuls are unlikely to be overly concerned with how to pay for the giveaways they propose.","332","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"Such unconcern would represent a bit of a change. Ever since the Great Recession sent the budget deficit soaring to ten per cent of G.D.P., Republicans have struggled to reconcile their old Reaganite religion of supply-side economics with their claims that Obama was bankrupting the country. When Mitt Romney, in 2012, said that he would cut everybody’s taxes by twenty per cent without raising the deficit, but didn’t identify spending cuts, his plan was widely ridiculed. Famously, the Tax Policy Center, a recognized non-partisan authority on such matters, described the proposals as “mathematically impossible”—a judgment from which Romney’s campaign struggled to recover.","333","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"But the economic environment is changing, which means that the political environment is also shifting—and not in the direction that tends to prompt concern for fiscal responsibility. In fiscal 2014, which ended on October 1st, the deficit was just 2.8 per cent of G.D.P. That means that it is nearly back to its average level over the past forty years. With G.D.P. growth buoyant, the deficit is likely to fall further this year. When deficits are low, they begin to recede from the public consciousness, and charges of fiscal recklessness carry less heft.","334","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"Neither party has fully adjusted to this new reality. Obama’s plan is a model of financial rectitude: modest tax cuts and spending programs financed by clearly identified increases in taxes and fees. That’s very laudable. However, recent history suggests that Washington, except in an economic crisis, doesn’t operate in this way. As deficits fall, the temptation to introduce another big tax cut often becomes overwhelming.","335","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"The Democrats may try to resist the temptation. Al Gore did so in 2000. But if Hillary, or another Democratic candidate, is serious about introducing tax and spending programs that would make a serious dent in wage stagnation and inequality, she (or he) will be faced with the choice of introducing bigger tax increases on the rich than Obama is proposing, or forgoing tax hikes and making some optimistic projections about the deficit. With the Republicans ever eager to portray the Democrats as inveterate tax-raisers, the choice will be a tricky one.","336","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"On the Republican side, there could well be a free-for-all. Jeb Bush has, in the past, positioned himself as a deficit hawk, even suggesting that he would be willing to accept modest tax increases in return for big spending cuts. As the primaries approach, will he stick to that position? Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee have both endorsed a flat tax. Rubio, together with Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, recently proposed a two-tier tax system in which most people would pay a rate of just fifteen per cent. Romney, if he does run, will doubtless have another tax-cutting scheme in his pocket. Even Chris Christie, if he enters the race, will need to find a way to avoid being portrayed as a governor who raised taxes.","337","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"

"CLIMATE CHANGE: There is no single defining piece of climate-change litigation, but industry representatives have brought multiple cases challenging virtually everything the Environmental Protection Agency has done to enforce the Clean Air Act. Last June, the E.P.A. issued its Clean Power Plan, which is designed to cut greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants by twenty-six per cent by 2020. In short order, twelve states (all Republican-dominated and reliant on coal for power) sued the E.P.A. to stop the regulations from going into effect.","353","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-threat-to-obama-from-the-courts"
"Of course, all Administrations see some of their initiatives challenged in court. The Supreme Court repeatedly rejected George W. Bush’s attempts to limit the legal rights of detainees in Guantanámo Bay. But the number and scope of the legal threats to Obama appear unprecedented. This comes in part because, these days, the extreme polarization of political opinion in Congress is reflected in the federal courts as well. On the Supreme Court and on lower courts, the differences between conservative and liberal federal judges can lead to dramatic differences in results. Sometimes, it’s worth it for challengers to roll the dice in front of the right judge.","354","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-threat-to-obama-from-the-courts"
"When I interviewed President Obama about legal matters, last year, he made another point about why litigation has become so important in contemporary Washington. He noted that there was once a time when Congress actually did pass laws to address national problems. Legislators enacted a major reform of immigration laws in 1986 and a significant addition to the Clean Air Act in 1990. But Congress has been paralyzed by partisan gridlock in recent years; its inability, or unwillingness, to address immigration is only the best known of its failures. When Congress doesn’t act, the underlying problems don’t go away—and a President will try to address them on his own. This leads to lawsuits in response. And now there are lots of them, and their verdicts will pass judgment on President Obama as much as on any individual issue.","355","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-threat-to-obama-from-the-courts"

"Set aside, for a moment, his repeated refusal, in the past few days, to say whether he believes that President Obama loves America, or whether he believes that the President is a Christian, and look instead at Walker’s record running what used to be one of America’s more progressive states. Having cut taxes for the wealthy and stripped many of Wisconsin’s public-sector unions of their collective-bargaining rights, he is now preparing to sign a legislative bill that would cripple unions in the private sector. Many wealthy conservatives, such as the Koch brothers, who have funnelled a lot of money to groups supporting Walker, regard him as someone who’s turning his state into a showcase for what they want the rest of America to look like.","357","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"But just how threatening is he? If you’ve been following the political news during the past week, you may well have the impression that he’s stumbling in his campaign for the 2016 G.O.P. nomination. Among the political commentariat, the consensus of opinion is that Walker’s repeated refusal to distance himself from Rudy Giuliani’s incendiary comments about Obama, and his subsequent encounter with the Washington Post’s Dan Balz and Robert Costa, during which he appeared to question Obama’s religious faith and took some shots at the media for asking him silly questions, weren’t merely reprehensible: they were serious gaffes that raised questions about Walker’s political abilities.","358","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"It wasn’t just liberal columnists who piled on. In a column at the Daily Beast, Matt Lewis, who also writes for the Daily Caller, said that Walker’s comments raised the question of whether he “might not be ready for prime time on the national stage.” Lewis went on: “Conservatives should be worried that Walker hasn’t proven capable of navigating these land mines.” MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, who is a former G.O.P. congressman, wrote at Politico: “Good candidates know how to make dumb questions look, well, dumb.”","359","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"Rather than deflecting the reporters’ queries about Obama’s beliefs, as other Republicans had done, Walker used them to send a none-too-subtle message to Republican voters. His refusal to say whether Obama was a Christian wasn’t merely a shot at a hostile media. As Dana Milbank, of the Washington Post noted, it allowed Walker to “wink and nod at the far-right fringe where people really believe that Obama is a Muslim from Kenya who hates America.” Milbank also wrote that Walker was “refusing to grant his opponent legitimacy as an American and a Christian.”","360","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"In a more just world, Walker’s indecent and craven antics would disqualify him from playing any further role in the Presidential race. But in the current political environment, his tactics, far from hurting him, may well bolster a candidacy that is already thriving.","361","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"Having cemented his reputation as an economic conservative, Walker is busy making a concerted effort to win over social conservatives and evangelical Christians, some of whom apparently believe that Obama is the Antichrist (or perhaps the Seventh King). Earlier this month, during a trip to London, he refused to say whether he believed in evolution, commenting: “That’s a question a politician shouldn’t be involved in, one way or the other.” In addition to making that hat tip to the Book of Genesis brigade, Walker has been reiterating his opposition to gay marriage and taking a notably harder line on abortion than he did during his gubernatorial reëlection campaign, last year. In a recent meeting with Iowa Republicans, the Times reported earlier this week, he stressed his support for a “personhood amendment” that would define life as beginning at conception and effectively outlaw the termination of pregnancies.","362","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"Evaluated in this context, Walker’s comments, or refusals to comment, about Obama’s beliefs look less like gaffes and more like carefully considered elements of a larger plan—and one that’s working for him. On Tuesday, the research firm Public Policy Polling released the results of a new national survey of Republican voters, which showed Walker leading the G.O.P. race, with twenty-five per cent of the vote. He was seven percentage points ahead of the candidate in second place, Ben Carson, the author and neurosurgeon, and eight percentage points ahead of Jeb Bush. “Walker is climbing fast in the polling because of his appeal to the most conservative elements of the Republican electorate,” said P.P.P. “Among ‘very conservative’ voters he leads with 37% to 19% for Carson, 12% for Bush, and 11% for Huckabee.”","363","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"This is just one poll, and the sample size was small—three hundred and sixteen—but recent state-level polls also show Walker near or in the lead. In California, according to the highly respected Field poll, he’s favored by eighteen per cent of Republicans. Bush is in second place with sixteen per cent, and Rand Paul is in third place with ten per cent. In Texas, a survey carried out by the University of Texas at Austin shows Walker running second, but he’s trailing local boy Ted Cruz by just one percentage point. When a previous poll was taken, in October, only two per cent of Texan Republicans favored Walker; now, he’s standing at nineteen per cent. In South Carolina, according to another P.P.P. survey, he’s also running second, just one point behind Bush, and leading Lindsey Graham, the state’s senior representative in the U.S. Senate.","364","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"It’s still early, very early, of course. But Walker is an ambitious and determined politician who has already been through one tough race—his 2012 recall election—that subjected him to a great deal of media attention and hostility from Democrats. Thanks to his ties to the conservative plutocracy, he’s almost certainly going to have some serious money behind him, and he is trying to pitch his campaign in the sweet spot of G.O.P. primaries, where conservatism and antagonism toward coastal élites meets electability. He has the advantage of youthfulness, at age forty-seven, and, finally, as he pointed out to a convention of Christian broadcasters on Monday, he is, “unlike some out there,” a self-made fellow who “didn’t inherit fame or fortune from my family.” That jab was presumably aimed at Jeb Bush, but if Walker were to get the G.O.P. nomination, it could be modified and directed at Hillary Clinton, assuming that she wins the Democratic nomination.","365","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"

"In July, 1953, a former Communist named Manning Johnson testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee about the menacing implications of Bolshevism in American life. He warned that Communists had infiltrated civil-rights organizations, making it difficult to distinguish the movement for racial equality from the movement for centralization and wealth redistribution. The civil-rights movement was often accused of Communist subversion, so little about the appearance warranted particular notice, save for one fact: Johnson was African-American. Black critics howled accusations of racial betrayal, but Johnson was engaged in something subtly different and vastly more interesting: desegregating the American tradition of paranoia.","March 10, 2015","367","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"

"It’s tempting to see Ben Carson—neurosurgeon, notable black success, conservative pundit, and coquettish potential Presidential candidate—as this election’s Herman Cain: the black conservative whose mere presence inoculates other Republicans from charges of racism as they attack Obama. The ability to provide that kind of racial cover may be part of the reason for Carson’s prominence in the party, but it’s not its overriding rationale. Instead, Carson is heir to the tradition of people like Manning Johnson and George Schuyler, the black conservative who defended Joseph McCarthy even after McCarthy’s fellow Senate Republicans rejected his conspiratorial canards. To the broad public, Carson’s crackpottery—his argument that the sexual behavior of prisoners proves that homosexuality is a choice, his contention that Obamacare is the biggest travesty to befall the nation since slavery, his theory that Obama may declare martial law and cancel the 2016 elections—disqualifies him from being taken seriously. But, for the small segment of the population that he is concerned with, those statements are assurances that they are not monochromatically white. Carson is a black representative and standard-bearer, not for conservatives but for paranoid Americans.","369","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"Carson first attracted mainstream attention when, in February, 2013, he delivered the keynote speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, which he prefaced several times with warnings about his disdain for political correctness. Carson, as is his habit, opened with the impressive details of his personal biography: the impoverished childhood in a single-parent household, in Detroit; the moral values inculcated in him by his illiterate but fiercely protective mother; the against-the-odds success that validates his creed of hard work, godliness, and education. With President Obama seated just feet from him, he went on to warn of the dangers of the federal deficit, advocate a flat tax based upon Biblical tithing, and endorse private health-care accounts that would replace the Affordable Care Act.","370","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"While Internet commentators hailed Carson’s speech for “wiping the smile off Obama’s face,” the President’s countenance would have been more aptly described as expressing a default neutrality. None of Carson’s comments marked him as exceedingly conservative; it wouldn’t be difficult to find Democrats who share those sentiments. In fact, Carson’s Booker T. Washington-esque prescriptions of personal virtue as a cure for poverty are almost identical to the arguments that Obama himself deploys when talking to black audiences. Nor do these admonishments encompass the entirety of Carson’s thinking on matters of race. The National Prayer Breakfast speech became the basis for his book “One Nation,” in which he criticizes racial profiling:","371","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"Even with the false note of evenhandedness, in which Martin’s death is the product of shared racism, this marks a departure from the reactionary arguments made by other black conservatives, like Carol Swain, in which Martin was seen as essentially responsible for his own death. And, at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, Carson urged congressional Republicans to create an alternate plan to insure health benefits for poor people before dismantling Obamacare. He is not among those who feel that the government has no role in insuring that the poor have access to health care.","372","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"Yet if Carson is only moderately conservative, he’s radically paranoid. His rhetoric betrays a sweaty-palmed fixation on government power, and a fear that President Obama has made himself into an American Caesar. Those fears are most clearly manifested in his tendency toward hyperbolic comparison. From his somewhat nuanced take, in “One Nation,” on Trayvon Martin’s death, Carson goes on to argue that the liberal disdain for black conservatives is as pernicious as Jim Crow. At the Values Voter Summit in 2013, he compared the Affordable Care Act to slavery, and argued that both are mechanisms of government control. This is part of a world view in which homosexuality is a matter of volition and possibly a product of a willful, covert effort to subvert traditional values. This is why Carson is able to reconcile support of civil rights for African-Americans with their denial to gays and lesbians, as he stated on CNN last week. African-Americans are not, after all, black on purpose.","373","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"The most relevant comparison for Carson isn’t to Cain but to Michele Bachmann, the last Presidential aspirant who, despite membership in a group with a history as targets of discrimination, came to represent the twitchy ideals of American panic. Carson has written of his youth, “Many of the whites in those days found ways to rationalize their unjust treatment of fellow human beings, arguing that they were not racists but rather protectors of traditional values.” Carson’s presence as a potential Presidential candidate represents a triumph, albeit a cynical one, over those rationalizations. He’s moved the country one step closer to that moment when we will be measured not by the color of our skin but by the content of our conspiracy theories.","374","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"The Obama Administration has just released its budget for the 2016 fiscal year, which begins on October 1st. I’ll write in a later post about the economics underlying the proposals. In the meantime, based on a reading of the budget documents and a fact sheet posted on the White House Web site, here are some initial takeaways:","February 2, 2015","375","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"1. With the Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress, the budget is as much a political document as an economic one. The chances that it will be enacted in anything like its current form are nil. Instead, the White House is using it to frame the political debate for this year and for the run-up to the 2016 Presidential election—an effort that began with the State of the Union address. The budget fleshes out the populist political agenda that President Obama laid out in that speech.","376","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"","377","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"2. The Administration is proposing a series of tax cuts and spending programs aimed at working families, which would be largely paid for by raising taxes on the rich. This agenda is being marketed, as it was in the State of the Union, under the banner of “middle-class economics.” “The ideas I offer in this budget are designed to bring middle-class economics into the twenty-first century,” President Obama said in a statement. “They’ll help working families feel more secure with paychecks that go further, help American workers upgrade their skills so they can compete for higher-paying jobs, and help create the conditions for our businesses to keep generating good new jobs for our workers to fill.”","378","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"3. In adopting an economic agenda that is explicitly redistributive, the White House is seeking to tackle the glaring problems of wage stagnation and rising inequality, while also daring Republicans to oppose some measures that are likely to be popular. These measures include a new five-hundred-dollar tax credit for second earners, an expansion of the earned-income tax credit, and an increase in the value of existing tax credits available to families paying for child care. In addition, the budget would increase funding for Head Start, Pell Grants, and Obama’s initiative to provide universal preschool, which he unveiled last year.","379","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"4. The budget still includes the President’s plan to provide free tuition for two years of community college for all students who graduate from high school with decent grades. Under the original plan, his initiative would have been paid for by eliminating some of the tax benefits attached to college savings accounts, known as 529s, the benefits of which are largely enjoyed by affluent families. But, after objections from Republicans and Democrats, the White House dropped this proposal. Now the money for the community-college plan will come from general tax revenues.","380","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"5. As indicated by No. 4, the White House’s definition of “middle class” is a bit hazy. The extra funds allotted to the earned-income tax credit, Head Start, community college, and Pell Grants would all be directed at households in the bottom half of the income distribution in the U.S. But it looks like all families, regardless of income, would be eligible for the second-earner tax credit, while families who earn up to a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year would be eligible for the tax credits tied to child care. If your family earns a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year, you are firmly in the top twenty per cent of the income distribution—it’s hard to describe that as middle class. Still, according to a detailed analysis by the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, by far the biggest beneficiaries from Obama’s proposals would be the working poor.","381","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"6. The budget contains three significant tax increases, all of which Obama mentioned in his State of the Union address. The first would raise the estate-tax bills that very wealthy families face, and would do so by eliminating the so-called stepped-up basis for valuing investments in the federal tax code. The budget would also raise the capital-gains tax rate paid by high earners from twenty per cent to twenty-eight per cent. In addition, the Administration would levy a new surcharge on big, highly leveraged financial firms, reflecting the risks they present to the rest of the economy.","382","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"7. Considered on their own merits, many of these policy proposals are well targeted and worthwhile. But nobody should pretend that they would make a big dent in inequality and wage stagnation. For the broad middle class—households situated between the twentieth percentile and the eightieth percentile of the income distribution—the measures, taken together, would raise after-tax incomes by just 0.1 per cent, or even less, according to the Tax Policy Center. (Households in the bottom quintile would see their after-tax incomes rise by one per cent. Households in the top quintile would see their after-tax incomes fall by 0.7 per cent.)","383","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"8. The budget would abolish the sequester and raise domestic spending by about seven per cent in 2016, with the increase evenly split between defense and non-defense programs. The White House says that this increase in spending would be paid for by cuts to other programs, such as agricultural subsidies, and by the elimination of the “carried interest” deduction for hedge funds and private equity firms. These are also good ideas. It barely needs saying that there is no prospect of Congress going along with them.","384","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"9. The White House is also proposing a one-off levy of fifteen per cent on corporate profits held overseas, the proceeds of which would be used to finance investments in road, airports, and other infrastructure projects. After years of neglect, the country’s infrastructure sorely needs upgrading. But this proposal is really just part of an opening bid in a larger debate about how to reform the corporate tax. Since this debate could lead to big corporations seeing their tax rates reduced from thirty-five per cent to twenty-eight per cent, or even less, this is one area where the Republicans may well be willing to coöperate with the Obama Administration.","385","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"10. Rather than seeking to balance the books within ten years, which is what Paul Ryan always claims (with very little plausibility) that his budget proposals would do, the White House is aiming to stabilize the deficit at about 2.5 per cent of G.D.P. That’s not far from where it is now. Later on, I’ll address the economics of all this. From a political perspective, the White House’s budget projections are all of a piece with its over-all strategy. For years, Washington has been fixated on eliminating the budget deficit entirely. The Administration is betting that the American public, in its eagerness to see the fruits of the economic recovery more widely shared, is now willing to tolerate a modest deficit for the indefinite future.","386","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-budget-ten-takeaways"
"Whatever happened to Marco Rubio? In February, 2013, his picture appeared on the cover of Time magazine, accompanied by the headline “The Republican Savior.” At the time, many political analysts—Bill Clinton reportedly among them—viewed the Florida senator as a big threat to the Democrats in 2016. Now, following his announcement on Monday in Miami, he’s officially in the race for the Republican nomination, but as a rank outsider. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, just 7.5 per cent of likely Republican voters consider him their first-choice candidate. That puts him in seventh place, behind Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ben Carson, and Mike Huckabee.","April 14, 2015","387","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"Of course, it’s early in the process. Having gone all in, Rubio might get a boost, just as Cruz, the junior senator from Texas, has since he announced his candidacy last month. Right now, though, it’s hard to see how he could challenge the front-runners. Although Rubio was elected to the Senate in 2010 as part of the Tea Party wave, and although he still espouses extreme views on issues like climate change (he’s a skeptic) and same-sex marriage (he opposes it), many people in the conservative movement don’t view him as a true believer. In any case, the right-wing end of the Republican field is very crowded. Rubio’s best hope is probably to position himself as a center-right candidate and hope for a slipup on the part of Jeb Bush, his fellow Floridian.","388","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"

"The proximate cause of Rubio’s current problems is well known: his role in co-sponsoring a bipartisan immigration-reform bill that would have established a lengthy pathway to citizenship for law-abiding undocumented immigrants. With the support of Rubio and thirteen other Republicans, the Senate passed the bill in June, 2013. After the bill generated a backlash among conservative and anti-immigration groups and died in the House of Representatives, Rubio backtracked, disavowing the legislation and saying that it wasn’t realistic. But the damage to his reputation on the right had been done. And so, as the race to 2016 began to shape up, Rubio found himself outflanked by other conservative hopefuls, such as Cruz and Walker.","390","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"In the past year or so, Rubio has been trying to regain the trust of his party’s hard-liners, saying that nobody has an automatic right to immigrate to the United States and stressing that improving border security should be the first priority. He’s had some success in this enterprise. “I think that Sen. Rubio has done something that most politicians don’t do,” Jenny Beth Martin, the president and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots group, told Politico. “He evaluated what went wrong … [and] is working to make sure he doesn’t make the same mistakes again. I think that neutralizes his mistakes.”","391","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"But what use is a Marco Rubio who panders to the right on his defining issue? The Republican Party is chockablock with supine politicians of this sort, and that helps to explain why it has lost the popular vote in five of the last six Presidential elections. The thing that made Rubio an exciting figure a few years ago, the reason he landed on the front of Time magazine, was that he seemed to combine youth, a compelling personal story, and conservative views with a willingness to reach out to parts of the electorate that the G.O.P. had neglected, particularly, but not exclusively, Hispanics. Immigration reform was supposed to be the test case for whether the Republican Party could adopt a more pragmatic and inclusive approach, and when it sunk, it took Rubio down with it.","392","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"The bigger story is that this Republican golden boy fell victim to what I refer to as the three-strikes theory of politics. If you look around, you will find that it generally takes not just one or two but three defeats for an unpopular political party to reform itself and abandon the things that made it unpopular. Because of the influence of established politicians, vested interests, and ideology, all democratic parties tend to resist change. Two strikes aren’t enough to overcome this inertia. Only after a third successive beating at the hands of voters can reformers overcome the ideologues and seize control of the party.","393","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"Of course, it’s only a theory, and it has its exceptions. But look at what happened to the Democratic Party in the nineteen-eighties. After losing to the Republicans for a third successive time in 1988, Bill Clinton and his business-friendly “New Democrats” gradually gained the upper hand and won the 1992 election. Something similar happened in the United Kingdom, when the Labour Party, after defeats in 1981, 1984, and 1987, jettisoned much of its ideological baggage: its commitments to public ownership, unilateral disarmament, and compulsory trade-union membership. The more recent experience in France, which saw the Socialist Party lose Presidential elections in 1995, 2002, and 2007, isn’t quite as stark, perhaps, in that the current President, François Hollande, could hardly be described as a great departure from previous Socialist leaders. But even Hollande, in the run-up to the 2012 Presidential election, advocated for some policies that had previously been considered off limits, such as raising contributions to the retirement system and making it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers.","394","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"Where are the Republican reformers? Despite talk about making the party more electable, the evidence suggests that the G.O.P. ultras, even if they don’t hold many very senior posts in the party, retain an effective veto over any efforts to modernize. With Rubio now parroting the immigration line laid down by Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, et al., the task of taming the right wing has passed to Bush, who, to his credit, has not yet backed down from his support for comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for the undocumented.","395","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"As I’ve mentioned before, Bush is hardly a moderate. During his eight years as governor of Florida, he pursued a stridently conservative agenda on spending, taxes, labor laws, and many other issues. Still, compared with the likes of Cruz, Walker, and Carson, he’s practically a Rockefeller Republican. But if you look at the surveys of Republican voters collected on Real Clear Politics that I cited earlier, you will find that Bush is stuck at well under twenty per cent. If you then add together the vote shares of Walker, Cruz, Paul, Carson, and Huckabee, all avowedly conservative candidates, you get a total of 53.1 per cent. Add in Rick Perry and Rick Santorum, and the conservative tally is even higher.","396","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"Based on this evidence, the G.O.P. doesn’t look like a party that is ready to embrace change. And that’s why Rubio already looks like an also-ran.

"On one level, Paul’s prediction may prove correct. Many viewers of Hannity and other Fox programs will probably seize on the new book in order to confirm their view that Hillary Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency. But none of these people were going to vote for her anyway. Politically, the important question is what impact, if any, the book’s allegations will have on independent voters, who may or may not vote for Clinton, and also on liberal Democrats who are inclined to vote for her, and maybe even to campaign for her, but who still have some reservations.","402","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"On this front, my guess is that “Clinton Cash” (whose full title is “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich”) could end up benefitting Hillary. With Hannity and other conservative media figures piling on, the Clinton campaign will be able to portray questions about the Clinton Foundation and the family’s finances as a political witch-hunt rather than a legitimate exercise in vetting Presidential candidates. And if that happens, many Americans may end up dismissing the whole thing as a partisan squabble.","403","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"Obviously, this is speculation. Not having read the book, which comes out on May 5th, I am relying on accounts from journalists who have. But if their versions of what the book contains are accurate, then Schweizer doesn’t back up his suggestions of wrongdoing with much in the way concrete evidence, which would allow the Clintons’ defenders to go on the offensive. Indeed, this is already happening. On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Tuesday, David Brock, the founder of Media Matters, the liberal-leaning media watchdog, who recently appears to have morphed into a Clinton campaign spokesman, said, “I think this is a political put-up job, and I can smell it from a mile away.”","404","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"Schweizer is a former fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of several conservative policy tomes as well as books about the Bush family and the Reagan Administration. According to the biography on his Web site, he served as a speechwriting consultant to the Bush Administration from 2008 to 2009. He is now the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative research organization based in Florida that, during the 2012 campaign, issued a report accusing the Obama Administration of illegally soliciting foreign donations. On the other side of the ledger, he has written two books about money and politics that criticized politicians from both parties, including Dennis Hastert, the former Republican Speaker of the House. One of them, published in 2011, was titled “Throw Them All Out.”","405","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"But most of Schweizer’s writing appears to have been directed at Democrats, and he is clearly a man of the right. In 2011, the Times reported that he was advising Sarah Palin on foreign policy. Brock, during his appearance on MSNBC, claimed that the Government Accountability Institute has received funding from entities affiliated with the Koch brothers, adding, “It’s subsidized by Hillary Clinton’s enemies.” On Tuesday night, according to Politico’s Gabriel Debenedetti, Brian Fallon, Clinton’s press secretary, circulated a memo to the campaign’s surrogates and allies, echoing Brock’s charges. “The book was backed by a Koch Brothers–linked organization and a billionaire family that is bankrolling Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign,” Fallon wrote.","406","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"It will be one thing if Schweizer has the goods on the Clintons—i.e., detailed evidence supporting his claim that policy decisions were influenced by financial donations and speaking fees. But, despite Rand Paul’s claims, it doesn’t sound as though the book will supply that level of detail. Reportedly, Schweizer relies heavily on timelines, linking the dates of donations to the Clinton Foundation and speaking fees paid to Bill Clinton with actions by the State Department while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. The Times’s Amy Chozick, for example, writes that Schweizer cites a free-trade agreement with Colombia that benefitted a major donor to the Clinton Foundation, and payments to Bill Clinton by a Canadian bank and a big shareholder in the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which the State Department was studying at the time.","407","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"The timelines are suggestive, but are they anything more than that? Many interested parties and institutions were weighing in on issues like trade deals and the Keystone pipeline, and former Obama Administration officials have already dismissed any suggestion that the Colombia agreement was altered to reward a Clinton Foundation donor. In a blog post published on Tuesday, another person who got hold of Schweizer’s book, Aviva Shen, a senior editor at Think Progress—which is published by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank with ties to the Clintons—writes, “Schweizer makes clear that he does not intend to present a smoking gun, despite the media speculation. . . . Schweizer explains he cannot prove the allegations, leaving that up to investigative journalists and possibly law enforcement.” Shen also quotes Schweizer on the Clintons: “We cannot ultimately know what goes on in their minds and ultimately provide the links between the money they took and the benefits that subsequently accrued to themselves, their friends, and their associates.”","408","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"Of course, given the wealth that the Clintons have accumulated since Bill Clinton left office, it is perfectly legitimate, and, indeed, imperative, for journalists to examine their finances and try to identify possible conflicts of interest. News outlets such as the Post, the Times, and the Wall Street Journal have been delving into these issues for months, generating lots of stories and quite a bit of critical commentary. (Back in February, I published a long post on Hillary Clinton’s money issues. My colleague Amy Davidson has also been following the story closely.)","409","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"In this context, it is neither surprising nor scandalous that several news organizations, including the Times and the Post, have reportedly made deals with HarperCollins, Schweizer’s publisher, to view the book in advance of its publication date. “We are always willing to look at new information that could inform our coverage,” Cameron Barr, the Post’s national editor, said in a statement reported by Politico’s Dylan Byers. “Mr. Schweizer’s background and his point of view are relevant factors, but not disqualifying ones. What interests us more are his facts and whether they can be the basis for further reporting by our own staff that would be compelling to our readers. There is no financial aspect to this arrangement.”","410","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"To repeat, there is nothing untoward about this. The job of news organizations is to ferret out newsworthy stories, check their veracity, and publish them. In this instance, they were on the case well before Schweizer’s book landed.","411","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"From here on out, however, things could get tricky for journalists covering the Clinton donations. Every word they write will be doubly scrutinized for evidence of political bias, and Hillary Clinton’s campaign operatives will be on hand to dismiss as part of a G.O.P.-inspired vendetta anything that is critical of the candidate. Until this week, it was easy to label such tactics as political spin, and few fair-minded people questioned the credibility of the Clinton money stories or the motivations of those writing and publishing them. Now that Schweizer has entered the fray, with the likes of Hannity and Paul to ballyhoo what appear to be largely unsubstantiated allegations, partisan politics is likely to color the views of the broader public. If and when Hillary Clinton falls back on the old argument that it’s all a right-wing conspiracy against her and her family, many people might well be prepared to take her at her word.","412","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"The soft rollout of Jeb Bush’s 2016 Presidential bid continues. Last week, he gave a widely covered speech in Detroit. On Tuesday, he launched jebemails.com, which hosts the first chapter of a new e-book featuring e-mail exchanges from his eight years as the governor of Florida. “Some are funny; some are serious; some I wrote in frustration,” Bush writes on the home page. “But they’re all here so you can read them and make up your own mind.”","February 10, 2015","413","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"

"Actually—just as you’d expect from a nascent campaign that is already showing considerable discipline—the e-mails appear to have been carefully selected to make Bush appear to have been attuned to the concerns of ordinary Florida voters. Nonetheless, the e-mails do highlight something important about Bush and how his Presidential campaign is likely to unfold. In the early stages of a contest set to feature Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, to name but two G.O.P. rabble-rousers, Bush has often been portrayed as moderate—someone willing to confront party ultras on issues like immigration and same-sex marriage. But that’s not necessarily how Bush sees himself, and, as his e-mails confirm, it’s not what he projected when he entered the Florida governor’s mansion in 1999. Then, as now, he viewed himself as an energetic conservative reformer, with the emphasis on conservative.","415","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"After being narrowly defeated in the 1994 gubernatorial election, Bush ran again in 1998, pledging to reduce the state’s tax burden, which was already low compared with that in some parts of the country, and to downsize the state’s payroll, which he described as a chronic drag on economic growth. “One of our goals should be to have fewer government employees each year we are serving,” he wrote in an e-mail to his staff, dated December 19, 1998. “Labor has huge potential to be reduced, possibly in half.” This animus toward public employees stayed with him. “I look forward to the time when these buildings of government are empty … silent monuments to the time when government played a larger role than it deserved or could adequately fill,” he said in his second inaugural address, delivered in January, 2003.","416","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"Indeed, Bush’s anti-government, pro-business instincts informed virtually all of his time as governor. He promised to get rid of regulations that restricted new developments. He said he’d take on the teachers’ unions by introducing choice and increasing the use of standardized testing in public schools. And he set out to reform the state-run Medicaid program. During his two terms in office, he followed through in all of these areas.","417","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"Bush also pushed through the biggest tax cuts in Florida’s history, vetoed spending increases that had been approved by the state legislature, and reduced the number of public-sector employees by about seven per cent. He required all schoolchildren to be tested regularly, initiated the performance-grading of their schools, and introduced a voucher system for charter schools, which the state’s Supreme Court struck down, in 2006. On the health-care front, he introduced a pilot program that allowed Medicaid recipients to select from a range of commercial health-care plans. Democrats, and some medical providers, accused him of following an ideologically driven agenda of privatization and cost-cutting that would end up harming patients. Conservatives hailed his reforms as a model for the rest of the country.","418","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"In short, Governor Jeb Bush wasn’t some sort of wishy-washy moderate. In a state traditionally dominated by a powerful legislature, he was, in the words of the University of North Florida political scientist Matthew Corrigan, “the first governor in Florida history to combine a strongly conservative agenda with an activist approach to government.” Last year, Corrigan published a book about Bush’s governorship, “Conservative Hurricane: How Jeb Bush Remade Florida.” It followed that of another academic, Robert Crew, of Florida State University, who published “Jeb Bush: Aggressive Conservatism in Florida,” in 2009. The two authors differ in their conclusions—Corrigan writes that Bush’s reforms were “long lasting and important,” while Crew is more skeptical—but they agree that, far from adopting the centrist template used by Mitt Romney and other moderate G.O.P. governors, Bush was a conservative whirlwind.","419","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"If he were elected President, there is no reason to doubt that he would pursue an equally activist and conservative agenda. In terms of its animating principles, a Jeb Bush Administration would be much closer to that of George W. Bush than that of George H.W. Bush.","420","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"The unresolved question is which policy areas a third President Bush would emphasize. Because of widespread opposition to the mathematics and English-language-arts standards known as the Common Core, which Bush strongly supports, education reform would present a problem for him. Immigration reform, another of Bush’s pet issues, is equally problematic. As for the old standby of pledging to cut taxes, which he did successfully in Florida, the Republican Party has been struggling for years to demonstrate that such cuts can be reconciled with balancing the budget. And the proposition that all deficits are bad isn’t one that any of the G.O.P. candidates in 2016 is likely to question.","421","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"In this environment, Bush’s task is to carve out an economic message that resonates with a wide swath of voters and also has some credibility. In Detroit, he spoke in generalities, earning poor reviews in some quarters, even as he was praised in others for being cagey. Still, the language he used was instructive. Accepting the terms of public debate set down by decades of wage stagnation, he identified an “opportunity gap” and said, “Far too many Americans live on the edge of economic ruin. And many more feel like they’re stuck in place, working longer and harder, even as they’re losing ground.”","422","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"Having identified the challenge, Bush, on this occasion, failed to meet it. As a way of boosting incomes and encouraging individual effort simultaneously, other ambitious Republicans, such as Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan, have proposed expanding the earned-income tax credit, which is effectively a federal wage subsidy for low-paid workers. If Bush knows about this proposal (and he surely does), he didn’t mention it. Indeed, conspicuously lacking from his presentation was any acknowledgement that a reformed tax and benefits system could help to tackle the economic problems he identified. Rather than engaging with a topic that is keenly discussed among self-identified “reform conservatives,” he fell back on G.O.P. boilerplate: bashing the government and raising the spectre of mass welfare dependency.","423","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"Citing the example of Detroit, he argued that “decades of big-government policies” had undermined the case for top-down measures designed to bolster economic opportunity. “Government inefficiency isn’t just irritating,” he said. “It’s instructive. If the government can’t collect parking fines or sell snacks on a train, why would government know how to enable every citizen to move up in life?” The answer, of course, was that supporters of government activism wouldn’t know how to help. “Instead of a safety net to cushion our occasional falls, they have built a spider web that traps people in perpetual dependence,” Bush continued.","424","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"To have a serious chance of becoming President, he will have to go beyond such applause lines. Under the banner of promoting more rapid and evenly divided economic growth, he’ll be forced to defend whatever proposals he offers for education, immigration reform, and free trade. He’ll also need to carve out a position on Obamacare and find a tax proposal that promises something to the broad middle class but also meets the test of plausibility that Mitt Romney’s 2012 plan failed.","425","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"Nobody should take seriously Romney’s barbed hint, in his announcement that he wouldn’t run for the Republican nomination, that Bush isn’t a genuine conservative. But a Bush plan, if he gets it right, would explicitly acknowledge that the Republican Party needs to adapt its thinking to the needs of the twenty-first century, while also encompassing some of the optimism and openness to outsiders that used to define Sun Belt conservatism.","426","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"

"The gaffe was quickly forgiven. Obama was a self-proclaimed “Star Trek” fan; at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles, in 2007, he had spotted Nimoy across the room—their first contact—and flashed him the Vulcan salute. Nimoy wrote in his memoir that “Spock was a character whose time had come. He represented a practical, reasoning voice in a period of dissension and chaos.” (The actor apparently saw similar qualities in the President.) Obama was frequently likened to Spock—even, slyly, by Obama himself. Eulogizing Nimoy, who died last week, Obama spoke admiringly of the character, whom he described as “cool, logical, big-eared, and level-headed.” He added, “I loved Spock.”","431","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"
"Nimoy was also a lifelong liberal. Born in Boston, he decided to be an actor at the age of seventeen, after appearing in a local production of “Awake and Sing!,” Clifford Odets’s gritty Depression-era drama. Odets’s portrayal of a “young man surrounded by a hostile and repressive environment” had, Nimoy recalled, “so touched a responsive chord that I decided to make a career of acting.” He struggled in the profession at the start, but decided to stick with it when, working as a cab driver in Los Angeles, he picked up a young Senator John F. Kennedy and drove him to the airport. The competition was unrelenting for both politicians and entertainers, Kennedy said, but he assured him, “Just remember: there’s always room for one more good one.”","432","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"
"Once Nimoy became famous, as Spock, he used his celebrity to promote political causes. He spoke at anti-Vietnam War rallies (as did the other Spock, Benjamin). In 1968, the teen magazine FaVE! published a letter addressed to Spock from a girl who was the offspring of a biracial marriage—as was Spock (and as is Obama)—asking for advice on coping with racism. Nimoy was moved to write a response, headlined “Spock: Teenage Outcast.” “Spock learned he could save himself from letting prejudice get him down,” Nimoy wrote. “He could do this by really being himself and knowing his own value as a person.”","433","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"
"In 1972, Nimoy stumped nationwide for George McGovern. (In gratitude, McGovern read some of Nimoy’s poetry into the Congressional Record.) Asked whether it was appropriate for an actor to make political speeches, Nimoy said, “Well, I think it’s about as fair as Ronald Reagan running for governor of California based on the fact that he’s done some movies.” Every four years, “Spock for President” bumper stickers appeared on cars across the country. Nimoy even sang a spirited version of the Pete Seeger classic “If I Had a Hammer,” which appeared on his albums “The Way I Feel” and “Highly Illogical.” In 2012, he narrated a fake convention bio-pic, “Mitt Romney: A Human Who Built That,” for “The Daily Show.”","434","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"
"Obama wasn’t the only politician to mourn Nimoy’s passing. Justin Trudeau, the leader of Canada’s Liberal Party, tweeted a picture of himself making the Vulcan salute, adding, “For us Trekkies he was—and always shall be—our friend. #LLAP.” (The Canadian Design Resource issued a call for citizens to “Spock your fives,” an ongoing, informal art project in which Canadians add Spock’s ears, hair, and eyebrows to the portrait of the former Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier on the five-dollar bill.)","435","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"
"Elsewhere on the political spectrum, Bill Post, a former conservative radio host who won a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives last year and who calls himself “the biggest ‘Star Trek’ fan in the Oregon Legislature,” said that Spock was the “greatest Republican in the history of the galaxy,” adding, “he was a legal alien who believed in prosperity.” It is true that Nimoy lived long and prospered. Still, it is doubtful that either Nimoy, a former sergeant in the United States Army, or Spock, a Starfleet commander of the United Federation of Planets, would have approved of last week’s Republican gambit to deport millions of undocumented immigrants by threatening to shut down the Department of Homeland Security. The attempt collapsed Friday, a few hours after Nimoy died. The funding issue will be taken up again this week, but Spock, as usual, was correct: it may take something like a Vulcan mind meld to sort this Congress out.","436","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"

"When Barack Obama took office, in 2009, he had a long agenda—mending a collapsing economy, transforming health care, and ending two wars, to name just the top items. Nominating judges to the federal judiciary was low on the list. The President filled two quick vacancies on the Supreme Court with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. As for the dozens of vacancies on the federal circuit and district courts, Obama’s attention was fleeting. He didn’t even submit nominees to fill many judicial vacancies, including on the D.C. Circuit, which is generally regarded as the second most important court in the country.

"When Republicans took control of the House of Representatives after the 2010 elections, the President’s chances for pushing through meaningful legislation vanished. But the Senate, which is responsible for confirming judges, remained in Democratic hands—and in 2013, Reid took charge of the issue. The Senate had confirmed only five Obama appointees to the federal appeals court in the election year of 2012, but Reid moved to double the pace in 2013. Republicans responded by filibustering almost every judicial appointment to the appeals court and slow-walking appointments to the district court, which had been routine and uncontroversial under earlier Presidents. Reid fought back, and kept pushing the President’s nominees. In time, though, Reid came to a crossroads.","441","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-harry-reid-changed-the-federal-courts"
"Reid had fifty-five Democrats in the Senate—enough for a majority but not enough to beat back Republican filibusters. So, in December, 2013, Reid invoked what became known as the nuclear option. With Reid’s blessing, Senate Democrats changed the rules so that only a majority would be required to move lower-court judgeships to a vote. Freed from the threat of filibusters, Reid pushed through thirteen appeals-court judges in 2013 and 2014, a group of exceptional quality. They included Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard, and Robert Wilkins on the D.C. Circuit. For the first time in decades, that court now has a majority of Democratic appointees. Other confirmations included such luminaries as Pamela Harris (a noted professor and advocate) on the Fourth Circuit, Jill Pryor on the Eleventh, and David Barron (a Harvard law professor and Obama Administration lawyer) on the First. None received more than sixty votes, meaning that they would not have been confirmed had Reid not changed the rules. In future decades, many of these judges will be candidates for promotion if a Democratic President has a Supreme Court vacancy to fill. At the same time, Reid pushed through more than a hundred district-court judges in his last two years as Majority Leader. Of course, almost all of these judges will serve long after Barack Obama and Harry Reid have left office.","442","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-harry-reid-changed-the-federal-courts"

Congress is famous now mostly for its dysfunction, but as Reid has shown the Senate can be made to work. With focus, passion, and relentless attention to the goal before him, he remade the federal judiciary.

In 1968, they took back the White House, in an election that looked closer than it was because a conservative third-party candidate, George Wallace, had siphoned off 13.5 per cent of the vote from Richard Nixon.

"Hillary Clinton is the least instinctive of politicians; you can almost see her thinking her way through a situation. The master situation for her, from the time of her political awakening through her early sixties, when she first ran for President, was the difficulty of winning in American politics as a liberal. This may help explain her much-disputed decision to bring in Mark Penn, who made his early reputation by figuring out how to achieve Democratic victories in a Republican era, as her chief strategist in the 2008 campaign. Clinton was obviously not looking for a strategist who could help her connect with voters on the left. If you were writing fiction, it would be too heavily ironic to deal her the fate of being defeated by someone who felt less constrained about owning up to a youthful admiration for Alinsky.","447","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"In the early phases of the 2016 campaign, there is no form of high-end political expertise that Clinton doesn’t have at her disposal—including much of the leadership of the campaign staff that defeated her in 2008. One can only imagine the polls, the focus groups, and the staff retreats that underlay her runic two-minute announcement video—a high-gloss little movie that was devoted to “everyday Americans,” included a bit of rhetoric about the deck being stacked against them, and hardly showed the candidate herself. The clear message was that Clinton has gone from decades of being spooked by the right to, now, being spooked by the left. The video had none of the old, formerly magical symbolic touchpoints of baby-boom liberal politicians who wanted to win: there was no mention of tax cuts, crime-fighting, militarism, or religion, and there were hardly any white males. The only arguably centrist notes struck were a couple of glowing mentions of small business and a very veiled possible reference to charter schools.","448","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"

But in the process they drove many who were more socially liberal away. And, because the political system is in constant flux, even as the Democratic and Republican parties have become more efficiently liberal and conservative, generating the hyper-partisanship that everyone claims to despise, each has begun to show a new set of internal strains. The Republicans have to try to unite affluent economic conservatives with financially struggling evangelicals. The Democratic Party that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama made, and that Hillary Clinton now inherits, encompasses minorities, labor unions, and single women, plus significant portions of Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and the broad professional upper-middle class in big metropolitan areas, especially on the coasts. (The historic home of the Bush family, Greenwich, Connecticut, is now represented in Congress by a Democrat.) The Democrats’ diversity enables them to achieve rough financial parity with the Republicans, but it has to be tricky to manage.","449","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"The announcement video indicates that the Clinton campaign believes that in this cycle, the core appeal to Democratic and potentially Democratic voters has to be based on economics. Voters want to hear that the generation-long stall-out of the American working and middle classes’ fortunes is somehow going to end. The problem is that, right now, the Democratic coalition seems to be in agreement on the formerly radioactive social issues—ethnicity, sexuality, values—but not on the economic issues that will define the election. In the video you can detect the hope that it will be possible to declare that the campaign is all about economics, and then to spend it talking mainly about other things. Does Hillary Clinton want to raise taxes on the rich? More heavily regulate financial institutions? Make unions more politically powerful? Throw some sand in the gears of globalization by restricting free trade? These are the kinds of questions that have historically gone along with an overriding concern with the welfare of “everyday Americans,” but they are not pleasant ones for the campaign, because in each case, a clear answer would alienate an element of the Democratic Party.","450","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"Don’t think of this problem as being only about Clinton’s keeping the Elizabeth Warren wing of her party on board through the nomination. Last week, John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio, who’s thinking of jumping into the Presidential race, made a point of going on national television and complaining at some length about “greed” on Wall Street. That indicates that he thinks there may be a way to run against both Clinton and Jeb Bush on what might be called Main Street economics, from within the Republican Party. Exactly what to say about the tough economic situation faced by most Americans could be as tricky for Clinton in the general election as it will be in the primary season. Her policy team is no doubt as well stocked as her message team, and it may have the tougher job.","451","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"On Monday, Tim Cook, of Apple, and Marco Rubio, of the Senate, agreed on the answer to a question that Governor Mike Pence, of Indiana, has gone to absurd lengths to dodge. Both said that the idea of Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act was to let certain businesses turn away gay and lesbian customers. The difference is that only one of them—the one with some Apple Watches to sell—thought that the act was a bad idea; the other one, who was speaking on Fox News, didn’t. Rubio also said that he’d make a “big announcement” next month, probably having to do with running for President. His view was seconded by another Presidential candidate, Jeb Bush, who, after talking about how the spread of same-sex marriage had caused florists to face crises of conscience, said of the RFRA, “We’re going to need this.” Need it for what?","March 31, 2015","452","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-a-g-o-p-gambit-backfired-in-indiana"

"“FIX THIS NOW” was the headline on the front page of the Indianapolis Star the next morning. The editorial inside said that the law, “whatever its original intent,” had created a “deep mess,” one that endangered the state’s reputation and its economy. The newspaper argued that nothing short of a comprehensive state anti-discrimination law that would protect the rights of gays and lesbians would fix it. Governor Pence has said that he has no interest in such a law, although this morning he conceded that he would support an adjustment to the act—“a clarification, but it’s also a fix.” He wasn’t specific about the change, and it’s hard to know if it will be enough, particularly since Pence went on to say that the RFRA had been “smeared”—that it had never been discriminatory, and the problem was one of “perception.”","454","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-a-g-o-p-gambit-backfired-in-indiana"
"The Indiana law is the product of a G.O.P. search for a respectable way to oppose same-sex marriage and to rally the base around it. There are two problems with this plan, however. First, not everyone in the party, even in its most conservative precincts, wants to make gay marriage an issue, even a stealth one—or opposes gay marriage to begin with. As the unhappy reaction in Indiana shows, plenty of Republicans find the anti-marriage position embarrassing, as do some business interests that are normally aligned with the party. Second, the law is not an empty rhetorical device but one that has been made strangely powerful, in ways that haven’t yet been fully tested, by the Supreme Court decision last year in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. That ruling allowed the Christian owners of a chain of craft stores to use the federal version of the RFRA to ignore parts of the Affordable Care Act. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in her dissent, argued strongly that the majority was turning that RFRA into a protean tool for all sorts of evasions. As Jeffrey Toobin has noted, she was proved right even before the Indiana controversy.","455","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-a-g-o-p-gambit-backfired-in-indiana"
"Both of those factors have combined to produce real confusion about the Indiana law. Some people are not being straightforward about its implications, whether because they are calculating, mortified, or—in the case of opponents, some of whom have also been unclear about what the law means—alarmed, but it also inhabits novel legal territory, so it is genuinely hard to know what those implications would be. Governor Pence has done much to muddle things even more. On Sunday, on “This Week,” George Stephanopoulos asked Pence “a yes-or-no question” about whether “a florist in Indiana can now refuse to serve a gay couple without fear of punishment.” He asked half a dozen times, but never got an answer:","456","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-a-g-o-p-gambit-backfired-in-indiana"
"Pence strongly suggested that Indiana’s law was identical to the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act and to laws in twenty states that bear the same name. In a more careful formulation, in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Pence said that the Indiana law “simply mirrors federal law that President Bill Clinton signed in 1993”—which is correct only if the mirror is the kind that adds twenty pounds when you look in it. Pence also said that Barack Obama, as an Illinois State Senator, had voted for a Religious Freedom Restoration Act with the “the very same language” as Indiana’s law; Politifact rated that claim only “half true.” The law has, in fact, been tweaked in ways that seem designed to maximize the effect of the Hobby Lobby decision. In that decision, the Justices found that the “person” with religious beliefs referred to in the federal RFRA could be a closely held for-profit company. (That is what Hobby Lobby is, so the opinion didn’t have to settle the question of whether other kinds of corporations had the same religious freedom.) The Indiana law went farther down that path: it explicitly covers “a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association, or another entity.” (It also says that the religious human beings behind a company only have to have “substantial ownership” of it—not even majority control—for the company to be covered by the act.) The Indiana law is also distinct in that the government does not need to be a party to the case, multiplying the potential number of lawsuits it can be used in. And there are, as Politifact and others have noted, contextual differences: other states, including Illinois, have laws against discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, which prevent some of the potential ill uses of the Indiana RFRA (Existing laws explain why racial discrimination is less of a RFRA problem, as the Indianapolis Star pointed out in a very good survey of the law.) Indiana, again, does not, though some municipalities in the state do. And that was before Hobby Lobby.","457","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-a-g-o-p-gambit-backfired-in-indiana"
"A RFRA of some kind is not, in the abstract, a terrible idea. In the simplest terms, RFRAs offer someone who violates certain laws a defense: the law is a restriction on my religious practice; the state has another, less intrusive way to accomplish what it wants, and exempting me does not thwart some compelling state interest. The inspiration for RFRAs was the prosecution of Native Americans for rituals involving peyote. It is logical for the government, for example, to find a way to allow a Sikh to keep his turban on even in a place where regulations say that hats must be removed, and should be easy to do without creating a security problem. But the idea of religious practice seems to have morphed to include a vague sense of offense at the lives of others. In Hobby Lobby, it was corporate owners who felt “implicated” by the contraceptive decisions of the employees whose health insurance they helped pay for. A Heritage Foundation paper cited a baker who thought that his religious freedom would be infringed upon if he delivered his goods to a same-sex wedding, because, he said, “when I do a cake, I feel like I am participating in the ceremony or the event or the celebration that the cake is for”—as if he were being forced to get gay-married himself.","458","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-a-g-o-p-gambit-backfired-in-indiana"
"For the moment, Indiana’s RFRA is open-ended. Its true reach will not be tested until some florists or bakers—or doctors or teachers, manufacturers or insurers—get to court, and perhaps gain victories that realize the most profound concerns about the law. (Hobby Lobby was once considered a long shot.) That contingency is why its supporters have been able to deny that it offers a license to discriminate. Pence, in his Wall Street Journal piece, took great offense at that notion, and then almost immediately cited a law professor who said that the law would give “valuable guidance to Indiana courts.” As Pence put it, “RFRA only provides a mechanism to address claims, not a license for private parties to deny services.” Perhaps it is more accurate, then, to call it a mechanism to discriminate, rather than a license. What it certainly will do is give some people more confidence to discriminate. But is that what Indiana really wants? And is that what the G.O.P.’s 2016 candidates should be looking for?","459","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-a-g-o-p-gambit-backfired-in-indiana"
"The tension between big-tent inclusiveness and ideological purity has bedevilled our two major political parties for many years, but for Democrats it became especially vexing in the middle decades of the twentieth century. From 1932 to 1964, the Democratic Party won seven out of nine Presidential elections and enjoyed an almost continuous majority in the House and the Senate. But who, exactly, was winning and what did victory mean? The answer was clear in only two intervals. The first was the initial phase of the New Deal, when Franklin Roosevelt’s economic-rescue proposals were swiftly passed into law by Congress and embraced by a nation traumatized by the Great Depression. The second came during the three-year period after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, when Lyndon Johnson and Congress went on a legislative spree that ended with the midterm election in November, 1966.","460","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"“The Fierce Urgency of Now” (Penguin Press), Julian E. Zelizer’s account of wins and losses in the Johnson years, combines history with political science, as befits our data-happy moment. The information comes at us steadily—there are useful facts on almost every page—but the narrative is spartanly furnished. There’s little portraiture, not much drama, and only enough mood-setting context to let us know what America was up to while L.B.J. and Congress were contriving new ways to strengthen the social safety net and exhaust the national treasury. The emphasis falls instead on the high, and sometimes low, workings of legislative government, as bills inched through committees and subcommittees, nicked and scarred in “mark-up” sessions; the feint-and-parry of parliamentary maneuver; and, above all, the votes.","461","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"This patient no-frills approach offers illuminations that a more cinematic treatment might not. And if Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton, at times betrays the head-counting instincts of a House whip, well, head-counting is the nuts and bolts of congressional lawmaking, as scholars like Nelson Polsby and David Mayhew pointed out a generation ago, and as Ira Katznelson, Sarah Binder, and Frances Lee have done more recently. “Overshadowed by presidents and social movements, legislators remain ghosts in America’s historical imagination,” Zelizer observed in “The American Congress,” the large and very useful anthology he edited in 2004. Its analyses, by him and thirty-nine others, begin with the Continental Congress and go all the way up to the Clinton and Bush years—not likely to be known as the Gingrich or DeLay years, even as these scholars cut the Leaders of the Free World down to their proper constitutional size.","462","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"The idea of an imperial Presidency was always an exaggeration. “A President, these days, is an invaluable clerk,” Richard Neustadt, the dean of Presidential theorists, pointed out in 1960.The clerk at the time was Dwight Eisenhower, the general and war hero twice elected in landslides, only to be frustrated, like so many popular Presidents before and since, in skirmishes with well-organized adversaries on Capitol Hill. Congressmen were the heavies then, just as they are today. And yet, however much we say that we dislike our representatives, we keep sending many of them back to Washington. Together, Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid, each his party’s leader in the Senate, have spent fifty-eight years there. In the House, John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi have logged a combined fifty-two. These four, and some others, compose our democracy’s only long-term elected class.","463","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"What distinguished L.B.J. from almost all his predecessors and successors was his profound rootedness in Congress, where he spent a dozen years in the House and another dozen in the Senate. As Majority Leader, he became as famous as a senator could be, thanks to his resourcefulness and his genius for compromise and his almost feral magnetism. But it was seldom clear what L.B.J. really wanted, apart from dominating the game and intimidating the other players. Robert Caro has turned the question over on a spit in four immensely detailed volumes and still seems undecided. Real-time observers were mystified, too. “The test will come when he runs out of ideas,” Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., remarked in August, 1964. “Up to this point he has been living intellectually on the Kennedy years.” A year later, L.B.J. had signed Medicare and the Voting Rights Act into law, seven days apart.","464","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"But in politics the truly new idea is a rarity. Much of the agenda presented with such fanfare in the nineteen-sixties, first by Kennedy and then by Johnson, had been in congressional circulation since the nineteen-forties and fifties, and Johnson was well versed in its fine points. As early as 1949, Senator Hubert Humphrey, who had a master’s degree in political science, was proposing one bill after another on national health insurance, Social Security extensions, and federally financed school construction. Not one had a chance of becoming law then, because the votes weren’t there. They’d gone missing in F.D.R.’s second term, when an alliance of Republicans and Southern Democrats formed “the conservative coalition,” a bloc that functioned as an autonomous congressional party, supplanting the two nominally major ones. By the time L.B.J. became President, Congress had been, as Zelizer says, a “graveyard of liberal legislation” for more than a quarter century.","465","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"As late as 1960, some thought a vigorous new President might single-handedly revitalize Congress. This was a delusion. In August, a few weeks after Kennedy promised a “New Frontier” in his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, the Times’ Tom Wicker cautioned that if Kennedy won he would meet the fearsome “roadblock in Congress,” the House Committee on Rules, which, under the control of a “six-man conservative junta,” was “virtually a third branch of Congress—equal to and sometimes superior to the Senate and the House.” It was controlled by its chairman, Howard Smith, of Virginia, who decided which bills reached the floor for a general vote and which did not.","466","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"In the Senate, Southern domination was even greater. Johnson had spent his years as Majority Leader in continual negotiation with the chamber’s true “master,” Richard Russell, Jr., the Georgia segregationist whose weapon was the filibuster—not the lone-wolf stunts performed recently by Rand Paul and Ted Cruz but martial epics, involving a “platoon” of men who delivered four-hour monologues on a rotating basis. “The Senate might be described without too much violence to fact as the South’s unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg,” the journalist William S. White wrote in “Citadel,” a best-selling account of the Senate published in 1957. White, a Texan, was by no means a critic of the Senate. He was enamored of its rituals and thought it had a “touch of authentic genius.” At a lunch organized by Johnson, not long after the book was published, each freshman senator found a copy of “Citadel” at his place setting with two inscriptions, one by White, the other by L.B.J., who urged them all to study it “as a sort of McGuffey’s Reader,” one of the freshman, Joseph Clark, recalled.","467","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Clark, who called Congress “the sapless branch,” belonged to the growing and restive corps of liberal Democrats who found the Senate less the genteel club that White described than a mildewed establishment. Part of the problem was bipartisanship. “L.B.J. has no idea of his own but consensus,” Schlesinger noted. The criticism rings strangely today, when consensus and bipartisanship have become the holy grails of government, but in the mid-twentieth century they seemed symptoms of stasis and even atrophy. Humphrey, who was in the vanguard of a fresh style of Democratic politics—“issues-based” rather than interest-group-appeasing—inveighed against the “rotten political bargain” that Southern Democrats, including Johnson, had sealed with Republicans. Genuine political progress, he maintained, had to begin with institutional reform.","468","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"There had been talk of overhauling Congress, within the institution and outside it, for generations. In 1879, when Woodrow Wilson was a senior at Princeton, he wrote a celebrated essay advocating a British-style “cabinet government,” in which the heads of State, Treasury, and so on would simultaneously serve in the Senate, thus linking the legislative and executive branches in a unified system of majority rule. He elaborated on the idea in his dissertation, “Congressional Government,” printed fifteen times between 1885 and 1900. Its targets included the House’s many committees and their ducal “elders.” Whenever a bill “goes from the clerk’s desk to a committee-room it crosses a parliamentary bridge of sighs to dim dungeons of silence whence it will never return,” Wilson wrote. “The means and time of its death are unknown, but its friends never see it again.” It is impossible to imagine anyone today writing such a book and wishing to enter politics, much less being elected President twice. Yet when Wilson arrived at the White House, in 1913, he tried to improvise the “straightforward, inartificial party government” he had championed. He went to Congress to deliver the State of the Union address rather than submit a written message, as every President since Jefferson had done. He also made the “President’s room” in the Capitol an actual office for meetings with committee chairmen. But the institutional friction was too great. Later, when a proposal was held up by filibuster, Wilson urged a cloture rule cutting off debate. The Senate adopted one, but it set the bar unreachably high: a two-thirds-majority vote, which stayed in place until 1975.","469","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"In 1941, the American Political Science Association appointed a “Committee on Congress” to explore possible wide-ranging reforms. Some in Congress were amenable and put the leader of the A.P.S.A. team in charge of a Joint House-Senate Committee. After many hearings and much delay, a “reorganization” was approved in 1946. It eliminated lots of committees, taking the House from forty-eight to nineteen and the Senate from thirty-three to fifteen. (Today, there are twenty-one and twenty, respectively.) But the reorganization didn’t include the A.P.S.A.’s most important suggestions: changing the rigid next-in-line “senility system” of chairmanships, reducing the power of the Rules Committee, taming the filibuster with a less onerous cloture rule. The streamlining concentrated even more power in the hands of those who already had it.","470","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Nor did the reforms address the muddled identities of the two major parties. In 1944, reflecting on the legislative stalemate of the prewar years, F.D.R. concluded that the two parties were dysfunctional, “split by dissenters.” That year, he suggested to Wendell Willkie, the moderate Republican he had run against in 1940, that the two form a new “liberal” party. (A decade later, Eisenhower, under attack from isolationists who threatened his ability to conduct his foreign policy, talked of a new party of “progressive moderates,” perhaps one modelled on Theodore Roosevelt’s Bull Moosers.) But a second and even more influential A.P.S.A. report, “Toward a More Responsible Two-Party System,” published in 1950, sifted through the problem of party discipline. This report grew out of a project supervised by E. E. Schattschneider, a professor at Wesleyan and a leading exponent of Wilsonian party government. A political party that “does not capitalize on its successes by mobilizing the whole power of the government is a monstrosity reflecting the stupidity of professional politicians who are more interested in the petty spoils of office than they are in the control of the richest and most powerful government in the world,” Schattschneider had written.","471","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"This argument became the overriding theme of the 1950 report. Schattschneider’s team of fifteen scholars and policy experts had talked to congressional leaders, to officials in the Truman Administration, and to state and local politicians. It concluded that the two major parties were “probably the most archaic institutions in the United States”—scarcely more than “loose associations of state and local organizations, with very little national machinery and very little national cohesion.” The Republican or Democrat sent to Congress was seldom screened by the national party and so felt no obligation to support the party’s program, if he even knew what it was. Once in office, he delivered patronage and pork to his constituents back home. He operated free of a coherent agenda and belonged to no “binding” caucus. The parties, in other words, were failing because they weren’t sufficiently ideological, partisan, and polarizing.","472","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"The solution was a “responsible party system”—centralized, idea-driven, serious-minded. Each party needed stronger central “councils” that met regularly, not just in Convention years, to establish principles and programs. Candidates should be expected to campaign on these platforms and then to carry them out, with dissidents punished or expelled. The party in power would enact its program, and the minority party would provide strong criticism and develop alternatives to present at election time.","473","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Schlesinger, for one, glimpsed “the shadow of an infatuation with the British party system.” He was right. Some drafters of the A.P.S.A. report had admired recent events in England, where the Labour Government elected in 1945 had nationalized the railroad and coal industries and, over Tory opposition, introduced a national health service. Labour had campaigned on the promise of a welfare state, and voters had known what they were getting. By comparison, American government looked sluggish and ineffectual. President Truman got nowhere with his health-care proposal, largely because of vehement and well-funded opposition from the American Medical Association. Schattschneider had something to say about that, too. As he had written in his 1942 book “Party Government,” the two parties “let themselves be harried by pressure groups as a timid whale might be pursued by a school of minnows.”","474","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"To the rising generation of liberal legislators, party government made sense. At the 1948 Democratic Convention, Hubert Humphrey spoke in passionate support of a civil-rights plank. (Its provisions included an anti-lynching law and a fair-employment-practices commission.) Instead of trying to appease the party’s Southern bloc, he met it head on. “The time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states’ rights, and to walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights,” Humphrey said.","475","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"It was an electrifying speech; some sixty million people heard it on the radio, and as many as ten million more saw it on television. The plank was voted in, and the entire Mississippi delegation, along with half of Alabama’s, stalked out. Humphrey, suddenly famous, won his Senate race in November and in 1949 landed on the cover of Time. Truman paid heavily. The Southerners went ahead with their threat to form their own party. The States’ Rights Democratic Party nominee, Strom Thurmond, won a million votes, and captured four states in the South. Humphrey had created a wedge issue within his own party. It was the beginning of the liberal insurgency that climaxed in the Great Society and gave rise to a new politics.","476","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Purging dissidents was the first step toward building a new congressional party. A second was drawing together like-minded legislators and voters who for the time being were kept apart by the two-party system. If Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans could form a congressional majority, Northerners in both parties might do the same. By the time L.B.J. became President, this possibility had been tossed around for years. In 1958, after the Democrats’ victories in the midterms cut into G.O.P. strongholds from New England to California, Richard Rovere, this magazine’s political correspondent, predicted “a coalition of Northern Republicans and Northern Democrats, led by the latter.” The two groups contained members who were “ideologically indistinguishable,” he wrote. But the moment hadn’t yet come for them to unite. Zelizer does the arithmetic: “In 1957 and 1958, southern Democrats and midwestern Republicans controlled 311 out of 435 seats in the House, and they held 71 out of 96 seats in the Senate. Even after the midterm elections of 1958, which increased the number of northern liberals in both chambers, the conservative coalition retained a ninety-two-vote majority in the House and an eighteen-vote majority in the Senate.” This was why the Speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn, though sympathetic to the liberal contingent, tamped down talk of a new majority dominated by “bomb-throwing liberals,” as they were called in the press.","477","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Matters didn’t much improve in 1960. Kennedy was elected President, but he only just squeaked in, and the Democrats actually lost nearly two dozen members of the House, many of them liberals. And Kennedy’s métier was not legislation but foreign policy and soaring rhetoric. The visionary flights of the New Frontier excited intellectuals and the young, but in Congress Kennedy’s proposals—a tax cut, a major education bill, civil-rights legislation—fizzled back to earth like dud rockets.","478","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Congressional Democrats were the ones who set about trying to push through a progressive legislative agenda. And L.B.J., who had steadily backed away from the Dixie contingent, was helping to coax the new agenda along. In 1959, when he was still in the Senate, he had put together a committee on unemployment and assigned a freshman liberal, Eugene McCarthy, to lead it. After holding more than two dozen hearings in a dozen states, the committee issued its report, in March of 1960. As the historian Dominic Sandbrook has written, the report “called for federal assistance and public works in areas suffering from chronic unemployment, national standards of unemployment insurance, action to fight racial and other discrimination, a youth conservation corps, expanded vocational training and federal funding for retraining the jobless.” (The last of these proposals was enacted as the Manpower and Development Training Act, in 1962.)","479","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"The paramount cause for liberals was civil rights. The movement was gaining momentum in arenas far from Washington. Like other contemporary historians, Zelizer stresses the importance of Martin Luther King, Jr., and other black leaders, who boldly calculated that the drama of the freedom rides and lunch-counter sit-ins, and, later, of clashes with white law enforcement in Birmingham and Selma, would force the President and Congress to act. He similarly gives credit to the efforts of Republican congressmen, including William McCulloch, of Ohio, an indispensable advocate for civil-rights legislation. The layer that Zelizer adds involves the Democratic Study Group, a coalition of liberal House members (some of them well versed in the A.P.S.A.’s 1950 report), led initially by Eugene McCarthy and then by such people as the Missouri Democrat Richard Bolling, who turned it into the first modern congressional caucus.","480","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"These “de facto lobbyists” for institutional reform, as Zelizer wrote in his 2004 book “On Capitol Hill,” became the model for later Republican insurgencies. The strategies identified today with the Tea Party Caucus (closed-door meetings, public-relations blitzes, bloc voting, continual pressure on weak-kneed House leaders) were pioneered by the D.S.G., which originated with twenty-eight signatories to a liberal manifesto in 1957 and grew to an estimated hundred and twenty-five members—almost half the Democrats in the House—by 1964. The D.S.G. pushed the House to increase the size of the Rules Committee in 1961, weakening the conservative junta. And when the Rules Committee sat on the Civil Rights Act, Bolling collected enough signatures on a petition to force a hearing in January of 1964, the first step in a long march; the obstacles included a sixty-day team-relay filibuster orchestrated by the Senate’s Southern bloc.","481","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Johnson’s landslide victory gave him the liberal mandate he needed to push through the agenda for the Great Society, but he couldn’t have done it if the right hadn’t been undergoing its own ideological sorting—a convulsion within the G.O.P. that transferred power from the East Coast to the Sun Belt in the person of Barry Goldwater. Goldwater was a gift to liberals. One of just six Republican Senators to vote against the Civil Rights Act, he seemed the iron-jawed tribune of antigovernment extremism. He warned that the new bill would lead to a “federal police state,” turning citizens into informers, an opinion shared by the John Birch Society. Zelizer is probably right to say that Goldwater “built the Great Society,” if only because he accomplished what the liberals couldn’t: he made civil rights, and the liberal causes that followed, seem intrinsic to American idealism.","482","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"One measure of the new order was the D.S.G.’s rising influence. The group had backed forty House incumbents, of whom thirty-nine won. It also picked forty successful challengers. The membership was now larger than the entire Republican caucus, and it exulted in its power. Two Southern Democrats who had supported Goldwater were stripped of seniority rights, the kind of “sanction” the A.P.S.A. report had called for. The Democratic Study Group successfully pressed for another reform that the report had recommended: changing the makeup of committees to favor the majority party. The “Goldwater Congress,” in James Reston’s phrase, became the first instance of unlimited majority rule since the beginnings of the New Deal. “F.D.R. passed five major bills in the first one hundred days,” Johnson boasted to an aide before the 1966 midterms. “We passed two hundred in the last two years.” Actually, Roosevelt had passed fifteen. But Johnson had one enormous advantage that Roosevelt lacked: a booming economy. “We may now turn to issues more demanding of human ingenuity than that of how to put an end to poverty in the richest nation in the world,” Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an architect of the War on Poverty, wrote in a 1965 essay titled “The Professionalization of Reform.” Such issues might include “the problem of perfecting, to the highest degree possible, the quality of our lives and of our civilization.”","483","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Moderate Republicans, afraid of being branded Goldwaterites, fled to the sanctuary of the Johnson program. Most “believed that the President’s measures were in the national interest,” Geoffrey Kabaservice points out in “Rule and Ruin,” his history of the modern Republican Party. That’s one reason Medicare passed, despite the strenuous lobbying of the American Medical Association. “Approximately thirty-seven legislators who had been considered ‘friends’ of the A.M.A. were defeated” in 1964, Zelizer writes. Wilbur Mills, the tightfisted Arkansas Democrat and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, had been blocking health-care proposals since the fifties, but had come around. He dropped hints of a compromise. L.B.J., with his instinct for congressional politics, deferred to Mills. Years of dismantling bills had made Mills expert in their intricacies, and many of the wrinkles had been worked out in advance. When committee members submitted alternative versions of the program, Mills adroitly mashed all the proposals together. The committee had only thirteen days to draft a final version. That was all the time it needed.","484","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"No modern Presidency follows the arc of classical tragedy as neatly as Johnson’s. He began as awkward steward to a slain hero he resented, grew into full command of his powers while beset by self-doubt and self-loathing, and finally seemed to will his own descent. The story has been told many times, but Zelizer is especially good on the unravelling of the Great Society. At the start of 1966, L.B.J. could reel off mouthwatering numbers on jobs and wages, yet brace for losses in the midterm elections. It had happened to F.D.R.; it could happen to him. He chose to push ahead for more programs, more agencies, rather than to scale back. This heavy-handed style invited suspicion. The social critic Paul Goodman said that L.B.J.’s government, instead of safeguarding citizens, was reducing them to the status of “clients.” “Dependency” became the new term of art.","485","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Four days before the midterms, Zelizer writes, Johnson stood “in front of a turquoise backdrop, ideal for broadcasts on color television,” and in three ceremonies signed eight bills that would funnel huge sums into Great Society programs, including $6.1 billion into schools. The Democrats lost seats, in part thanks to a group of constituents many had taken for granted: working-class, pro-union, Northern whites who remained loyal to the New Deal but suspected that Great Society programs weren’t meant to help them—were, in fact, coming at their expense. Zelizer again has the numbers: “Only thirty-eight out of seventy-one Democrats elected” in 1964 “were reelected to the House in 1966. Just twenty-three of the forty-seven freshman Democrats who had been elected in Republican districts in 1964—not counting the freshmen who had defeated Democratic incumbents—were victorious.”","486","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Two years earlier, the conservative coalition seemed finished. Now the liberal one did. Emboldened conservatives attacked “Great Society play money,” rallying votes against a modest bill to exterminate rats in city neighborhoods. Moynihan was now jeering at antipoverty programs in the pages of The Public Interest: “Toss a rock in the lobby of the Office of Economic Opportunity headquarters in Washington today, and one will hit, at random, a steely-eyed budget examiner intent on a systems analysis of health services in Hough, a bearded youth determined to overthrow the ‘entrenched autocracy’ of the Democratic Party machine in some Eastern industrial slum, a former regional director of the Peace Corps worried about Comanche reaction to the latest batch of VISTA volunteers, and a Negro lawyer concerned how to double the number of Head Start projects in his home state before the next election.”","487","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"L.B.J. began warning that if Congress didn’t raise taxes the country would suffer a “ruinous spiral of inflation” and “brutally higher interest rates.” The other option, scaling back the costs of the Vietnam War, seemed out of the question. Against the best advice, he had been sending in more troops; ultimately, the number exceeded half a million, and total Pentagon spending reached Second World War levels. Johnson was afraid to pull out, for fear of being labelled soft on Communism. Still a creature of Congress, he remembered the convulsions over the “loss” of China and the Korean War. Johnson had been Minority Leader during much of Joe McCarthy’s rampage and found himself powerless to stop it. This time, the protest was coming from the left on campuses and among the intellectuals and the press.","488","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"The broad public hadn’t yet turned against the Vietnam War. It was the battle at home that was cause for alarm. Strife over civil rights was moving west and north. Protests in Birmingham and Selma had given way to riots in Watts, which erupted less than a week after L.B.J. signed the Voting Rights Act. Riots in Detroit and Newark followed, in the summer of 1967. Such conflict delayed the “third civil-rights bill”—a housing law that would have redressed discriminatory real-estate practices in the North. The bill cleared the House, but it was killed in the Senate by Everett Dirksen, the Illinois senator who had been instrumental in passing the first two bills. The bill passed the following year.* There had been racial violence in Chicago, and although whites had committed most of it, Zelizer explains that “Dirksen, like a growing number of Republicans, blamed civil rights activists tied to the black power movement.” After losing a skirmish with Wilbur Mills over taxes, L.B.J. muttered, “I’m not master of nothing. . . . We cannot make this Congress do one damn thing that I know of.”","489","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Former allies turned against him, too. Eugene McCarthy, who had helped him mount an eleventh-hour run at the 1960 Presidential nomination, became the Pied Piper of the “Dump Johnson” movement organized by antiwar Democrats. College students converged in New Hampshire for the 1968 primary, and McCarthy’s strong second-place finish proved crippling to Johnson. After Robert Kennedy jumped in, Johnson concluded that he might not even get nominated. He withdrew, and the leaden mantle passed to his Vice-President, Humphrey. Captive to his own rotten bargain, Humphrey insisted that the calamitous war policy was working and so was lumped in with his party’s despised establishment elders. Humphrey and McCarthy, both Minnesotans and pioneers of the new liberal politics, battled through to the nominating Convention in Chicago. The factions of the “responsible” Democratic Party had stayed together about as long as the Beatles.","490","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"But, like the Beatles, they left an enduring legacy, if not one that they had envisioned. Even as the new liberal party had been forming, a new conservative party had been, too—along the axis that united the Dixie states and the Southwest. Lasting majority rule, however, would elude conservatives just as it had Democrats. Beginning with Richard Nixon, in 1968, Republicans won five of the next six Presidential elections, only to be repeatedly thwarted in Congress, outnumbered and bullied and kept off committees, just as the liberals had been. Like the liberals, they were exasperated by the deals their leaders kept making with the other side. In 1973, House bomb-throwers, following the example of the Democratic Study Group, formed the Republican Study Committee. Forty years later, it helped orchestrate a government shutdown.","491","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"To date, the most ingenious practitioner of responsible party politics has been Newt Gingrich. All its principles can be found in his “Contract with America”: the stark agenda (balance the budget, cut back welfare), the institutional reforms (term limits, limits as well for committee chairs), the implicit threat to discipline heretics. With it came the ideologically unified party that progressives had once dreamed of, complete with caucusing, late-night strategy sessions, and political-action committees. The result was not only a House majority, won in 1994, but British-style cohesion. Under Gingrich, the House of Representatives became, at last, the American House of Commons. “The Republican Party in the House is the most disciplined political party we have ever seen in the history of America,” Barney Frank said at the time.","492","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"Gingrich’s reign was short-lived, but many of his reforms went forward. In 2004, House Speaker Dennis Hastert announced a new House rule: no bill would go to the floor for a vote unless “a majority of the majority” supported it. He meant a majority of Republicans, in order to reduce the danger of bipartisan passage. (This is what stopped the immigration law passed by the Senate in 2013 from reaching the House.) And when the numbers weren’t there the conservative party remained firm in its opposition. L.B.J. had mustered as many Republican votes as possible for Medicare, lest it be seen as a “Democratic bill.” President Obama didn’t have that option. It was gone from politics, though it took him a while to realize it.","493","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"
"In 1950, when the American Political Science Association report was published, Schlesinger wondered whether the new sorting-out was feasible “without a reorganization of our parties on taut ideological lines” that might inflame antagonisms rooted deep in the native temper. The report, drawing comfort from the very consensus it wished to do away with, confidently insisted that sharpening their disagreements wouldn’t put a forbidding “ideological wall” between the two parties. The Second World War had destroyed all the colossal isms save one, Communism, and it had no future in America. Even as Democrats and Republicans became more partisan, both sides would gravitate toward the center, where most voters were, and both would offer competing solutions to problems most voters could agree needed solving, such as securing voting rights and providing health care for the elderly.","494","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/power-congress"

"There are two new signs that the Republican Party, often said to be in the midst of a civil war, might be experiencing something more like the Internet bubble of the nineteen-nineties. First, there’s the money: at a conference this weekend organized by Freedom Partners, a network built around the Koch brothers, donors met in Rancho Mirage, California, and resolved to spend eight hundred and eighty-nine million dollars—the sort of number that gets rounded up to a billion—on the G.O.P.’s 2016 candidates, according to the Washington Post’s Matea Gold.","January 27, 2015","497","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"At the same time, at the similarly named, but differently catered, Freedom Summit, in Des Moines, Iowa, an event built around the alarmist Representative Steve King, potential Presidential candidates were on full, exhibitionist display. Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, and Rick Santorum were there, each claiming his own place on the strutting-stridency matrix; so were Donald Trump and Sarah Palin. Special bonus: Carly Fiorina. (Bobby Jindal was at his own rally, called The Response.*) Their presence onstage suggests that the G.O.P. field is wide open—far more so than it is for the Democrats—attracting boom-towners and political Ponzi-schemers, as well as ideologues. There will be plenty of money—hard and soft, smart and speculative—expended as giddily as anything that was ever put into Kozmo.com. A bubble can be less corrosive and bloody than a war, and there’s always a chance that an unlikely startup might make for a successful I.P.O.

"There were a lot of businessmen at Freedom Partners; there was a lot of talk about ordinary people and “crony capitalism” at the Freedom Summit. The latter event probably had the edge in theatricality. After watching several candidates, a Cedar Rapids billboard salesman told the Des Moines Register that he wished some of the “real true conservatives” had the “gravitas” of Chris Christie. Trump berated Romney (“He choked!”) and Sarah Palin improvised about the nature of freedom after her teleprompter went out (“The man can only ride you when your back is bent!”).","500","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"But it would be a mistake to see, in the coincidence of scheduling, a divide between the “establishment” and the upstarts. For one thing, a couple of the candidates, Walker and Cruz, made it to both Freedom pageants; Cruz, who in Iowa spoke about winning over “the forty-seven per cent,” spoke in Rancho Mirage about how the criticism of the Koch brothers was “grotesque.” Rand Paul and Marco Rubio opted solely for Freedom Partners, where Paul dismissed Romney, who was absent, in words only marginally more polite than Trump’s. Rubio, meanwhile, congratulated members of the audience for not trying to bribe him: “I don’t know a single person in this room who has ever been to my office … asking from government any special access.”","501","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"Jeb Bush missed both events; there may have been more people who were sorry about that in the Kochs’ circle than in King’s: it was King who described Dreamers as drug mules with “calves the size of cantaloupes,” which is not quite where Bush wants to be seen standing on immigration. (King’s Freedom Summit was co-sponsored by Citizens United, the group whose victory at the Supreme Court made all sorts of new political sponsorships possible.) Trump, in his speech, attacked Bush’s position on immigration this way: “He said, ‘They are coming for love.’ What? Half of them are criminals!” (A Politico dispatch describing the moment continued, “‘Jeb and Mitt you can’t have!’ Trump yelled. ‘It’s over!’”)","502","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"But the coolness to Jeb is more a matter of degree. According to the Washington Post, Paul, Cruz, and Walker were “favorites” at Rancho Mirage, too: “It’s not as if there’s one perfect champion and five bad individuals,” a “person familiar with donor views” told the paper. The Post added that Freedom Partners “is still debating whether it will spend some of that money in the GOP primaries. Such a move could have a major impact in winnowing the field of contenders but could also undercut the network’s standing if it engaged in intraparty politics and was not successful.”","503","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"Here, again, there might be an instructive contrast with the Democrats. The Republicans are looking at some dubious characters—but at least they are looking. If the G.O.P. is in a market bubble—whether of the tech or tulip variety—the Democrats might be experiencing something more like stagflation. The inflation is in the nominal price assigned to its main product, the putative candidacy of Hillary Clinton. That price keeps going up, without ever seeming to factor in her liabilities. The stagnation is in the party’s development of new voices, and, as a corollary, new ideas. In 2012, the Democrats benefited from the churn on the Republican side and the calm on theirs—but that’s largely because they were running an incumbent. (And it was Obama’s defiance of a similar sort of anointment that allowed him to emerge in 2008.) Now, there’s an artificial freeze on competition. Elizabeth Warren won’t say that she’s interested in running, and, even if she does run, her voice alone wouldn’t mean that there would be a broad debate. The peeps from the general direction of Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, have not been inspiring. (See Ryan Lizza on his travels with O’Malley.)","504","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"On both sides, in different ways, there might just be too much money chasing too few goods, to cite another economic dictum. Palin and Romney probably took the weekend’s prizes as the most mockable and the most mocked. And yet, they are also distinguished by being the only two characters in this ensemble whom the G.O.P. has put on a national ticket. If McCain had done just a little better, Palin might have had a chance to fidget at the State of the Union and mortify Americans with her behavior at state funerals. Romney got forty-seven per cent of the popular vote. Do Republicans see either of their nominations as an admonishment, or an inspiration?

"Since I was eight years old, and the Republican candidates were named Nixon, Rockefeller, and Reagan, and the Democrats were Humphrey, Kennedy, and McCarthy, I’ve been passionate about American politics, as a student, a witness, and a partisan. Politics was in my blood, at the family dinner table, in my work and my free time. But at some point in the past few years it went dead for me, or I for it. Perhaps it was week thirty-eight of the Obama-Romney race (a campaign between “Forward” and “Believe in America”), or the routinization of the filibuster, or the name Priorities USA Action, or the fifty-eighth vote in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act—something happened that made it very hard to continue paying attention. I don’t take this as a sign of personal superiority: I’ve always disliked people who considered themselves to be “above” politics. I mourn my lack of political passion as I would if I were to lose interest in reading fiction, or to stop caring about someone who’d been important to me for most of my life. And I count on getting back the feeling—the intense mix of love, hatred, anxiety, astonishment, and gratification—because life, public life, is impoverished without it.

The G.O.P. leadership knows that it’s unlikely to persuade enough Democratic lawmakers to support an override of Obama’s veto, but it is eager to lay down a marker for upcoming battles over health care, taxes and spending, immigration, war powers, and many other issues. “The President’s veto of the Keystone jobs bill is a national embarrassment,” said Speaker John Boehner in a video clip posted on his Facebook page. “The President is … too invested in left-fringe politics to do what Presidents are called on to do, and that’s put the national interest first.” Clearly, the Republicans think they have a winner. “The Keystone pipeline is a no brainer,” Jeb Bush posted on his Facebook page shortly before the veto came down. “President Obama must stop playing politics & sign the bill.”","528","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-symbolic-politics-of-keystone-xl"
"To environmental activists, preventing construction of Keystone XL has turned into a test case of whether they can overcome opposition, not only from the G.O.P. but from elements of the Democratic Party, in order to block a big energy project. Victory, in the form of a final decision from Obama rejecting the project, wouldn’t have much immediate impact on carbon emissions, or on climate change. But it would provide the movement with a rallying point in its larger struggle to keep oil, gas, and coal reserves buried in the ground. In welcoming the President’s veto, Bill McKibben, a former staff writer for this magazine who runs the climate movement 350.org, told the Times, “Hopefully the ongoing legislative charade has strengthened his commitment to do the right thing.”","529","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-symbolic-politics-of-keystone-xl"
"The opposition to Keystone XL emerged during Obama’s first term. It was partly based on fears that the pipeline would lead to a big boost in carbon emissions, and partly based on worries about what its construction would do to environmentally sensitive areas along its route, including the Nebraska Sandhills and parts of the Ogallala Aquifer. But, as my colleague Ryan Lizza explained in an informative piece published in September, 2013, the national anti-Keystone movement also grew out of concerns that Obama wasn’t doing enough to confront climate change or the energy industry.","530","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-symbolic-politics-of-keystone-xl"
"McKibben and Tom Steyer, a Californian hedge-fund billionaire who is a big contributor to the Democratic Party, played key roles in promoting the opposition. Steyer helped fund groups fighting the pipeline and confronted Obama about it directly, while McKibben organized protests, including one outside the White House, where he and others were arrested. “This is like a Rube Goldberg machine producing global warming and other environmental catastrophes,” McKibben told The New Yorker about the pipeline. “If we’re going to do anything about global warming, it’s the poster child for the kind of stuff that’s going to have to stay in the ground.”*","531","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-symbolic-politics-of-keystone-xl"
"In the past few years, a lot has changed in the North American energy market. Many electricity producers have switched from coal to cleaner shale gas, which is produced in the Dakotas, Texas, and other places, and CO2 emissions have fallen considerably. More recently, we’ve seen a big fall in oil prices, which, if it were to be sustained, could render it uneconomic to exploit some of the heavy oil contained in the Canadian tar sands. But winning the battle over the Keystone XL pipeline is still crucially important to environmental activists, if only as a show of force. If you go to the home page of the Sierra Club’s Web site, you will see an urgent appeal. “PRESIDENT OBAMA VETOED KEYSTONE XL,” it reads. “This is a good first step, but Big Oil-backed members of Congress won’t stop trying until President Obama rejects Keystone XL once and for all. Help us see this fight to the end.”","532","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-symbolic-politics-of-keystone-xl"
"It’s not clear what Obama will ultimately decide. The White House still seems reluctant to engage in debate about the pipeline’s merits. When he vetoed the G.O.P. bill on Tuesday, Obama didn’t say that he’d decided in favor of the environmentalists. He simply sent a short written message to Congress, accusing it of seeking “to circumvent longstanding and proven processes for determining whether or not building and operating a cross-border pipeline serves the national interest.”At one point, Obama said that he would base his decision on the outcome of a State Department technical review of the pipeline’s environmental implications. When the study was released last January, though, it concluded that blocking the pipeline wouldn’t make much difference to overall carbon emissions: the Canadians would find other ways of transporting to refineries the bitumen-heavy crude extracted from the Alberta tar sands. This finding jibed with the assessment of most, but not all, independent-energy experts.","533","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-symbolic-politics-of-keystone-xl"
"That left the White House in a bind. Environmentalists are a vocal and energetic part of the Democratic coalition. To justify further stalling, the President has, since last year, been pointing to ongoing court cases in Nebraska. Last month, one of those cases was resolved in favor of allowing construction to proceed. The White House now says it is awaiting a final recommendation from the State Department, which, in turn, says it doesn’t have a timetable for coming up with one.","534","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-symbolic-politics-of-keystone-xl"
"The technocrat in Obama might be tempted to approve the pipeline and emphasize the other environmental decisions he has made, such as tightening fuel-emissions standards for motor vehicles and ordering coal-fired power stations to reduce their emissions. He could probably come up with studies showing that the impact of these policies on carbon emissions would dwarf the impact of the pipeline. But the politician in Obama knows that there would still be a big stink.","535","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-symbolic-politics-of-keystone-xl"

Nor will he speak of publishing a newspaper, leading one of the nation’s most prestigious universities, or directing the C.I.A. That, of course, is because he’s done none of these things; these were the qualifications of candidates in previous Presidential elections.

Other than Jeb Bush, not one of the serious Republican contenders played a meaningful role in our national life before 2010, the year that Paul and Marco Rubio—who will announce his own candidacy next week in Miami—ran for the Senate.

"Sifting through these candidates’ speeches, one finds few indications of past experience—little use, even, of the past tense. To the extent that they have anything to say about their own lives, it concerns, in most cases, their childhoods. They stress, in practiced fashion, their modest roots. Rubio describes himself as the “son of a bartender and a woman who worked in a hotel.” Walker tells audiences that he is the “son of a small-town preacher and a mom who was a part-time secretary.” (In the opening passage of his budget address in February, he offered even humbler detail: “Mom was raised on a farm where they didn’t have indoor plumbing.”) Cruz, meanwhile, dedicated the first six minutes of his announcement speech last month to stories about his parents’ struggles, and said more about them than he did about himself.","540","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"

His father, Ron Paul, is, of course, an icon of the libertarian right, which confers, on the son, a certain kind of credibility—just not the hard-won, hardscrabble kind that candidates since Andrew Jackson have sought. At the Conservative Political Action Conference, in February, Rand Paul allowed a bit opaquely that “I was born into the America that experiences and believes in opportunity.” (If you thought he was from the America that doesn’t believe in opportunity, you were wrong.) He has had little else to say about his life, or life’s work, prior to his decision that it merits his leading the free world. The aptness of ophthalmology as a metaphor for national leadership (“I see a great nation,” as F.D.R. said) remains, at this point, unexploited.","541","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"

In that role, Cruz helped lead the fight to establish an individual right to bear arms and to defend the constitutionality of a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. All in all, it is a career that would make him a strong choice for attorney general in somebody else’s Administration, a little lower on the org chart than he’s aiming.

And Walker does have a standard rap about what he’s accomplished in Wisconsin: mostly that he’s “put the power back in the hands of the hard-working taxpayers” (except the hands that hold union cards). Yet Walker’s attempts to inflate his credentials have only diminished them, comically so. His much-derided comment that battling public-sector unions is good training for fighting terrorists (“If I can take on a hundred thousand protestors, I can do the same across the world”) was a warmup, it turned out, for his also-derided claim that his tenure as a teen-age Eagle Scout led him to “be prepared” for the dispatch of soldiers into battle.

In a Q. & A. session at CPAC, Sean Hannity pressed Bush to talk about his two terms as governor of Florida. “Here’s the record,” Bush answered a bit testily. “And it’s a record that may be hard for people to imagine, because it’s a record of accomplishment, of getting things done.” This is precisely the problem; some of the things Bush got done then or has supported since—immigration reform, Common Core standards—provoke fits in Republican primary voters. Bush’s reluctance to talk about his governorship—paired with his pained ambivalence about his family name—gives his candidacy a feeling of disconnectedness, an emptiness at its core. “It can’t be about the past, can’t be about my mom or dad or brother,” Bush told Hannity.

This was the thrust of Hillary Clinton’s campaign (“ready on Day One”) that year as well as John McCain’s (“I know how the world works”). Obama turned those opponents’ experience against them, rendering each one as a weary embodiment of the status quo. His inexperience underscored the entire rationale of his candidacy—its novelty, the break it represented with the past.

Some leaders, like Obama, gain that kind of insight by their mid-forties; others never do. The troubling thing about Rand Paul and the other Republican hopefuls is their indifference—indeed, their proud resistance—to the kind of experience that broadens one’s perspective and changes one’s mind. Paul “is exactly the same person he was 25 to 30 years ago,” a former aide to Paul’s father told a reporter on the eve of today’s announcement. “He hasn’t really changed.” Only at a high-school class reunion or in a Republican Presidential primary would that be meant as a compliment.","546","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"In February, 1962, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, Republican of Maine, gave a speech at a Lincoln Day event in Bangor berating her fellow G.O.P. members for their hesitation about running for President. They were guilty, she said, of “faintheartedness”—the sort of insult that only a lady could deploy. According to an A.P. report from the speech, Smith, “without using names,” complained that the likeliest candidates—Richard M. Nixon, who had lost the previous election to John Kennedy; Governor Nelson Rockefeller, of New York; and Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona—were overly scared of J.F.K., whose reëlection seemed like an easy bet, and so were “waiting for a sunnier day.” (There was also Governor George Romney, but she dismissed him as a “sacrificial lamb.”) Republicans, she said, needed a man with some fight in him, someone “who is not afraid to lose.”","March 24, 2015","547","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"

"Reading Smith’s words half a century, and thirteen Presidential elections, later, one is struck by three things. First, the uncertainty of politics, and in this case the potential for tragedy—John F. Kennedy would be murdered a year before the election he seemed sure to win. Second, the fact that the hesitation Smith saw is not a problem for the G.O.P. today; this much was evident when Ted Cruz took the stage, on Monday, to inform the public of his run for the Presidency and his role in America’s redemption. His announcement was followed by speculation about which Republican would be next: Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, et al. There’s no real suspense about whether these men want to run, just about when their leadership PACs and exploratory committees will change their names to campaigns. The candidates might not make much sense, but they will surely fulfill Smith’s injunction of not being afraid to lose.","549","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"
"And one of them, as it’s always strange to remember, will win—the nomination, if not the Presidency. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal argued that, although “neither man will like this comparison,” there are parallels between Cruz’s candidacy and Obama’s, which seemed so unlikely until he won. (Indeed, Cruz did not like it, saying that Obama had only been a “backbencher.”) If the election that followed Smith’s remarks, in 1964, and the career of Barry Goldwater indicate anything, it is that what are seen as constraints on Cruz’s rise—radical positions, unpopularity within his own party, near buffoonery—don’t always keep a candidate down, even at the highest levels. This leads to a third conclusion: that Ted Cruz might actually get on the national ticket.","550","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"
"Like Cruz, Goldwater was extreme, and as he said, in one of his best-known speeches, he didn’t consider this a vice. His extremism was not simply of the small-government variety, although that is what those who venerate him tend to invoke. He mused about letting NATO commanders use atomic weapons on the battlefield according to their own judgement. In May, 1964, when the American presence in Vietnam was a fraction of what it would become, he was asked how he’d handle the problem of Vietnamese supply lines in the jungle, which were hard to see. There had been several suggestions, he said, that probably wouldn’t be pursued, “but defoliation of the forests by low-grade atomic weapons could well be done.” That was a few months before his party handed him the nomination.","551","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"
"Goldwater was not seen as entirely serious; one defense of his extremism was that it was simple clumsiness. He was not a disciplined speaker. (Cruz certainly is; read Jeffrey Toobin’s Profile.) In 1963, Jacob Javits, a Republican Senator from New York, told the A.P. that Goldwater’s backers included “some pretty sad elements on the ultra-right.” Javits said that he was a supporter of Rockefeller, who represented “more mainstream” positions. That same year, the Times doubted that Goldwater could get his party’s support. J.F.K. amused reporters with jokes about him.","552","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"
"Goldwater is sometimes invoked as a cautionary tale, a lesson that both parties learned: nominate the extremist, and your party will lose. (Other than his native Arizona, he only won five states, all in the South.) The other lesson, though, is that in losing you might transform your party. Ronald Reagan made the full transition to politics by way of Goldwater’s campaign. There is no Rockefeller wing of the Republican Party. (And, thus, less of a firewall against extreme candidates.) It’s not even clear that there’s an “establishment.” And 1964 was a strange election year, in the wake of Kennedy’s assassination. What if Goldwater really was running against Kennedy, whose attraction to crises and vulnerability to scandal are clearer now than they were at the height of his Presidency? Once each party in our system puts forward a candidate, it is a mistake to discount the possibility that anything can happen. Sarah Palin, after all, had a good chance of being second in line for the Presidency in the Administration of a man who is not young.","553","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"

He stroked his chin theatrically; the C.F.R. members in the room were already laughing. (I was the moderator at the event, and had asked about his confidence in a President Cruz’s handling of a nuclear crisis.) How about the other possible nominees, including Scott Walker, who has said that his fights with labor unions have prepared him to confront ISIS with nuclear weapons? How would Chris Christie deal with enemy supply-line traffic? The idea of another Bush handling the wars in the Middle East is a less amusing image than Ted with nukes, but it’s still not comforting. There may be many reasons Ted Cruz won’t win, from money to support in key states.

There was a brief effort to draft Henry Cabot Lodge II (a figure with certain dynastic parallels to Jeb Bush), but it faded. After the first ballot at the Republican convention, the only candidate left besides Goldwater was Margaret Chase Smith. Although she had hardly campaigned, she’d put her name down, and arrived with twenty-seven delegates. (George Romney had forty-one.)

"When it comes to unpaid leave, the picture is brighter, thanks to the Family and Medical Leave Act, which Congress passed in 1993. Remarkably little progress has been made in the two decades since then, despite the F.M.L.A.’s manifest weaknesses. The law allows workers to take up to twelve weeks’ leave without losing their jobs if they or their close family members fall ill, or when a baby arrives. But the leave is unpaid, so most low-wage workers cannot take advantage of it. And, because the law exempts workplaces with fewer than fifty employees, among other eligibility regulations, it only covers about sixty per cent of workers, anyway.","559","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paid-family-leave-obama-work"
"The F.M.L.A. had all the hallmarks of a first step; the problem was that there was never a second or third one.

Nor was it an issue that feminists and women’s-rights activists focussed on all that intently. In recent years, it seems, we’ve heard more about work-life balance among professional women than among the working classes—more about how the Sheryl Sandbergs and the Marissa Mayers might finesse the demands of a job and a family than how a nurse, a bus driver, or a cashier could.

The Washington Post reported this week that eighty-eight per cent of private-sector managers and financial workers can take paid sick days, compared with only forty per cent of service workers.

"To those who worry that such policies are too costly for small businesses, the government, or maybe even women hoping to advance in their careers, there is some reassuring data.

"The New Jersey law went into effect in 2009, and three years later the Center for Women and Work at Rutgers conducted a study that showed some remarkably robust and positive results. Women who had taken the leave were far more likely to be working nine to twelve months after the birth of their child than new mothers who had not; they were also thirty-nine per cent less likely to be on public assistance, and fifty-four per cent more likely to have seen an increase in their wages. This finding is important: in some of the European countries that offer very long leaves—of a year or more—women who take advantage of the policies often pay a price in promotions and earning potential. But, based on the evidence here, shorter leaves seem to boost women’s wages.","566","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paid-family-leave-obama-work"
"Studies also showed that, after the law in California went into effect, in 2004, people there took more and longer leaves. This was especially true for less advantaged women—non-college-educated, unmarried, and non-white mothers, who had previously taken maternity leaves that lasted, on average, only a week. (Among their college-educated, higher-income counterparts, the average was three to five weeks.) For all the attention being paid to the importance of bonding with infants, the fact that bonding isn’t instantaneous receives relatively little notice. A week of maternity leave goes by in a twilit blur; it’s hardly long enough for a new mother to get her physical strength back, let alone figure out the operating instructions for a tiny, dependent new creature. Women who went on paid leave breastfed their babies longer. Meanwhile, most of the businesses surveyed in California reported either positive or no noticeable impact from the family-leave law. Presumably, their employees came back to work happier, healthier, and less distracted.","567","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paid-family-leave-obama-work"
"The data on the California and New Jersey laws suggests something not altogether expected but very encouraging.

There is popular momentum behind the idea of guaranteed sick days, in particular; along with Massachusetts, California, Connecticut, and a number of cities have now enacted such laws. These measures, along with minimum-wage laws, were among the few victories for Democrats in the midterm elections.

In the thirties, Franklin Delano Roosevelt had chosen not to add health care to his Social Security proposal because he believed that it would be too controversial, and would damage the prospects of other programs. Whereas most Western democracies had adopted some form of national health-care program, the United States relied on a private system that revolved, as the sociologist Paul Starr has recounted, around a sacred understanding of the doctor-patient relationship. When liberals talked about giving the government a bigger role in health care, stakeholders in the existing system always fought back, protecting their authority and autonomy by warning that Washington would sever the ties between doctors and their patients. It was one thing to distribute old-age pensions but quite another to allow the government to intrude into intimate medical affairs. When one senator suggested in 1937 that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was prepared to expand the government’s role in medicine if doctors did not do more to help the needy, Time magazine asked in its June cover story, “Nationalized Doctors?”","572","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"When President Harry Truman proposed national health insurance for every American in 1945, and again in 1949, as part of his effort to move forward with domestic policies that had been left out of the New Deal, he and allied liberals came to see why F.D.R. had avoided the issue of health care back in the nineteen-thirties. The American Medical Association conducted the most expensive lobbying effort to that date in opposition to Truman’s health-care plan, which it branded as “un-American” and “socialized medicine.” Charging that the Truman Administration consisted of “followers of the Moscow party line,” the A.M.A. worked closely with the conservative coalition in Congress to kill the measure in committee. By 1950, the proposal was dead.","573","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Meanwhile, during the forties and fifties, the government solidified the private health-care system through corporate tax breaks that subsidized companies offering their workers insurance. More workers were brought into the private system through this indirect and hidden form of government assistance, creating even greater resistance to the idea of the federal government directly providing insurance.","574","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Still, many Democrats remained convinced that the health-care system left too many Americans without access to affordable care. In 1957, Congressman Aime Forand, an ardent New Deal liberal who had quit school after seventh grade to take care of his ailing father, came up with the idea of a smaller and more targeted program as a first step toward national health insurance. With Congressman Cecil King, a California Democrat, Forand proposed covering some of the medical costs of the growing number of Americans over the age of sixty-five. The problem of elderly Americans who lacked health care was acute, according to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Older Americans required more than twice as much hospital care as people under the age of sixty-five. Even with Social Security benefits, most could not afford the cost of hospitalization, which was rising rapidly during these years as a result of medical advances. Forand and King made the tactical decision to propose that the program fall under the Social Security Administration. Liberals would be able to argue that they were simply expanding the popular program and paying for the new benefits through the Social Security payroll tax.","575","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"In the House and Senate, the proposal, which the media called Medicare, received strong support from a new cohort of Democrats including Richard Bolling, of Missouri, and Hubert Humphrey, of Minnesota, whose numbers had been steadily growing since the 1946 election and exploded in the 1958 midterms. They were a new generation of Northern liberals who, while slightly younger than Forand and King, had been deeply influenced by the New Deal and were committed to extending its benefits in areas like health care, civil rights, and education. In their minds, the economy was booming, so the U.S. could afford to have the federal government alleviate all kinds of social problems that, until then, had been ignored. They were aligned with Walter Reuther, the president of the United Automobile Workers, who said to the program’s critics that it was time to “quit fighting ideological windmills and deal with basic human needs.”","576","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Organized labor, a powerful player in American politics at this time, when thirty per cent of the workforce was unionized, threw its support behind Medicare. Labor leaders cheered when Massachusetts Senator John Kennedy announced his support for Medicare during his 1960 Presidential campaign against Richard Nixon. Kennedy was no radical, but he believed that health care was one area where the government needed to have an expanded role. Kennedy saw the revised health-care bill as attractive in principle, as well as fiscally responsible, because workers would pay for the benefits that they would eventually receive. On August 14, 1960, Kennedy visited Hyde Park to celebrate, with Eleanor Roosevelt, the twenty-fifth anniversary of Social Security, and he used the occasion to promote Medicare. The program was desperately needed in “every city and town, every hospital and clinic, every neighborhood and rest home in America—wherever our older citizens live out their lives in want and despair under the shadow of illness,” the candidate said.","577","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Despite his reputation for being dispassionate about domestic policy, Kennedy, as President, authorized an all-out public-relations effort in support of Medicare. While there were many areas of policy, like civil rights, where Kennedy avoided action for fear that congressional conservatives would kill his ideas, the President believed that the bill stood a decent chance of passing, because so many voters loved their Social Security. On May 20, 1962, the President delivered a spirited address at a rally in Madison Square Garden, with more than seventeen thousand people in attendance and many more watching on television. “The fact of the matter is that what we are now talking about doing, most of the countries of Europe did years ago,” Kennedy said. “The British did it thirty years ago. We are behind every country, pretty nearly, in Europe, in this matter of medical care for our citizens.”","578","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"The A.M.A. launched an aggressive campaign in opposition to the President. Edward Annis, the president of the A.M.A., delivered a televised response to Kennedy’s address: Medicare would “put the government smack into your hospital.” A new A.M.A. political-action committee offered campaign support to candidates who opposed the bill. The A.M.A. women’s auxiliary launched Operation Coffee Cup, in which doctors’ wives hosted living-room discussions about the dangers of socialized medicine. Ronald Reagan produced a record to be played at these events, “Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine,” in which he warned that “one of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine.” The A.M.A. also had strong allies, such as the insurance lobby, which preferred to work behind the scenes to combat the bill.","579","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"In the House of Representatives, A.M.A. officials were counting on Wilbur Mills, an Arkansas Democrat and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. At five foot eight and a hundred and eighty pounds, with slicked-back hair and thin silver-rimmed glasses, Mills didn’t look like a congressional giant, but he was a key player in the insular world of tax and security experts. A graduate of Hendrix College, in Arkansas, he had attended Harvard Law School and was rumored to spend evenings reading the tax code. He had lived with his wife in the same modest apartment, near the National Zoo, for almost twenty-five years, and was renowned for his grasp of abstruse fiscal issues.","580","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"What drove Mills most was his belief in fiscal conservatism. He understood that the federal government was a permanent part of American life, but he was determined to contain the growth of the federal budget and to limit the tax burden that fell on working Americans. What most troubled Mills about the Medicare proposal was that its costs would grow rapidly, especially when voters learned that physicians’ bills were not covered by the program and pressured legislators to add those benefits as well. With Medicare, Congress could be forced to raise Social Security taxes beyond reasonable levels, resulting in a backlash against the entire program.","581","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Each time liberals had pushed for Medicare over the six years since Forand and King first proposed it, Mills had refused to let it up for a vote in his committee. In 1960, working with Oklahoma Senator Robert Kerr, Mills had attempted to stifle the drive toward Medicare by passing a limited program that provided means-tested health insurance to elderly citizens who were poor. As with public welfare, the program would be administered by state and local governments that chose to participate. Although Congress passed Medical Assistance for the Aged, known as the Kerr-Mills Act, only twenty-eight states had adopted it, and the guidelines for participation were so stringent that only one per cent of the elderly received benefits. Still, when Kennedy sent the proposal to Congress and rallied support on television, Mills would not bring Medicare up for a vote.","582","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"When Lyndon Johnson became President, in November, 1963, he made it clear that he was determined to pass Medicare. His overriding goal was to persuade Congress to pass a series of major bills that would constitute a second New Deal. Along with civil rights, Medicare was at the top of his list. Johnson urged Wilbur Cohen, a leading figure in the Social Security Administration, to work with Mills to come up with a Medicare proposal that was acceptable to the Ways and Means chairman. “If labor will buy it, that he can call a Mills bill,” Johnson told Cohen.","583","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"The negotiations didn’t get far. Even as Johnson called on Congress to fulfill the unfinished agenda of the slain President, Mills refused to hold a vote. He said that the cost problems had not been solved, and that there were not enough votes in the House to pass a bill if he sent it out of committee. In October, Medicare proponents in the Senate made a bold move by attaching Medicare as an amendment to legislation increasing Social Security benefits. Mills killed the proposal in conference committee. “I don’t know whether we can pass it next year or not,” Johnson told Senator Hubert Humphrey.","584","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"On Election Day, everything changed. Johnson defeated the right-wing Republican Senator Barry Goldwater in a landslide victory. Democrats obtained two hundred and ninety-five seats in the House and sixty-eight in the Senate. For the first time in decades, liberal Democrats, rather than more conservative Southerners, held the balance of power within their own party.","585","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"When the eighty-ninth Congress convened, in January, 1965, the emboldened liberals drove through a series of reforms and reorganization to further strengthen their hand. One of the important changes was to alter the party ratios on each committee to reflect the new majority. The Democrats added two pro-Medicare legislators to Ways and Means, while the G.O.P. assigned one. Democrats also instated the “twenty-one-day rule,” a procedure that offered a mechanism for moving a bill out of the House Rules Committee if the conservative chairman, the notorious Howard Smith, was refusing to allow it out for a vote. With these changes, House Majority Leader Carl Albert told Johnson, it wouldn’t matter if Mills was “for Medicare or not.”","586","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"On January 5th, Mills told the White House that Medicare would be the first order of business. The chairman knew that even if he continued to oppose the bill, pro-Medicare Democrats would be able to pass it without him, and without consulting him. Mills understood that his best option was to craft a Medicare proposal that would contain costs as much as possible and would allow him to take credit for a major legislative victory.","587","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Republicans, too, wanted to be part of the debate, and offered alternative proposals. Congressman Thomas Curtis, of Missouri, and A. Sydney Herlong, a Florida Democrat, proposed an expansion of Kerr-Mills that had the backing of the A.M.A. The ranking Republican on Ways and Means, John Byrnes, of Wisconsin, offered a more ambitious plan. Byrnes, who shared Mills’s fiscal conservatism but also believed in the importance of social policy, proposed a voluntary program that would cover the costs of physicians for older Americans. Those who elected to participate would contribute a monthly premium toward their care, while the federal government would finance the rest through general tax revenue.","588","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Medicare proponents had to make sure that there were not so many proposals that they siphoned off majority support for their bill. In closed-door hearings, Mills was now defending the fact that the Administration’s plan depended on Social Security taxes. “Haven’t we done a better job … of financing the cost of the Social Security program out of a separate fund, paid for by a payroll tax, than we have some other expenditures of government?” he asked.","589","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"As the discussions proceeded, the chairman had an even bigger idea, thinking of a way to put together a bill that would be almost impossible to defeat and which would satisfy some of his fiscal fears. On the afternoon of March 2nd, he leaned back in his chair and told Wilbur Cohen, “Maybe it would be a good idea if we put all three of these bills together.” Cohen, who had been negotiating with Mills for years, immediately had his staff draft a new bill.","590","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Based on Mills’ idea, which Cohen called a “three-layer cake,” the Administration revised its bill to include hospital insurance paid for by Social Security taxes, a voluntary program covering physicians’ costs paid for by a contribution from beneficiaries and general revenue from the federal government, and an expanded version of Kerr-Mills, later called Medicaid.","591","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"Mills boasted that this plan satisfied everyone. Republicans couldn’t complain, because their ideas were part of the bill. Premiums and general tax money would pay for the part of the program covering doctors’ bills, so the future burden on Social Security taxes would be more predictable. Because private physicians fell under the voluntary part of the program, the A.M.A. could not as easily claim that this was “socialized medicine.”","592","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"On March 23rd, the Ways and Means Committee approved the bill by a vote of seventeen to eight. Republicans still voted for the John Byrnes bill, but did so knowing that the “three-layer cake” would pass. Cohen called Johnson to tell him about the outcome. “I think it’s a great bill, Mr. President,” Cohen said. “You got not only everything that you wanted but we got a lot more than—on this thing. It’s a real comprehensive bill.”","593","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"The American Medical Association knew that it had been beaten. Once it lost Wilbur Mills, it lost Congress. The House passed the final bill by a vote of three hundred and thirteen to a hundred and fifteen, on April 8th. The only remaining threat to Mills’s proposal came from liberals who tried to add amendments in the Senate, which would increase the cost of the legislation. But, in the conference committee, Mills systematically knocked down each amendment. He made only one major compromise, that hospitals and doctors would determine the “reasonable charges” for costs rather than the government doing so through regulated prices. He incorrectly assumed that this would not result in huge costs.","594","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"On July 30th, Johnson signed the Medicare bill, in Independence, Missouri, with former President Harry Truman standing beside him. For the first time, the federal government would play a direct role in the health-care system. Most liberals wanted much more, but they understood that passing Medicare and Medicaid was itself a historic step.","595","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/medicare-made"
"With the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, decades of obstruction came to an end. But turning a legislator like Mills was not easy. Persuasion and negotiation could only go so far.

"Ted Cruz might want you to imagine that he did not use the word “imagine” as relentlessly as he did in his speech at Liberty University on Monday, kicking off his campaign for the White House. But I might be imagining that. Cruz’s mantra has been ridiculed everywhere from the editorial page of the Times (“it seemed as if John Lennon had returned”) to Real Clear Politics (“Imagine the Unintended Irony of Ted Cruz”), yet Cruz is not a man given to regret or self-reflection. If he were, he would never have invited us to picture him as a kid in the nineteen-eighties “heading off to school over a thousand miles away from home, at a place where he knew nobody, where he was alone and scared.” The name of that school, which he neglected to mention, is Princeton University, where he was the president of the Ivy Council, the star of the debate team, and a member of one of the school’s oldest eating clubs. Any of those experiences might have been lonely and scary, but that, let’s be honest, is hard to imagine.","March 24, 2015","597","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ted-cruzs-bold-colors"

"Toward the end of his speech, Cruz asked his audience to “imagine it’s 1979 and you and I were listening to Ronald Reagan.” (“Woo!” went the Liberty students.) Among the aspirants for the Republican nomination, Cruz is not alone in positioning himself as Reagan’s true heir, but he has, perhaps, been the most insistent about it. Cruz has quoted variants of Reagan’s line that Republicans should wave “a banner of bold colors, no pastel shades” so frequently that crowds have begun to shout the words “bold colors” as he speaks them. In 2013, at the annual Reagan Dinner, in Des Moines, Cruz posited that “we’re facing a new paradigm in politics,” adding, without fear of self-contradiction, that the new paradigm “was beta-tested in 1980 with the Reagan revolution.” At last year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, Cruz vowed to “bring back Morning in America”; in February, before the same audience, Cruz said that he was “convinced 2016 is going to be an election very much like 1980,” right down to Reagan’s antagonisms. “It’s worth remembering, when Reagan ran, Washington despised Reagan,” Cruz said. He has that part covered.","599","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ted-cruzs-bold-colors"
"In fairness, Cruz is not the political equivalent of a tribute band. His performance on Monday—part revival meeting, part TED talk—owes little, if anything, to Reagan’s conversational style. Cruz engages the audience more directly, and takes more obvious pleasure in the applause; when a line lands, he cocks his head back with self-satisfaction. But the echoes were there, each no doubt deliberate: twice, Cruz evoked the “shining city on a hill,” Reagan’s twist on John Winthrop’s phrase, and he described a mounting, government-led assault on liberty in the same apocalyptic terms as “A Time for Choosing,” Reagan’s seminal speech of 1964. And, as Cruz took flight in his peroration, he did so on the wings of Reagan—recalling that moment in 1979 when Reagan “was telling us that we would cut the top marginal tax rate from seventy per cent all the way down to twenty-eight per cent, that we would go from crushing stagnation to booming economic growth to millions being lifted out of poverty and into prosperity and abundance … and that, within a decade, we would win the Cold War and tear the Berlin Wall to the ground.”","600","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ted-cruzs-bold-colors"
"Cruz’s reference to 1979, rather than 1980, the Presidential-election year, is an allusion to Reagan’s own campaign announcement speech, a half-hour, paid television broadcast on November 13, 1979. Watching that speech today, however, only reinforces why Republicans such as Cruz and Rand Paul and Scott Walker should stop comparing themselves to Reagan: it makes them look like a bunch of kids. Reagan manages to appear statesmanlike despite the fact that the production values are, by today’s standards, laughable; the set of his taped message looks like one of those offices in late-night ads for personal-injury law firms, and the broadcast opens with Reagan, seated in a leather chair, caught in the act of reading an almost comically thick book—a dictionary? Artifice aside, and demagoguery about “the arrogance of [the] federal establishment” notwithstanding, Reagan’s speech was serious, not strident, in tone, and ventured a credible argument—that “this nation hungers for a spiritual revival; hungers to once again see honor placed above political expediency, to see government once again the protector of our liberties, not the distributor of gifts and privilege.”","601","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ted-cruzs-bold-colors"
"As the Times reporter Adam Clymer observed the next day, the Ronald Reagan of 1979 “was not the harsh, anti-Washington candidate of 1976,” who had tried to unseat incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford by “feeding red meat to the Republican right in a necessary effort to substitute enthusiasm for breadth of support.” Instead, he was restrained, even reflective. Some conservatives worried that their man had lost his zeal. But, “if you’re trying to get elected,” James Lake, Reagan’s press secretary, explained, “you combat the perception that some people have of you as a strident, right-wing conservative.” “Bold colors,” were out, Clymer wrote, at least for the time being. “Last night,” Reagan “seemed to choose pastels.”","602","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ted-cruzs-bold-colors"
"Bold colors may be the only option right now for Cruz, whose immediate and existential need is to stand out in a crowded field of conservative candidates who outpoll him by orders of magnitude. To that end, Cruz is emulating the only Reagan he is capable of emulating—the strident one, the losing one—which is, or ought to be, another object lesson in the perils of emulating Reagan at all. “If there is one thing we are sure of,” Reagan said in his announcement speech of 1979, “it is that history need not be relived.” Imagine if Cruz, or any Republican contender, were to heed that message.","603","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ted-cruzs-bold-colors"
"Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech before Congress was conceived as a political stunt, and it is hard to imagine commentators resisting the question of how the event is playing. We are likely to hear a great deal about how many Democrats show up, how often they applaud, and whether they stand when applauding. But Netanyahu will also be making a case to the American people. He will tell us that an Iranian bomb constitutes an existential threat to Israel, and that the U.S. and its allies should impose even harsher economic sanctions on Iran, presumably to force the “dismantling” of its nuclear infrastructure. He will tell us that, in the negotiations that the U.S. and other leading powers are currently conducting with Iranian leadership, Congress should refuse any deal that, as he puts it, “cements” Iran’s place as a threshold nuclear power. To make this case plausible, there are certain facts that he won’t be able to admit.","March 3, 2015","604","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"Netanyahu will almost certainly begin by acknowledging, and claiming to regret, tensions with the Obama Administration, praising Democrats and stoking an old spirit of bipartisanship. Israel has gotten almost reflexive support—diplomatic cover and military assistance—from both Democrats and Republicans when its security has been at stake. Given the circumstances of Israel’s founding, no Israeli leader can appear to take this support for granted, and no American President would want to appear cavalier about it. (Yesterday, Samantha Power, the American Ambassador to the United Nations, was dispatched to the conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to review the Administration’s record of support and promise a continuation of that support.)","605","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"","606","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"But because both American political parties are so deeply concerned about the security of the state, Netanyahu has a permanent incentive—as does AIPAC, for that matter—to present Israel’s policies as necessary to fend off urgent existential threats. Netanyahu will claim that any Iranian nuclear capacity is proof of genocidal intentions toward Israel—we have heard the same argument about the Palestinian claim to “a right of return”—so why would supporters of Israel accept the reciprocal approach that may emerge from negotiations? This gambit should not work this time. Clearly, Netanyahu is representing one side of a policy debate, with supporters and detractors in both the United States and Israel, where American lives and regional interests are also at stake, and where the Obama Administration has taken a very different position.","607","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"The big threat that Netanyahu will raise is that of Islamist extremism. The Middle East is rife with armed insurgent groups that have proven themselves capable of horrific acts of violence. Sunni groups have been backed by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States allied with the U.S.; Shiite groups have been backed by Iran, and tacitly by Russia, the chief military sponsor of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria. These extremists are united in their hatred for Israel and the West, not necessarily in that order. More immediately, however, they are waging war against each another, more or less along sectarian lines. These rifts may create openings for American diplomacy; it is hard to see, for example, how the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) could ever be defeated without Iran’s coöperation. Netanyahu, unlike Obama, refuses to admit this, presenting these groups as a single military front that the West must beat back.","608","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"For Netanyahu, in other words, Iran should be seen as the most powerful example of this extremism. He speaks, reasonably enough, of Iran’s past sponsorship of terrorist acts, its bloody suppression of the popular uprising that followed the election of 2009, and former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s call to “wipe Israel off the map.” But Netanyahu also wants his audiences to understand a point that his own former chief of staff denies: that Iran’s ruling clerics are fundamentally irrational and share a self-sacrificial mindset with terrorists.","609","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"It is more reasonable to see Iran’s clerics, like the Saudis, as a brutal, pragmatic, authoritarian theocracy with a tenuous hold on power. The regime is likely to go through serious upheavals in the coming years. The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is seventy-six years old. The Guardian Council, which elected him, is filled with both reformers and reactionaries. The powerful and rich Revolutionary Guard could conceivably carry out a coup. A rising generation, which was shaped by the protests and repressions after the elections of 2009, could once again take to the streets. Iran, in other words, is less a terrorist state than a turbulent one, and its continued isolation poses far greater dangers to the international community than a process that draws it closer to the rest of the world—with monitors on the ground, regular diplomatic exchanges, and greater economic integration.","610","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"Most vexing in this context is Netanyahu’s conception of how economic pressures might influence the regime. In his view, stiffening sanctions would put stress on the Iranian middle and educated classes; notionally, these groups would, in turn, force embattled and xenophobic clerics to change their priorities. Yet Netanyahu derides this logic—that economic forces matter—when it is used to envision the moderating influence of a deal. Obama has reason to believe, but cannot say, that relaxing sanctions will bring the middle class into the global economy—exposing élites to foreign travel, and to scientifically trained entrepreneurs and scholars. This opening to the international community might well create new national interests for the regime to protect, and perhaps ultimately transform it.","611","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"The countries currently engaged in negotiations with Iran—not only the U.S. but also China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, even Russia—are a formidable diplomatic bloc, which has reason to deny Iran the capacity to make nuclear weapons, if only to prevent a regional nuclear-arms race. This group has proven its ability to maintain Iran’s economic isolation and force its comparative impoverishment. Netanyahu has been speaking about the negotiations as if they were being conducted by people who, lacking the Jewish people’s sense of dread, engage in wishful thinking—and who are entertaining the relaxation of sanctions before Iran’s nuclear capacity is taken down more or less completely.","612","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"Netanyahu is appalled, he says, that Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are willing to formally approve Iran as a threshold state, with the scientific and infrastructural capacity to assemble a nuclear weapon. In fact, Iran has been a threshold state for some time, and when Netanyahu focusses on this issue he elides the achievement that appears likely to come out of the ongoing negotiations; reportedly, to increase to at least a year the time that Iran would need to assemble a bomb. A year, as President Obama told Reuters last night, would be enough time for the U.S. and its allies to react, first by imposing economic sanctions and finally by taking military action.","613","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"This, for Netanyahu, amounts to appeasement. To be clear, what he really seems to want is war. Netanyahu speaks of “dismantling” Iran’s nuclear infrastructure: demolishing all its nuclear installations and disbanding its scientific groups and programs. He has come to Congress to ask that it increase sanctions until, presumably, Iran accedes to this. But he cannot really think that Iran would completely abandon its nuclear program. Instead, sanctions would not only preëmpt continued negotiations with the great powers, and the humiliation of Iranian reformers, but guarantee a “break-out,” with Iran going for a bomb.","614","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"If this happened, the international community (read, the U.S.) presumably would abandon diplomatic efforts and attack Iran, with the very high risk that this would entrench the regime and create an escalating war with Iran and its proxies in the Persian Gulf. American and perhaps NATO forces would almost certainly be drawn into the conflict. The great powers are entertaining military action as a last resort, and, unlike Israel, they have the military means to intervene at the eleventh hour. Why would they even consider making the last resort the first?","615","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"Ultimately, Netanyahu wants Americans to believe that Iranian leaders are so fanatical in their hatred for Israel that, once armed with a nuclear weapon, they would use it unexpectedly against Tel Aviv. Even if the threat is merely hypothetical—incinerating Tel Aviv would, after all, irradiate the Palestinians for whose sake a bomb would be dropped—no Israeli government can ignore it. That’s why the Israelis have been working for years on a “second-strike capacity,” with the means to retaliate against all Iranian cities. It is an open secret that Israel is in possession of at least a hundred nuclear warheads of its own, and has deployed submarines (acquired from Germany), bombers, and missiles. To believe Netanyahu, you must believe that Iranian leaders are out to secure a nuclear-suicide vest. It is easier to believe that they are trying to secure what Israel has, a hedge against invasion.","616","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-speech-congress"
"Just before getting on the plane to Washington, Netanyahu went to the Western Wall and prayed before the cameras. He wants to seem, or at least dares others to deny, that he carries the fate of a persecuted Jewry on his shoulders. He imagines that he, unlike other world leaders, has learned from history; John Boehner will present him with a bust of Winston Churchill.

"On the same day that the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo immediately sold out an initial run of five million copies of its latest issue—which featured a cover image of the prophet Muhammad—French police arrested the comedian and activist Dieudonné M’bala M’bala for writing on his Facebook page, “Je me sens Charlie Coulibaly.”* Dieudonné was charged with “incitement of terrorism,” for appearing to offer a gesture of solidarity with Amedy Coulibaly, the Islamist gunman who murdered four hostages in a kosher grocery store in Paris last Friday, apparently in concert with the terrorists who carried out the massacre at Charlie Hebdo’s offices two days earlier.","January 15, 2015","618","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/french-law-treats-dieudonne-charlie-hebdo-differently"

"The juxtaposition of the two events—the celebration of a magazine that routinely publishes cartoons considered blasphemous and offensive by many of the world’s Muslims and the muscular prosecution of a relentlessly provocative black comedian—has immediately exposed France to charges of hypocrisy and double standards. To many French Muslims, it seems as if it’s open season for ridicule and anti-Muslim sentiment, while the full power of the state is ready to come down on Dieudonné, who thumbs his nose at the French establishment and enjoys making provocative and thinly veiled anti-Semitic jokes.","620","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/french-law-treats-dieudonne-charlie-hebdo-differently"
"The Facebook post was a shrewd move by Dieudonné. As I have written for this site before, the comedian has played a complex cat-and-mouse game with the French state for years, earning himself a raft of trials and half a dozen convictions for inciting racial hatred while, at the same time, building a considerable following, particularly among disaffected young people of North African and African origin. His comic performances have long included jokes such as “The Germans should have finished the job in 1945.” Charlie Hebdo, for its part, has survived forty-eight trials over the past twenty-two years, according to Le Monde, and has lost a total of nine times, generally for “injure”—personal defamation—rather than hate speech, after, for instance, describing a journalist as “a complete and utter cretin” and a right-wing politician as “the bitch of Buchenwald.” But attempts to punish the publication for religious insults have generally failed, whether it was referring to Pope John Paul II as “un pape de merde” (a shitty pope) or publishing cartoons of the prophet Muhammad.","621","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/french-law-treats-dieudonne-charlie-hebdo-differently"
"The different treatment accorded to Charlie Hebdo and Dieudonné is, however, built into France’s complex cluster of laws regulating protected speech. These laws are alternately very free and highly restrictive. Right after the French Revolution, France abrogated its old laws making blasphemy a crime—and so Charlie Hebdo’s blasphemous depictions of Muhammad are not a crime. At the same time, France’s press laws, which date to the late nineteenth century, make it a crime to “provoke discrimination, hatred, or violence toward a person or group of persons because of their origin or belonging to a particular ethnicity, nation, race, or religion.” In other words, you can ridicule the prophet, but you cannot incite hatred toward his followers. To take two more examples, the actress Brigitte Bardot was convicted and fined for having written, in 2006, about France’s Muslims, “We are tired of being led around by the nose by this population that is destroying our country.” Meanwhile, the writer Michel Houellebecq (whose new novel was featured in the issue of Charlie Hebdo that came out just before the attack) was brought up on charges, but acquitted, for having said in an interview that Islam “is the stupidest religion.” Bardot was clearly directing hostility toward Muslim people, and was thus found guilty, while Houellebecq was criticizing their religion, which is blasphemous, but not a crime, in France.","622","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/french-law-treats-dieudonne-charlie-hebdo-differently"
"This complex distinction reflects modern France’s anti-clerical roots: individuals are protected, but churches and their doctrines are not. There was a powerful desire among the French Republicans to destroy the hegemony of the Catholic Church after the Republic was definitively reëstablished in 1871. This desire did not, however, extend to the creation of something akin to a First Amendment in France. Freedom of expression is mentioned prominently in the Rights of Man, but in practice it is far more restricted than in the U.S., and contains many confusing exceptions. There is a law, for example, passed in 1881, against insulting the head of state. In 2008, when Nicolas Sarkozy was President, a man in a crowd refused to shake his hand. Sarkozy said angrily, “Casse-toi, pauv’con!,” which means something like “Get lost, stupid jerk.” But when a protester later brought a sign reading “Casse-toi, pauv’con!” to a public meeting attended by Sarkozy, the man was arrested and brought up on charges. According to French law, the President of the Republic can insult you, but you can’t insult him—even with his own words.","623","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/french-law-treats-dieudonne-charlie-hebdo-differently"
"In 1990, France passed a law that made it a crime to deny the Holocaust. Dieudonné has flouted this law by inviting onstage during his performances—to thunderous applause—Robert Faurisson, a notorious Holocaust denier. But Dieudonné avoided legal trouble by not actually remarking on Faurisson’s theories. In 2013, the French Parliament passed a law against the “direct” or “indirect” incitement of terrorism, and it is this law that is being invoked to prosecute Dieudonné for his recent Facebook post.","624","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/french-law-treats-dieudonne-charlie-hebdo-differently"
"These kinds of exceptions, selective restrictions, and ambiguities in France’s freedom-of-expression laws have left the country vulnerable to charges of political favoritism. France might consider either a broader conception of free speech—the notion that the answer to bad speech is more speech—or doing a better job of clarifying what is allowed, and why. That it does not relates, once more, to France’s anti-clerical roots.","625","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/french-law-treats-dieudonne-charlie-hebdo-differently"
"France’s version of the separation of church and state—known as laïcité—has a much more anti-religious flavor than the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prevents the establishment of a state-sponsored Church not in order to suppress all public expression of religion but to allow a multitude of faiths to operate freely. In France, the long battle by Republicans against the Church generated broad hostility to most expressions of religion in public. This tradition came to the fore in 2004, when the Parliament passed the “veil” law prohibiting Muslim girls from wearing headscarves in public schools, and in 2010, when it prohibited face-covering veils in public places.* While the law also included a ban against wearing yarmulkes and “large crosses” at school, the law was clearly inspired by a desire to crack down on the ability of France’s Muslims to express a separate identity in public. In the U.S., such a ban would be opposed by conservatives and liberals alike as a serious limitation on religious freedom and freedom of expression.","626","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/french-law-treats-dieudonne-charlie-hebdo-differently"
"Although the French are in no mood for compromise at the moment, they might want to reflect on the fact that America’s Muslim minority, which is free to wear headscarves or not, is far more integrated into American life than France’s. The immediate response in France to the recent massacre has been more forcefully to push its “our way or the highway” form of assimilation, which has, frankly, not been working. This past week, when the French school system enforced a minute of silence for the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack (generally under “Je Suis Charlie” signs), incidents were reported at some seventy French schools—mostly ones with large Muslim populations—where students resisted the observance. While many French see this as siding with the terrorists over the victims, this is not necessarily so. The French state was, in fact, forcing those students to pay homage to a publication that had, in their view, mocked their religion. If it is legitimate for Charlie Hebdo to publish offensive cartoons, it must be legitimate to object, peacefully, to its doing so.","627","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/french-law-treats-dieudonne-charlie-hebdo-differently"
"The broader debate about free expression—and about the discrepancy in the treatment accorded Charlie Hebdo and Dieudonné—also needs to consider the over-all context of media in France. The airwaves and traditional media are dominated by non-Muslim voices. Entire radio and TV programs debate daily the merits and demerits of Islam in France, without much effort to include the views of those in the Muslim community. The commentators on these shows may stop short of hate speech, but many routinely engage in broad generalizations and negative stereotyping. In this context, the vigilant surveillance of Dieudonné’s nasty provocations appears extremely one-sided and disproportionate, and gives him, sadly, far more importance than he deserves.","628","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/french-law-treats-dieudonne-charlie-hebdo-differently"
"With France still reeling from last week’s deadly attacks, it may take time for a moderate response to prevail. But if the country wants to turn the attacks into a turning point for renewed national unity, it needs to show that its Republican values of freedom are inclusive and protect all its citizens—not only some of them. Last week’s tragedy could drive a wedge between violent extremists and France’s Muslims, the vast majority of whom are peaceful, or it could deepen the divide between France’s minorities and the rest of the country.","629","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/french-law-treats-dieudonne-charlie-hebdo-differently"

"Jeb Bush, who is “actively exploring” a Presidential run in 2016, has come under fire for a 2009 Miami-Dade County voter-registration application in which he identified himself as Hispanic. The Times has a photocopy of the document, which requires an original signature next to an oath declaring “that all information provided in this application is true.” A spokeswoman could offer no explanation for the error, but the most likely one is that it gives new meaning to the term “honest mistake.” Bush has a long history of identifying with and immersing himself in the Hispanic community. His wife, Columba, is Mexican-born, and his three children are mixed-race. But, as the media was quick to remind Bush (who was born in Texas, to two exceedingly American parents, George and Barbara), ethnic identities are not exactly elective.","April 6, 2015","631","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"

"Back in August of 2012, we were given a glimpse of Bush’s own discomfort with using his connection to the Hispanic community, in a sitdown interview conducted in Spanish by Jorge Ramos, of Univision. The two men discuss the Republican Party’s stance on immigration, which leads Ramos to ask about using Hispanic identification to one’s electoral advantage. Ramos cites Bush’s eldest son (who would later be elected Texas land commissioner, in a landslide) as an example, saying, “Your son, George P. Bush, he is Latino, right? He considers himself Latino? Because, of course, his mother, Columba, is Mexican.” (CNN’s John King once misidentified her as Colombian.) Bush replies with great pride, “Exactly.” But, as Ramos continues, Bush’s smile droops—he sees where he’s going next, with a more ambiguous example. Ramos says, “Governor Romney, his father is Mexican, he was born in Mexico, the laws say that he is Mexican.” Yes, Bush assents, and here he begins to look uncomfortable. “But he doesn’t consider himself Latino, nor does he put much emphasis on his Latino origin.” The camera catches Bush straining, confusingly both nodding and then shaking his head. Ramos then asks whether Romney’s reluctance to use his ties to Mexico might lose him some votes. Bush shrugs, and says, “I don’t know, I don’t know,” but one has the sense that he does—Romney ended up losing the Hispanic vote to Obama by a margin of seventy-one per cent to twenty-seven per cent.","633","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"
"At a Hispanic Leadership Network conference in Miami in 2013, the former Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez, who is a Cuban-born Republican, described Jeb Bush as “just as Hispanic as everyone in this room, and maybe a little more.” He was embellishing the truth, but not by much—Bush married Columba Garnica de Gallo, in 1974, after meeting her four years earlier while on a school trip to Mexico. He studied Latin American affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, and he and Columba lived in Caracas, Venezuela, for two years before settling down in Florida, where he began a long career in Republican politics. But does any of this make him more or less Hispanic than Elizabeth Warren is Native American? (He’s still more Hispanic than Romney, which is still not at all.)","634","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"
"Bush speaks fluent, near-effortless Spanish as the result of his long-term life choices rather than as part of an effort to win Hispanic votes (a political tactic I have previously called “Hispandering”). As a result, the Spanish-language media is taking him seriously as a candidate who might appeal to Latino voters. Earlier this year, on his Sunday morning talk show, “Al Punto,” Ramos told Gutierrez, “For the first time in history, we have two Hispanic candidates from the Republican Party”—Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz—and, with a good-natured shrug of his shoulders, he added, “and Jeb Bush, if we want to convert him to Latino as well!” Gutierrez responded, “I think it’s very good that we have Hispanics, but there are different types of Hispanics.” He wasn’t referring to Caribbean versus Central American Hispanics, or the difference between Mexicans and Chicanos. He said he preferred not to compare Cruz (a Canadian-born Cuban-American) with Rubio (an American-born Cuban), because the latter is more moderate and the former is on the extreme right. His Goldilocks candidate is the effectively Hispanic Jeb Bush, whose policies he says he knows and likes best. Like many centrists, Bush supports comprehensive immigration reform—legal status and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants—and has distanced himself from the Tea Party extremism of calls for sealing borders. He said in 2013 that immigrants are the economic engine of the U.S., and, in a brief interview last December, told Miami’s NBC affiliate, “I think there’s a compelling case that, if we want to be young and dynamic again, we have to make legal immigration easier.” So if heritage matters less than track records and platforms, then what should it matter to Hispanic voters how Jeb Bush identifies himself, mistakenly or otherwise?","635","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"
"It matters, generally speaking, because minority groups tend to recoil when outside individuals identify with them under false pretenses or with ulterior motives. It rankles, and feels disingenuous. A few months ago, many feminists in Silicon Valley were piqued by comments made by Vivek Wadhwa about women in technology as part of a larger article on the subject in Newsweek. The entrepreneur and academic has always vocally identified himself as a champion for women working in the tech industry, but when he posited, based on his research, that those women were reluctant to speak up for themselves, he was widely criticized and roundly rejected. Jeb Bush would do well to learn from Wadhwa’s precarious positioning, and to avoid the temptation to speak on behalf of any groups that have not voluntarily elected him to do so. And he certainly should not identify as a member, his wife and children notwithstanding.","636","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"
"Bush has at times criticized the G.O.P. for its tough tone in past elections on immigration, and he has gone so far as to call illegal immigration in the name of a better life “an act of love.” One could say about Bush that his own misidentification, along with his desire to be embraced by the Hispanic population, is something of an act of love, made with good intentions. He knows that, deep down in his DNA, he is not Hispanic, but he still hopes, in a way that seems at least partly genuine, that Hispanic voters will think of him as their candidate.","637","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"
"In fact, Bush has a history of polling well with Latinos—in 1998, he won the governorship of Florida with sixty-one per cent of the Hispanic vote to Democratic incumbent Buddy MacKay’s thirty-eight per cent. But, as the Washington Post has pointed out, that may not necessarily translate to similar numbers in 2016; in 1998, the Hispanic electorate in Florida was largely Cuban, a bloc that tends to vote Republican, whereas a national primary would call upon much wider and more diverse groups of Latinos. In 2011, nearly two-thirds of the Latino population, which consistently leans Democratic, identified as Mexican. Still, Florida, with its twenty-nine electoral votes and twenty-two-per-cent-Latino population, would be a hefty prize for Republicans.","638","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"

"On March 18, 2005, the House and Senate subpoenaed Terri Schiavo, ordering her to appear as a witness before committees in both chambers. No one in Congress was waiting to hear what she had to say—everyone knew that Schiavo couldn’t say anything. She had been in what doctors called a persistent vegetative state for fifteen years, although her husband, Michael, had long said that she wouldn’t have wanted to be kept alive in such a condition. When, a couple of weeks later, she finally, indisputably died, at a hospice in Pinellas Park, Florida, an autopsy found that her brain was so atrophied that it was probably less than half the size it had once been. Instead, the point of the subpoenas, pushed by the Republican leaders Bill Frist and Tom DeLay, was to theatrically invoke federal “witness protection” laws to threaten anyone who removed her feeding tubes with the crime of obstructing her appearance before Congress. Republican aides told reporters that the penalty might be five years in prison.","February 18, 2015","645","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/learning-jeb-bush-terri-schiavo"
"","646","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/learning-jeb-bush-terri-schiavo"
"DeLay and Frist were just late-game entrants in the fight for Schiavo’s body, or, rather, the fight to turn what was left of it into a political object. The politician who had the most to say about Terri Schiavo was Jeb Bush, who was governor of Florida then and now seems to be running for President. In 2003, when a court affirmed Michael Schiavo’s right, as Terri’s guardian, to have her feeding tube removed, Jeb Bush pushed a law through the Florida state legislature giving him the power to overrule the court—and so “stormed to the brink of a constitutional crisis,” as the Tampa Bay Times put it in a review of the case earlier this year, going “all in on Schiavo.” The bill was called “Terri’s Law,” but, in terms of decision-making, it was all Jeb’s. He then issued an executive order and, as Michael Kruse described it in an piece for Politico last month, “A police-escorted ambulance whisked her from her hospice in Pinellas Park to a nearby hospital to have her feeding tube put back in.” When a judge overturned Terri’s Law, and the Supreme Court let that ruling stand, Bush turned his efforts to lobbying Congress, at a time when his brother was President.","647","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/learning-jeb-bush-terri-schiavo"
"Bush’s new campaign has brought Schiavo’s story back. E-mails about the case were among those he recently released, and last week Michael Schiavo wrote a letter to the editor of the Miami Herald, warning voters against “trusting” Bush, who Schiavo said “abused the powers” he had as governor. “He made life miserable for my family, the doctors and staff at the nursing home, the police—all because he wanted to involve himself in something that both the law and common human decency told him that no government official should have gotten involved in,” he wrote. Schiavo is giving other interviews as well.","648","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/learning-jeb-bush-terri-schiavo"
"There are those for whom the case is seen not as an embarrassment for Bush but as a conservative credential. The video images of Schiavo remain vivid—in a hospital room, as her parents attempt to get her to look at a balloon and exhort her to show that she realizes that they are there and that they love her. Her parents saw the videos as evidence of her mind’s presence, and proof that she should be kept alive. Many viewers, looking into Schiavo’s drifting eyes, had a sense only of the power of wishful affection to see something that was not there. The doctors who examined her saw nothing else. Schiavo’s parents came to despise her husband, whose intentions they impugned. Their supporters called Michael Schiavo a murderer. The family was Catholic, and their religious beliefs were taken as an irrefutable license to levy such attacks. After Congress, on a March weekend, passed another dubious bill, DeLay decided to call it the “Palm Sunday Compromise.” (A judge soon dispensed with DeLay’s witness-protection ploy.) Much of the passion had to do not with Schiavo, or even the right to die, but with an issue for which her case was taken as a proxy: abortion. Hendrik Hertzberg wrote at the time, “Her lack of awareness actually increased her metaphoric usefulness. Like a sixty-four-cell blastocyst, she was without consciousness. Unlike the blastocyst, she was without potential. If letting her body die is murder, goes the logic, then thwarting the development of the blastocyst can surely be nothing less.”","649","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/learning-jeb-bush-terri-schiavo"
"The abortion debate, which has hardly abated, is just one of the ways that the Schiavo case retains its emotional resonance. (As governor, Jeb Bush worked to restrict reproductive rights, at one point trying to get a guardian appointed for the fetus of a disabled rape victim.) There are others: it is something of a kaleidoscope, mixing up the unknowns about the human brain and the mysteries of marriage. Jeb Bush and other politicians dismissed the medical and scientific consensus on Schiavo’s condition because it didn’t fit their political preferences; that tendency remains, in areas from climate change (about which Jeb has said that he’s a “skeptic”) to immunization. Schiavo died, as far as doctors could tell, because she had an undiagnosed potassium imbalance, possibly because she had forced her weight down from some two hundred and fifty pounds, from when she was in high school, to about a hundred and ten, when she collapsed at the age of twenty-six. Her husband believed that she suffered from bulimia. There was a malpractice settlement that seems to have had a large place in her parents’ imagination, but, when it came down to it, was not worth much—a million dollars, consumed before she died by medical expenses and legal fees. Before it was over someone made a half-stunt offer to Michael another million dollars if he’d divorce Terri and give her parents the rights to her body. (If nothing else, the Schiavo case is a reminder of why same-sex marriage, and the legal protections it brings with it, is vital to so many couples.) Michael Schiavo began living with another woman while Terri was still being sustained by the feeding tube, and had two daughters with her. The slurs and threats they received show that you don’t need Twitter for a certain sort of mass-whispering hysteria. “People used to say they would steal my children,” Schiavo told Fox News last week.","650","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/learning-jeb-bush-terri-schiavo"
"When people ask, between now and Election Day, 2016, what the Schiavo case was about—pity or bitterness, faith in God or science, conviction or political posturing, the judiciary against the executive, or maybe arrogance—their interest may be in Jeb Bush’s motives. Examine the Schiavo case, and try to find the moderation that is so often casually ascribed to Jeb: it isn’t easy. It’s worth sorting out the balance of pragmatism and ideology in his character, as well as his interest in playing to the G.O.P. base and his own Catholic faith—but the policy consequences are the same. That’s clear in Bush’s manhandling use of Terri Schiavo.","651","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/learning-jeb-bush-terri-schiavo"
"Then there is Bush’s sense of how far to push, and that he was entitled to do so. In August, 2003, he wrote to one of the many judges involved, “I normally would not address a letter to the judge in a pending legal proceeding…. However, my office has received over 27,000 emails reflecting understandable concern for the well-being of Terri Schiavo.” A Times report published last weekend, about Jeb’s many notes and requests to the White House on other matters when his father worked there, suggests that he “normally” wasn’t shy at all about asserting influence inappropriately. At the very end, after the autopsy confirmed that Terri’s brain really was too damaged for the sort of consciousness that her parents imagined, Bush wrote to a state prosecutor asking him to investigate Michael Schiavo, suggesting that there had been a sinister gap between when Schiavo found his wife collapsed and when he called 911. “I urge you to take a fresh look at this case without any preconceptions as to the outcome,” Bush wrote. The prosecutor found nothing.","652","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/learning-jeb-bush-terri-schiavo"
"The staff of the French magazine Charlie Hebdo, massacred in an act that shocked the world last week, were not the gentle daily satirists of American editorial cartooning. Nor were they anything like the ironic observers and comedians of manners most often to be found in our own beloved stable here at The New Yorker. (Though, to be sure, the covers of this magazine have startled a few readers and started a few fights.) They worked instead in a peculiarly French and savage tradition, forged in a long nineteenth-century guerrilla war between republicans and the Church and the monarchy. There are satirical magazines and “name” cartoonists in London and other European capitals, particularly Brussels, but they tend to be artier in touch and more media-centric in concern. Charlie Hebdo was—will be again, let us hope—a satirical journal of a kind these days found in France almost alone. Not at all meta or ironic, like The Onion, or a place for political gossip, like the Paris weekly Le Canard Enchaîné or London’s Private Eye, it kept alive the nineteenth-century style of direct, high-spirited, and extremely outrageous caricature—a tradition begun by now legendary caricaturists, like Honoré Daumier and his editor Charles Philipon, who drew the head of King Louis-Philippe as a pear and, in 1831, was put on trial for lèse-majesté.","653","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/satire-lives"
"Philipon’s famous faux-naïf demonstration of the process of caricature still brings home the almost primitive kind of image magic that clings to the act of cartooning. In what way was he guilty, Philipon demanded to know, since the King’s head was pear-shaped, and how could merely simplifying it to its outline be viewed as an attack? The coarser and more scabrous cartoons that marked the covers of Charlie Hebdo—and took in Jesus and Moses, along with Muhammad; angry rabbis and ranting bishops, along with imams—were the latest example of that tradition. In the era of the Internet, when images proliferate, merge, and alter in an Adobe second, one would think that the power of a simple, graffiti-like scrawl was minimal. Indeed, analysts of images and their life have been telling us for years that this sort of reaction couldn’t happen anymore—that the omnipresence of images meant they could not offend, that their meanings and their capacity to shock were enfeebled by repetition and availability. Even as the Islamist murderers struck in Paris, some media-studies maven in a liberal-arts college was doubtless explaining that the difference between our time and times past is that the ubiquity of images benumbs us and their proliferation makes us indifferent. Well, not quite. It is the images that enrage; many things drove the fanatics to their act, but it was cartoons they chose to fixate on. Drawings are handmade, the living sign of an ornery human intention, rearing up against a piety.","654","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/satire-lives"
"For those who recall Charlie Hebdo as it really, rankly was, the act of turning its murdered cartoonists into pawns in a game of another kind of public piety—making them martyrs, misunderstood messengers of the right to free expression—seems to risk betraying their memory. Wolinski, Cabu, Honoré: like soccer players in Brazil, each was known in France by a single name. A small irreverent smile comes to the lips at the thought of the flag being lowered, as it was throughout France last week, for these anarchist mischief-makers, and they would surely have roared at the irony of being solemnly mourned and marched for by former President Nicolas Sarkozy and the current President, François Hollande. The cartoonists didn’t just mock those men’s politics; they regularly amplified their sexual appetites and diminished their sexual appurtenances. It is wonderful to see Pope Francis condemning the horror, but also worth remembering that magazine’s special Christmas issue, titled “The True Story of Baby Jesus,” whose cover bore a drawing of a startled Mary giving notably frontal birth to her child. (Did the Pope see it?)","655","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/satire-lives"
"Nor was it only people’s pieties that the cartoonists liked to tweak. Georges Wolinski, eighty years old, born of a Polish Jewish father and a Tunisian Jewish mother, caused a kerfuffle two years ago by creating a poster—for the Communist Party, no less—in favor of early retirement, which showed a happily retired man grabbing the rear ends of two apparently compliant miniskirted women. “Life Begins at Sixty” was the jaunty caption. Yet Wolinski, for all his provocations, was a life-affirming and broadly cultured bon vivant, who became something of an institution; in 2005, he was awarded the Légion d’ Honneur, the highest French decoration.","656","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/satire-lives"
"In recent years, Charlie Hebdo has had to scrabble for money. It gets lots of attention, but satirical magazines of opinion are no easier to finance in France than they are in America. Still, Wolinski and his confederates represented the true Rabelaisian spirit of French civilization, in their acceptance of human appetite and their contempt for false high-mindedness of any kind, including the secular high-mindedness that liberal-minded people hold dear. The magazine was offensive to Jews, offensive to Muslims, offensive to Catholics, offensive to feminists, offensive to the right and to the left, while being aligned with it—offensive to everybody, equally. (The name Charlie Hebdo came into being, in part, in response to a government ban that had put an earlier version of the magazine out of business; it was both a tribute to Charlie Brown and a mockery of Charles de Gaulle.) The right to mock and to blaspheme and to make religions and politicians and bien-pensants all look ridiculous was what the magazine held dear, and it is what its cartoonists were killed for—and we diminish their sacrifice if we give their actions shelter in another kind of piety or make them seem too noble, when what they pursued was the joy of ignobility.","657","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/satire-lives"
"As the week came to its grim end, with the assassins dead and several hostages—taken not by chance in a kosher grocery store—dead, too, one’s thoughts turned again to the inextinguishable French tradition of dissent, the tradition of Zola, sustained through so much violence and so many civic commotions. “Nothing Sacred” was the motto on the banner of the cartoonists who died, and who were under what turned out to be the tragic illusion that the Republic could protect them from the wrath of faith. “Nothing Sacred”: we forget at our ease, sometimes, and in the pleasure of shared laughter, just how noble and hard-won this motto can be. ♦","658","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/satire-lives"
"Friday was the second day of the annual CPAC jamboree, where conservative activists go to cheer members of the Paul family and jeer at Republican politicians whom they regard as insufficiently devoted to the faith. From the start of this year’s meeting, which is being live streamed on conservative Web sites, it has been clear that many of the attendees, and some of the presenters, too, regard Jeb Bush as someone who falls into the “insufficiently devoted” category—members of which are often referred to as RINOs (Republicans In Name Only). On Thursday, a packed crowd gave a rousing reception to Scott Walker, the up-and-coming governor of Wisconsin, who looks, at this early stage in the primary process, like Bush’s strongest rival.

"On Friday morning, the Bush-baiting continued. First into battle was Laura Ingraham, the talk-show host. “Why don’t we just call it quits,” she asked, during a breakfast-time appearance, “and Jeb and Hillary can run on the same ticket? I mean, going through the list of things they agree on: Common Core, amnesty, giving Obama fast-track trade authority, allowing the trade deals with China, the surveillance culture.

"After a couple of ho-hum speeches from Rick Perry and Marco Rubio, two of the would-be G.O.P. candidates in 2016, Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, took the stage. Many CPAC partisans regard the R.N.C. as the soggy, corporate-funded enemy within (which could also serve as a shorthand description of their feelings about the Bush family), but Priebus was there to be friendly. “There will be no coronation in the Republican Party,” he assured the crowd. “If you want to win the nomination, you’re going to have to earn the nomination.” Then came Donald Trump, who appeared to have spent the flight down to D.C. doing some handicapping. “Jeb Bush—he’s in favor of Common Core,” Trump said blithely. “He’s weak on immigration. I don’t see him winning.”","662","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"
"Many of the attendees would dearly love to believe that Trump is right in his analysis. He was followed by one of their heroes, Senator Rand Paul, who already seems to have been running for President forever. Paul didn’t address Bush directly: he didn’t have to. By the time he had taken some potshots at Hillary Clinton, promised to deliver the biggest tax cut in American history, and noted that America needed new leadership, elements of the crowd were chanting, “President Paul!

"There was a lot of speculation about what sort of reception Bush would receive when he spoke in the early afternoon. The Washington Times had published a report about a possible walkout. At the last moment, Bush’s staff had switched the format of his appearance from a speech to a twenty-minute Q.-and-A. session with Sean Hannity, the Fox News host. The change seemed like a sign of nervousness in his camp or, perhaps, a reaction to the widespread panning that his last big speech, about foreign policy, received.","664","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"
"It turned out to have been a smart move. Hannity was polite and respectful, and Bush appeared more relaxed taking questions than he had been while reading out loud. As the two of them took the stage, some Paul supporters did walk out, but the vast majority of the crowd stayed and listened to Bush describe himself as a “practicing reform-minded conservative.”","665","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"
"Some of those who remained weren’t convinced. When Hannity brought up immigration they booed, prompting Bush to quip, “I’m marking you down as neutral, and I want to be your second choice.” It was a good line, and Bush delivered other zingers too. Asked to respond to the words “Hillary Clinton,” he replied “foreign fund-raising,” a barbed reference to a Washington Post story, published earlier this week, reporting that the Clinton Foundation raised money from overseas governments during Hillary’s tenure as Secretary of State. When Hannity said “Barack Obama,” Bush replied “failed President.”","666","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"
"These gibes earned Bush some cheers. More importantly, though, he didn’t make any enemies, or any new ones at least. Indeed, he made a pretty convincing case that he is a committed conservative. (A couple of weeks ago, I made the same argument.) As governor of Florida, he reminded his audience, he cut spending, bequeathed his successor a budget surplus, and introduced the first statewide school-voucher system in the country. In a bow to supply-side economics, he said that he believed that tax cuts could create revenue. When the discussion turned to foreign policy, he welcomed Benjamin Netanyahu’s upcoming speech to Congress, saying, “We need to make clear that there is no light between us and Israel.” And then, shifting back to Obama, he accused the President of trampling on the Constitution and disrespecting America’s heritage. It wasn’t exactly Rudy Giuliani questioning Obama’s religion and love of country, but it earned Bush more applause, as Hannity wrapped things up.","667","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"
"The immediate response from journalists who watched the exchange was positive. “That had the potential to be disastrous, but Jeb turned in a really strong performance,” Jessica Taylor, the campaign editor for The Hill, said in a tweet. Evidently, even Laura Ingraham couldn’t think of anything particularly nasty to say. She contented herself with a tweet about Bush’s ties to the plutocracy: “Jeb Handlers will spin #CPAC2015 appearance as ‘brave,’ and ‘held firm,’ ‘didn’t back down,’ to reassure #DonorClass that he’s the one.”","668","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"

"As Bill Clinton might put it, Barack Obama has brass. Barely two months after his party suffered a shattering defeat in the midterm elections, Obama walked into the House chamber looking like a quarterback just returned home from a Super Bowl triumph. “Good to see you,” he said, joshing with Democrats who had arrived early to get an aisle seat. “How are you?” If he noticed some prominent absences on the Democratic side, including such stalwart supporters as Kay Hagan and Mark Udall, two senators who lost their seats in the fall, he didn’t let on. Entering enemy terrain, the President was clearly determined to make it his own—at least for one night.","January 21, 2015","670","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"

"Although Obama ended with one of his trademark calls for unity, the address he delivered was forceful and politically charged. As expected, the heart of it was a populist economics plan that challenges virtually everything today’s Republican Party stands for. “Middle-class economics,” the President called it, and without delving into too many details he made a pretty good fist of laying it out: tax breaks for working families, a higher minimum wage, expanded child care, two years’ worth of free community-college tuition guaranteed, investments in infrastructure—and much of this to be financed by raising taxes on the rich and the big banks. “Let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one per cent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth,” Obama declared. “We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the economy.”","672","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"
"That part of the speech, which echoed some of the themes that were raised by the Occupy Wall Street movement, and that have since been further elucidated by Thomas Piketty, was well trailed. What came as more of a surprise was the President’s over-all tone, which clearly reflected his recent successes in doing an end run around Congress on immigration policy, reaching a deal on climate change with China, reversing U.S. policy toward Cuba, and seeing his approval ratings rise on the back of good economic news. From the beginning, his language was much more celebratory than in his previous State of the Union speeches. “We are fifteen years into this new century,” he said. “It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page.” There followed a litany of indicators showing that things are going right in the Union: a growing economy, shrinking deficits, a falling unemployment rate, millions fewer people without health insurance, an end to the combat mission in Afghanistan. “America, for all that we have endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: the shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong,” he said.","673","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"
"The President wasn’t merely upbeat. He was self-assured, glib, and, at times, bordering on bumptious. “Well, we’ve been warned,” Karl Rove complained on Twitter. “POTUS will spend rest of year campaigning.” In the chamber, the Republicans, some of whom had perhaps been expecting a more humble Obama, sat mostly in silence. (As is usual on these occasions, John Boehner, the Speaker of the House, looked like he was suffering from chronic constipation.) At one point, after reciting another encouraging economic development, the President turned to the Republicans and said, “This is good news, people.” It wasn’t until near the end that he acknowledged the results of the elections—the elections he triumphed in, that is. “I have no more campaigns to run,” he said. And then, departing from his prepared remarks in response to some applause from Republicans, he smiled and added: “I know, because I won both of them.”","674","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"
"In a speech that lasted about an hour, Obama devoted barely ten minutes to foreign policy: here, too, his interpretation of recent events was highly positive. Without providing much evidence to support his assertion, he said, “In Iraq and Syria, American leadership—including our military power—is stopping ISIL’s advance.” He also asked his hosts to pass a resolution authorizing the use of force against the jihadists in Iraq and Syria, and, addressing the nuclear negotiations with Iran, promised to veto a sanctions bill if Congress passes one. Turning to Russia and Ukraine, he didn’t quite declare victory over Vladimir Putin, but he came pretty close, mocking those who suggested, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea last year, that Putin had outmaneuvered the West. “Today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters,” Obama said. “That’s how America leads: not with bluster but with persistent, steady resolve.”","675","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"
"By then, he was rolling toward the finish. He welcomed home Alan Gross, the American who had been held prisoner in Havana until the recent détente; hailed efforts to fight Ebola in West Africa (in truth, he could have made more of the efficacy of the government’s response here at home); pledged, once again, to shut down Guantánamo; and slipped in a stretcher about how restrained the United States has been in its deployment of drones. After declaring climate change to be the biggest threat to future generations, he went into a closing spiel that drew on a familiar Obama trope, saying that there’s no such thing as a liberal America and a conservative America, or a white America and a black America—only a United States of America, in which both parties should come together and embrace a “better politics.”","676","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"
"I won’t dwell on that bit, partly because it’s so familiar, and partly because it didn’t fit in with the rest of the speech, which had contained but one crumb for his Republican opponents to chew on—a promise to complete some new free-trade deals.

"As the President is well aware, his ambition of transcending partisanship has been frustrated. In fact, he now seems quite comfortable with embracing partisanship and economic populism. Until the end of the speech, when Obama circa 2004 put in a cameo appearance, he had provided a welcome glance of the Obama whom many Democrats believed they had elected in 2008: progressive, impassioned, and persuasive. “Where was this economic Obama in 2009?” the documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney asked on Twitter. That’s a question that historians will certainly ponder. Last night, though, the President showed up and staged a successful occupation of Capitol Hill.","678","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-occupies-capitol-hill-2015-state-union"
"Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, explained his approach to the Legislature as we flew in a state plane from Albany to Westchester County. At fifty-seven, Cuomo still has an athletic build, and, at two hundred pounds distributed over a six-foot-one-inch frame, he fits into an airline seat with some difficulty. It was mid-December, and he was on his way to Manhattan to continue a vigil. His father, former Governor Mario Cuomo, was at his apartment on the East Side, with end-stage heart disease. Mario Cuomo defined his three terms as governor with oratory; Andrew Cuomo has sought to build his reputation in a different way. He made clear that his primary inspiration when it came to dealing with legislators was Bill Clinton, not his father. During Clinton’s second term, Cuomo served in his Cabinet, as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. “I was watching, and they were impeaching the guy, and he was still there every day, asking them how they were doing, trying to make deals,” Cuomo recalled, his voice bearing the hard consonants of Queens, where he grew up. “My job is to get to yes,” he said. “If I don’t make a deal, I get nothing done. If I get nothing done, I am a failure. If the objective is to make a nice speech, it means nothing.”","679","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Because New York State’s government had long been controlled by “three men in a room”—the Governor; Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Speaker of the Assembly; and Dean Skelos, the Republican Majority Leader of the Senate—Cuomo often found occasion to praise the other two. “I’m very big on giving other people credit,” he told me. “It’s the whole collegial thing. That’s how I get what I get done done.” Most recently, in his State of the State address, on January 21st, Cuomo said that he would soon be going on a trade mission to Mexico, and he displayed a PowerPoint slide of himself, Skelos, and Silver, all wearing sombreros. “We are going to be our own version of the three amigos!” Cuomo declared, to appreciative laughter from Skelos and Silver, who were seated on the stage beside him. A perfunctory shout-out like this would ordinarily draw little notice, except that, the following morning, federal agents led Silver off in handcuffs.","680","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Silver was charged in a baroque scheme to exploit his office for personal gain. According to the prosecutor’s complaint, he arranged for state funding of a research laboratory at Columbia University for victims of an asbestos-related cancer. The director of the lab referred his patients to Silver’s personal-injury law firm, which, in turn, filed lawsuits on their behalf. From this and a related arrangement, Silver is said to have netted more than four million dollars. (Silver has denied wrongdoing, though he did step down as speaker; the lab director and the law firm have not been charged.)","681","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s solicitude for Silver and others in the Legislature was longstanding. In the summer of 2013, Cuomo created what became known as the Moreland Commission, a bipartisan group of leading citizens, who were to spend up to eighteen months investigating public corruption in the state. The commission’s inquiries focussed in particular on whether the outside business activities of state legislators should be subject to tighter regulation. By early 2014, Silver and his colleagues had come to loathe the commission, and went to court to thwart its inquiries. Around the same time, Cuomo was seeking to pass his annual budget, and he hoped to do that on schedule. So, just nine months after Cuomo created the commission, he abruptly shut it down. Silver passed Cuomo’s budget; Cuomo rid Silver of the meddlesome commission.","682","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"On the day after Silver’s arrest, I met with Cuomo in his New York City office, on Third Avenue. I asked him about the widespread contention that the charges against Silver showed that Cuomo should have let the Moreland investigation run its course.","683","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"“They’re exactly wrong,” Cuomo said. “What happened on the Moreland Commission is they subpoenaed the outside info of the Senate and the Assembly, in a fairly aggressive way. The Senate and the Assembly join together, the Republicans and the Democrats, in a motion to quash the subpoenas. And they are successful in the lower court. And we’re stuck for, like, four months.”","684","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Closing down Moreland, in Cuomo’s view, broke the logjam. After the shutdown, the Legislature passed modest ethics reform, which increased penalties for bribery and established a pilot program for public financing in the next state comptroller’s race. Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, demanded the Moreland files and used them to make the case against Silver and, perhaps, others. “We get the legislation I wanted in the first place,” Cuomo told me. “Moreland takes the same cases and the same subpoenas and hands them to local D.A.s and to Preet.” Cuomo disclaims any responsibility for Silver’s possible misdeeds. “If Anthony Weiner shows his private parts, do you blame Obama? These are criminal acts of individual legislators. What would you have me do?”","685","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Each step in Cuomo’s analysis makes a kind of tactical sense. But he shut down the investigation even though the Legislature failed to make significant political reforms. Bharara and the other prosecutors obtained the commission’s files only because Bharara publicly expressed his outrage at Cuomo’s action. * Cuomo’s explanation ignored the symbolism: How could there ever be a legitimate reason, in a state long beset with corruption in its Legislature, for the governor to short-circuit his own marquee attempt to clean it up?","686","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"For better and for worse, Cuomo views his work as a series of transactions. He disdains rhetoric; he prizes results. He has had several accomplishments in his first four years. Against heavy odds, he pushed through a marriage-equality bill in the Legislature; he banned fracking; he tightened the state’s gun-control laws; he closed thirteen prisons; he started construction on the first major bridge in the state in fifty years, a replacement for the Tappan Zee, across the Hudson; and he passed four balanced budgets in a row, all on time. Deeds, not words—that might as well be the motto of Cuomo’s administration. In nearly every speech, and in many conversations, Cuomo dismisses the importance of political talk. As if adopting a typical voter’s view of President Obama, Cuomo told me, “Beautiful rhetoric, beautiful vision—I’m sold on the vision—and what happens? There was no product. There was no actualization of the vision. Now I’m more disillusioned than I was when we started. You brought me up with that beautiful language, and you got me excited and I thought it was possible and then it wasn’t.”","687","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"I mentioned that Cuomo seemed especially pleased to be identified with clearing snow after storms. “Because talking about clearing the snow, talking about doing any of this crap, doesn’t work,” he said. “They’ve heard it before. They’ve heard it all. You’re not going to say anything that moves the jury. I believe that fundamentally. Show me, it’s show-me time. Show me results. Build a bridge, build a train to LaGuardia, clear the snow, save lives. Huh? A little competence. Work with the other side, not this crazy partisan gridlock, huh? You can actually work together. Balance the budget. Really? Get a budget passed on time.” By his own method of accounting, his first term as governor ranks as a considerable success. It also stands in notable counterpoint to that of his father, who died on January 1st, the day Andrew was sworn in for his second term.","688","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"For decades, the political calendar in Albany followed a predictable pattern. The governor gave his State of the State address shortly after the first of the year and submitted a proposed budget by February 1st, in time for the Legislature to act before the current budget expired, on April 1st. When we spoke in his office, Cuomo offered a dramatic rendering of what usually happened next. “All you knew about state government in this state was what you saw for one week a year—four days leading up to April 1st,” he said. “The newscast would start, ‘Well, this year, do you think we’re going to have a budget on time?’ They go to a legislator: ‘I think some people are optimistic. I think it might.’ April 1st: ‘Here we are! Waiting for midnight, let’s see if we have a budget deal. And here the Governor’s coming out. Governor! Are we going to have a budget on time?’ ‘No, the Senate is an ass and the Assembly’s an ass, and they’re all asses.’ The budget winds up four months late, five months late.”","689","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo, who took office in 2011, was determined to end this syndrome. Thanks to a constitutional amendment ratified in 1927, New York State has what’s known as “executive budgeting,” which means, in rough terms, that the governor alone has the right to submit a budget, and the role of the Legislature is limited to voting it up or down. Over the years, though, the power of the Legislature expanded, and the terms of the budget became subject to extensive negotiation and, often, delay. This practice offended James McGuire**, who was chief counsel to Governor George Pataki, the Republican who served from 1995 to 2007, and McGuire led a crusade to restore the governor to preëminence in budget matters. Sheldon Silver challenged McGuire, and Pataki, on behalf of the Assembly. The fight went to the Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, which, in 2004, handed the governor a major victory. The court made clear that the Legislature “may not alter” the governor’s budget proposal in any way.","690","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Still, it took some time for the significance of Silver v. Pataki, as the case was known, to be fully appreciated in Albany. There was only one on-time budget in the Pataki years; the Legislature kept state government functioning after April 1st by passing “extenders”—stopgap measures to fund the operations of the state until the actual budget was passed. “Cuomo was the first one who really used the full extent of the governor’s power over the budget under the constitution,” McGuire told me.","691","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"When Cuomo submitted his first budget, he laid down a challenge to legislators. If they refused to pass his budget on time, he would submit the entire budget as an extender. A Cuomo aide said, “We said to them, ‘Here’s your extender, it’s called the budget. If you don’t want to pass it, you will close the whole government—not just the parks, the whole thing.’ ” The aide went on, “We had to face the question of what we would do if the Legislature didn’t blink. We thought we would have to make good on our threat. But we never got there. They understood that we meant business. They passed the budget, and they did it on time.” Cuomo had tamed the Legislature on the centerpiece of state government.","692","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s obsession with the timing of the budget can obscure the larger issue of state spending. “He fixates on on-time budgets, but he never says why the budgets were delayed in the old days,” Dan Cantor, the national director of the Working Families Party, told me. The Party, a left-leaning consortium of labor unions and others, has had a contentious relationship with Cuomo. “The budgets were delayed because the left held them up, because they wanted more money for things that were important—for schools and roads and libraries. Cuomo is not some kind of progressive. He rejects the view that the middle class in America was built by unions pushing up and the progressive income tax pushing down. His attitude is we have to keep rich people happy. It’s trickle-down economics.”","693","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"To a certain extent, Cuomo would not dispute this view, at least when it comes to taxes. His liberalism manifests itself in initiatives that entail relatively little government spending, such as marriage equality, the fracking ban, and gun control. Cuomo has made a point of cutting some taxes every year, which he regards as crucial in retaining and courting jobs for the state. He also dismisses the idea that the state tax code can address the problem of inequality. “You keep raising taxes, raising regulations, they will leave,” he said in a recent speech in Albany. “Business is more mobile, people are more mobile, and they will leave. And they have left. So that was a cultural shift for us in New York—we’re in a competition with all those other states. Our friends say, ‘Well, we should use the tax code to address social inequities and raise the taxes on the rich.’ If that’s going to happen, that has to happen at the federal level, because we here in this state, we are in a competition, we are in a footrace with every other state. And our taxes and our level of taxation and our regulations are going to say whether we come in first, second, third, or fourth in that race.”","694","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"It’s sometimes said of certain politicians that they love humanity but hate people; Andrew Cuomo does not appear especially fond of either. He is the uncommon elected official with a streak of misanthropy. Cuomo rarely sees ordinary people, and they rarely see him, except in television commercials. “Andrew doesn’t like meeting with voters,” someone who is familiar with his campaigns told me. “He’ll do parades, but that’s about it.” In his 2014 race for reëlection, which he won with fifty-four per cent of the vote, Cuomo outraised Rob Astorino, the Republican candidate, by forty-five million dollars to six million, and thus dominated the airwaves with his advertisements. Cuomo agreed to a single debate with Astorino and none with Zephyr Teachout, his opponent in the Democratic primary.","695","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Except during weather crises or after transportation accidents, Cuomo hardly ever consents to be interviewed on television. When he does answer questions on the air, it is often by telephone rather than on camera. Unlike most of his predecessors, Cuomo has given his inaugural addresses to small, invitation-only audiences. (This year, at the World Trade Center, a guard at the front door shooed away the curious with the words “Not open to the public.”)","696","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo has a tense and distant relationship with the Albany press corps. His news conferences, which are sometimes just “gaggles,” or scrums in a hallway in the capitol, can be contentious. (Reporters have demanded that Cuomo explain the poor sales of his memoir, “All Things Possible,” which was published last fall.) Cuomo does make semi-regular appearances on an Albany-based public-radio interview program, and he used to be a frequent guest on the radio show of Fredric U. Dicker, the longtime Albany correspondent for the New York Post, but the relationship between the two men soured. On the window of Dicker’s office, which faces a well-travelled corridor in the capitol, there is now a photograph of the Governor with a Pinocchio nose and the words “Come clean on Moreland.”","697","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Behind a lectern, Cuomo can sound like an American tourist abroad, speaking loudly and slowly in order to make himself understood. At closer range, he’s a more formidable presence. His speech comes in aggressive, self-confident bursts, especially when he’s sizing up the state of political play. He is relentless. “When he wants to hire you, he starts calling you all the time and acting like you already work for him,” a former aide said. “He just assumes he can persuade you.” His interactions with state legislators also tend to be one on one, and his early success with them on the budget created another opportunity for him. “What people forget is when the budget is months late there is no time to do anything else,” a senior aide told me. “But we knew by March that we were going to get the budget, and that meant that we had time to do marriage equality right away, in 2011.”","698","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Today, same-sex marriage is legal in thirty-six states and the District of Columbia; it would be inconceivable for New York not to be among them. But in 2011 success was a long shot. New York’s Senate had voted down a marriage-equality law two years earlier, when the Democrats controlled the chamber. In the 2010 elections, the Democrats lost the Senate, which meant that getting the issue voted in would be even more difficult. (Passage in the Democratic-controlled Assembly was assured.)","699","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"“I didn’t know that I could pass it,” Cuomo told me. “I’m not a big fan of fighting the good fight and losing, because one of the Democratic Party’s problems is, I think, it’s done that too often. You know, we were oversaturated with good intent, no action, no results.” Still, he decided to press ahead.","700","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The plan was detailed and methodical, focussed entirely on winning in the Senate, which was run, then as now, by the Republican Skelos. “L.B.J. used to talk about how, in legislative relations, people sort of have a pattern,” Cuomo told me. “They talk about, in certain card games, people have a pattern. Clinton used to talk about, you know, people have a tell.” He went on, “Skelos never goes first, and Skelos never says anything until the last minute.” At first, Skelos would not even commit himself to bringing the issue up for a vote. As Cuomo recalled, “Skelos said, as a put-off, ‘Don’t ask me what I’m going to do. You never get to me until it gets past the Democrats, and it hasn’t gotten past the Democrats. So I’m not responding, because it’s moot. Call me when it gets past the Democrats. And, by the way, it never will.’ ” (Skelos declined to comment.)","701","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo and his allies tried to establish Democratic unity, which proved elusive. In the cynical calculus of Albany, failure on marriage equality looked better to some Democrats than victory. “If they kept the issue alive, year after year, they could continue to fund-raise against Republicans on it, and then blame the Republicans for its failure,” one person involved in the process said. Cuomo personally lobbied the holdouts. His staff kept a stash of Pepperidge Farm cookies (as well as Kosher cookies for the observant) for when the lawmakers came to meet with him. “All governors—Pataki, Spitzer, his father, me—let the legislators get on our nerves,” David Paterson, Cuomo’s predecessor, told me. “Andrew maintains a poise of not letting that get into the conversation. Many would have thought that his temper and his passion would get in the way. He has actually been the governor who has exercised greater patience and decorum than the rest of us.” When Cuomo grew frustrated by a few stalling Democrats, he called a press conference to demonstrate that all members of the Party were now united. Unwilling to embarrass the Governor, everyone fell in line.","702","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"He then needed at least three Republican votes, a task made considerably more difficult by a public promise from the leader of the state Conservative Party to mount primary challenges against any Republican senators who voted for same-sex marriage. “It was just good old-fashioned political personal persuasion,” a Cuomo aide recalled. The marriage bill was the last bill of the session, and Cuomo had few options for horse-trading about other legislation. “He used the governor’s mansion. He used his office. His daughters were around. You were greeted. You were given refreshments. You were talking with Andrew, your friend, alone. ‘Which side of history do you want to be on?’ ‘I won’t forget you.’ ‘Have another cookie.’ ”","703","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Roy McDonald, a longtime Republican state senator from a district around Saratoga County, had voted against marriage equality in 2009. “I think with some of these social issues, it becomes so adversarial that it hurts our country,” he told me. “But I began to think, If someone is pursuing happiness, God bless them. It’s not our business to be telling people what to do.” Cuomo met with McDonald repeatedly. “He talked to me, but I don’t think it was a matter of convincing us,” McDonald said. “He was respectful. I commended him for being a leader on the issue.” In time, Cuomo gathered four Republican commitments for his side. (Four was ultimately deemed necessary, because no one wanted to be “the vote” that turned the issue.)","704","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Marriage equality passed by thirty-three to twenty-nine. In 2012, Roy McDonald was defeated for reëlection in the Republican primary.","705","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s contempt for the power of words alone seems especially notable coming from the son of perhaps the best-known political speaker of his generation. He often uses the same phrase to dismiss comparisons between him and his father. As he put it in his eulogy for Mario, “Over the years, the press would love to give their dime-store psychoanalysis of our quote-unquote ‘complex’ father-and-son relationship, which was all a lot of hooey.” Still, the relationship was complex, and, like most sons, Andrew was formed both by emulation and by rejection of his father’s example.","706","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"During Andrew’s childhood, his father was not a famous man. For most of those years, Mario Cuomo was a work-obsessed lawyer with a modest practice in downtown Brooklyn. He first came to some prominence in 1972, when Mayor John Lindsay asked him to mediate a dispute in Queens. The Lindsay administration had proposed building a large public-housing project in Forest Hills, which was then a mainly Jewish and middle-class neighborhood. The community rebelled, and the fight, which pitted African-Americans against Jews, became both a symptom and a cause of the breakdown of the civil-rights coalition of the nineteen-sixties. Cuomo brokered a compromise (the project was built in a scaled-back form), and he then published a thoughtful diary of his efforts to resolve the controversy. Readers of the diary, which recounted his seven-day work weeks, could be forgiven for concluding that the author had no children. In fact, he had five.","707","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Mario and Matilda Cuomo married in 1954, while Mario was a student at St. John’s law school, and they had their first child, Margaret, the following year. She is now a prominent radiologist and cancer specialist. Andrew was born in 1957. In a later edition of Mario’s diaries, he wrote, “Margaret and Andrew Mark took the brunt of the early years of our marriage, years of financial insecurity when I was a law student and young lawyer, and Matilda taught school.” The next child was Maria, a philanthropist married to the designer Kenneth Cole; then Madeline, a lawyer; and, finally, Chris, born in 1970, who is a news anchor at CNN, where we are colleagues. Andrew Cuomo notes in his memoir that protesters in the Forest Hills controversy sometimes came to the Cuomo family home, in Queens, but they wasted their time: “He often left before my sisters and I got up and came back after we were asleep. To make their point, the demonstrators would have had to march at 7 P.M. on a Sunday, the one time of the week that my mother insisted he be home for dinner. And when he was home, he was usually working.”","708","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Andrew went to Archbishop Molloy*** High School, in Queens, and, the week before he graduated, his father’s close friend Fabian Palomino asked Mario how Andrew was doing. “You know, I really don’t know,” Mario replied, as recounted in Robert S. McElvaine’s 1988 biography. “I’ve been so busy running around the office for a long time—I really don’t know. I haven’t spent a lot of time with him in the last four years. I guess I’ve taken him to two or three ball games. Matilda made me take him.”","709","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After the mediation in Forest Hills, Cuomo became a more or less perpetual candidate for elective office, usually an unsuccessful one. In 1973, he considered a run for mayor of New York, but backed out. In 1974, he lost the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor; the following year, the new governor, Hugh Carey, named him secretary of state. In 1977, Cuomo entered a seven-way Democratic primary for mayor of New York, a contest that remains a classic in New York politics. As Andrew writes in his book, “I learned early that if I wanted to spend time with my father I had to tag along.”","710","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"So Andrew, then in his second year at Fordham, in the Bronx, volunteered to be Mario’s driver in the mayor’s race. “Andrew was the ‘body guy’—he was always with his father,” Bruce Gyory, an Albany-based political consultant who worked on the campaign, told me. “His job was to get his father in and out of events on time. It was not easy, because Mario was warm and gregarious, and he didn’t have that inner clock that most politicians have about when their next meeting is.” In the fall, Andrew returned to college, and organized the borough for his father. Mario finished second to Ed Koch in the primary, lost to him in a runoff, and then ran unsuccessfully as the Liberal Party candidate in the general election. (The race poisoned relations between Mario Cuomo and Koch for the rest of their lives, mainly because Koch blamed Cuomo for campaign signs that supposedly said “Vote for Cuomo, not the homo.” Over the years, Andrew has also been blamed for the signs. Though the signs figure largely in New York political folklore, there is no evidence that they even existed.)","711","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The following year, 1978, Mario ran as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor—a largely powerless position—and won. Andrew was then a student at Albany Law School, and while the Legislature was in session he and Mario were roommates at the Hotel Wellington. Mario kept a diary during this period, and Andrew is a frequent presence, usually as the object of his father’s affectionate exasperation. December 6, 1980: “Andrew is looking for another car: he has a real fascination with automobiles that comes higher on his list of priorities than many other things, including studying for his classes. He’ll pass anyway; he always has. But he has never tested himself intellectually. I think if he did he’d be surprised at his own ability.” (Andrew still collects and tinkers with sports cars.) January 22, 1981: “Andrew is working at the gas station for the week he’s home. He’s going to need the money. He ran up $165 in tickets in Albany for leaving his car parked overtime while he was studying for exams. The car is in his mother’s name, so they ran a story in the Times-Union referring to Matilda Cuomo, scofflaw!”","712","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In 1982, Cuomo and Koch ran against each other again, this time in the Democratic primary for governor. The race was widely seen as a last chance for Cuomo, who was earning a reputation as a perennial loser. In his diary, on January 5, 1982, he noted that a political associate “suggested Andrew would make a good campaign manager. . . . I’m leery about his being too distracted from his law studies, though, and will have to think hard about it.”","713","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"It appears, in retrospect, that Mario praised his son more in his diary than to his face. “As our conversations began to center on the upcoming 1982 election, my father never mentioned that he had any particular confidence in my political acumen,” Andrew wrote in his memoir. “Expressing feelings and pride in their children was not something the men of his generation did.” Still, at this moment of political life or death, Mario turned to his son. February 18, 1982: “Andrew is doing an excellent job organizing the campaign. He, more than any of us, has appeared to profit from the political involvement of the last 8 years. He is competent, respectful, dedicated—and liked.”","714","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"That last point was debatable. During 1982, Andrew first gained a reputation as a political brawler, playing the bad cop to his father’s philosopher king. Koch began the campaign with a thirty-five-per-cent lead in the polls, and Mario, as well as his twenty-four-year-old campaign manager, had to struggle to be taken seriously. “Andrew is driven and intense, and he was smarter than people gave him credit for when he was running his father’s campaign,” Howard Glaser, who worked for Mario in 1982 and has since been a close aide to Andrew, told me. “He’s never been a person who cared a lot about what the media thinks of him. He just wanted to get the job done.” Aided by a series of gaffes by Koch, including a Playboy interview in which the Mayor disparaged both rural and suburban life, Mario surged to a six-point victory in the primary. September 23, 1982: “Andrew is near exhaustion. He has a tendency to overwork himself. It’s a syndrome I recognize and understand.” In the general election, Mario defeated Lew Lehrman, a corporate executive who lavishly financed his own campaign, by three per cent. December 5, 1982: “Andrew loved the beautiful gold pocket watch his family bought him for his 25th birthday. Engraved on the inside of the front cover was the inscription: ‘We are proud of you. Even more, we love you. Your family.’ It was wonderful to be able to do it.”","715","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the state capitol in Albany, Andrew Cuomo sits at the same desk, in the same office, that his father did as governor. George Pataki used a grand space next door, but Andrew, like his father, prefers the cozier dimensions of Room 203. On a shelf opposite the desk is a photograph of the two men together, taken on a basketball court, shortly after Mario was elected governor. Though they are both smiling for the photographer, they also clearly know how to play the game—and are intent on the competition. Andrew, his hair styled in a swirling eighties bouffant, is dribbling, while his father leans in on defense. “I weigh two hundred, but he was two forty,” Andrew told me. “If he knocked into you, you hurt for a week.”","716","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Basketball is a team game. Mario preferred to play one on one, as Andrew recalled at his father’s funeral. “The basketball court remained for him the one place where he could allow himself to be his fully aggressive self,” Andrew said. “We had epic battles, he and I. He hated few things as much as a timid opponent on the basketball court, because you cheated him of a real contest. I was bigger than my father, and I was not intimidated by the fact that he was governor—he couldn’t fire me. We played in the state-police gym in Albany. He liked to play one on one because it was the purest form of competition. . . . He would make faces at you, he would taunt you, he would talk constantly, and it would distract me—a maddening banter, designed to unnerve you. He would hit you in places the human body did not have anatomical defenses.”","717","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The two men usually played ball at the end of long days in Albany, where Andrew worked for his father as an unpaid adviser. (The other aides called him Governor; Andrew called him Mario.) As Andrew notes in his memoir, it was around this time that he earned the nicknames “Prince of Darkness,” “Darth Vader,” and Mario’s “hatchet man.” (All undeserved, Andrew said.) In short order, though, Andrew escaped Albany, spending a brief period as an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan and then as a lawyer in a private firm. He retained a hand in his father’s political career, but soon went out on his own.","718","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the eighties, New York City, and the state as a whole, suffered an epidemic of homelessness. Many of the homeless had no shelter; others lived in shabby and dangerous hotels that charged the government exorbitant rates. Cuomo decided to help address the problem by establishing a nonprofit organization called Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, or HELP. The plan was to build transitional housing for the homeless and provide social services to the residents on site. The idea was also to provide a kind of tough love for the residents. In return for housing and assistance, including job training and day care, the residents had to observe a strict code of conduct, which set a 10 P.M. curfew. Cuomo built a successful demonstration project in the East New York section of Brooklyn.","719","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s next project for HELP proved more difficult. He sought to build a development for the homeless in Greenburgh, a town of eighty-five thousand in suburban Westchester County. The locals objected to housing for the poor in their midst, and Andrew found himself in an ugly fight reminiscent of Mario’s struggle in Forest Hills, nearly two decades earlier. He got some idea of what he was up against when he brought two dozen doughnuts to what he thought would be a small community meeting about the project, and seven hundred people showed up. Still, he approached the controversy much as his father had—with long neighborhood consultations, quiet negotiations, and scaled-back ambitions. It took four years, five lawsuits, and ten million dollars, but finally, in 1991, HELP opened its Greenburgh complex. (HELP still exists, with Maria Cuomo Cole as the board chair, and it has established thirty-two residential facilities for the homeless.)","720","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the meantime, Andrew began courting Kerry Kennedy, one of Robert F. Kennedy’s eleven children, who was working in Boston on a foundation dedicated to her father’s memory. In his book, Andrew describes his first visit to the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod. “I was dressed all wrong,” he writes. “These people were wearing cut-off denim shorts, ragged T-shirts, and no shoes. I looked like a designer logo smorgasbord. Not to mention the baggy psychedelic bathing suit and loafers. This was Saturday Night Fever meets Hyannis Port.” Andrew Cuomo and Kerry Kennedy married on June 9, 1990.","721","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After Bill Clinton was elected President, in 1992, his team recruited Andrew, by then a nationally recognized expert on housing, to become an Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. While in Washington, the Cuomos had twin girls and then another daughter. In 1994, when Mario Cuomo ran for a fourth term in New York, Andrew did not return to help him campaign. It was the first time he had not participated in one of his father’s races. Mario was swept out in the Republican landslides of that year by Pataki, an unheralded state senator. Andrew’s career continued to advance. Two years later, when Clinton was reëlected, he named Cuomo to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development. At thirty-nine, Cuomo was the youngest member of any President’s Cabinet since John F. Kennedy made Robert Kennedy the Attorney General, in 1961.","722","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"As the HUD Secretary, Cuomo presented himself as the spokesman for the nation’s poor, travelling around the country to show that, even in a time of prosperity, many people were left behind. He was given to fierce denunciations of those who, in his opinion, used federal dollars to mistreat the vulnerable. In 1997, the department sued A. Bruce Rozet, a HUD landlord, accusing him of taking kickbacks from a management company called Insignia Financial, which ran his buildings. According to a press release from HUD, which was cited in a 2006 Village Voice story, the department’s mission was to provide housing for the needy—“not to provide lives of luxury for con artists stealing from our programs.” Cuomo called the case “the largest ever brought by HUD” and condemned “the abysmal conditions” that he said tenants were forced to endure in projects that had been “poorly maintained” by Insignia.","723","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the period leading up to the 2000 Presidential campaign, Cuomo had grown close to Vice-President Al Gore, and he was mentioned as a possible White House chief of staff in a Gore Administration. But, with George W. Bush’s Inauguration, Cuomo returned to New York. And his life fell apart.","724","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo had not lived in New York State for eight years, but he had a famous father (and famous in-laws), along with an impressive résumé from his federal service, and in 2002 he decided to run for the Democratic nomination for governor. His opponent was Carl McCall, the state treasurer and a veteran of New York politics, who had been waiting his turn for a shot at the top job. McCall was also the highest-ranking African-American official in the state. The rationale for Cuomo’s candidacy, which he declared in a Kenneth Cole showroom, was never clear. Cuomo tried to portray himself as an insurgent outsider, but that was a tough sell from a governor’s son and veteran political operative. On April 17, 2002, Cuomo committed what was regarded as a fatal gaffe. Comparing the incumbent, Pataki, to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the aftermath of 9/11, Cuomo said, “He stood behind the leader. He held the leader’s coat.” This was regarded as an unforgivable politicization of the terrorist attacks. The governor’s race went so badly that Cuomo was compelled to withdraw even before the primary. (In the general campaign, McCall lost handily to Pataki.)","725","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After the election, Cuomo’s marriage disintegrated, in a rancorous battle chronicled in detail by the local tabloids. The divorce was eventually settled, without litigation, but Cuomo found himself an outcast—single, unemployed, and repudiated by the New York political establishment. His salvation began in an unlikely place. He was visiting a real-estate executive in New York, and another prominent businessman happened to be in the office—Andrew Farkas, who had been the chief executive of Insignia Financial, the company that Cuomo denounced in such strong terms as HUD Secretary.","726","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Farkas, an heir to the Alexander’s department-store fortune, who went on to make one of his own, was spoiling for a fight with his former adversary. Farkas’s company had paid more than seven million dollars to settle the charges in the HUD case. (Farkas was never personally charged.) “Our first interaction was somewhat combative,” Farkas told me. “We had a very difficult few hours together, then we went back to our respective corners.” Still, Cuomo got in touch to continue their conversation. “I was intrigued with the fortitude of a man who was walking into the hornet’s nest of dealing with me,” Farkas said. “Folklore and myth and legend are full of stories of people who meet on the field and go from combatants to allies. We became quite enamored of each other. We had a great deal in common—families with strong fathers, and we both had our problems with prior marriages.”","727","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo went to work for a new commercial real-estate venture that Farkas established, and, as the Times has reported, he was paid more than $2.5 million in three years. Also in this period, as Cuomo notes in his memoir, he remained an attentive parent to his daughters, in spite of the divorce—a point of great pride with him. (The twins are now in college, and the younger daughter will go next fall.) Cuomo also began seeing Sandra Lee, a food and life-style entrepreneur. They have lived together in Westchester for years. “We are not married, and everything is fine,” Cuomo told me. Lee has eschewed the role of First Lady, and continued a successful independent career.","728","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"When, in 2006, Pataki decided not to seek a fourth term, Eliot Spitzer, who had enjoyed great success as the state attorney general, had a clear shot at the governorship. Cuomo decided to run for attorney general. The finance chairman of his campaign was Andrew Farkas.","729","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo had learned from his 2002 defeat. Gone were the announcement parties at fashionable New York locales, replaced by humble entreaties to mid-level upstate pols. At the time, David Paterson was Spitzer’s running mate. Paterson told me, “I told him that I thought he should go around and visit some of the people in New York state politics, in a kind of mea-culpa kind of way. That doesn’t come naturally to Andrew, to say the least, but he did do it.” Notably, Cuomo did not seek the advice of his father on campaign matters. Campaign advisers tell of receiving phone calls from Mario Cuomo, who would report that Andrew wasn’t interested in his advice. Andrew, in turn, would ask the staffers what Mario was saying. Cuomo won the primary and the general election with ease.","730","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo and Spitzer, two ambitious New York politicians of the same generation and party, had eyed each other warily for years. Cuomo now had to figure out how to define himself in an office where Spitzer had become known nationally, as the scourge of Wall Street. His approach was different. “As lawyers, we are very interested in process,” a senior member of Cuomo’s staff in the attorney general’s office said. “But Andrew is not very interested in process. He didn’t care that much about how we put cases together and how we planned to litigate. He wanted, instead, to know what were we going to end with, and what’s the best way to get there.” According to Mylan Denerstein, another top aide in both the attorney general’s and the governor’s office, “He is fixated on accomplishments and results. He’d always walk around the office saying he wanted to hear ‘-ed’ words from his staff—‘completed,’ ‘filed,’ ‘accomplished’—not ‘-ing’ words—‘trying,’ ‘working,’ ‘hoping.’ ” In line with these priorities, Cuomo, as attorney general, succeeded more frequently in negotiating settlements in major investigations than in filing long-shot lawsuits. He obtained a major reform of student-loan practices from eight leading lenders and won an agreement for pharmacies to give prescription information in languages besides English. Since attorneys general can pick and choose among issues to pursue, and the public has few expectations for them, the job carries few political risks, and has been a common stepping stone to the governorship.","731","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo found ways to afflict Spitzer. After news broke that Joseph Bruno, then the Republican leader in the Senate, might have used state aircraft for personal purposes, Cuomo launched an investigation. He cleared Bruno of wrongdoing but excoriated Spitzer for using the controversy to gain political advantage over Bruno. And when Spitzer’s reputation imploded, in a prostitution scandal, forcing him to resign after little more than a year, Cuomo was one step closer to the top position. David Paterson, thrust suddenly into the top job, fared little better than Spitzer—again, without much help from Cuomo. Paterson was accused of covering for an aide accused of domestic violence and, in a separate matter, accepting free Yankees tickets. As the state’s chief law-enforcement officer, Cuomo might have offered a lifeline to the newly installed governor, but he let Paterson suffer. Amid chaos in Albany, and a fast-sinking national economy, Paterson decided against running for his own term as governor in 2010. Cuomo ran, and won by a wide margin.","732","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The design of the New York State Capitol, which was completed on the crest of an Albany hillside in 1899, borrows from most of the leading architectural styles of the previous millennia, none entirely successfully. But Andrew Cuomo loves the building in all its Romanesque-Gothic-neoclassical-Victorian glory. He’s been a regular in its corridors since his father became secretary of state, nearly four decades ago. Upon taking the governor’s office, in 2011, Cuomo insisted that a renovation, which had been creeping along for eleven years, be completed within a year. “The place smelled like a New York subway in the seventies,” he told me. “It was intolerable.”","733","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In 1995, George Pataki cut off public access to the corridors of the second floor of the capitol, where he and his staff worked. Cuomo reopened the space to the public and supervised a renovation of what’s known as the Hall of Governors. There are portraits of Cuomo’s predecessors (except Spitzer), cabinets of mementos from their tenures, and, stencilled on the walls, a time line of significant events in New York history. To wander that hallway is to recognize that for much of American history the governorship of New York served as a kind of proto Vice-Presidency, carrying with it the expectation of a run for the White House. Some governors won (Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Roosevelt), some lost (Charles Evans Hughes, Al Smith, Thomas E. Dewey, Nelson Rockefeller), and some went on to other forms of distinguished service (John Jay, Herbert Lehman, Averell Harriman). With a few exceptions, they were consequential men. (They have all been men.)","734","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the cabinet devoted to Mario Cuomo’s twelve years, there are three printed items: a 1988 message from Cuomo to the Legislature announcing the “Decade of the Child”; the first of Cuomo’s twelve vetoes of the reinstitution of the death penalty in New York; and a book of his speeches, which is open to a 1984 address at Notre Dame, in which he described his effort to reconcile his Catholic faith with his support for abortion rights. These are honorable achievements, but modest in scope. Mario was somewhat defensive about a legacy defined more by talk than by action; he called his book of speeches, with some exaggeration, “More Than Words.” Through the sleepy Pataki years, and the brief, chaotic reigns of Spitzer and Paterson, there are few landmarks noted in the Hall of Governors. There is already one for Andrew Cuomo, however: “2011: New York grants marriage equality for all citizens.”","735","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After the same-sex-marriage victory, Cuomo became a hero in the gay community, and he was invited to be honored at the annual dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, in Washington. His only obligation would have been an eight-minute speech, and the event presented a priceless opportunity for a politician with national ambitions to meet with some of the most important Democratic fund-raisers in the country. Cuomo declined.","736","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"“Maybe I’ve overdone it, but that Presidential phenomenon got my father into a lot of trouble,” Cuomo told me. (Mario Cuomo vacillated about running for President, especially in the 1992 cycle.) “There’s only one good way to deal with it: ‘I’m running for President, I’m telling you now, before you ask, that I’m running. Goodbye.’ ” He went on, “The protracted expectation, the flirtation, is very harmful, because fundamentally what I have is my relationship with the people in the state. And they’re suspicious of my ego and my ambition. And as soon as you put in their head, ‘Maybe he wants to be President and that’s why he’s doing this, to be President,’ I believe your whole relationship changes.” Speaking of the press, he said, “I have bent over backward not to give them anything, because that’s what they want to write.”","737","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The question of Cuomo’s ambition for the White House is largely moot for 2016, because Hillary Clinton, also a New Yorker (of sorts), is the presumed Democratic nominee. Cuomo has not officially taken himself out of the running, and he is stepping up his international travel, including a forthcoming trip to Cuba, but there is no Cuomo campaign operation, and there probably will not be one during this cycle. (A new biography of Cuomo, by Michael Shnayerson, will be published in March; the book is premised on a possible race for the White House.) Still, even among Cuomo’s friends and advisers there seems to be little enthusiasm for a Presidential run. The Governor’s reclusive public profile, many agree, makes him ill-suited to running for national office. “Andrew will not run for President,” a former aide told me. “He’d have to talk to too many people.”","738","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Silver’s arrest has already scrambled Cuomo’s plans for his second term. Political corruption in Albany has proved to be varied, as well as enduring; in recent years, legislators have been accused of taking bribes and kickbacks, and engaging in sexual harassment and assault, as well as, like Silver, exploiting their office in connection with outside earnings. Cuomo gave a speech last week promising (again) to tighten rules on legislators’ outside activities, but the culture of the capitol is notoriously resistant to change. Otherwise, Cuomo plans a strong push to remove failing public-school teachers, a move that is opposed by unions (and their allies in the Working Families Party). Cuomo will look for opportunities where he can find them. “I don’t operate in a vacuum,” he told me. “I deal one year at a time, in reaction to the times.”","739","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s transactional approach extends not only to issues but also to individuals; he tends to have nonaggression pacts rather than alliances. As HUD Secretary, Cuomo hired Bill de Blasio to be his New York representative, and, now that de Blasio is the mayor of New York City, the Governor appears determined to remind him of his continuing junior status. When the two men differed over charter schools (Cuomo is an enthusiastic backer, de Blasio is more skeptical), the Governor supported a multi-million-dollar television campaign against the Mayor’s position. Cuomo and Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, jointly control the Port Authority, which operates the bridges, tunnels, and airports of the New York metropolitan area. Cuomo refrained from attacking Christie during the scandal involving the closure of an approach to the George Washington Bridge; Christie, although he was chair of the Republican Governors’ Association, did not campaign for Cuomo’s opponent or offer him financial support. As part of a deal to obtain the endorsement of the Working Families Party last year, Cuomo promised to campaign for Democrats to take control of the Senate; he did almost nothing to that end. “It’s clear that Cuomo doesn’t really want a Democratic Senate,” Zephyr Teachout, his primary opponent, said. “He’d rather be the power broker between the two houses rather than see actual progressive legislation passed.”","740","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In light of his father’s illness, Cuomo’s celebration of his reëlection was muted, his attention sometimes distracted. One day in December, at a gaggle outside his office in the capitol, a reporter asked him a question about raising tolls on the Thruway. Cuomo dodged, saying that some people thought the rates should rise, and some people thought otherwise. A reporter in the back of the scrum yelled out, “But what does Governor Cuomo think?”","741","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"

"As Mario Cuomo’s life slipped away in the final days of 2014, his elder son was a frequent presence by his side. “He’d sleep for, like, twenty minutes and he’d be up, and this was the constant cycle,” Andrew told me. “So it actually worked, because I could go at five in the morning or I could go at two in the morning, but I was going every morning and every night.” Andrew wanted his father to be healthy enough to hold the Bible at his swearing-in, on New Year’s Day. “I said to him, ‘You have to exercise your upper body, because you have to hold the Bible. You have to hold the Bible.’ ” As father and son talked, Mario had a question: Which version of the Bible?","743","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Mario Cuomo was the rare politician who might actually have an informed preference on Biblical liturgy. “We used to argue about the versions of the Bible,” Andrew said. “We spent a lot of time separating the findings of the management of the Church from Jesus’ teachings. So what Bible we’re talking about was important, because some Bibles are more interpretive, some are purer. He wanted the more verbatim, from Jesus. Because that was his whole point—that he had issues with the management of the Church, but he had no issue with the owner of the franchise.” They settled on the King James.","744","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Andrew planned two inauguration ceremonies on New Year’s Day—the one at the World Trade Center, and the other in Buffalo. As the day drew near, Mario confessed that he was too weak to hold the Bible. Andrew recalled, “New Year’s morning—I’m on the way to the inauguration, and I stop by, I thought I’d take one more chance—I said, ‘Come on.’ I said, ‘Let’s go. You don’t have to hold the Bible, but why don’t you come?’ And he said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘I told you I can’t go. But I’ll be right here.’ ” So Andrew made him an offer. If Mario felt up to it, Andrew would take him along to Buffalo: “And he loved Buffalo, my father. Buffalo was probably the worst-off part of the state for a lot of years. And the Buffalo Bills were always an underdog, so he was very drawn to Buffalo, as am I.” Mario watched the World Trade Center speech on television, with Andrew’s sisters, but he didn’t say anything about going to Buffalo, so Andrew went on without him.","745","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After Andrew gave the second version of his inaugural address, in Buffalo, in the late afternoon, he stepped down to greet guests at the ceremony. “It’s a small room, you came off the stage, I had just gotten sworn in, I had to shake hands,” Andrew recalled. A state trooper approached him and said, “You have to go home right away.” When Andrew asked why, someone said, “Your father died.” Mario Cuomo was eighty-two.♦","746","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"

"The great Supreme Court cases turn on the majestic ambiguities embedded in the Constitution. It is not a simple thing to define and apply terms like “the freedom of speech,” or “equal protection of the laws,” much less explain how much process is “due.” Still, the Justices, in their best moments, have explicated these terms in ways that ennobled the lives of millions. This week, the Court will hear arguments in a momentous case, King v. Burwell, a challenge to a central feature of the Affordable Care Act. But, in contrast to other landmarks in Supreme Court history, the King case is notable mostly for the cynicism at its heart. Instead of grandeur, there is a smallness about this lawsuit in every way except in the stakes riding on its outcome.","751","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/hard-cases-jeffrey-toobin"
"Shortly after the A.C.A. passed, in 2010, a group of conservative lawyers met at a conference in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute, and scoured the nine-hundred-page text of the law, looking for grist for possible lawsuits. Michael Greve, a board member of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian outfit funded by, among others, the Koch brothers, said, of the law, “This bastard has to be killed as a matter of political hygiene. I do not care how this is done, whether it’s dismembered, whether we drive a stake through its heart, whether we tar and feather it and drive it out of town, whether we strangle it.” In time, lawyers hired by the C.E.I. discovered four words buried in Section 36B, which refers to the exchanges—now known as marketplaces—where people can buy health-insurance policies. The A.C.A. created federal tax subsidies for those earning less than a certain income to help pay for their premiums and other expenses, and, in describing who is eligible, Section 36B refers to exchanges “established by the State.” However, thirty-four states, most of them under Republican control, refused to create exchanges; for residents of such states, the law had established a federal exchange. But, according to the conjurings of the C.E.I. attorneys, the subsidies should be granted only to people who bought policies on the state exchanges, because of those four words in Section 36B. The lawyers recruited plaintiffs and filed a lawsuit; their goal is to revoke the subsidies provided to the roughly seven and a half million people who were left no choice by the states where they live but to buy on the federal exchange.","752","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/hard-cases-jeffrey-toobin"
"The claim borders on the frivolous. The plaintiffs can’t assert that the A.C.A. violates the Constitution, because the Justices narrowly upheld the validity of the law in 2012. Rather, the suit claims that the Obama Administration is violating the terms of its own law. But the A.C.A. never even suggests that customers on the federal exchange are ineligible for subsidies. In fact, there’s a provision that says that, if a state refuses to open an exchange, the federal government will “establish and operate such Exchange within the State.” The congressional debate over the A.C.A. included fifty-three meetings of the Senate Finance Committee and seven days of committee debates on amendments. The full Senate spent twenty-five consecutive days on it, the second-longest session ever on a single piece of legislation. There were similar marathons in the House. Yet no member of Congress ever suggested that the subsidies were available only on the state exchanges. This lawsuit is not an attempt to enforce the terms of the law; it’s an attempt to use what is at most a semantic infelicity to kill the law altogether.","753","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/hard-cases-jeffrey-toobin"
"During Obama’s remaining time in office, more challenges to his legacy, like the King case, will work their way through the courts. Even before Republicans took full control of Congress earlier this year, the legislative process had basically come to a halt; now, if the G.O.P. manages to pass laws in both houses, they will likely be met by Presidential vetoes. So Obama’s adversaries have taken their agenda to federal judges, who are nearly as politically polarized as the legislators in Congress. Last month, Republican officeholders in twenty-six states chose to bring a challenge to the President’s immigration plan before Judge Andrew S. Hanen, an outspoken conservative in Brownsville, Texas. On procedural rather than constitutional grounds, Hanen ordered a nationwide hold on the plan, which is a crucial element of the President’s program for his second term.","754","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/hard-cases-jeffrey-toobin"
"In a human sense as much as in a legal one, the stakes in King v. Burwell dwarf those of the immigration lawsuit and, indeed, most cases in the history of the Supreme Court. If the Justices rule for the plaintiffs, the seven and a half million people on the federal exchange who receive tax subsidies will lose them immediately, which means that most of them will also lose their insurance, because they can no longer afford it. Insurance companies will then likely raise rates for the remaining policyholders, many of whom would drop their coverage, leading to even higher rates, and so on; this sequence is known as the A.C.A. death spiral. A remarkable coalition of state officials, insurance companies, hospitals, physicians, and nurses—many among them less than friendly to the Obama Administration—have filed briefs in the case warning of the consequences if the subsidies are withdrawn. A brief written by the deans of nineteen leading schools of public health states with bracing directness that, if the plaintiffs win this case, nearly ten thousand Americans will die unnecessary deaths each year.","755","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/hard-cases-jeffrey-toobin"
"In a more civilized era—even the nineteen-nineties—Congress routinely passed technical fixes to major laws, in order to remove minor ambiguities, like the one that is arguably present in the A.C.A. For example, in 1999, with little controversy or notice, Congress made small changes in the Children’s Health Insurance Program, two years after its original passage. But that largeness of spirit has vanished from Congress, so it falls once again to the Supreme Court to determine the future of the A.C.A. The Justices all have well-developed views about the Constitution, and strong preferences about how our understanding of it should evolve. But their decision in the mean-spirited lawsuit that is King v. Burwell will reflect little on the interpretive schools to which they belong. The Court will have many more chances to define the Constitution for the ages. In this case, though, the Justices’ choice is a simple one: life or death. ♦","756","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/hard-cases-jeffrey-toobin"
"With all the coverage of Hillary Clinton’s e-mails, another bit of political news has been largely overlooked. At a press conference in Baltimore on Tuesday, Martin O’Malley, the former Democratic governor of Maryland, said that he won’t seek the U.S. Senate seat that Barbara Mikulski, Maryland’s five-term Democratic senator, has announced she will vacate in 2016. Rather than entering a Senate race in which he would immediately be the favorite, O’Malley appears set to go all-in and challenge Clinton for the Democratic Presidential nomination.","March 4, 2015","757","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"

"If O’Malley does formally enter the race, he’ll be a heavy underdog, of course. Still, he’ll find some encouragement from Clinton’s ongoing troubles. On Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that she maintained her own home-brew server for the private e-mail address that she has been revealed to have used for work correspondence as Secretary of State, rather than relying on an outside service, such as Google or Yahoo. “Operating her own server would have afforded Clinton additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal, administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails,” the A.P. story said.","759","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"Yesterday, I expressed some skepticism about whether the e-mail flap would amount to much over the long term, and about whether the Republicans would be able to use it against Clinton once the campaign proper starts. In seeking to keep her State Department e-mails from prying eyes, she clearly skirted the rules. But it appears that she didn’t break the federal recordkeeping laws in place at the time, and everyone knows that she has good reason to be paranoid: on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, many people are out to get her, Republican attack dogs prominent among them.","760","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"The danger to Clinton is cumulative and close to home. In the past few weeks, many Democrats, particularly those on the progressive wing of the party, have been reminded of their reservations about a Clinton restoration. To begin with, there was the spectacle of Hillary, fresh from the State Department, traipsing around the country making highly paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, the Carlyle Group and other redoubts of the one per cent. Last week came the revelation that foreign governments were making financial contributions to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was still serving as Secretary of State. And now there’s her e-mail system, which appears to have been explicitly designed to frustrate legitimate requests for documents from the media and from Congress. It all adds to the impression that the Clintons operate by their own set of rules.","761","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"So far, other potential Democratic challengers, who include Vice President Joe Biden and Jim Webb, the former senator from Virginia, have shied away from criticizing Hillary directly, but this may be about to change. During O’Malley’s recent trip to South Carolina, the Associated Press reported, he “took a veiled shot at Clinton, warning Democrats that more ‘triangulation’ would not be a successful strategy for the party.”","762","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"The reference, to Dick Morris’s term describing Bill Clinton’s strategy for transcending ideological polarities, hardly constituted a venomous attack. O’Malley, who began his career in politics by working for Gary Hart’s 1984 Presidential campaign, is a thoughtful and deliberate politician, rather than a showman or a brawler. His standing in Democratic politics is currently diminished, however, by the results of last November’s gubernatorial election, in which O’Malley’s chosen successor, his lieutenant governor, Anthony Brown, suffered an upset defeat to the Republican candidate, Larry Hogan.","763","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"O’Malley had a strong record as governor, promoting the use of information technology, seeing liberal measures on immigration and gay marriage into law, and repealing the death penalty for future offenders. In recent months, he has been reaching out to progressives in the early primary states, and echoing many of the themes that made Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren popular, such as calling for the break-up of big banks. ”People want to see new faces,” Dan Calegari, a Democratic activist in New Hampshire, told the A.P. “There’s a certain amount of Clinton fatigue. They’ve been around for thirty years now. Quite honestly, I think if Martin decides to get in the race, he will surprise some people.”","764","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"To repeat, O’Malley would be a long shot. British bookmakers currently have the odds that he will win the nomination set at around twenty-five-to-one. Warren, despite her protestations that she won’t run, is at seven-to-one. Biden is at sixteen-to-one. Clinton remains the favorite, of course, but the betting markets suggest that the race isn’t entirely sewn up. At most of the bookmakers, the odds on her emerging as the Democratic candidate are one-to-three, which means that you would have to put down three dollars to win one dollar. These numbers imply that there’s a seventy-five-per-cent probability that Clinton will get the nomination. Until now, most political operatives and pundits, myself included, have been tacitly assuming that the chances that Hillary won’t be the Democratic candidate were lower than one in four. It may be time for a reassessment.","765","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"

This was the period when the Fed turned its monetary spigots all the way on, launching a bond-buying program that came to be known as “quantitative easing.” Many members of the committee, including Ben Bernanke, its chairman, and Janet Yellen, who was then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, had reservations about quantitative easing’s efficacy and long-term implications. But with the U.S. unemployment rate reaching ten per cent in October, 2009, they were rightly convinced that the economy needed another boost. And since the Fed had already reduced its target interest rate—the federal funds rate—almost to zero per cent, injecting hundreds of billions of newly created dollars into the financial system via bond purchases was about the only option available.","770","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-fed-needs-defending"

It was widely known that Bush had been “actively exploring” the possibility of a campaign at least since the spring, when he started showing up at the gym in the grand Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, where he keeps his office, with a personal trainer and new workout gear. But there had been as yet no signs of a commitment. “It’s the telegraph people have been waiting for,” Jim Nicholson, a former Republican National Committee chairman and Cabinet secretary under President George W. Bush, said.","781","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The announcement inevitably renewed questions about the desirability of political dynasties and about whether Jeb was being propelled to run, in part, by fraternal rivalry. “There’s always been a friendly competition among the siblings in the family, and that’s just human nature, I suppose,” George P. Bush, Jeb’s older son, told me. As Jeb, who was the governor of Florida for two terms, has followed his brother’s career, he has also stood apart from it. “There is kind of George W.’s world, and then there’s Jeb’s world, and frankly there’s not a lot of intersection,” Mark McKinnon, who was a senior adviser to George W.’s Presidential campaigns, said. Jeb is more introverted and more ideological than both his father, George H. W. Bush, whose politics are driven more by personal associations than by doctrine, and his brother, whose conservatism is more instinctual than considered. It was Jeb who signed the nation’s first “Stand Your Ground” self-defense law, and fought to keep Terri Schiavo on life support.","782","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Now, though, as a result of the rightward shift in the Republican Party, Bush is being viewed as a moderate in the emerging Presidential field. He has strong support among the Party’s establishment and donor class, but his popularity among the current conservative rank and file is difficult to gauge. Since he left office, Bush has maintained a national profile through his work on the issue with which, as governor, he had sought to make his biggest mark: education reform. But, after leading the way in pushing a conservative vision for America’s schools, Bush is now caught in the midst of an unexpected upheaval on the issue within his own party.","783","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"His level of enthusiasm for running has also been difficult to assess. He has often cited worries about the effect that a campaign would have on his family, especially on his wife, Columba, who dislikes the role of political spouse. George P. Bush told me that it would be hard for his father to relinquish the life in business that he has led since leaving office, in 2007. “People forget that before he went into public service he was in real estate and has always had a business mind,” his son said.","784","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The family that, over three generations, has served in the White House (twice), the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the governors’ mansions of two states is also a family of businessmen. Prescott Bush was a partner at the investment bank Brown Brothers Harriman, but, even as he thrived on Wall Street, with a house in Greenwich, Connecticut, and three live-in maids, he declined to run for a vacant House seat in 1946, because he didn’t think he could afford it. He was finally elected to the Senate in 1952, at the age of fifty-seven. His son George H. W. Bush didn’t enter politics until he had become a millionaire in the Texas oil industry; he was elected to Congress in 1966, when he was forty-two. Doug Wead, who served as an adviser to both Presidents Bush, told me, “I don’t think it’s about money for money’s sake. It’s a way of defining who I am and where I sit in the history of the family: ‘Can I do it? Can I be a real man?’ Just imagine the pressure. The first step in life in the Bush family is: Can I make a million?”","785","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"After college, Jeb worked for the Texas Commerce Bank in Venezuela before returning to join his siblings—George; their younger brothers, Neil and Marvin; and their sister, Dorothy—on their father’s 1980 Presidential campaign. Jeb campaigned mostly in Florida; having learned enough Spanish to court his wife, whom he met on a high-school exchange trip to Mexico, he had become fluent while in Caracas, an asset in Miami’s Little Havana. After George H. W. Bush lost to Ronald Reagan in the primaries, Jeb and Columba settled in Miami to raise their three children—George P., Noelle, and Jeb, Jr.","786","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Armando Codina, a Cuban-American real-estate developer who had supported George H. W. Bush’s campaign, offered Jeb a forty-per-cent stake, with no money down, in his company, Codina Partners. Bush’s role was to find tenants for commercial developments, and he easily won over colleagues and clients with his unassuming manner. A few separate deals he was involved in came under scrutiny, including one with a company that sold water pumps in Nigeria, but Bush was never accused of any wrongdoing. He considered running for Congress, but, according to Peter and Rochelle Schweizer’s biography “The Bushes,” his father persuaded him to wait until he had made more money. He served as the chairman of the Dade County G.O.P. and, in 1987, became the state commerce secretary under Governor Bob Martinez but left the post less than two years later to work on his father’s successful Presidential campaign. Around that time, he decided to run for governor, and, in 1992, with his father’s reëlection in doubt, he began to focus on a gubernatorial campaign for the 1994 election. (By then, he had a net worth of more than two million dollars.) In Texas, his brother did the same, which the family viewed as an intrusion on Jeb’s more serious effort. After Bush senior left the White House, he spent far more time campaigning in Florida than in Texas.","787","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Unlike George, Jeb embraced the ascendant right-wing orthodoxy: he declared himself a “head-banging conservative”; vowed to “club this government into submission”; and warned that “we are transforming our society to a collectivist policy.” On Election Night, he lost narrowly to the incumbent, Lawton Chiles. George Bush, having shown himself to be an unexpectedly able candidate, with a more modulated tone than his brother, beat the incumbent Texas governor, Ann Richards, by more than eight points.","788","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"After the loss, Jeb returned to business, working primarily with Codina Partners again. It wasn’t clear if he would continue to pursue a political career. Tom Slade, a former chairman of the Florida G.O.P. (who died in October), told me that Bush had said, “I don’t know if I’m going to run for governor again or not, because I’d rather go settle some stuff with my wife.” Campaigning had been a strain on the family, but, Slade added, “I remember having heard Columba say, ‘Jebby really loves politics,’ and kind of sigh.”","789","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"It became apparent to Bush that he had emphasized a conservative agenda at the expense of an organizing mission in his campaign. He had focussed mainly on crime and welfare reform, and, if he were to run again, he would need “to be sure his platform was palatable to a larger community,” as T. Willard Fair, the head of the Miami affiliate of the Urban League, put it. In 1995, Bush found that platform. Early that year, he called Fair and said that he wanted to contribute some money left over from his campaign to the Urban League. Fair thought that Bush would present a check, pose for a picture, and leave. But the two men spent ninety minutes discussing the failure of the Dade County schools to educate black students, who were twenty-four per cent more likely than white students to drop out. Fair, a garrulous man with a conservative bent, told me, “Jeb said, ‘Why don’t you start a charter school?’ I said, ‘What’s a charter school?’ ”","790","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"That year, Bush found a compatible source for ideas on education when he joined the board of the Heritage Foundation, which was generating papers and proposals to break up what it viewed as the government-run monopoly of the public-school system through free-market competition, with charters and private-school vouchers. Bush found school choice philosophically appealing. “Competition means everybody gets better,” he said.","791","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"He enlisted Fair to help promote a state law authorizing charter schools, which, unlike vouchers, were gaining some Democratic supporters, including President Bill Clinton, who saw them as a way to allow educators to innovate within the public-school system. The law passed in 1996, with bipartisan support, and that year Bush and Fair founded the first charter school in the state—an elementary school in an impoverished, largely African-American section of Miami, called the Liberty City Charter School. Bush brought his mother in for classroom visits and dropped by unannounced to make sure that things were running smoothly. If he found wastepaper lying around, he’d leave it on the desk of the principal, Katrina Wilson-Davis. The message was clear, she recalls: “Just because kids are poor and at risk doesn’t mean that their environment shouldn’t be clean and orderly.”","792","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Bush decided to make a second run for governor, in 1998. He chose Frank Brogan, Florida’s education commissioner, as his running mate, and railed against the state’s graduation rate, which was about fifty per cent, and fourth-grade reading scores that were nearly the worst in the country. He unveiled the A+ Plan, which relied heavily on Heritage Foundation proposals for holding schools more accountable; it imposed a strict A-F grading system at all levels, based on students’ scores on the state’s assessment test, the FCAT, and provided additional funding to schools with good grades and stipulated that students at schools with poor grades would receive taxpayer-funded vouchers to attend private and parochial schools. This time, Bush won easily. He faced a weaker opponent than he had in 1994, but his new agenda seemed to help: he doubled his share of the black vote.","793","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Brogan, a former fifth-grade teacher and middle-school principal, was nominally in charge of the education portfolio. But Bush’s most influential adviser was Patricia Levesque, a former legislative aide to the state House Republican leadership and a graduate of Bob Jones University, the fundamentalist Christian school in South Carolina. (She greeted a new hire in Bush’s administration by asking him if he had “found a church home” yet in Tallahassee.) Brogan had drafted the A+ Plan into a bill, but Bush called for revisions to give its accountability measures a harder edge. Within months, the Republican-led legislature had passed it, providing Florida with one of the highest-stakes testing regimens in the country, and the first statewide voucher program.","794","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Some friends and associates saw personal motivations behind Bush’s initiatives. Patrick Riccards, who, as counsel for the federal government’s National Reading Panel, discussed education reform with Bush, said, “As the father of Hispanic kids, you become far more sensitive to disparities—kids who look like your kids not getting the skills they need or getting into the right colleges.” (Bush’s children attended private schools in Miami and Jacksonville.) Others detected a competitive desire to surpass his brother’s agenda in Texas. Governors around the country were taking up education reform, but the Bushes were prominent in the field. George W. Bush had initiated his program four years earlier, but it essentially built on Ann Richards’s measures to help struggling schools, such as insuring that they got adequate funding, and it had bipartisan support. It was also far less aggressive—it emphasized testing, but included fewer penalties for failing schools and steered clear of vouchers. Sandy Kress, who was a senior education adviser to George W. Bush in the White House, said that he “really thought this is mainly about improving public schools.”","795","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Jeb’s program, by contrast, was of a piece with his larger agenda to privatize state-run services, from prisons to Medicaid. He also recognized the long-term political benefits of upending the system. According to Jim Warford, a county school superintendent in North Florida, whom Bush selected to be his K-12 schools chancellor in 2003, “He saw the teachers’ unions as one of the foundations of the Democratic Party, and he saw a great advantage—that anything he could do to undercut the teachers’ union would have a political return.”","796","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Advisers to both brothers saw little evidence that they discussed the issue. “They operated through their staffs,” Warford said. “If anything, a more accurate comparison would be two N.F.L. coaches trying to steal each other’s playbooks and game plans.” But if Jeb was envious when George was elected President, in 2000, he did not express it. “If he has any of that feeling, he doesn’t show it,” Lucy Morgan, who covered him for the St. Petersburg Times and knows him socially, said. Instead, he further immersed himself in education research, and brought in national experts, such as Reid Lyon, a brain-development researcher at the National Institutes of Health, for private briefings. Even his opponents concede that he was very well informed. Dan Gelber, a Democrat who served in the Florida legislature, recalls an e-mail debate with Bush about the rating system for test scores. “We ended up having this very esoteric exchange, and I remember thinking, He either has a roomful of experts writing these e-mails or he really knows something.”","797","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"During his first term, Bush’s agenda suffered some setbacks. Voters approved a referendum capping class size at twenty-five students in high school and required smaller classes in lower grades. Courts ruled his main voucher program unconstitutional, because it sent taxpayer money to religious schools. In response, he adopted a funding model in which corporations donated to the program in return for tax credits. Still, after a term that also featured a big tax cut for wealthy Floridians, he was easily reëlected, in 2002.","798","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"By then, President Bush was implementing his signature legislation, the No Child Left Behind Act, which required schools to meet gradually higher scores on annual tests, set by the states, in order to receive additional federal funding. Jeb Bush made it known that he thought his own approach superior, because it sought to grade schools on improvements in individual students’ scores, rather than just on schools’ performance in a given year. “There were lots of conversations about the work in Texas and how Florida had improved on that,” Warford said. According to education officials, Jeb’s team had little respect for Rod Paige, the former Houston schools superintendent whom George W. Bush had named Secretary of Education. “It was a little prickly in Florida,” Sandy Kress, who worked on the implementation of No Child Left Behind, said. “It was ‘We’re going to do it our way and can do it better.’ ”","799","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Florida’s population grew by 2.5 million during Bush’s eight years as governor—almost the equivalent of adding another Miami, Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando, and St. Petersburg. Suburbs colonized the former swamplands beyond the Miami airport, the orange and palmetto groves east of Tampa, and the farmland near Fort Myers. The growth, which created jobs in construction and real estate, was fuelled, notoriously, by lax mortgage-lending practices. But it was also fuelled by charter schools.","800","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Developers of new subdivisions teamed up with companies that were opening up charter schools less as a means to innovate than as a way to benefit from Florida’s boom. The “McCharters,” as they became known, were paid for with public money—not just their daily operations but often their buildings, too, since Florida was one of a few states that allowed taxpayer revenue to be used for the construction of charters. But, as charters, the schools were free of public oversight and collective-bargaining agreements. In Osceola County, outside Orlando, a charter school was built next to a traditional public school to absorb students from an expanding subdivision—a “win-win-win for everybody,” Bush said at the ribbon-cutting ceremony.","801","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Under the 1996 law, only nonprofit groups could apply to open a charter school. To get around that, for-profit charter companies set up foundations to file the application and then hire those companies to operate the schools. The St. Petersburg Times reported that by 2002 for-profit companies were managing three-quarters of the state’s newly approved charter schools. According to the newspaper, the companies typically took at least a twelve-per-cent cut of a school’s budget—about two hundred thousand dollars a year for an elementary school and double that for a middle school or a high school. At the same time, the charters were spending about two thousand dollars less per student than traditional public schools (which received relatively low funding, by national standards), a practice that often resulted in inexperienced teachers and spartan facilities. Still, many parents were attracted by the schools’ selective aura, smaller class size, and strict behavior codes. The principal of Ryder Elementary, which served families employed at the Miami headquarters of the Ryder trucking company, explained, “We really operate like a private school.”","802","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"This struck some people as being far from the spirit of charter reform. “Should we be paying money for real-estate companies posing as charter schools?” Sherman Dorn, an education-policy expert who taught at the University of South Florida, said to me. Teachers’ unions and some Democratic legislators spoke out against the for-profit schools. But, in 2002, Bush signed a law allowing charter operators who were denied approval by local school boards to appeal to the state. In 2003, he signed a law to eliminate the state’s cap on the number of charters, which had been set at twenty-eight in the largest counties. Republican lawmakers fought to increase the amount of taxpayer money available for charter construction, and to let developers build schools using the subdivision homeowner fees that they used for pools and other amenities.","803","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Bush, like other proponents of education reform, wanted parents to have the freedom to choose from various schools. “Florida has the largest, most vibrant charter-school movement in the country,” he said at the opening of a for-profit charter high school in Fort Myers. He had no personal financial stake in the school boom, a point that his spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, emphasizes. “Governor Bush does not personally profit in any way from his education-reform advocacy work,” she said. (Bush declined to be interviewed for this article.) But some of his political allies in the state did. In 1997, Jonathan Hage, a former Heritage Foundation staffer who had helped Bush set up the Liberty City Charter School, started Charter Schools USA. Hage told the St. Petersburg Times that he had simply identified a “classic business opportunity.” Charter Schools USA, whose headquarters occupy a building across from a Jaguar dealership in the Fort Lauderdale suburbs, now manages seventy schools in seven states and has nearly three hundred million dollars in revenue.","804","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In 2004, Robert Cambo, a former Codina Partners employee who had started his own building firm, worked with Hage’s company to develop two schools. Al Cardenas, who became the chairman of the Florida Republican Party in 1999, went on to be a lobbyist for Charter Schools USA and the Florida Consortium of Charter Schools. (Until recently, he was the chairman of the American Conservative Union.) Octavio Visiedo, a Bush family friend, was the superintendent of the Dade County school system. He retired in 1996 and started a company that evolved into Imagine Schools, which now has thirty-four thousand students nationwide. Cardenas, who advised Visiedo as he set up the company, told me that the Governor’s support for the growing industry was pivotal: “Bush was helping me get the movement going.” When asked about the money to be made in for-profit charters, Cardenas said, “I don’t care about how much money someone makes. I care about how they’re educating kids. It’s kind of socialistic to decry an organization for making money. What people should be concerned about is what’s the quality of it.”","805","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The quality was difficult to assess. By 2006, Jeb’s last year in office, there were more than three hundred charter schools (for-profit and nonprofit) in Florida, with more than a hundred thousand students, most of them in big metropolitan areas such as Miami and Tampa. But the state made only sporadic efforts to track their performance. The 1996 law called for annual statewide reports on the schools, but none were produced until November of 2006. Test scores in lower grades were found to be slightly higher than at traditional public schools, and slightly lower in the higher grades. The reading test-score gap between black students and white students in elementary grades decreased at about the same rate as in traditional schools, but in the charter high schools the gap widened. However, direct comparisons were difficult, because the charters took about twenty per cent fewer low-income and special-needs students. It was even harder to track the impact of vouchers, because the private and parochial schools that accepted them were not required to administer state tests.","806","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"As Bush saw it, some schools and companies were inferior, but that situation would sort itself out over time. Kristy Campbell told me, “Expanding school choice was a priority for his administration.” However, she added, just as with traditional public schools, Bush “believes charter schools should be closed if students aren’t learning.” Frank Brogan, Bush’s lieutenant governor, told me, “The Governor is a free-market guy.” But Andy Ford, the president of the Florida Education Association, the teachers’ union that was trying to halt the spread of for-profit charters, believes that although Bush “does genuinely care about trying to make kids’ lives better,” his approach created “a closed circuit of people making a lot of money on so-called ‘reform.’ ”","807","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"By the end of Bush’s second term, fourth-grade reading scores in the state had improved sharply, though eighth- and tenth-grade scores were more middling. (Since Bush left office, gains in test scores at all levels have been relatively incremental; graduation rates have steadily increased, but they remain among the nation’s worst.) Nevertheless, Bush saw his education record as his central accomplishment. “The fact is that more kids are learning now and we’re not dumbing down the curriculum,” he said.","808","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"When Bush left office, in 2007, he and Columba returned to Miami. He signed on with a commercial-real-estate brokerage, started a management-consulting firm—Jeb Bush & Associates, with Jeb, Jr.—and joined at least four corporate boards. Again, one of the ventures he was associated with—InnoVida, a startup maker of inexpensive building materials—ran into legal difficulties, but again he was not implicated. He also became a paid adviser to Lehman Brothers, just before the financial crisis, and gave the kinds of remunerative speech that former governors tend to give.","809","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Bush continued to stay active in education policy. In 2008, he launched the Foundation for Excellence in Education, a nonprofit that promoted his reforms and urged other states to adopt similar practices. The organization, led by Patricia Levesque, holds an annual two-day, expenses-paid summit for school administrators and elected state officials. The foundation also organized a half-dozen state education commissioners—called “chiefs for change”—to promote Bush’s agenda at conferences around the country.","810","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"By this time, school reform had become a bipartisan national movement. No Child Left Behind had made its mark across the country, as local leaders, such as the mayors Michael Bloomberg, in New York, and Cory Booker, in Newark, championed their roles in raising scores, and many Democratic leaders, including the newly elected President, Barack Obama, and his Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, accepted the necessity of testing-based accountability. (The Administration’s Race to the Top initiative rewarded states that engaged in aggressive reform.) Meanwhile, as teachers and administrators struggled to meet the law’s demands, the education industry responded. For more than a century, private companies had sold textbooks and other educational supplies to public schools, but now, particularly with the advent of the Internet, the marketplace exploded. The range of new offerings included the state tests. In Florida alone, the British publishing conglomerate Pearson was paid two hundred and fifty million dollars over four years, to administer the FCAT. Then there were test-prep products, mostly digital, that promised to improve scores by helping teachers track students’ progress. (Neil Bush had entered the field, with Ignite, an education-software firm geared toward middle-school social studies, science, and math, which he started in 1999.)","811","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In 2010, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. launched an education-technology division, called Amplify. It was led by Joel Klein, who had been the New York City schools chancellor under Bloomberg. Murdoch said, “When it comes to K through 12 education, we see a five-hundred-billion-dollar sector in the U.S. alone that is waiting desperately to be transformed.” Amplify’s products include digital tablets loaded with instructional programs and games (in one, Tom Sawyer battles the Brontë sisters), for use in K-12 classes.

"Companies soon came to see the Foundation for Excellence in Education as an ideal platform to promote a range of ideas and products to state officials. Murdoch gave the keynote address at the 2011 summit. In 2012, the foundation earned revenues of ten million dollars, much of it donations from education companies.

"Sometimes, according to e-mails obtained by the watchdog organization In the Public Interest, Levesque pitched the state commissioners on behalf of the companies. In July, 2011, she encouraged Chris Cerf, the New Jersey commissioner, to accept an offer from Dell of a demo “teacher dashboard,” a digital classroom-management system. (“Public education is a public enterprise,” Cerf told me. “But it’s also true that, like all public entities, it also relies on collaborations.”) In 2012, Levesque e-mailed Tony Bennett, the Indiana commissioner, urging him to consider an overture from Reasoning Mind, which sells a math software program for grades two through six. She told Bennett that Jeb Bush “would really appreciate you and your staff taking time to meet with” the company’s president “when you get a chance to review his curriculum.”","814","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In 2010, Bush had used the foundation to launch an initiative called Digital Learning Now, which promoted the benefits of “virtual schools,” providing online instruction. Virtual schools had once been a fringe market for families that homeschooled their children. But, as more school districts faced budget cuts and overcrowded classrooms, some required students to take classes online—in all grades, but mostly in high school—and the industry surged. The quality of instruction is uneven. Classes are typically two or three times larger than in traditional schools, and teachers, who work from home, earn much less. In 2012, the National Education Policy Center studied one of the largest virtual-school companies, K12, and found that its students lagged in math and reading proficiency and had lower graduation rates than those in traditional schools. In a statement at the time, K12 disputed the N.E.P.C.’s methodology.","815","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Yet Bush, a longtime technophile, saw in virtual schools the same revolutionary potential to expand choice that he had seen in vouchers and charters. Unions consider virtual schooling “an even bigger threat than vouchers because it’s such a disruptive idea,” he told National Review. In 2010, he convened a “digital learning council” that included virtual-school executives from around the country. It issued a report urging states to adopt industry-friendly measures, such as eliminating limits on virtual-school enrollment. Several states proceeded to do so. In Maine, according to a 2012 investigation by the Portland Press-Herald, foundation staff members essentially wrote legislation backed by the Republican governor, Paul LePage, to expand virtual schools. “I have no ‘political’ staff who I can work with to move this stuff through the process,” Maine’s education commissioner had e-mailed Levesque, after meeting her at a foundation summit.

"One entrepreneur who had seen the potential of the school-reform boom was Randy Best, a legendarily eccentric Texan with a knack for buying and selling. While a student at Lamar University, in the nineteen-sixties, Best started a class-ring and jewelry business, which he and his partners sold for twelve million dollars. That was followed by an eclectic array of ventures: art galleries, clinics, cattle yards, oil and gas, defense and aerospace, and Girl Scout-cookie manufacturing. He spent much of his wealth on a personal natural-history collection that included a seven-foot-long Egyptian sarcophagus lid, a Siberian cave-bear skeleton, and sabre-toothed-tiger skulls from the Pleistocene period.","817","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"

Not the military—nothing—is bigger,” Best later told Mother Jones. In 1995, he launched Voyager Expanded Learning, a for-profit chain of after-school tutoring programs in Dallas, and started donating money to George Bush’s 1998 reëlection campaign.

A 2006 Department of Education inspector general’s audit and a 2007 report by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee found that Reading First officials had been paid generous “consulting” fees by some of the companies whose services they were recommending, including Voyager. George Miller, the Democratic chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, said that the situation was “very close to a criminal enterprise.” In 2007, a major comparison of reading programs conducted by the Department of Education found that Voyager had “potentially negative effects,” because students using it showed a decline in comprehension. Best says that neither he nor Voyager officials were contacted or questioned by any regulatory or investigative bodies.","820","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"By then, Best had sold Voyager to ProQuest, a Michigan company, for three hundred and sixty million dollars. In 2007, he started another Dallas-based company, Higher Ed Holdings, later renamed Academic Partnerships, which persuades public colleges to attract more students by outsourcing to the firm their master’s-degree programs in fields such as business and education. The company puts the courses online, recruits students from a call center in Dallas, and takes a large percentage of the tuition revenue—between fifty and seventy per cent. It has contracts with more than fifty colleges nationwide, although it hasn’t been welcomed everywhere. At the University of Toledo, the education faculty blocked the contract because, as Leigh Chiarelott, then the head of the department, told me, there were serious concerns that “we’d be almost like a diploma mill.”","821","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Best needed someone to lend credibility to the company. Florida had spent heavily on Voyager during Jeb Bush’s governorship, and, in 2005, when Bush was still in office, Best spoke with him about going into the education business. By 2011, Bush had joined Academic Partnerships as an investor and an adviser, and he became the company’s highest-profile champion. Best told the Washington Post that Bush’s annual salary was sixty thousand dollars, but he did not disclose the terms of Bush’s investment stake. For the first time, Bush was making money in an educational enterprise. But Campbell, Bush’s spokeswoman, is careful to draw a distinction between his work for Academic Partnerships and his education advocacy, noting that Academic Partnerships is involved in higher education, not K-12 schools.","822","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In July, 2011, Bush sent letters to college presidents inviting them to the company’s first big marketing conference, at the Four Seasons Hotel near Dallas. Speakers included Tony Blair and the former Australian Prime Minister John Howard. Last spring, Bush recorded an infomercial inviting people to attend another Dallas conference, in March. This time, the speakers were Thomas Friedman, Fareed Zakaria, and Hillary Clinton, who opened her remarks with praise for Bush’s work on education. He was, she said, someone who “really focused on education during his time as governor in Florida and has continued that work with passion and dedication in the years since.”","823","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"As governor, Jeb Bush had been among those who noted one of the biggest problems with the No Child Left Behind law: standards varied greatly from state to state, depending on how ambitiously officials designed their tests and defined their success. In 2009, a coalition of governors and state education officials came together and, with financial support from the Gates Foundation and the implicit backing of the Obama Administration, devised a new set of standards intended to raise the calibre of instruction nationwide. The states broke into two consortia, each of which designed a set of tests around the new standards, called the Common Core.","824","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The effort was bipartisan, and, at the beginning, all but four states signed on to it. Jeb Bush was not directly involved, but he was a vocal supporter of making tests and standards more consistent across the country, as part of his philosophy of full accountability for schools. The Common Core, he said, was a “clear and straightforward” path to “high, lofty standards.” In March of 2011, he appeared onstage at Miami Central High School with President Obama and Arne Duncan, who were in town to promote the Administration’s policy. “Education achievement is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue,” Bush said. “It is an issue of national priority.” Obama thanked Bush for coming to the event, adding, “We are so grateful to him for the work that he’s doing on behalf of education.”","825","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"To avoid the standards being viewed as a federal mandate, the Administration had left their creation to the states. But it initially made states’ acceptance of them a requirement for receiving funds under its Race to the Top initiative. Conservative activists quickly seized on the standards as another example of Obama’s big-government overreach, along the lines of the Affordable Care Act. (They referred to the standards, inevitably, as Obamacore.) The Koch brothers, the talk-radio hosts Glenn Beck and Michelle Malkin, and the Heritage Foundation joined the attack. (Bush had left the Heritage board when he ran for governor the second time, in 1998.) “The élites in the Republican Party and the Democratic Party don’t get this,” a lawyer for the American Principles Project, one of the groups leading the backlash, said.","826","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In June, 2011, Jeb Bush and Joel Klein, newly installed at News Corp., co-wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed headlined “The Case for Common Educational Standards.” A month later, an e-mail went out from the Foundation for Excellence in Education to the chiefs for change, alerting them that the upcoming convention of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, with which the foundation was usually allied, was going to take up a resolution against the Common Core. The e-mail urged the commissioners to lobby legislators attending the convention to oppose it.","827","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The campaign against the standards particularly threatened Tony Bennett, the Indiana commissioner, a rising Republican who was one of the chiefs for change. In many states, the commissioners are appointed, but in Indiana they are elected. In 2012, the Tea Party organized opposition to Bennett’s reëlection; e-mails between Bennett’s office and the foundation that summer are full of alarm about the “black helicopter crowd.” In November, Bennett lost to an anti-Common Core Democrat who had Tea Party backing. Several potential Republican Presidential candidates for 2016—including the governors Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, Bobby Jindal, of Louisiana, and Mike Pence, of Indiana, all of whom had supported the Common Core—backed away from the standards, as did Florida’s governor, Rick Scott. Last April, Bush told Fox News, “Others that supported the standard all of a sudden now are opposed to it. I don’t get it.”","828","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Meanwhile, several of the chiefs for change whom Bush was relying on to promote the standards were leaving office. Early last year, New Jersey’s Chris Cerf took an executive position at Amplify, which in 2013 had won a $12.5-million contract to develop a digital library of student-assessment tools from one of the state consortia that were developing the Common Core-based tests. Such movement from the public sector to the private is routine, but it underscored a central critique of the standards from both the left and the right: that, because the new testing regime required states to buy new test-prep materials, curricula, and even computers on which to take the tests, they were essentially another sales opportunity for the education industry. A headline on the Web site of the libertarian magazine Reason in July claimed that “Common Core Is Crony Capitalism for Computer Companies.”","829","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"A decade and a half earlier, Bush had been in the vanguard on conservative school reform. But, last September, he was not invited to the Values Voter Summit, the big annual event in Washington, D.C., for Republican politicians seeking to build support among religious-right activists. Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, which hosts the summit, explained at a news conference that “Jeb is a very nice guy, but he has a challenge among real conservatives for aggressively pushing for Common Core.” He added, “That’s a huge problem.”","830","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Since Bush left the statehouse, the for-profit charter-school industry in Florida has continued to grow; the two largest chains have doubled their enrollment, to more than fifty thousand students. For-profit charters now spend half a million dollars a year on lobbying, and they contribute heavily to political campaigns. Charter Schools USA alone gave more than two hundred thousand dollars to candidates for state office in the 2012 elections. The industry so dominates the field, particularly in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas, that it has discouraged the expansion in Florida of highly regarded not-for-profit networks, such as KIPP and Green Dot. But questions about for-profit operations continue to mount.","831","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"

The company, which was founded in 1999 by two brothers, Fernando and Ignacio Zulueta, has nearly a hundred charter and virtual schools in the state. The Miami Herald reported last April that the audit is examining the company’s practice of leasing space from development firms controlled by the Zuluetas. A 2006 Miami-Dade County audit determined that this arrangement, at one cluster of Academica schools, had cost taxpayers $1.3 million.

He reiterated his support for the Common Core and school choice in a speech that was full of education bromides (“poverty is not an excuse”; “states and local communities are where the best ideas come from”). It was hard to question the conviction underlying his remarks, but his delivery was phlegmatic. Todd Lamb, a former education adviser to President George W. Bush who now works for Engrade, the digital-learning division of McGraw-Hill, said that if Jeb “had grown up in, say, rural Northern California, he would’ve become a chief academic officer for a school district.”","837","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"

"With the National Guard patrolling the streets of Baltimore, the crisis of policing in minority communities has already merged with the 2016 Presidential campaign. On Wednesday morning, Hillary Clinton went to Columbia University and spoke at a policy forum named after David Dinkins, New York City’s first black Mayor. She went somewhat beyond the remarks that President Obama delivered at the White House on Tuesday, calling for an end to mass incarceration, especially of young black men, and for the mandatory use of body cameras by the police.","April 29, 2015","843","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"Over the coming days and weeks, the merits of Clinton’s proposals will be subjected to closer analysis, and the politics of the issue will be chewed over in exhaustive detail. Before that, though, it’s worth looking at what Obama and Clinton said in their speeches, which was pretty striking. The President, who has been criticized by some black intellectuals and media figures for striking too timid a pose on race relations, asked Americans to confront the long history of minority deaths at the hands of the police, saying, “We, as a country, have to do some soul-searching. … This is not new. It has been going on for decades.” Clinton, in a speech that lasted about half an hour, also told some harsh truths. Indeed, she used almost that exact phrase, saying, “We have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in America.”","844","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"Words are only words, of course, welcome as they are. In a country where police forces are run locally and the Republicans control Congress, bringing about real change will be a big challenge. But, with camera phones and social media helping to highlight incidents that otherwise would have passed largely unnoticed, something significant does appear to be happening. Out of the protests, the anger, and the saturation media coverage, the kernel of a long-overdue urban agenda is emerging—one that is centered on reforms to policing and the criminal-justice system, but that also acknowledges the broader social, economic, and racial realities that make up what Gunnar Myrdal, more than seventy years ago, called “An American Dilemma.” In pursuing such an agenda, words and speeches aren’t sufficient, but they are certainly necessary.","845","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"Having been curiously quiet over the weekend, despite protests and arrests on Saturday in Baltimore over the death, in police custody, of Freddie Gray, Obama had to come out and condemn the violence that took place following Gray’s funeral, on Monday, which he did in unequivocal terms. “When individuals get crowbars and start prying open doors to loot, they’re not protesting. … They’re stealing,” he said, adding, “They need to be treated as criminals.” But the President also acknowledged the peaceful protestors who had taken to the streets before the violence started, noting that they had legitimate concerns about the deaths of Gray and other young black men—concerns he linked to the urban decay and neglect that has blighted America’s reputation for at least half a century. One particular passage is, I think, worth quoting in full:","846","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"Clinton, for her part, wasn’t coming to this issue fresh. Three weeks ago, after a South Carolina cop repeatedly shot in the back a black man named Walter Scott, who was running away after being stopped for a faulty taillight, she tweeted, “Praying for #WalterScott’s family. Heartbreaking & too familiar. We can do better – rebuild trust, reform justice system, respect all lives.” At Columbia, she began in a similar vein, saying, “Yet again, the family of a young black man is grieving a life cut short. Yet again, the streets of an American city are marred by violence.”","847","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"She continued:","848","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"This was emotive stuff. But what did she think should be done? She called a recent report by a Presidential task force that was appointed in the wake of riots over the police shooting of Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri, last year, “a good place to start.” However, she seemed keen to move beyond the report’s recommendations, which stopped short of calling, for example, for the mandatory use of police cameras, or for limiting police use of paramilitary equipment. Clinton said that body cameras should be the norm, arguing that this would “protect good people on both sides of the lens,” and said that public money should be used to “bolster best practices,” rather than spent on “weapons of war that have no place on our streets.”","849","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"Like Obama, Clinton was also careful to stress the broader context. “You cannot talk about smart policing and reforming the criminal-justice system if you also don’t talk about what’s needed to provide economic opportunity,” she said. But perhaps the most newsworthy aspect of the speech was a call for “a true national debate about how to reduce our prison population while keeping our communities safe.” Noting that America has five per cent of the world’s population but twenty-five per cent of its prisoners, and that roughly one and a half million African-American men are missing from their communities and families because they are incarcerated, Clinton said, “We don’t want to create another incarceration generation.”","850","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"In calling for big reductions in the number of prisoners, Clinton was distancing herself from her husband’s legacy—in 1994, at the height of the “drug war,” he signed legislation that lengthened sentences for drug offenders and provided more federal money for prison construction. But times have changed, and so has the political environment: these days, even some Republicans agree that far too many Americans, particularly Americans of color, are languishing in jail for minor offenses. Texas, a solidly Republican state, is reducing sentences, closing prisons, and funding alternative programs. In a sense, the national debate is merely catching up with local initiatives, some of which are cost-driven.","851","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"Still, after the riots in Ferguson and Baltimore, it is surely encouraging to see the President and the leading Democratic candidate to replace him speaking so forcefully, and confronting the “lock ’em up” mentality that has dominated the public debate for so long. “I don’t want the discussion about criminal justice, smart policing, to be siloed, and to permit discussions and arguments and debates about it to only talk about that,” Clinton said. “The conversation needs to be much broader. Because that is a symptom, not a cause, of what ails us today.” In the next nineteen months, Clinton will give many speeches. But she might not speak a truer sentence than that last one.","852","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"For about a century, economic inequality has been measured on a scale, from zero to one, known as the Gini index and named after an Italian statistician, Corrado Gini, who devised it in 1912, when he was twenty-eight and the chair of statistics at the University of Cagliari. If all the income in the world were earned by one person and everyone else earned nothing, the world would have a Gini index of one. If everyone in the world earned exactly the same income, the world would have a Gini index of zero. The United States Census Bureau has been using Gini’s measurement to calculate income inequality in America since 1947. Between 1947 and 1968, the U.S. Gini index dropped to .386, the lowest ever recorded. Then it began to climb.","853","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Income inequality is greater in the United States than in any other democracy in the developed world. Between 1975 and 1985, when the Gini index for U.S. households rose from .397 to .419, as calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau, the Gini indices of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Sweden, and Finland ranged roughly between .200 and .300, according to national data analyzed by Andrea Brandolini and Timothy Smeeding. But historical cross-country comparisons are difficult to make; the data are patchy, and different countries measure differently. The Luxembourg Income Study, begun in 1983, harmonizes data collected from more than forty countries on six continents. According to the L.I.S.’s adjusted data, the United States has regularly had the highest Gini index of any affluent democracy. In 2013, the U.S. Census Bureau reported a Gini index of .476.","854","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"The evidence that income inequality in the United States has been growing for decades and is greater than in any other developed democracy is not much disputed. It is widely known and widely studied. Economic inequality has been an academic specialty at least since Gini first put chalk to chalkboard. In the nineteen-fifties, Simon Kuznets, who went on to win a Nobel Prize, used tax data to study the shares of income among groups, an approach that was further developed by the British economist Anthony Atkinson, beginning with his 1969 paper “On the Measurement of Inequality,” in the Journal of Economic Theory. Last year’s unexpected popular success of the English translation of Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-first Century” drew the public’s attention to measurements of inequality, but Piketty’s work had long since reached American social scientists, especially through a 2003 paper that he published with the Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez, in The Quarterly Journal of Economics. Believing that the Gini index underestimates inequality, Piketty and Saez favor Kuznets’s approach. (Atkinson, Piketty, Saez, and Facundo Alvaredo are also the creators of the World Top Incomes Database, which collects income-share data from more than twenty countries.) In “Income Inequality in the United States, 1913-1998,” Piketty and Saez used tax data to calculate what percentage of income goes to the top one per cent and to the top ten per cent. In 1928, the top one per cent earned twenty-four per cent of all income; in 1944, they earned eleven per cent, a rate that began to rise in the nineteen-eighties. By 2012, according to Saez’s updated data, the top one per cent were earning twenty-three per cent of the nation’s income, almost the same ratio as in 1928, although it has since dropped slightly.","855","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Political scientists are nearly as likely to study economic inequality as economists are, though they’re less interested in how much inequality a market can bear than in how much a democracy can bear, and here the general thinking is that the United States is nearing its breaking point. In 2001, the American Political Science Association formed a Task Force on Inequality and American Democracy; a few years later, it concluded that growing economic inequality was threatening fundamental American political institutions. In 2009, Oxford University Press published both a seven-hundred-page “Handbook of Economic Inequality” and a collection of essays about the political consequences of economic inequality whose argument is its title: “The Unsustainable American State.” There’s a global version of this argument, too. “Inequality Matters,” a 2013 report by the United Nations, took the view—advanced by the economist Joseph Stiglitz in his book “The Price of Inequality”—that growing income inequality is responsible for all manner of political instability, as well as for the slowing of economic growth worldwide. Last year, when the Pew Research Center conducted a survey about which of five dangers people in forty-four countries consider to be the “greatest threat to the world,” many of the countries polled put religious and ethnic hatred at the top of their lists, but Americans and many Europeans chose inequality.","856","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"What’s new about the chasm between the rich and the poor in the United States, then, isn’t that it’s growing or that scholars are studying it or that people are worried about it. What’s new is that American politicians of all spots and stripes are talking about it, if feebly: inequality this, inequality that. In January, at a forum sponsored by Freedom Partners (a free-market advocacy group with ties to the Koch brothers), the G.O.P. Presidential swains Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio battled over which of them disliked inequality more, agreeing only that its existence wasn’t their fault. “The top one per cent earn a higher share of our income, nationally, than any year since 1928,” Cruz said, drawing on the work of Saez and Piketty. Cruz went on, “I chuckle every time I hear Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton talk about income inequality, because it’s increased dramatically under their policies.” No doubt there has been a lot of talk. “Let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one per cent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth,” Obama said during his State of the Union address. Speaker of the House John Boehner countered that “the President’s policies have made income inequality worse.”","857","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"The reason Democrats and Republicans are fighting over who’s to blame for growing economic inequality is that, aside from a certain amount of squabbling, it’s no longer possible to deny that it exists—a development that’s not to be sneezed at, given the state of the debate on climate change. That’s not to say the agreement runs deep; in fact, it couldn’t be shallower. The causes of income inequality are much disputed; so are its costs. And knowing the numbers doesn’t appear to be changing anyone’s mind about what, if anything, should be done about it.","858","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Robert Putnam’s new book, “Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis” (Simon & Schuster), is an attempt to set the statistics aside and, instead, tell a story. “Our Kids” begins with the story of the town where Putnam grew up, Port Clinton, Ohio. Putnam is a political scientist, but his argument is historical—it’s about change over time—and fuelled, in part, by nostalgia. “My hometown was, in the 1950s, a passable embodiment of the American Dream,” he writes, “a place that offered decent opportunity for all the kids in town, whatever their background.” Sixty years later, Putnam says, Port Clinton “is a split-screen American nightmare, a community in which kids from the wrong side of the tracks that bisect the town can barely imagine the future that awaits the kids from the right side of the tracks.”","859","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Inequality-wise, Port Clinton makes a reasonable Middletown. According to the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, Port Clinton’s congressional district, Ohio’s ninth, has a Gini index of .467, which is somewhat lower than the A.C.S.’s estimate of the national average. But “Our Kids” isn’t a book about the Gini index. “Some of us learn from numbers, but more of us learn from stories,” according to an appendix that Putnam co-wrote with Jennifer M. Silva. Putnam, the author of “Bowling Alone,” is the director of the Saguaro Seminar for civic engagement at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government; Silva, a sociologist, has been a postdoctoral fellow there. In her 2013 book “Coming Up Short: Working-Class Adulthood in an Age of Uncertainty” (Oxford), Silva reported the results of interviews she conducted with a hundred working-class adults in Lowell, Massachusetts and Richmond, Virginia, described her account of the structural inequalities that shape their lives as “a story of institutions—not individuals or their families,” and argued that those inequalities are the consequence of the past half century’s “massive effort to roll back social protections from the market.” For “Our Kids,” Silva visited Robert Putnam’s home town and interviewed young people and their parents. Putnam graduated from Port Clinton High School in 1959. The surviving members of his class are now in their mid-seventies. Putnam and Silva sent them questionnaires; seventy-five people returned them. Silva also spent two years interviewing more than a hundred young adults in nine other cities and counties across the nation. As Putnam and Silva note, Silva conducted nearly all of the interviews Putnam uses in his book.","860","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"“Our Kids” is a heartfelt portrait of four generations: Putnam’s fellow 1959 graduates and their children, and the kids in Port Clinton and those nine other communities today and their parents. The book tells more or less the same story that the numbers tell; it’s just got people in it. Specifically, it’s got kids: the kids Putnam used to know, and, above all, the kids Silva interviewed. The book proceeds from the depressing assumption that presenting the harrowing lives of poor young people is the best way to get Americans to care about poverty.","861","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Putnam has changed the names of all his subjects and removed certain identifying details. He writes about them as characters. First, there’s Don. He went to Port Clinton High School with Putnam. His father worked two jobs: an eight-hour shift at Port Clinton Manufacturing, followed by seven and a half hours at a local canning plant. A minister in town helped Don apply to university. “I didn’t know I was poor until I went to college,” Don says. He graduated from college, became a minister, and married a high-school teacher; they had one child, who became a high-school librarian. Libby, another member of Putnam’s graduating class, was the sixth of ten children. Like Don’s parents, neither of Libby’s parents finished high school. Her father worked at Standard Products, a factory on Maple Street that made many different things out of rubber, from weather stripping to tank treads. Libby won a scholarship to the University of Toledo, but dropped out to get married and have kids. Twenty years later, after a divorce, she got a job as a clerk in a lumberyard, worked her way up to becoming a writer for a local newspaper, and eventually ran for countywide office and won.","862","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"All but two of the members of Putnam’s graduating class were white. Putnam’s wistfulness toward his childhood home town is at times painful to read. The whiteness of Port Clinton in the nineteen-fifties was not mere happenstance but the consequence of discriminatory housing and employment practices. I glanced through the records of the Ohio chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., which included a branch in Port Clinton. The Ohio chapter’s report for 1957 chronicles, among other things, its failed attempt to gain passage of statewide Fair Housing legislation; describes how “cross burnings occurred in many cities in Ohio”; recounts instances of police brutality, including in Columbus, where a patrolman beat a woman “with the butt of his pistol all over her face and body”; and states that in Toledo, Columbus, “and in a number of other communities, the Association intervened in situations where violence flared up or was threatened when Negro families moved into formerly ‘all-white neighborhoods.’ ” Thurgood Marshall, the director of the N.A.A.C.P.’s Legal Defense and Educational Fund, spoke in Ohio in 1958, after which a sympathetic Cleveland newspaper wrote that Marshall “will never be named to the Supreme Court.” In 1960, the Ohio N.A.A.C.P. launched a statewide voter-registration drive. One pamphlet asked, “Are you permitted to live wherever you please in any Ohio City?” Putnam acknowledges that there was a lot of racism in Port Clinton, but he suggests that, whatever hardships the two black kids in his class faced because they were black, the American dream was nevertheless theirs. This fails to convince. As one of those two kids, now grown, tells Putnam, “Your then was not my then, and your now isn’t even my now.”","863","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"In any case, the world changed, and Port Clinton changed with it. “Most of the downtown shops of my youth stand empty and derelict,” Putnam writes. In the late nineteen-sixties, the heyday of the Great Society, when income inequality in the United States was as low as it has ever been, the same was probably true of Port Clinton. But in the nineteen-seventies the town’s manufacturing base collapsed. Standard Products laid off more than half of its workers. In 1993, the plant closed. Since then, unemployment has continued to rise and wages to fall. Between 1999 and 2013, the percentage of children in Port Clinton living in poverty rose from ten to forty.","864","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Silva found David hanging out in a park. His father, currently in prison, never had a steady job. David’s parents separated when he was a little boy. He bounced around, attending seven elementary schools. When he was thirteen, he was arrested for robbery. He graduated from high school only because he was given course credit for hours he’d worked at Big Boppers Diner (from which he was fired after graduation). In 2012, when David was eighteen, he got his girlfriend pregnant. “I’ll never get ahead,” he posted on his Facebook page last year, after his girlfriend left him. “I’m FUCKING DONE.”","865","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Wealthy newcomers began arriving in the nineteen-nineties. On the shores of Lake Erie, just a few miles past Port Clinton’s trailer parks, they built mansions and golf courses and gated communities. “Chelsea and her family live in a large white home with a wide porch overlooking the lake,” Putnam writes, introducing another of his younger characters. Chelsea was the president of her high school’s student body and editor of the yearbook. Her mother, Wendy, works part time; her father, Dick, is a businessman. In the basement of their house, Wendy and Dick had a “1950s-style diner” built so that Chelsea and her brother would have a place to hang out with their friends. When Chelsea’s brother got a bad grade in school, Wendy went all the way to the school board to get it changed. Chelsea and her brother are now in college. Wendy does not appear to believe in welfare. “You have to work if you want to get rich,” she says. “If my kids are going to be successful, I don’t think they should have to pay other people who are sitting around doing nothing for their success.”","866","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Aside from the anecdotes, the bulk of “Our Kids” is an omnibus of social-science scholarship. The book’s chief and authoritative contribution is its careful presentation for a popular audience of important work on the erosion, in the past half century, of so many forms of social, economic, and political support for families, schools, and communities—with consequences that amount to what Silva and others have called the “privatization of risk.” The social-science literature includes a complicated debate about the relationship between inequality of outcome (differences of income and of wealth) and inequality of opportunity (differences in education and employment). To most readers, these issues are more familiar as a political disagreement. In American politics, Democrats are more likely to talk about both kinds of inequality, while Republicans tend to confine their concern to inequality of opportunity. According to Putnam, “All sides in this debate agree on one thing, however: as income inequality expands, kids from more privileged backgrounds start and probably finish further and further ahead of their less privileged peers, even if the rate of socioeconomic mobility is unchanged.” He also takes the position, again relying on a considerable body of scholarship, that, “quite apart from the danger that the opportunity gap poses to American prosperity, it also undermines our democracy.” Chelsea is interested in politics. David has never voted.","867","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"The American dream is in crisis, Putnam argues, because Americans used to care about other people’s kids and now they only care about their own kids. But, he writes, “America’s poor kids do belong to us and we to them. They are our kids.” This is a lot like his argument in “Bowling Alone.” In high school in Port Clinton, Putnam was in a bowling league; he regards bowling leagues as a marker of community and civic engagement; bowling leagues are in decline; hence, Americans don’t take care of one another anymore. “Bowling Alone” and “Our Kids” also have the same homey just-folksiness. And they have the same shortcomings. If you don’t miss bowling leagues or all-white suburbs where women wear aprons—if Putnam’s then was not your then and his now isn’t your now—his well-intentioned “we” can be remarkably grating.","868","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"In story form, the argument of “Our Kids” is that while Wendy and Dick were building a fifties-style diner for their kids in the basement of their lakefront mansion, grade-grubbing with their son’s teachers, and glue-gunning the decorations for their daughter’s prom, every decent place to hang out in Port Clinton closed its doors, David was fired from his job at Big Boppers, and he got his girlfriend pregnant because, by the time David and Chelsea were born, in the nineteen-nineties, not only was Standard Products out of business but gone, too, was the sense of civic obligation and commonweal—everyone caring about everyone else’s kids—that had made it possible for Don and Libby to climb out of poverty in the nineteen-fifties and the nineteen-sixties. “Nobody gave a shit,” David says. And he’s not wrong.","869","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"“Our Kids” is a passionate, urgent book. It also has a sad helplessness. Putnam tells a story teeming with characters and full of misery but without a single villain. This is deliberate. “This is a book without upper-class villains,” he insists in the book’s final chapter. In January, Putnam tweeted, “My new book ‘Our Kids’ shows a growing gap between rich kids and poor kids. We’ll work with all sides on solutions.” It’s easier to work with all sides if no side is to blame. But Putnam’s eagerness to influence Congress has narrative consequences. If you’re going to tell a story about bad things happening to good people, you’ve got to offer an explanation, and, when you make your arguments through characters, your reader will expect that explanation in the form of characters. I feel bad for Chelsea. But I feel worse for David. Am I supposed to hate Wendy?","870","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Some people make arguments by telling stories; other people make arguments by counting things. Charles Dickens was a story man. In “Hard Times” (1854), a novel written when statistics was on the rise, Dickens’s villain, Thomas Gradgrind, was a numbers man, “a man of facts and calculations,” who named one of his sons Adam Smith and another Malthus. “With a rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication table always in his pocket, Sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature, and tell you exactly what it comes to.”","871","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Numbers men are remote and cold of heart, Dickens thought. But, of course, the appeal of numbers lies in their remoteness and coldness. Numbers depersonalize; that remains one of their chief claims to authority, and to a different explanatory force than can be found in, say, a poem. “Quantification is a technology of distance,” as the historian of science Theodore Porter has pointed out. “Reliance on numbers and quantitative manipulation minimizes the need for intimate knowledge and personal trust.” It’s difficult to understand something like income inequality across large populations and to communicate your understanding of it across vast distances without counting. But quantification’s lack of intimacy is also its weakness; it represents not only a gain but also a loss of knowledge.","872","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Corrado Gini, he of the Gini index, was a numbers man, at a time when statistics had become a modern science. In 1925, four years after Gini wrote “Measurement of Inequality of Incomes,” he signed the “Manifesto of Fascist Intellectuals” (he was the only statistician to do so) and was soon running the Presidential Commission for the Study of Constitutional Reforms. As Jean-Guy Prévost reported in “A Total Science: Statistics in Liberal and Fascist Italy” (2009), Gini’s work was so closely tied to the Fascist state that, in 1944, after the regime fell, he was tried for being an apologist for Fascism. In the shadow of his trial, he joined the Movimento Unionista Italiano, a political party whose objective was to annex Italy to the United States. “This would solve all of Italy’s problems,” the movement’s founder, Santi Paladino, told a reporter for Time. (“Paladino has never visited the U.S., though his wife Francesca lived 24 years in The Bronx,” the magazine noted.) But, for Gini, the movement’s purpose was to provide him with some anti-Fascist credentials.","873","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"The story of Gini is a good illustration of the problem with stories, which is that they personalize (which is also their power). His support for Fascism doesn’t mean that the Gini index isn’t valuable. It is valuable. The life of Corrado Gini can’t be used to undermine all of statistical science. Still, if you wanted to write an indictment of statistics as an instrument of authoritarian states, and if you had a great deal of other evidence to support that indictment—including other stories and, ideally, numbers—why yes, Gini would be an excellent character to introduce in Chapter 1.","874","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Because stories contain one kind of truth and numbers another, many writers mix and match, telling representative stories and backing them up with aggregate data. Putnam, though, doesn’t so much mix and match as split the difference. He tells stories about kids but presents data about the economy. That’s why “Our Kids” has heaps of victims but not a single villain. “We encounter Elijah in a dingy shopping mall on the north side of Atlanta, during his lunch break from a job packing groceries,” Putnam writes. “Elijah is thin and small in stature, perhaps five foot seven, and wears baggy clothes that bulk his frame: jeans belted low around his upper thighs, a pair of Jordans on his feet.” As for why Elijah is packing groceries, the book offers not characters—there are no interviews, for instance, with members of the Georgia legislature or the heads of national corporations whose businesses have left Atlanta—but numbers, citing statistics about the city (“Large swaths of southern and western Atlanta itself are over 95 percent black, with child poverty rates ranging from 50 percent to 80 percent”) and providing a series of charts reporting the results of studies about things like class differences in parenting styles and in the frequency of the family dinner.","875","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"In “The Age of Acquiescence: The Life and Death of American Resistance to Organized Wealth and Power” (Little, Brown), Steve Fraser fumes that what’s gone wrong with political discourse in America is that the left isn’t willing to blame anyone for anything anymore. There used to be battle cries. No more kings! Down with fat cats! Damn the moneycrats! Like Putnam’s argument, Fraser’s is both historical and nostalgic. Fraser longs for the passion and force with which Americans of earlier generations attacked aggregated power. Think of the way Frederick Douglass wrote about slavery, Ida B. Wells wrote about lynching, Ida Tarbell wrote about Standard Oil, Upton Sinclair wrote about the meatpacking industry, and Louis Brandeis wrote about the money trust. These people weren’t squeamish about villains.","876","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"To chronicle the rise of acquiescence, Fraser examines two differences between the long nineteenth century and today. “The first Gilded Age, despite its glaring inequities, was accompanied by a gradual rise in the standard of living; the second by a gradual erosion,” he writes. In the first Gilded Age, everyone from reporters to politicians apparently felt comfortable painting plutocrats as villains; in the second, this is, somehow, forbidden. “If the first Gilded Age was full of sound and fury,” he writes, “the second seemed to take place in a padded cell.” Fraser argues that while Progressive Era muckrakers ended the first Gilded Age by drawing on an age-old tradition of dissent to criticize prevailing economic, social, and political arrangements, today’s left doesn’t engage in dissent; it engages in consent, urging solutions that align with neoliberalism, technological determinism, and global capitalism: “Environmental despoiling arouses righteous eating; cultural decay inspires charter schools; rebellion against work becomes work as a form of rebellion; old-form anticlericalism morphs into the piety of the secular; the break with convention ends up as the politics of style; the cri de coeur against alienation surrenders to the triumph of the solitary; the marriage of political and cultural radicalism ends in divorce.” Why not blame the financial industry? Why not blame the Congress that deregulated it? Why not blame the system itself? Because, Fraser argues, the left has been cowed into silence on the main subject at hand: “What we could not do, what was not even speakable, was to tamper with the basic institutions of financial capitalism.”","877","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Putnam closes “Our Kids” with a chapter called “What Is to Be Done?” Tampering with the basic institutions of financial capitalism is not on his to-do list. The chapter includes one table, one chart, many stories, and this statement: “The absence of personal villains in our stories does not mean that no one is at fault.” At fault are “social policies that reflect collective decisions,” and, “insofar as we have some responsibility for those collective decisions, we are implicated by our failure to address removable barriers to others’ success.” What can Putnam’s “we” do? He proposes changes in four realms: family structure, parenting, school, and community. His policy recommendations include expanding the earned-income tax credit and protecting existing anti-poverty programs; implementing more generous parental leaves, better child-care programs, and state-funded preschool; equalizing the funding of public schools, providing more community-based neighborhood schools, and increasing support for vocational high-school programs and for community colleges; ending pay-to-play extracurricular activities in public schools and developing mentorship programs that tie schools to communities and community organizations.","878","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"

"“Inequality: What Can Be Done?,” by Anthony Atkinson, will be published this spring (Harvard). Atkinson is a renowned expert on the measurement of economic inequality, but in “Inequality” he hides his math. “There are a number of graphs, and a small number of tables,” he writes, by way of apology, and he paraphrases Stephen Hawking: “Every equation halves the number of readers.”","880","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Much of the book is a discussion of specific proposals. Atkinson believes that solutions like Putnam’s, which focus on inequality of opportunity, mainly through reforms having to do with public education, are inadequate. Atkinson thinks that the division between inequality of outcome and inequality of opportunity is largely false. He believes that tackling inequality of outcome is a very good way to tackle inequality of opportunity. (If you help a grownup get a job, her kids will have a better chance of climbing out of poverty, too.) Above all, he disagrees with the widespread assumption that technological progress and globalization are responsible for growing inequality. That assumption, he argues, is wrong and also dangerous, because it encourages the belief that growing inequality is inevitable.","881","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Atkinson points out that neither globalization nor rapid technological advance is new and there are, therefore, lessons to be learned from history. Those lessons do not involve nostalgia. (Atkinson is actually an optimistic sort, and he spends time appreciating rising standards of living, worldwide.) One of those lessons is that globalizing economies aren’t like hurricanes or other acts of God or nature. Instead, they’re governed by laws regulating things like unions and trusts and banks and wages and taxes; laws are passed by legislators; in democracies, legislators are elected. So, too, new technologies don’t simply fall out of the sky, like meteors or little miracles. “The direction of technological change is the product of decisions by firms, researchers, and governments,” Atkinson writes. The iPhone exists, as Mariana Mazzucato demonstrated in her 2013 book “The Entrepreneurial State,” because various branches of the U.S. government provided research assistance that resulted in several key technological developments, including G.P.S., multi-touch screens, L.C.D. displays, lithium-ion batteries, and cellular networks.","882","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Atkinson isn’t interested in stories the way Putnam is interested in stories. And he isn’t interested in villains the way Fraser is interested in villains. But he is interested in responsible parties, and in demanding government action. “It is not enough to say that rising inequality is due to technological forces outside our control,” Atkinson writes. “The government can influence the path taken.” In “Inequality: What Can Be Done?,” he offers fifteen proposals, from the familiar (unemployment programs, national savings bonds, and a more progressive tax structure) to the novel (a governmental role in the direction of technological development, a capital endowment or “minimum inheritance” paid to everyone on reaching adulthood), along with five “ideas to pursue,” which is where things get Piketty (a global tax on wealth, a minimum tax on corporations).","883","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"In Port Clinton, Ohio, a barbed-wire fence surrounds the abandoned Standard Products factory; the E.P.A. has posted signs warning that the site is hazardous. There’s no work there anymore, only poison. Robert Putnam finds that heartbreaking. Steve Fraser wishes people were angrier about it. Anthony Atkinson thinks something can be done. Atkinson’s specific policy recommendations are for the United Kingdom. In the United States, most of his proposals are nonstarters, no matter how many times you hear the word “inequality” on “Meet the Press” this year.","884","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"It might be that people have been studying inequality in all the wrong places. A few years ago, two scholars of comparative politics, Alfred Stepan, at Columbia, and the late Juan J. Linz—numbers men—tried to figure out why the United States has for so long had much greater income inequality than any other developed democracy. Because this disparity has been more or less constant, the question doesn’t lend itself very well to historical analysis. Nor is it easily subject to the distortions of nostalgia. But it does lend itself very well to comparative analysis.","885","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Stepan and Linz identified twenty-three long-standing democracies with advanced economies. Then they counted the number of veto players in each of those twenty-three governments. (A veto player is a person or body that can block a policy decision. Stepan and Linz explain, “For example, in the United States, the Senate and the House of Representatives are veto players because without their consent, no bill can become a law.”) More than half of the twenty-three countries Stepan and Linz studied have only one veto player; most of these countries have unicameral parliaments. A few countries have two veto players; Switzerland and Australia have three. Only the United States has four. Then they made a chart, comparing Gini indices with veto-player numbers: the more veto players in a government, the greater the nation’s economic inequality. This is only a correlation, of course, and cross-country economic comparisons are fraught, but it’s interesting.","886","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Then they observed something more. Their twenty-three democracies included eight federal governments with both upper and lower legislative bodies. Using the number of seats and the size of the population to calculate malapportionment, they assigned a “Gini Index of Inequality of Representation” to those eight upper houses, and found that the United States had the highest score: it has the most malapportioned and the least representative upper house. These scores, too, correlated with the countries’ Gini scores for income inequality: the less representative the upper body of a national legislature, the greater the gap between the rich and the poor.","887","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"The growth of inequality isn’t inevitable.

"Nearly eight years ago, Democrats held their first televised Presidential debate of the 2008 campaign, marking the debut of a cast of characters that ranged from the plausible to the preposterous. For two hours, the candidates, some of them now remembered only by those with an unhealthy attachment to politics, went at it as the moderator, NBC’s Brian Williams, made game attempts to nudge them into saying something interesting. The most incautious remarks came from former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel and former Representative Dennis Kucinich, both of whom had nothing to lose and knew it. When Williams asked for reactions to Senator Harry Reid’s remark that “the war in Iraq is lost,” Gravel replied, “Well, first off, understand that this war was lost the day that George Bush invaded Iraq on a fraudulent basis.” Kucinich talked about impeaching Dick Cheney. The leading competitors were simply careful. Senator Joe Biden said, “Look, Brian, this is not a game show. You know, this is not a football game. This is not win or lose. The fact of the matter is that the President has a fundamentally flawed policy.” Senator Hillary Clinton said, “Well, Brian, at the outset let me say that the American people have spoken; the Congress has voted, as of today, to end this war. And now we can only hope that the President will listen. … This is not America’s war to win or lose. We have given the Iraqi people the chance to have freedom, to have their own country.” Senator Barack Obama said, “Well, Brian, I am proud that I opposed this war from the start, because I thought that it would lead to the some—the disastrous conditions that we’ve seen on the ground in Iraq.”","April 3, 2015","889","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"

Hillary Clinton is still being asked to defend her 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq-war resolution, and still sounds much as she did when she said, “Well, Brian, I take responsibility for my vote. … It was a sincere vote based on the information available to me. And I’ve said many times that if I knew then what I now know, I would not have voted that way.” At the same time, Clinton brought real conviction and knowledge to discussions of universal health care, a central issue in 2008 that is still with us.

But it’s a race that’s bound to become ever more compelling, possibly with more candidates (Ben Carson? Carly Fiorina?), and the contenders will be sharpened in the process.

The investigation community is like a perpetual scandal-seeking machine, quick to seize on any hint of inconsistency, and both Clintons, understandably, are weary of being pursued by those who don’t wish them well.

The former Virginia Senator James Webb, who began exploring a run last November, is still hinting that he intends to run. But when you look for signs of the Webb campaign, which promised a fresh view of income inequality, military commitments abroad, and the terrible waste of lives—mainly black lives—caused by mass incarceration, what you’re likely to find is the status of the James Webb space telescope, which will replace the Hubble. (That Webb ran NASA in the years of the Apollo program.)

He’s spent the subsequent decade dealing with the fallout from the case that landed him in prison—a case that, at its core, is about a single campaign contribution. Siegelman ran for office on a promise to create a state lottery to fund education in Alabama. The issue went to a ballot question, and Richard Scrushy, a prominent health-care executive, donated five hundred thousand dollars to support the pro-lottery campaign. (Voters rejected the lottery.) After Scrushy had given the first half of his contribution, Siegelman reappointed him to Alabama’s Certificate of Need Review Board (the CON Board), which regulates health care in the state. Scrushy had served on the CON Board through the administrations of three different governors. The heart of the case against Siegelman came down to a single conversation that he had with Nick Bailey, a close aide of the Governor’s, about a two-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar check from Scrushy for the lottery campaign. As summarized by the appeals court:","898","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman"

"In 2006, after a district-court trial before Judge Mark Fuller, Siegelman was convicted of seven counts, including bribery, conspiracy, and fraud. He was acquitted of twenty-two charges and sentenced to seven years in prison. (An appeals court overturned two of the seven convictions and allowed Siegelman out on bail during some of the time his case was on appeal.) Siegelman is currently incarcerated in a federal prison in Oklahoma; his projected release date is in 2017.","900","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman"
"Throughout Siegelman’s legal ordeal, the Supreme Court has been in the process of deregulating American politics, most notably in the 2010 Citizens United decision. In that case, the Justices found that money is speech—that contributing to a political campaign amounts to a protected activity under the First Amendment. As the appeals court in Siegelman’s case noted, the charges in his case “impact the First Amendment’s core values—protection of free political speech and the right to support issues of great public importance. It would be a particularly dangerous legal error from a civic point of view to instruct a jury that they may convict a defendant for his exercise of either of these constitutionally protected activities.”","901","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman"
"It seems clear that Siegelman was conducting the seedy, but routine, business of contemporary American politics. Scrushy contributed because he wanted something in return, which is why many, if not most, people contribute to political campaigns. (George Will made this point in a column in defense of Siegelman.) Why do “bundlers” become Ambassadors in congenial countries? Why do local contractors support mayoral candidates? Why do real-estate developers give to prospective (and incumbent) governors? Because they want something. Siegelman was convicted because the quid pro quo was too “explicit”—but, beyond the conversation about what Scrushy might want, there was no clear evidence that it was. Thanks to the courts, the line between illegal bribery by campaign contribution and the ordinary business of politics has all but disappeared. Throwing a man in prison for activity at the murky barrier between the two is simply unjust.","902","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman"
"Siegelman should be freed, too, because there was a distasteful overlay of politics to his prosecution. According to an affidavit filed by a Republican lawyer in Alabama, senior state Republicans, in the aftermath of the 2002 election, said that Karl Rove, then a top White House aide to President Bush, had promised them a Justice Department investigation of Siegelman—an investigation that then took place. The matter of White House interference in the case is unproved, but Rove certainly proved, later in the Bush Administration, that he was willing to manipulate United States Attorneys for the political advantage of the Republican Party. Given the ubiquity of quid-pro-quo politics in Alabama (and most other states), the case against Siegelman appears selective indeed.","903","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman"
"There is another reason to question the harsh sentence dealt to the Governor. The behavior of the judge who imposed it is more than questionable. On August 10, 2014, Judge Fuller was arrested for domestic violence in an Atlanta hotel after his wife called 911. Shortly after his arrest, Fuller accepted a plea deal that would allow him to expunge his criminal record if he stayed out of further trouble. But the standard of contact for federal judges should be a great deal higher than “not exactly a felon.” At the moment, Fuller is not hearing cases, but, inexplicably, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has failed to remove him formally from his duties, and the House of Representatives has yet not begun impeachment proceedings. The state’s U.S. senators have called on Fuller to resign, but he has refused, and continues drawing a federal paycheck while doing no work. (Yesterday, Siegelman’s lawyers argued before an appellate court that the verdict should be overturned because of the alleged involvement of a lawyer who had been recused.)","904","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman"
"Through six years in office, President Obama has been especially stingy in granting pardons and commutations. But the power to grant clemency is an important one; it should be wielded with care, but it should be used. Our prisons are nearly full. Not everyone who is there belongs there. Don Seigelman is one person who should not be incarcerated anymore, and the President can and should make sure that he is freed.","905","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman"
"A year ago, on a bleak and chilly February morning, North Carolina’s Forward Together movement, a coalition of progressive groups with broad support among liberal-minded Carolinians, held its eighth-annual rally at the state capitol in Raleigh. The movement had begun drawing national attention, and the march through downtown was widely called the largest civil-rights gathering in the South since the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery; estimates put between fifty thousand and eighty thousand people there.","February 18, 2015","906","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"","907","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"At the time, a sense of momentum gripped Forward Together, which had swollen from small vigils of conscience to something not seen for decades—a sweeping alliance of the religious and the secular, attached to no candidate and not beholden to a major party, with members from far outside the usual-suspects list of professional and recreational full-time citizens. The main event was Moral Mondays, a weekly vigil at the capitol building that grew from dozens of participants to thousands after a new Republican governor, Pat McCrory, and the state legislature marched through abortion restrictions, limits on voting, a rejection of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, environmental rollbacks, and such symbolic enormities as the repeal of the Racial Justice Act, a law that commuted the death penalty to life without parole when race had influenced the original sentence. Those first rallies were often hurried in order to finish ahead of thunderstorms, which form over the Blue Ridge Mountains, two hours to the west, and sweep across the Piedmont toward the piney coastal plane that runs from Raleigh to the coast.","908","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"At this time last year, the midterm elections were coming up, and Forward Together planned to send organizers into every county in the state, to register tens of thousands of new voters and turn the election. The movement was particularly focussed on defeating Thom Tillis, the Senate candidate who, as speaker of North Carolina’s House of Representatives, was the figure most associated with the recent spate of conservative legislation. The organizing and registration drives happened; the victories didn’t. Instead, Tillis narrowly but decisively beat the sitting Democratic Senator, Kay Hagan. Republicans kept their nearly two-to-one advantage in the state legislature and picked up a seat in the House of Representatives.","909","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"Forward Together’s leaders had explanations, almost too many. North Carolina’s political map is a triumph of gerrymandering: the Republicans’ lock on the state legislature rests on a mere fifty-five per cent of votes, and the same goes for their ten-to-three advantage in the federal house. After two Obama campaigns, there are few unregistered voters waiting to be reached and cajoled to the polls. New laws cutting back on early voting and eliminating same-day registration may have inhibited students and black voters. Everyone knows that midterms are hard on Democrats, with a baseline electorate that is older and whiter than during Presidential contests.","910","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"But, as the political cliché has it, the person explaining is probably not winning. The Forward Together activists tried and lost. Last November, disappointment and exhaustion were palpable in liberal towns like Durham and Chapel Hill. What else was there to do?","911","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"This year’s rally, held on Valentine’s Day, under one of the clear skies that locals describe as tarheel blue, was visibly smaller, though other marchers and I took more than an hour to weave through six long blocks. The Reverend William Barber, a North Carolinian child of civil-rights activists who earned a master’s degree at Duke’s divinity school, and who has been the movement’s central figure since he launched the annual march, in 2007, was full of energy. The marchers were into it, and were as visibly diverse as they have been all along. There were students and other young people, many retirees, and plenty of people between them in age. The crowd looked like North Carolina, which is about sixty-five per cent white, twenty-two per cent black, and nine per cent Latino. All the same, there was a quieter energy and a sense of settling in for a long game, along with hints of uncertainty about what a long game means, these days, for a progressive movement in the South.","912","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"Maybe to their credit, the speakers at this post-defeat rally were not doing much explaining. Instead, they—and, above all, Reverend Barber—doubled down on rhetoric that was unmistakably Southern, even Carolinian, and deeply rooted in the region’s history.","913","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"The first note that strikes the ear at these events is a religious one. In North Carolina, the N.A.A.C.P. has a core of clergymen (mainly, in fact, men) at the heart of its leadership. The Prophet Ezekiel and John the Revelator are contemporaries and companions in Reverend Barber’s addresses. No oration is complete without a call for justice to roll down like a mighty stream. Speakers from outside the N.A.A.C.P. are often other ministers or rabbis. Although there is always a perfunctory reference to “those who have no faith but believe in a moral universe,” or some similarly awkward phrase of inclusion, the movement’s claims are transcendent, and that transcendence is rooted in the clapboard churches and red-clay roads of a devout region with few other civic institutions. (Organized labor is always present and name-checked, but North Carolina has long had the lowest rate of union membership in the country.)","914","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"The second attribute of the rhetoric at Moral Mondays rallies is constitutional. The Declaration of Independence and North Carolina’s 1868 Reconstruction constitution are constant reference points, for their announcement of the “self-evident” truth that all men are created equal. In American political discourse, the Constitution stands for principles whose authority outruns and outlives all partisan divisions. If the Constitution says it, it must be good and true; if it is good, it must be in the Constitution. At this year’s rally, one speaker used her brief time to argue that denying Medicaid coverage and labor-organizing rights violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of “equal protection of the laws,” not a doctrinally sound position but part of a long tradition of calling on constitutional principles to dignify political claims. Here, too, the movement’s claims to authority are transcendent, though only to an earthly, political transcendence.","915","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"The third theme that’s often invoked at the rallies is also the most regional: it is an appeal to a fraught local history. Reconstruction was a hurricane in North Carolina. Free blacks helped to write the 1868 state constitution, which established, at least notionally, equal and universal citizenship. For a time, black Republicans represented the state in Washington, and in alliance with mainly white Populists they held racist Democrats at bay and governed the state. Then, in 1898, a set of young Democrats staged an electoral upset that came to be called Redemption. They ran a well-financed, nakedly race-baiting statewide campaign, and launched an effort of extra-legal racial intimidation and terror to keep black voters from the polls. In Wilmington, a major coastal town whose officials were not up for election that year, the Redeemers drove a Republican government from office with a paramilitary force of five hundred armed men, who killed between ten and twenty blacks in a day of fighting. When the ballots were counted and the blood had dried, North Carolina had an overtly white-supremacist government that quickly consolidated its power, writing literacy tests for voters into the constitution and largely keeping blacks out of office until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.","916","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"In Barber’s telling, the Moral Mondays movement is trying to establish a Third Reconstruction: a new alliance of black voters with working-class whites, Latinos, other immigrants, and liberal élites to meld the formal equality of the civil-rights era (the Second Reconstruction) with economic opportunity and fairness. The state legislature, on the other hand, is hellbent on a Second Redemption, rolling back the right to vote and undercutting democratic representation through gerrymandering. Of course, these interpretations of history, morality, and constitutionality are not simply true or false. They are the kinds of things that become true when people start living as if they were.","917","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"I went to jail for the first time—not for long at all, and not in hard conditions—in June, 2013, for an act of peaceful civil disobedience that the Forward Together leadership had asked of its supporters. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggested that upward of a thousand North Carolinians would die that year because the state had refused the Medicaid expansion. I felt the need to amplify my objection in a way that a vote, an op-ed, or a political donation (at least one that an ordinary person can afford) doesn’t allow. Civil disobedience is the American idiom for that kind of objection, a respectful but emphatic way of raising the stakes.","918","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"As I presented my wrists for the police cuffs, my mind bristled with misgivings. I wasn’t comfortable with the movement’s religious language, which sometimes slid into a suggestion that the legislature was sinful and illegitimate. It troubled me to consider that the Tea Party legislators inside the building where we were protesting were equally sure that God, the Constitution, and history were on their side. I disliked the way that putting myself silently on the line for a movement indicated that I identified with it totally, when I could have ginned up a dozen demurrals just from the speeches I had heard that day. I felt, as I did at this year’s “march for love and justice,” that, really, justice would be enough. Love sounds good, but I’m not at all sure what it means in a political community, or whether I would like it there.","919","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"Then again, high-minded principles and dry realism have never been enough. American democracy depends on its austere legalists and cautious pragmatists, but also on those like Walt Whitman, an ecstatic prophet of democratic community as a kind of mystery and joy, and Frederick Douglass, who turned slave revolt into a mode of constitutional interpretation. Douglass, who claimed February 14, 1818, as his birthday, was the hero of Barber’s Valentine’s Day address this year: “A righteous troubler of America,” he was called. There is also something of Whitman’s sensually democratic mood in Barber, for whom words seem to carry a blend of idea and sensation. A feeling of being in something together is a great part of what the movement gives to its members—often in challenging ways, as gay activists end up literally side by side with traditional churchgoers. The great changes of the past sixty years—civil rights, feminism, and gay rights—have depended on hard-nosed reforms, but they are also unimaginable without new modes of sympathy and moral imagination, new ways of gaining strength from being together.","920","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"Of course, those of us who attend these rallies go home to fragmented worlds. Some of us will see one another on campus and at the food co-op. Others will meet at church, but I won’t see them—nor will most of the white Episcopalians see the black Baptists, or vice-versa. Without common institutions, such as the unions we don’t have here, the urban spaces we mostly lack, and the integrated neighborhoods that are too few and far between, an episodic movement may be too thin and low-intensity to change political sensibility. If it only mobilizes what is already there, last November’s losses suggest that it will not be enough.","921","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/long-game-moral-march"
"President Obama gave one of his strongest speeches on Saturday, in Selma, Alabama, on the fiftieth anniversary of “Bloody Sunday”—the day of the violently suppressed march that helped lead to the Voting Rights Act, the climactic achievement of the civil-rights movement. Standing in early-spring sunlight on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Obama praised the American spirit of striving and self-renewal embodied in the moral and physical courage of the marchers: “What greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this, what greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?”","March 10, 2015","922","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"
"Obama’s hymn to the America of constant change is encompassing enough to include every generation, including that of the first black children of a President to grow up in residence at the White House (Malia and Sasha Obama were among the marchers in Selma last weekend). The speech was inspiring, at moments soaring, but, in a sense, the President didn’t need to give it. His presence on the bridge alongside Congressman John Lewis, who had walked at the forefront of the original march and taken the first blows from Alabama state troopers, was eloquence enough. Here was change—here was the picture of a nation, still imperfect, but more closely aligned with its highest ideals. Obama could have spoken as briefly as when Lincoln said, “The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.” Between Gettysburg and Selma there’s a straight line of history and ideas and sacrifice.","923","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"

"A week after Bloody Sunday, President Lyndon Johnson addressed a joint session of Congress, as well as seventy million Americans watching on television. He urged Congress to pass a voting-rights bill, the second piece of landmark civil-rights legislation in less than a year. It was the greatest speech of his Presidency, and one of the greatest by any President. “I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy,” Johnson began, and from there he kept raising his aim, comparing Selma to Lexington and Concord and Appomattox, to the great turning points in American history. “There is no Negro problem,” he said. “There is no Southern problem. There is no Northern problem. There is only an American problem. And we are met here tonight as Americans—not as Democrats or Republicans—we are met here as Americans to solve that problem.” Johnson said that if America won all its wars and doubled its wealth and journeyed to the stars but failed to solve this problem, “we will have failed as a people and a nation.” He declared that the scene before him gave hope in American democracy: “For the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great government—the government of the greatest nation on earth.”","925","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"
"“All the majesty of this great government”—imagine that phrase being uttered without irony on Capitol Hill today. Or “the outraged conscience of a nation,” or “And we shall overcome.” Imagine a President addressing a joint session of Congress on an issue of such moment and framing it in such starkly moral terms, knowing that he could count on some solid support from the opposition leadership. Amid the cheers and applause, some senators and congressmen sat stone-faced, but no one shouted, “You lie!” Articles of impeachment were not drawn up. Southern committee chairmen didn’t invite George Wallace to come to Congress and rebut President Johnson, as Speaker Boehner recently invited a foreign leader to come embarrass President Obama.","926","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"
"As brutal as the Alabama state police and the Dallas County sheriff’s department were on Bloody Sunday, as violent as the vigilantes were who killed Jimmie Lee Jackson, James Reeb, and Viola Liuzzo in those weeks, as much progress as America has made in fifty years, something has gone seriously backward since 1965: the quality of American institutions. The flap over the historical accuracy of Johnson’s portrayal in the film “Selma” obscured this larger truth. “The real hero of this struggle is the American Negro,” Johnson told Congress, but the context for Selma was a country of functioning institutions. Martin Luther King, Jr.,’s desperate strategy was to dramatize white racism to such a degree that the institutions would have to respond.","927","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"
"There may still be ordinary Americans as brave and committed to justice as the civil-rights movement’s foot soldiers, but we no longer have a national government (or a federal bench, a press corps, labor unions, businesses, religious groups, universities) capable of coming together with the imagination, wisdom, and self-restraint necessary to achieve something on the scale of voting rights. These days, Congress can hardly keep the Department of Homeland Security open without tearing itself to pieces. As Charlie Dent, a Republican representative from Pennsylvania, said to the Times, “We really don’t have two hundred and eighteen votes to determine a bathroom break over here on our side.”","928","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"
"On Monday, forty-seven Republican senators addressed an open letter to the Iranian leadership, declaring that “we will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.” The senators noted that Obama will leave office in 2017, while many of them will go on serving for decades—so why should the clerics pay any attention to the executive branch? The senators didn’t release classified U.S. intelligence on the nuclear negotiations, but it’s not altogether clear what stopped them. They’re doing all they can to sabotage their own country’s position in the talks, practically making themselves the de facto ally of hardliners in Tehran. Try to imagine such actions by America’s elected leaders during the Cold War.","929","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-america-has-lost-since-selma"
"It may be that the postwar decades, with a booming mixed economy, middle-class prosperity, and an agreed-upon enemy, created unique conditions for Americans to address some of the country’s deepest problems, such as a century of Jim Crow. Our problems today, from climate change to economic inequality, seem immovable not because they’re so much harder, but because we no longer have the political tools to budge them. Perhaps that’s why, last Saturday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, President Obama spoke more about the daring spirit of the American people than the greatness of constitutional democracy. If solutions arise from this generation and the next, they seem unlikely to come from Washington.

"Actually, that wasn’t the only topic she covered. To begin with, she thanked the United Nations for hosting the conference and putting women’s issues at the fore, and reminded everyone of her past work in that arena. “Twenty years ago, this was a lonelier struggle,” she remarked to the scores of reporters arrayed in front of her, recalling when, in 1995, she travelled to Beijing and spoke at the fourth World Conference on Women.","932","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"If the former Secretary of State and First Lady was nervous, she didn’t let it show. She spoke forcefully and unhurriedly. “I want to comment on a matter in the news today,” she said. But, once again, it was a feint. This time, she upbraided the forty-seven Republican signatories to a newly released open letter, addressed to Iranian leaders, that questions President Obama’s authority to reach an agreement to restrict Iran’s nuclear capabilities. The Republicans were either trying to be helpful to the Iranians or harmful to the Commander-in-Chief, Clinton noted. “Either answer does discredit to the letter’s signatories,” she said.","933","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"Finally, she addressed the issue that had occasioned the press conference: the revelations that, during her four years as the nation’s top diplomat, she eschewed an official e-mail account and, instead, used a personal account that fed all of her correspondence through a server located at the Clinton family home in Chappaqua, New York.","934","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"","935","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"There were four things that she wanted to tell the American public, Clinton said. First, “I opted for convenience to use my personal e-mail account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails, instead of two,” she said. “Looking back, it would have been better if I’d simply used a second e-mail account and carried a second phone, but at the time this didn’t seem like an issue.”","936","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"Was that an explanation, an apology, or both? Could she not have maintained two accounts on one device? Rather than stopping to parse, Clinton offered her second point: that the vast majority of her work e-mails were sent to the official accounts of her colleagues and were, therefore, captured on the State Department’s server. Third, she pointed out that, after she left office and the State Department asked her and other former officials to send them copies of any personal e-mails related to her job, “I responded right away and provided all my e-mails that could possibly be work-related.”","937","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"Now we were getting to the heart of the matter. Shortly before Clinton spoke, David Gergen, a former communications adviser to Bill Clinton and other Presidents, suggested, from his perch at CNN, that she should “surprise everyone” by promising to hand over the family server and to submit to an independent review process, in which a respected third party would go through all of the server’s contents and decide if it contained anything else that should be forwarded to the official archives. “I think concrete steps are going to go a lot further,” Gergen said, referring to the expected verbal statements.","938","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"On the face of it, that seemed like sound advice. But it turned out to be advice that Clinton wasn’t in a position to take. “We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work-related e-mails and deliver them to the State Department,” she said. “At the end, I chose not to keep my private personal e-mails.” Why so? The messages she jettisoned were “about planning Chelsea’s wedding or my mother’s funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends, as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.” She added, “No one wants their personal e-mails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy.”","939","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"It took a few seconds for me to grasp what Clinton was doing: she was attempting to appeal to voters’ sense of fair play, over the heads of her opponents and the media. Not only did she have no intention of handing over more e-mails but the material had been deleted months ago, or so it seemed, without any outside review.","940","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"Winding up her prepared remarks with her fourth point, Clinton said that, by handing over all of her work e-mails to the State Department and asking for them to be made public—the latter step she took last week—she had done something unprecedented. And, finally, she repeated that the whole imbroglio had come about in an innocent fashion. “I thought using one device would be simpler,” she said, “and obviously it hasn’t worked out that way.”","941","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"Once the question-and-answer session started, the reporters, some of whom had queued up for hours to obtain U.N. credentials, were understandably eager for more details about the deleted e-mails. She said that there had been about sixty thousand e-mails on the personal server in total, and that about half of them were deemed work-related and half of them personal. You didn’t need to be a mathematician, or an investigator for Congressman Darrell Issa (who over the weekend suggested that Clinton could face criminal charges if she failed to coöperate fully with congressional investigators), to appreciate that about thirty thousand e-mails hadn’t been turned over to the State Department.","942","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"“Those e-mails were not in any way related to my work,” Clinton repeated. “I have absolute confidence that the State Department has everything work-related,” she later added. Once she received the request from the department, she said, she had instructed her staff to carry out a thorough investigation, telling it to “err on the side” of disclosing anything that could possibly have been related to her official duties.","943","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"And that was about that. Toward the end, Clinton engaged in some back-and-forth about whether she had obeyed the State Department’s rules, and whether her private e-mail server was vulnerable to security threats. She insisted that she had obeyed the rules, and said that her server was secure. “I did not e-mail any classified material to anyone,” she added.","944","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"

"It remains to be seen whether the public agrees. Practically everyone I have spoken with believes that Clinton set up her private e-mail system not just as a matter of convenience but in order to exert control over what eventually became public.

They will also continue to demand that she turn over her e-mail server, just in case there’s anything left on it that should be preserved. Her supporters will point out, as she did, that previous Secretaries of State, including Colin Powell, also used personal e-mail accounts, and they will accuse the critics of being conspiracy theorists.

"The Supreme Court oral argument on Wednesday in King v. Burwell featured thousands of words, dozens of provocative questions, two engaged and skillful lawyers—and one very striking silence. Chief Justice John Roberts, usually among the most active questioners on the court, scarcely said a word throughout the highly anticipated clash. The justices besieged Solicitor General Donald Verrilli and Michael Carvin, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, who are challenging a central provision of Obamacare, with so many questions that Roberts gave the pair ten extra minutes a side. The chief himself didn’t take up any of that time until practically the last moment.","March 4, 2015","948","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"Roberts’s one question may turn out to be extremely important. The issue in the case is whether the Obama Administration, in implementing the Affordable Care Act, violated the terms of that law. The plaintiffs assert that the A.C.A. only authorizes subsidies for individuals who buy health insurance on the fourteen state-run exchanges, or marketplaces. Under their reading of the law, the eight million or so people in the other thirty-six states who currently buy their insurance from the federal marketplace should be denied their subsidies. Most of the justices’ questions dealt with the issue of how to read the law correctly, but Roberts, in his single substantive question, took a different tack.","949","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"

"Anthony Kennedy had asked about “Chevron deference,” a doctrine of law that describes how much leeway the executive branch should have in interpreting laws. Verrilli, not surprisingly, said that the Chevron doctrine gave the Obama Administration more than adequate permission to read the law to allow subsidies on the federal exchange. “If you’re right about Chevron,” Roberts said, at long last, “that would indicate that a subsequent Administration could change that interpretation?” Perhaps it could, Verrilli conceded.","951","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"The question suggests a route out of the case for Roberts—and the potential for a victory for the Obama Administration. Roberts came of age as a young lawyer in the Reagan Administration, and there he developed a keen appreciation for the breadth of executive power under the Constitution. To limit the Obama Administration in this case would be to threaten the power of all Presidents, which Roberts may be loath to do. But he could vote to uphold Obama’s action in this case with a reminder that a new election is fast approaching, and Obamacare is sure to be a major point of contention between the parties. A decision in favor of Obama here could be a statement that a new President could undo the current President’s interpretation of Obamacare as soon as he (or she) took office in 2017. In other words, the future of Obamacare should be up to the voters, not the justices.","952","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"Roberts’s silence was the most unpredictable part of the argument. Carvin spoke first, and all four Democratic appointees —Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan—battered him with hostile questions about his reading of the law. Based on their questions, and their voting patterns, they look extremely likely to vote to uphold the law in its current form. In a similar vein, Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito went after Verrilli in a way that left little doubt about their sympathies. (Clarence Thomas, who has not asked a real question since 2006, can be assumed to be on their side as well.)","953","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"Alito is often the most clever questioner among the justices, and his intelligence and savvy were on display today as well. Verrilli and his allies have argued strongly that chaos would follow if the federal subsidies were struck down. Millions, they say, would lose their insurance virtually overnight. Alito offered a plan to alleviate that problem, if only for a little while. “Would it not be possible to stay the mandate until the end of the tax year,” he asked Verrilli, to avoid “very disruptive consequences”? Delaying the effect of a Supreme Court decision striking down the mandate would shift the political pressure away from the Court and toward Congress and the states. For colleagues (especially Roberts), who worry about the court as a focal point of partisan anger, Alito’s plan might offer hope.","954","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"For his part, Scalia looks ever more like a Fox News justice, who seems to get his talking points from popular culture rather than from the law. In response to Verrilli’s claim that millions would lose health insurance if the plaintiffs win, Scalia asked, in all seriousness, “You really think Congress is just going to sit there while all of these disastrous consequences ensue?… Congress adjusts, enacts a statute that takes care of the problem. It happens all the time. Why is that not going to happen here?” This is the point that several Republican members of Congress have made in recent weeks—“Sure! We’ll fix Obamacare!” As any half-aware student of the contemporary Congress knows, there is no chance at all—none—that this Congress will amend or improve the Affordable Care Act to save subsidies.","955","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"As for Anthony Kennedy, who is often described as the swing vote on this court, he offered hope to both sides. He seemed to suggest that the plaintiffs’ version of the law would impose undue obligations on the states—a favorite theme in Kennedy’s jurisprudence. At other points, however, he expressed sympathy for Carvin’s reading of the law, namely that it allowed subsidies only to those on the state-based exchanges. At a minimum, the votes of Roberts and Kennedy seem like they are in play—and that may be the best the Obama Administration could have hoped for at the outset of the day.","956","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/did-john-roberts-tip-his-hand"
"“That doesn’t sound very sensible,” Ashton Carter, the next Secretary of Defense, said when Senator Kelly Ayotte asked him, at his confirmation hearings, about the advisability of transferring any of the prisoners now at Guantánamo Bay to Yemen, given the disorder in that country. “I appreciate that,” Ayotte replied. She probably did. Ayotte is one of the Republican Senators who have fought hard to keep Guantánamo open, and Carter was about as reassuring for her on that count as an Obama nominee could be. (She tweeted out his not-sensible comment.) Perhaps it’s a feint—the wise nominee avoids a debating match—but, for anyone who hoped that the President might actually fulfill his commitment to close Guantánamo before he left office, it was a discouraging afternoon.","February 5, 2015","957","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ashton-carter-want-close-gitmo"

"The Secretary of Defense matters to the process because, under a law that Congress passed in one of its headlong efforts to keep the prison open, he is required to certify that any prisoner who is to be transferred is no risk of engaging in terrorism, or that the risk has been largely mitigated. It’s an elastic clause, given that it’s hard to see the future, and could be used to shut down efforts to empty the camp. Earlier this week, Chuck Hagel, the outgoing Defense Secretary, told Barbara Starr, of CNN, “Not everyone at the White House has agreed with me … probably on the pace of releases.” (Starr: “Have you had pressure?” Hagel: “We’ve had a lot of conversations.”) Ayotte jumped on that report in her questioning of Carter:","959","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ashton-carter-want-close-gitmo"
"It could be, again, that there were few good ways to answer that question—that it would be hard for Carter to declare himself ready for manipulation. But a hint that there might be moral pressure, not just Presidential impatience, to transfer prisoners who, in some cases, were cleared for release years ago without ever being charged with anything, would have been welcome. And one didn’t get it from Carter, who has a reputation for being more hawkish than Obama all around (and particularly on Syria). He’d had an earlier chance, too, when Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, asked him, “Can you talk to us about how you might resist such pressure if you receive it from the White House?”","960","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ashton-carter-want-close-gitmo"
"“I sure can,” Carter said. “I call it straight. I have an obligation under the law with respect to the risk … and I intend to discharge that responsibility in a very straight-up way.” When Cotton asked about Miranda rights and whether Carter would transfer a captured ISIS prisoner to the U.S., Carter said, “It would be a legal determination about where he ended up and so forth, but I think, from a Secretary of Defense’s point of view, would be, let’s get that intelligence.” It could, again, have been worse; he might have decried Miranda warnings. But a nod to the devastating revelations of the recent Senate report on the C.I.A.’s detention practices, in which military personnel and resources were at times implicated, would not have been misplaced in that exchange.","961","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ashton-carter-want-close-gitmo"
"What is most striking may be what Carter did with an opening that a Democrat gave him. Martin Heinrich, of New Mexico, asked about “waste” and “the fiscal impact” of Guantánamo, which, he noted, had cost taxpayers an average of about half a billion dollars for each of the past five years—more than three million dollars per detainee, annually. “That compares to about seventy-eight thousand dollars we use to house hardened criminals in the Florence, Colorado, super-max prison.” Couldn’t prisoners be kept in a more “fiscally responsible setting”? Carter began, “Senator, I understand the cost numbers you’re citing. They broadly correspond to what I understand,”and then said,","962","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ashton-carter-want-close-gitmo"
"There are prisoners for whom it is as “plain as day” that incarceration somewhere, for the rest of their lives, is necessary. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who has admitted to being a planner of the 9/11 attacks, is in that category. But he is an easy case—if his is the question of Guantánamo, it’s not so difficult to solve, conceptually, even if the Republicans have made it politically hard. Men like him have been convicted before, and sent to super-max prisons. Indeed, at the same time Carter was puzzling about where these people could possibly go, Zacarias Moussaoui, also known as the “twentieth hijacker,” was back in the news, reminding anyone who has forgotten that he was tried and convicted in a civilian court and has spent the past decade in the very Florence super-max that Cotton mentioned. (Lawyers for the victims of the attacks were visiting Moussaoui to question him about Saudi funding of Al Qaeda, as part of a civil suit.) They are just not the typical Guantánamo prisoners.","963","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ashton-carter-want-close-gitmo"
"There are a hundred and twenty-two prisoners at Guantánamo. (The Miami Herald has a good breakdown of who they are.) Fifty-four of them—two-fifths of the total—have been cleared for release or transfer. Again, in some cases, they were cleared long ago; one of the last to be released had been captured under foggy circumstances, as a teen-ager, and waited half a dozen years after being cleared. He was then sent to Estonia. (More than forty are from Yemen—hence Ayotte’s question.) The government seems to think that it has evidence to bring military-tribunal proceedings against another thirty-three or so—though its efforts at prosecution have been painfully slow and, at times, risible. Civilian courts have a far stronger record of convicting terrorists. Then there are thirty-five who have come to be called “forever prisoners.” Sometimes they are referred to as people who “can’t” be tried; in truth, there is nothing stopping a trial but the fear of an acquittal or whatever might emerge in testimony. (Torture, perhaps.) The government is not willing to charge them with any crime, but it is too cautious, scared, or just embarrassed—without a trial, it’s hard to say which one—to release them.","964","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ashton-carter-want-close-gitmo"

Until around 1990, many big countries had cut themselves off from global capitalism and the opportunities it provides for the transmission of capital and knowledge. Today, Eastern Europe, China, India, and, increasingly, parts of Africa are all active players.

The British Empire, which at one point covered almost a quarter of the world’s land, was built on cotton, coal, iron, and steel—the industries of the industrial revolution.

In Iraq, the United States is now relying on an enemy, Iran, to take the fight on the ground to the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham, which in the grand scheme of things is a nuisance to the United States, rather than an existential threat.

At least a decade ago, as Asia’s importance to the world economy increased, smart officials in Washington came to realize that this situation couldn’t continue indefinitely, and that if the Bank and the I.M.F. were to maintain their influence they would have to be reformed, with China, India, and other Asian countries playing bigger roles.

(To be sure, Hugh Carey, Cuomo’s predecessor as governor, also deserves a good deal of credit; he helped manage New York through the great fiscal crisis of the late nineteen-seventies.)","991","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"
"Koch, a New York parochialist from his toenails to his bald dome, would surely rest content with being lionized on his home turf. But Cuomo, the erudite son of Italian immigrants who operated a grocery store in the South Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, had higher aspirations—or so it seemed when you listened to his speeches. If not exactly a philosopher king, he was a politician with a broad, progressive vision. Even in the moments when he departed from that vision—for example, trimming spending to tackle the deficit or building prisons to hold New York’s swelling population of convicted felons—he never gave up on it; at least, not in his own mind.","992","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"
"Cuomo’s most famous speech, of course, is the one that he delivered at the 1984 Democratic Convention, in San Francisco, in which he addressed Ronald Reagan directly, saying, “Mr. President, you ought to know that this nation is more ‘A Tale of Two Cities’ than it is just ‘a shining city on a hill.’ ” The speech helped generate a decade of fevered speculation about whether Cuomo would run for President. But he had laid down his ideological marker the previous year, 1983, in his inaugural speech as governor, which included this defining passage:","993","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"
"As Cuomo readily pointed out, his governing philosophy, which he described as “progressive pragmatism,” wasn’t new, or even particularly partisan. It was the philosophy of Democrats like Franklin D. Roosevelt, Robert Wagner, and Hugh Carey, but also of Fiorello LaGuardia, John Lindsay, and Nelson Rockefeller, three liberal Republicans. (Lindsay eventually became a Democrat; LaGuardia and Rockefeller didn’t.)* “For more than fifty years, without dramatic deviation, whatever Party has been in power, New York has proven that government can be a positive force for good,” Cuomo reminded his audience that night in 1983.","994","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"
"What is noteworthy about Cuomo’s progressivism, and what will insure his place in the history books, is the moral urgency and scholastic intensity with which he defended and articulated it. In an era when Ronald Reagan was busy lambasting welfare moms, Keynesian economics was on the defensive, and many ambitious young politicians in his Cuomo’s Party were depicting themselves as “New Democrats” who had discovered the virtues of low taxes and free enterprise, Cuomo spoke up for the struggling and the excluded. In his 1984 convention speech, for example, though it was his reference to Dickens’s 1859 novel that stole the headlines, it was the paragraphs leading up to that bon mot which gave Cuomo’s message its ageless appeal:","995","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"
"To be sure, these were only words. In a political environment where, to this day, capital is mobile and many ordinary voters balk at paying higher taxes, Cuomo wasn’t immune to the political currents—sometimes they swept him along. During his twelve years in Albany, he increased state spending on things like education and health care, but he also engaged in a big prison-building program and cut taxes on several occasions, usually at the prodding of Republicans in the legislature. (His son Andrew has gone further in the direction of the New Democrats, capping property taxes and proposing budget cuts.) And, after the voters turfed him out, the liberal lion moved to Sutton Place, where he took up his long-abandoned law career, as he put it, “representing wealthy people, trying to make them wealthier.”","996","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"
"Cuomo wasn’t a saint, nor was he a great builder or policy innovator. But if he didn’t create a new template for progressives he stood up doggedly for the old one, which included many things—such as creating anti-poverty programs and investing in public infrastructure—that had fallen out of fashion. And this in itself was a historic achievement. Milton Friedman once remarked that the role of economists is to “develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.” Cuomo was no economist, but he helped to preserve a great political tradition that goes back to the New Deal and even beyond, to the Progressive era. Today, with issues of inequality and social exclusion once again dominating the political agenda, and with a mayor in City Hall who got there, in part, by borrowing his line about “Two Cities,” Cuomo’s legacy is secure.","997","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mario-cuomos-legacy"

"Jean McConville had just taken a bath when the intruders knocked on the door. A small woman with a guarded smile, she was, at thirty-seven, a mother of ten. She was also a widow: her husband, Arthur, had died eleven months earlier, of cancer. The family continued to live in Divis Flats—a housing complex just off the Falls Road, in the heart of Catholic West Belfast—but had recently moved to a slightly larger apartment. The stove was not connected yet, so Jean’s daughter Helen, who was fifteen, had gone to a nearby chip shop to bring back dinner. “Don’t be stopping for a sneaky smoke,” Jean told her. It was December, 1972, and already dark at 6:30 P.M. When the children heard the knock, they assumed that it was Helen with the food.","999","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Four men and four women burst in; some wore balaclavas, others had covered their faces with nylon stockings that ghoulishly distorted their features. One brandished a gun. “Put your coat on,” they told Jean. She trembled violently as they tried to pull her out of the apartment. “Help me!” she shrieked.","1000","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"“I can remember trying to grab my mother,” her son Michael told me recently. He was eleven at the time. “We were all crying. My mother was crying.” Billy and Jim, six-year-old twins, threw their arms around Jean’s legs and wailed. The intruders tried to calm the children by saying that they would bring their mother back: they just needed to talk to her, and she would be gone for only “a few hours.” Archie, who, at sixteen, was the oldest child at home, asked if he could accompany his mother, and the members of the gang agreed. Jean McConville put on a tweed overcoat and a head scarf as the younger children were herded into one of the bedrooms. The intruders called the children by name. A couple of the men were not wearing masks, and Michael realized, to his horror, that the people taking his mother away were not strangers—they were his neighbors.","1001","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Divis Flats had been constructed in the late nineteen-sixties, in one of those fits of architectural utopianism that yield dystopian results. A “slum clearance” program had razed a neighborhood of narrow, overcrowded nineteenth-century dwellings, replacing them with a hulking complex of eight hundred and fifty units. To Michael McConville, Divis’s warren of balconies and ramps seemed like “a maze for rats.” By 1972, it had become a stronghold for the Irish Republican Army, which was waging an escalating guerrilla battle against the British Army, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and loyalist paramilitary groups. A nineteen-story tower stood on one edge of Divis. It was one of the tallest buildings in Belfast, and the British Army had established an operational post on the top two floors. Because this aerie was in the middle of enemy territory, there were times when the British could get to it only by helicopter. From the rooftop, British snipers traded fire with I.R.A. gunmen below. Michael and his siblings had grown accustomed to the reverberation of bombs and the percussion of gun battles. On bad nights, the children dragged their mattresses off the beds and away from the windows and slept on the floor.","1002","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The I.R.A. had disabled the elevators at Divis to hamper British patrols, so the masked gang hustled Jean and Archie McConville down a stairwell. When they reached the bottom, one of the men pointed a gun at Archie’s face, so close that he could feel the cold barrel on his skin, and said, “Fuck off.” Archie was just a boy, outnumbered and unarmed. He reluctantly ascended the stairs. On the second level, one of the walls was perforated with a series of vertical slats. Peering through the holes, Archie watched as his mother was bundled into a Volkswagen van and driven away.","1003","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The disappearance of Jean McConville was eventually recognized as one of the worst atrocities that occurred during the long conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles. But at the time no one, except the McConville children, seemed especially concerned. When Helen returned home, she and Archie went out to look for Jean, but nobody could—or would—tell them anything about where she had been taken or when she might be back. Some weeks later, a social worker visited the apartment and noted, in a report, that the McConville children had been “looking after themselves.” Their neighbors in Divis Flats were aware of the kidnapping, as was a local parish priest, but, according to the report, they were “unsympathetic.”","1004","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Rumors circulated that McConville hadn’t been abducted at all—that she had abandoned her children and eloped with a British soldier. In Belfast, this was an incendiary allegation: Catholic women who consorted with the enemy were sometimes punished by being tied to a lamppost after having their heads shaved and their bodies tarred and feathered. The McConvilles were a “mixed” family; Jean was born Protestant and converted to Catholicism only after meeting her husband. The family had lived with Jean’s mother, in a predominantly Protestant neighborhood in East Belfast, until 1969, when they were driven out, as internecine tensions sharpened. They sought refuge in West Belfast, only to discover that they were outsiders there as well. Several weeks after the abduction, on January 17, 1973, a crew from the BBC visited the apartment and taped a segment. As the younger siblings huddled on the sofa—pale children with downcast eyes, looking shy and frightened—the reporters asked Helen if she had any idea why her mother had left. “No,” she said, shaking her head. Agnes McConville, who was thirteen, noted, hopefully, that her mother was wearing red slippers when she was taken away. She added, “We’ll keep our fingers crossed and pray hard for her to come back.”","1005","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"But there was reason to believe that something terrible had happened to Jean McConville. About a week after she was kidnapped, a young man had come to the door and handed the children their mother’s purse and three rings that she had been wearing when she left: her engagement ring, her wedding ring, and an eternity ring that Arthur had given her. The children asked where Jean was. “I don’t know anything about your mother,” the man said. “I was just told to give you these.” When I spoke to Michael recently, he said, “I knew then, though I was only eleven years of age, that my mother was dead.”","1006","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"His siblings were not so quickly convinced. The act of “disappearing” someone, which the International Criminal Court has classified as a crime against humanity, is so pernicious, in part, because it can leave the loved ones of the victim in a purgatory of uncertainty. “You cannot mourn someone who has not died,” the Argentine-Chilean writer Ariel Dorfman once observed. Helen and Archie reported Jean’s abduction to the police, but in the files of the Royal Ulster Constabulary there is no record of any investigation at the time. McConville’s body did not turn up. And so some of the children held out hope for years that they had not been orphaned, and that their mother might suddenly reappear. Perhaps she had developed amnesia and was living in another country, unaware that she had left a whole life behind in Belfast. But, as decades passed without word, these fantasies became increasingly difficult to sustain. For all the gnawing irresolution, there was one clear explanation. Michael’s sister Susan, who was eight when Jean was taken, told me that she knew, eventually, that her mother was dead, because otherwise “she would have found her way back to us.”","1007","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"After several months of fending for themselves, the McConville children were separated by the state, and the younger ones were dispersed to different orphanages. The older ones found jobs and places to live. The siblings saw each other infrequently and never spoke of what happened to their mother. One by-product of the Troubles was a culture of silence; with armed factions at war in the streets, making inquiries could be dangerous. At one point, a posse of boys from the youth wing of the I.R.A. beat Michael McConville and stabbed him in the leg with a penknife. They released him with a warning: Don’t talk about what happened to your mother. As the children grew older, they occasionally saw their former neighbors around Belfast, and recognized individuals who had come to the apartment that night. But, as Archie McConville told me, “you can’t do nothing. They walk past you like nothing happened.”","1008","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Then, in 1994, the I.R.A. declared a ceasefire. Gerry Adams, the bearded revolutionary who was the president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Republican movement, had entered into peace negotiations with the British government, attempting to persuade the I.R.A. to abandon armed resistance and tolerate a continued British presence in Northern Ireland. As Tim Pat Coogan observes in the 2002 edition of his book “The I.R.A.,” a peace deal would be visionary, but also highly risky for Adams, because “his life would not be worth a cent should it be thought that he was selling out the ‘armed struggle.’ ” Through perseverance and political savvy, Adams succeeded, and in 1998 he helped create the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to the Troubles. As the peace process got under way, the I.R.A. agreed to help locate bodies that its members had buried in hidden graves during the seventies.","1009","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Though Adams is the most famous face of the Irish Republican movement, he has long denied having been a member of the I.R.A. He maintains that he never played any operational role in the violence of the Troubles, and that he confined himself to the leadership of Sinn Fein. As the chief Republican delegate involved in peace negotiations, however, he was obliged to confront the matter of forced disappearances, and he met on several occasions with the McConville children. Adams himself grew up in a family of ten children, and he conveyed his sympathies to the McConvilles. “There is no doubt the I.R.A. killed your mother,” he said. He told them that he did not know who had authorized the killing or carried it out, or where Jean McConville was buried. But he pledged to investigate.","1010","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Michael McConville told Adams that he wanted an apology. Adams parsed his words with precision. “For what it’s worth, I’ll apologize to you,” he said. “It was wrong for the Republican movement to do what they did to your mother.”","1011","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The first person to speak publicly about involvement in the disappearance of Jean McConville was a former I.R.A. terrorist named Dolours Price. In 2010, Price revealed in a series of interviews that she had been a member of a secret I.R.A. unit called the Unknowns, which conducted clandestine paramilitary work, including disappearances. Price did not participate in the raid on the McConville house, but she drove Jean McConville across the border into the Republic of Ireland, where she was executed. McConville, Price claimed, had been acting as an informer for the British Army, providing intelligence about I.R.A. activity in Divis Flats. The order to disappear her came from the Officer Commanding of the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional I.R.A.—the man who held ultimate authority over the Unknowns. According to Price, the Officer Commanding was Gerry Adams.","1012","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Dolours Price liked to tell people that Irish Republicanism was in her DNA. As a little girl in Belfast, she sat on the knee of her father, Albert, and listened to stories about how, as a teen-ager in the forties, he had taken part in an I.R.A. bombing campaign in England. Her aunt Bridie Dolan, who lived with the family, had been horribly disfigured at twenty-seven, after accidentally dropping a cache of gelignite in an I.R.A. explosives dump. The blast blew off both of her hands, and permanently blinded her. “It was never a case of ‘Poor Bridie,’ ” Dolours’s younger sister Marian told the journalist Suzanne Breen, in 2004. “We were just proud of her sacrifice. She came home from hospital to a wee house with an outside toilet, no social worker, no disability allowance, and no counselling. She just got on with it.” Bridie was a chain smoker, and Dolours and Marian would light cigarettes and insert them between her lips.","1013","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"By the late sixties, Dolours was a striking and impetuous teen-ager, with a moon face, blue-green eyes, and dark-red hair. She and Marian attended teacher-training school, but she gravitated to radical politics, taking part in civil-rights demonstrations and travelling to Milan to give a talk on “British repression” at the headquarters of a Maoist political group. Tensions had persisted in Northern Ireland since 1920, when the Irish War of Independence led to the partition of the island, ultimately resulting in an independent republic of twenty-six counties in the south and continued British dominion over six counties in the north. The I.R.A. had its origins in that conflict, and after partition the organization devoted itself to trying to force the British to withdraw altogether. Catholics in the north were subjected to rampant discrimination in housing and jobs, and, with the advent of the Troubles, in 1969, these tensions exploded in violence. New paramilitary groups loyal to the British Crown were emerging, including the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defense Association, and that January loyalist mobs attacked civil-rights protesters as they marched from Belfast to Derry. In August, a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary fired a machine gun into Divis Flats, killing a nine-year-old Catholic boy, Patrick Rooney—the first child to die in the Troubles. The R.U.C. raided the Price house repeatedly during this period, suspicious of Albert Price’s I.R.A. connections. In 1971, the British reintroduced the controversial tactic of “internment”—imprisoning indefinitely, and without trial, anyone suspected of Republican activity. But the policy backfired, radicalizing a new generation of recruits to the Republican cause. The Provisional I.R.A., a more aggressive offshoot of the official I.R.A., began preparing for a sustained guerrilla campaign. Dolours Price set out to join the Provisionals.","1014","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Historically, women had enlisted in the I.R.A.’s female wing, known as the Cumann na mBan (Irishwomen’s Council). Dolours Price’s mother and grandmother had both been members of this group. But Dolours did not want to bandage men’s wounds, she said—she wanted to be “a fighting soldier.” The leadership of the Provisional I.R.A. convened a special meeting to consider her case, and, in August, 1971, Price became the first woman admitted to full membership in the I.R.A. She was twenty.","1015","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Marian soon joined her in the I.R.A. Dolours later said, “I should be ashamed to admit there was fun in it in those days.” People are often drawn to radicalism by a sense of community and shared purpose. In this case, there was also glory. I.R.A. members referred to themselves not as soldiers or terrorists but as “volunteers”—a signal that they were prepared to sacrifice their lives for the cause.","1016","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Educated, attractive young women had not been seen carrying guns on the rubble-strewn streets of Belfast before, and the Price sisters acquired an iconic glamour. “They were sassy girls,” Eamonn McCann, a longtime friend of the sisters, told me. “They weren’t cold-eyed dialecticians or fanatics on the surface. There was a smile about them.” One press account described them as “pretty girls who would finish their school work and then take to the streets armed, one or both hiding an Armalite rifle under their raincoat, to take part in gun battles with the British army.” The sisters became the subject of sexualized lore, with stories circulating about Marian, in a miniskirt, charming her way past a British Army checkpoint while driving a car full of explosives. At the time, there was a shopping center in Belfast called Crazy Prices, and, inevitably, the sisters became known as the Crazy Prices. Another friend of the sisters told me that Dolours was drawn to the I.R.A., in some measure, by “rebel chic.”","1017","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"During this period, Dolours crossed paths with Gerry Adams. He was a former bartender from Ballymurphy, a lean young man with sharp cheekbones and black-framed eyeglasses. Like Dolours, he had grown up in a Belfast family deeply rooted in the I.R.A. It is believed that Adams joined the organization as a teen-ager, in the mid-sixties. Several former I.R.A. volunteers confirmed to me that Adams was a member of the group, and a photograph taken at a Belfast funeral in 1970 captures him wearing the black beret that was an unofficial uniform of the organization. In March, 1972, the British government interned Adams on the Maidstone, a British prison ship, but in June he was released so that he could represent an I.R.A. delegation in secret peace talks with the British. Dolours and Marian Price picked him up and drove him into Belfast to rejoin the Republican leadership. (The talks were unsuccessful.) A U.S. diplomatic cable in January, 1973, reported that Adams was “an active Belfast military commander.”","1018","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Nevertheless, Adams did not carry out operations. In a 2010 documentary, “Voices from the Grave,” Dolours Price recalls, “Gerry didn’t allow himself to be in the presence of guns, or in any situation that would put him at risk of arrest.” Instead, he deputized operational work to his close friend Brendan Hughes, a compact man with bushy black eyebrows and a shock of black hair. Hughes, who was known as the Dark, brought military cunning to the job, along with a measure of glee. He lived “from operation to operation,” he said later. “Robbing banks, robbing post offices, robbing trains, planting bombs, shooting Brits, trying to stay alive.” To Dolours Price, Hughes seemed like “a giant of a man.” He inspired fierce loyalty from his subordinates, because he fought alongside them and “asked no volunteer to do what he would not do himself.”","1019","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Hughes had been a merchant seaman before joining the I.R.A., and one day a sailor he knew showed him a brochure for a new assault rifle from America—the Armalite. “We all fell in love with this weapon,” Hughes recalled. The Armalite was ideal for urban warfare: lightweight and powerful, with a retractable stock that made it easy to conceal. According to Hughes, Adams dispatched him to New York to procure Armalites, using a network of sympathetic arms dealers. Hughes devised an ingenious plan to ship the guns back to Ireland. In 1969, the Queen Elizabeth 2 began making stately transatlantic crossings between Southampton and New York. The ship had a crew of a thousand; many of them were Irish, and some secretly worked for Brendan Hughes. And so a ship named after the Queen of England was used to smuggle weapons to the I.R.A. On Belfast’s streets, graffiti heralded the guns’ arrival: “God made the Catholics, but the Armalite made them equal.”","1020","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"For much of the sixties, the I.R.A. had just a few dozen members, and was therefore easy to track. Now there were hundreds of recruits; more sophisticated tactics, with the advent of the Provisional I.R.A.; and new leaders, like Adams. The British authorities were caught off guard. When Brendan Hughes became active in the I.R.A., his father destroyed the family’s photographs of him, so that British forces could not identify him by sight. Similarly, pictures of Adams were so rare that, for a time, the British authorities could not say for sure what he looked like. In Adams’s autobiography, “Before the Dawn,” he describes British troops capturing his dog, Shane, and taking him for a walk on a leash, in the hope that he might lead them to his owner. Adams and Hughes became targets of assassination, and they perpetually moved among safe houses, counting on support from the community in West Belfast. Armored personnel carriers roamed the Falls Road and helicopters hovered overhead; local residents removed street signs to disorient British patrols, and rattled the lids of trash bins to sound the alarm. While Hughes and his men were fleeing soldiers in a foot chase, a front door might suddenly open, allowing them to duck inside. When Adams moved around the city during this period, he later wrote, he “avoided streets where there were stretches without doors.”","1021","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In 1972, the British Army launched a clever operation. It set up a washing service called Four Square Laundry, issued coupons offering steep discounts, then sent a van into Catholic neighborhoods to pick up and drop off clothes. The coupons were color-coded, so the clothing could be subjected to forensic testing for traces of gunpowder or explosives, and then correlated with delivery addresses to identify houses that were being used by the I.R.A. The Four Square operation was exposed after the I.R.A. interrogated one of its members, Seamus Wright, and discovered that he had been working as a double agent for the British. Gunmen strafed the Four Square van, killing the driver; according to the I.R.A., they also killed two men who were hiding in a secret compartment under the roof. Dolours Price then drove Wright and one of his colleagues—a seventeen-year-old named Kevin McKee, who was also discovered to have been a traitor—into the Republic, where they were executed, and secretly buried, in the fall of 1972.","1022","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"After I.R.A. leaders learned that the British were cultivating double agents, they established a unit to identify “touts”—informers—and other disloyal elements. Jean McConville moved to Divis Flats as this climate of paranoia was taking hold.","1023","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"One day when Michael McConville was a young boy, his father brought home two pigeons. Michael was allowed to keep them in “a wee box” in his room, he told me, and his father fostered an interest in pigeon racing. After the family moved to West Belfast, Michael and his friends began stalking derelict houses where pigeons roosted. Whenever he found a bird, he peeled off his jacket and cast it like a net over the animal, then smuggled it home under his sweater, adding it to his burgeoning fleet. West Belfast was a hazardous place for an adventurous kid, but Michael had no fear, he told me: “Most boys didn’t, being brought up in a war zone.” On one occasion, he scaled the façade of an old mill only to discover a unit of British soldiers encamped inside. Startled, they trained their rifles on him and bellowed at him to climb back down.","1024","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"“You had no respect for the law, because all’s you seen is brutality,” Michael recalled. “The soldiers getting men against the wall, kicking their legs spread-eagle. That’s what put the seed in a lot of kids’ heads to join the I.R.A.” He sighed. “I don’t think the British had much of a clue about what they were starting.”","1025","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Michael is fifty-three, slight and taciturn, with clipped gray hair, flushed cheeks, and his mother’s pursed mouth. When I visited him last summer, at the bright, modern house that he built in a rural area a short drive from Belfast, he showed me a framed photograph of his mother. It’s a famous image, the only surviving photo of Jean McConville: a grainy shot from the sixties taken outside the family’s old house, in East Belfast. Jean smiles tentatively at the camera, her dark hair pulled away from her face, her arms crossed. Three of her children are perched on a window ledge beside her, while Arthur crouches, grinning, in the foreground. Arthur was older than Jean; he had fought the Japanese in Burma during the Second World War. When their first child, Anne, was born, in 1954, Jean was only seventeen.","1026","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"After Arthur died, it was a struggle to feed ten children, even with his Army pension. “She just wasn’t coping,” Michael said, adding that she had a nervous breakdown. When I brought up the claim that his mother was an informer, Michael asked, with indignation, “When would she have had the time?” She was constantly on her feet, he said, cooking stews or washing clothes on a scrubbing board in the kitchen sink. After Arthur’s death, Jean’s attention to cleaning took on a compulsive intensity. Because one child or the other was forever losing a button or needing some other repair, she always had a large blue safety pin—a “nappy pin,” Michael calls it—fastened to her clothes. It was her defining accessory.","1027","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Not long before Jean McConville was taken away, she raised the suspicions of her neighbors. She and the children were home one night when they heard a man moaning in pain outside their front door. Jean cautiously opened the door and discovered a wounded British soldier sprawled on the landing. He had been shot. Jean tended to him, and brought him a pillow. “That’s just who my mother was,” Michael said. “She would have helped anyone.” The next day, someone painted the words “Brit Lover” on the front door. Jean had a brother, Tom, who sometimes visited from East Belfast. According to Susan and Archie, he occasionally came to Divis outfitted in an orange sash, the traditional Unionist symbol; to make such a provocation in a West Belfast Catholic neighborhood was an act of suicidal folly. Nevertheless, Jean had converted to Catholicism, and her children were Catholic. At the time of her abduction, her oldest son, Robert, was interned in prison for suspected activity in the Official I.R.A.","1028","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Jean McConville’s one indulgence was a weekly outing to play bingo. One night, she was interrupted during the game by someone who told her that one of her children had been injured and that a car was waiting outside to take her to the local hospital. Several hours later, British soldiers discovered her wandering through the streets, barefoot and disoriented. Apparently, she had been detained by an armed group and then released. Her face was swollen and badly bruised—she had been beaten. When the soldiers brought her home, “she was talking in riddles,” Michael recalled. The children couldn’t figure out what had happened to her. They made her tea, and she smoked one cigarette after another.","1029","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"When his mother was taken away the second time, and did not return, Michael said, “There was no one to look after us. I kept getting put in different homes, but each time I would run away.” He recalled an orphanage where monks walked through the dormitory at night with a roving flashlight, taking boys from their beds. Michael was not abused himself, but his younger brother Billy, who was sent to a Catholic orphanage in Kircubbin, recently told a panel investigating past abuses that he had been sexually molested. Michael eventually ended up at a facility that was surrounded by a ten-foot electrified fence. “It was the best home I ever had,” he told me. A kind nun took an interest in him, and he started to pull his life together. He met his wife, Angela, when he was sixteen. He has had a steady career installing tiles, and, unlike several of his siblings, has avoided the ravages of drugs and alcohol. He and Angela have four children, and he boasted about them a bit. “I’ve tried my best, given the life I had, to do well with the kids,” he said.","1030","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In South Africa, after the fall of apartheid, the government initiated a process of “truth and reconciliation.” So that a thorough record of past abuses might be compiled, perpetrators were offered immunity from prosecution in exchange for honest testimony. In Northern Ireland, where roughly thirty-six hundred people were murdered during the Troubles and some forty thousand wounded, there has been no comprehensive accounting. A recent report by Amnesty International criticizes the “piecemeal” investigations of historical abuses, and suggests that, “across the political spectrum, it is those in power who may fear that they have little politically to gain—and possibly much to lose—from any careful examination of Northern Ireland’s past.” In 1999, with the encouragement of Bill Clinton, the British and Irish governments established the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims’ Remains, and the I.R.A. agreed to identify the graves of nine people who had been murdered and secretly buried during the Troubles, but only after securing a promise that no criminal prosecutions would result. The I.R.A. declared that some of the disappeared had been informers, including Jean McConville. Michael and his siblings angrily rejected this characterization, yet they had little choice but to work with the I.R.A. to search for her remains.","1031","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Much of the Irish landscape is dominated by peat bogs; the anaerobic and acidic conditions in the densely packed earth mean that the past in Ireland can be subject to macabre resurrection. Peat cutters occasionally churn up ancient mandibles, clavicles, or entire cadavers that have been preserved for millennia. The bodies date as far back as the Bronze Age, and often show signs of ritual sacrifice and violent death. These victims, cast out of their communities and buried, have surfaced vividly intact, from their hair to their leathery skin. The poet Seamus Heaney, who harvested peat as a boy on his family’s farm, once described the bogs of Ireland as “a landscape that remembered everything that had happened in and to it.”","1032","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In the summer of 1999, Jean McConville’s daughter Helen learned, through two priests who were serving as intermediaries, that the I.R.A. had identified the place where her mother’s body could be found: a stretch of windswept coastline outside Carlingford, in County Louth, on the east coast of the Republic. As backhoes prepared to tear up the soil, Helen convened her siblings around a table. It was an awkward reunion. Many of them had not seen one another in years. Edgy and fractious, their grief still palpable, they were now in their thirties and forties but looked older; their faces were haggard, and the hands and forearms of the men were etched with blotchy, blue-black tattoos. When Jean’s children spoke of her, even to one another, they had a tendency to refer to her as “my mother.”","1033","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"

"For fifty days, the backhoes excavated, creating a crater the size of an Olympic swimming pool. The family’s sense of anticipation eventually gave way to despair: the I.R.A. had apparently been mistaken. “They made a laughingstock of us” when Jean was kidnapped, Agnes said, her mascara dissolving in tears. “They’re making another laughingstock of us now.” The search was called off, and the children returned to their homes. One of the men who had abducted Jean now drove a black taxi up and down the Falls Road. Occasionally, Michael hailed a cab and climbed inside only to discover this man behind the wheel. Michael never said anything—he couldn’t. He rode in silence, then handed the man his fare.","1038","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"One afternoon in March, 1973, a woman answered the telephone at the headquarters of the London Times and heard a man reciting, in a soft brogue, the descriptions and locations of several cars that were parked in the city. “The bombs will go off in one hour,” he said.","1039","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"It was two o’clock. Officials at the Times reported the call to the police while several reporters headed toward the closest bomb, which, according to the caller, was inside a green Ford Cortina parked outside London’s Central Criminal Court, the Old Bailey. By two-thirty, police had arrived on the scene. A hundred-and-twenty-pound bomb lay underneath the car’s back seat. They called in the bomb squad and burst into an adjacent pub, The George, ordering the startled patrons to evacuate. A school bus had just deposited forty-nine children not far from the Cortina, and an inspector shouted at the teachers to get them out of the area.","1040","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Plans for a coördinated bombing of central London had originated several months earlier, at a secret meeting in Belfast. The I.R.A. had planted hundreds of bombs in Northern Ireland, but Dolours Price, remembering her father’s bombing campaign in Britain during the forties, had argued for a bolder operation. In a 2012 interview with the Telegraph, she recalled, “I was convinced that a short, sharp shock, an incursion into the heart of the empire, would be more effective than twenty car bombs in any part of the north of Ireland.” Dolours attended the strategy meeting, along with her sister Marian and Brendan Hughes. According to both Dolours Price and Hughes, the meeting was run by Gerry Adams. Generally, the I.R.A. issued warnings before its bomb blasts, in order to minimize civilian casualties. But sometimes these warnings did not allow sufficient time for escape: in July, 1972, twenty bombs were detonated in a single day in Belfast, killing nine people, an episode that became known as Bloody Friday.","1041","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"“This could be a hanging job,” Adams told the group, explaining that if the perpetrators were caught they could be executed for treason. “If anyone doesn’t want to go, they should up and leave now.” Several people did so, but the Price sisters remained, and a team of ten was eventually selected to carry out the I.R.A.’s first bombing mission in England in thirty years. Although Dolours was only twenty-two, she was chosen to run the mission. She was, in her own words, the Officer Commanding “of the whole shebang.” The team was sent into the Republic for several weeks of weapons training. Cars were stolen at gunpoint, in Belfast, then repainted and sent to Dublin, where they were fitted with English license plates and shipped by ferry across the Irish Sea. Shortly before the day chosen for the attack, Price and her team filtered into London and checked into hotels.","1042","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The plan was to plant the bombs in four locations in the morning, with timers set to detonate simultaneously that afternoon. By 7:30 A.M., all four cars were in position. The bombs were set to blast at 2:50 P.M. By then, if everything went according to plan, the bombers would have caught a flight back to Ireland.","1043","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"But, unbeknownst to Price and her team, British authorities had an I.R.A. informer who had given them advance warning of the attack. Police had been instructed to be extra vigilant, and shortly after one of the bombs was planted, in a Ford Corsair outside Scotland Yard, a passing officer noticed that the number plate on the car did not match the year of the vehicle. Upon further inspection, police discovered the bomb in the back seat—and defused it. British officials, knowing that the bombers were likely trying to escape the country, issued an emergency directive: “Close England.”","1044","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In the departures lounge at Heathrow Airport, police spotted a group of young people waiting to board a flight to Dublin. A dark-haired woman in a long coat appeared to be giving orders. It was Dolours Price. When police questioned her, she told them that her name was Una Devlin. An officer showed her an early edition of the Evening News, with a banner headline about the bomb discovered at Scotland Yard. She stared at it silently. In her handbag, police found, along with “a large quantity of makeup,” a spiral notebook with several pages ripped out. When experts examined the indentations on the pages underneath, they discovered traces of a diagram that depicted the circuitry of a timing device. Dolours was arrested, as was Marian Price; at the subsequent trial, the detective who interrogated Marian recalled that, at precisely 2:50 P.M., “she raised her wrist and looked very pointedly at her watch, and smiled at me.”","1045","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Police explosives experts did not arrive at the Old Bailey until two-fifty, and could not defuse the bomb before it detonated. The blast shattered windows, blew a crater in the ground, and sent glass and twisted metal flying. A bomb in Westminster also went off. These two explosions injured more than two hundred people, and one man died of a heart attack. “There was no intention to kill people with the London bombs,” Hughes remembered. Dolours Price was less apologetic. “There were warnings phoned in, but people had stood about,” she said years later. “Some had even stood at office windows and been sprayed by broken glass when the car went up.” She added, “In Belfast, we gave fifteen-minute warnings. In London, we’d given them an hour.”","1046","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The trial of the Old Bailey bombers took place in Winchester Castle, outside London, and lasted ten weeks. It was a sensational event, with the press drawn especially to the Price sisters; the Irish Times described them showing up in court each day “sprucely dressed” and adopting defiant poses. On the stand, Dolours was almost smug, insisting that she knew nothing of the operation. When a prosecutor asked about the timing device depicted in her notebook, she feigned confusion, mugging for the spectators—“He lost me.” Asked about her politics, she was less evasive, saying, “I would like to see the removal of the border and the establishment of a democratic Eire.”","1047","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Eight bombers were convicted and received double life sentences. As the verdict was read aloud, they jeered at the judge, proclaiming their loyalty to the I.R.A. They also announced their intention to launch a hunger strike. As Padraig O’Malley points out in his 1990 book, “Biting at the Grave: The Irish Hunger Strikes and the Politics of Despair,” fasting as a form of protest had a history in Ireland dating back to pre-Christian times. In 1903, W. B. Yeats wrote a play, “The King’s Threshold,” about a poet in seventh-century Ireland who launches a hunger strike at the gates of the royal palace. Yeats describes: “An old and foolish custom, that if a man / Be wronged, or think that he is wronged, and starve / Upon another’s threshold till he die, / The common people, for all time to come, / Will raise a heavy cry against that threshold.”","1048","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In 1920, Terence MacSwiney, an Irish politician who had been imprisoned in Brixton on charges of sedition, died after a seventy-three-day hunger strike. His case attracted international attention, and tens of thousands of people filed past his coffin after his death. “It is not those who inflict the most but those who suffer the most who will conquer,” MacSwiney had said.","1049","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"When the Price sisters and several of their co-defendants began refusing food, they had clear demands. They wanted to be granted political-prisoner status and transferred to Northern Ireland so that they could serve their sentences closer to their families. “Each day passes and we fade a little more,” Dolours wrote, in a letter. “But no matter how the body may fade, our determination never will.” Most parents would panic at the thought of a daughter, barely out of her teens, announcing her intention to starve herself to death. But the Prices could situate this gesture within a proud tradition of dissent. Albert, after visiting his daughters, told the press, “They are happy. Happy about dying.”","1050","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The British authorities, recognizing that they would face a crisis if one of the Price sisters perished, force-fed them daily. “Four male prison officers tie you into the chair so tightly with sheets you can’t struggle,” Marian later explained. “You clench your teeth to try to keep your mouth closed, but they push a metal spring device around your jaw to prize it open.” Guards then inserted a wooden clamp with a hole in the middle, and slid a tube through the hole. “They throw whatever they like into the food mixer,” Marian continued. “Orange juice, soup, or cartons of cream if they want to beef up the calories.” By January, 1974, people who visited Dolours expressed horror at her physical deterioration: she had lost a great deal of weight, her skin had turned waxen, and her hair had gone white at the roots. Her teeth had come loose under pressure from the clamp.","1051","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"It was an impossible situation for the British government, which began to be attacked for force-feeding the Prices, though the sisters were otherwise likely to die. The standoff took a bizarre turn when thieves stole the Vermeer painting “The Guitar Player” from a museum in Hampstead, and, in ransom notes, threatened to burn it—“with much cavorting in the true lunatic fashion”—if the Price sisters were not moved to Northern Ireland. The Prices’ mother, Chrissie, told the press that Dolours, “who is an art student,” had pleaded that the Vermeer remain undamaged. (It was eventually returned, unharmed.)","1052","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In May, 1974, the British government, under increasing public pressure, agreed to stop force-feeding the Prices. The sisters began losing a pound a day and, according to one medical assessment, were “living entirely off their own bodies.” Finally, Roy Jenkins, the British Home Secretary, assured the Prices that they could eventually be moved to Armagh prison, in Northern Ireland. That June, after two hundred and five days, they abandoned the strike. A transfer was secretly approved the following spring.","1053","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"

"Within an hour, they had landed in Northern Ireland. The Price sisters were overjoyed to be home but distressed about the timing of their arrival. In the preceding months, both their mother, Chrissie, and their aunt Bridie Dolan had died. The sisters had unsuccessfully petitioned for compassionate release to attend their mother’s funeral. Chrissie Price’s casket was carried through the streets of Belfast. The piper leading the procession was a young girl dressed in the black beret and dark glasses of the I.R.A.","1057","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In “On the Blanket,” a history of hunger strikes during the Troubles, Tim Pat Coogan notes that the decision to stop force-feeding the Prices had profound consequences, because the British government was effectively signalling that “henceforth any prisoner on hunger strike would be allowed to die.” In 1981, the hunger striker Bobby Sands did die, followed by nine other prisoners. As he lay dying, Sands engaged in a fateful stunt: he ran for a seat in the British Parliament, representing Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and he won.","1058","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"During the seventies, Gerry Adams was in and out of jail. In addition to his 1972 internment on the Maidstone, he was confined for three years in Long Kesh prison, where he shared a cell with Brendan Hughes. At some point, Adams began to think that there were limits to what the I.R.A. could achieve through violence. After Sands won his seat, Adams’s close aide Danny Morrison announced that Sinn Fein would henceforth run candidates in elections. In a famous formulation, he said, “Will anyone here object if, with a ballot paper in this hand and an Armalite in the other, we take power in Ireland?” The strategy of “the Armalite and the ballot box” represented a departure for the Provisional I.R.A.: by running for positions in the British administration in Northern Ireland, Adams and his colleagues could be perceived as implicitly acknowledging the administration’s legitimacy. Adams replaced the woolly sweaters of a West Belfast revolutionary with the suits and ties of a politician. In 1983, he, too, was elected a Member of Parliament, representing West Belfast.","1059","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Dolours Price spent six years in Armagh. Although she and Marian were no longer refusing food, they continued to deteriorate physically. In the 2002 radio documentary, Dolours explained the psychology of a hunger striker: “If you eat, you’re going to lose. You convince yourself of that when you embark on a hunger strike. You have to convince yourself, because your body is telling you it wants food, and you’re telling your body, ‘No, you can’t have food. . . . We will not win this struggle if I give you food.’ ” After the Price sisters forced the British government to bend to their aims, they found it difficult to overcome the profound resistance they had developed to eating. “We both ended up with very, very, very distorted notions of the function of food,” Dolours said.","1060","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"By the spring of 1980, Marian had lost so much weight that she was released from prison, after Humphrey Atkins, Britain’s Northern Secretary, judged her “in imminent danger of death.” Dolours was relieved that her sister had escaped a life sentence, but she felt abandoned. “I got really depressed,” she said later. “It was like I’d been separated from my Siamese twin.” In a letter, she described the crushing inertia of her days, her energy depleted, her body numb: “I move as a clockwork doll.”","1061","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"A cache of papers recently declassified by the British government reveals that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was closely watching the case of Dolours Price. Initially, Thatcher was unmoved. In one memo, she speculated that Price would rejoin the I.R.A.—“I doubt whether her old friends will let her alone when she is out”—and reminded her subordinates that the London bombing had caused a man’s death. (According to an autopsy, the heart attack that killed the man had actually begun before the bomb detonated.) In April, 1981, Tomas O Fiaich, an Irish cardinal, visited Price in Armagh, and reported to Thatcher. “From being a vivacious girl . . . she has become, at thirty, a gaunt spectre, prematurely aged and deprived of any further desire to live,” he wrote. He begged Thatcher for clemency, stressing that “even next week may be too late.” When Price entered Armagh, in 1975, her weight was a hundred and fourteen pounds. By the time the cardinal saw her, she weighed seventy-six pounds. Thatcher authorized her release.","1062","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Dolours Price did not rejoin the I.R.A. Instead, she moved to Dublin, where she avoided publicity and tried to establish a career as a freelance journalist. She began dating the actor Stephen Rea, whom she had met during the civil-rights protests of the sixties. Rea was a brooding, shaggy-haired Belfast Protestant who was sympathetic to the Republican cause. In 1980, he had helped establish Field Day, an Irish theatre troupe. Rea and Price were married at Armagh Cathedral in 1983. When asked about being married to a convicted terrorist, he would say, “That’s my wife’s past. . . . She doesn’t apologize for that, and I’m not going to apologize for her.”","1063","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Rea never had a formal relationship with the Republican movement, but he did have a bizarre connection to Gerry Adams. After a series of I.R.A. bombings in the late eighties, the Thatcher government announced a bafflingly misguided policy, which held that, on British television, the voice of anyone believed to be advocating paramilitary action must be muted. Actors were hired to dub interviews and speeches, and for years a small stable of Irish actors found occasional employment as the voice of Gerry Adams. One of the actors was Rea.","1064","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The terms of Dolours Price’s release held that she must obtain permission from the British government if she wanted to leave Northern Ireland. But, her defiance unchecked, she proceeded to move with Rea to London. According to friends, Price relished the cheekiness of this relocation. England’s tabloids did as well, noting that the bomber of the Old Bailey was now “sipping champagne with stars at the National Theatre,” where Rea was directing a play. Price’s effrontery was brought to the attention of Thatcher, and she made no secret of her frustration. “If she and her husband wish to live together, they can live together in Northern Ireland,” she wrote. But no action was taken against the couple.","1065","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Eventually, Price and Rea had two boys, Danny and Oscar, and the family moved back to Dublin. (In interviews, Rea said that he did not want to bring up his sons in England.) One of Rea’s closest collaborators was the Irish filmmaker Neil Jordan, and in 1992 they released “The Crying Game,” in which Rea played the role for which he is perhaps most famous: Fergus, a decent and soulful man who happens to be a member of the I.R.A. In the story, Fergus is assigned to guard a kidnapped British soldier (played by Forest Whitaker) in the hours before his execution. They stay up all night, and Fergus develops a friendship with the soldier, hand-feeding him pieces of chocolate and comforting him when he cries, before taking him outside to be shot. While promoting the film, Rea said little about the fact that his wife had once occupied a similar role, guarding prisoners at gunpoint or driving them to their deaths. But in one later interview he discussed what it meant to be a member of the I.R.A., and described the “conundrum of people whose lives are a gesture.” Such people, Rea said, are often “not afraid of death, because your death is acceptable if you’re living for a cause.”","1066","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Belfast has ostensibly been at peace for two decades, but the city remains acutely divided. The borders between Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods are inscribed in the concertina wire and steel of the so-called “peace walls” that progress like fissures across the city. These towering structures maintain some degree of calm by physically separating the city’s populations, as if they were animals in a zoo. The walls are tagged with runelike slurs—K.A.T., for “Kill All Taigs,” a derogatory term for Catholics, on one side; K.A.H., for “Kill All Huns,” a reference to Protestants, on the other—and dwarf the squat brick houses and the unlovely council estates on either side, throwing them into shadow.","1067","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In one sense, the Troubles are over. The principal armed factions have long since decommissioned their weapons, and in most parts of Belfast it is safe to walk the streets. The city center is dominated by the same chain stores—Tesco, Caffè Nero, Kiehl’s—found in the other urban centers of Western Europe, and most residents will tell you that they want Belfast to become famous for something other than conflict. Several people informed me, with pride, that the local film-production facility, Titanic Studios, is where “Game of Thrones” is shot. One popular tourist attraction is the Troubles Tour, in which ex-combatant cabdrivers guide visitors to flashpoints from the bad years, decoding the ubiquitous murals that conjure famous battles, martyrs, and gunmen. The effect is to make the Troubles seem like distant history.","1068","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"But there are at least as many peace walls in Belfast today as there were at the time of the Good Friday Agreement. Residents still live in neighborhoods circumscribed by religion, and ninety-three per cent of children in Northern Ireland attend segregated elementary schools. Bus stops in some parts of the city are informally designated Catholic or Protestant, and people walk an extra block or two to wait at a stop where they won’t fear being hassled. I arrived in August, just after “marching season,” when Unionists commemorate the Battle of the Boyne and other bygone victories by lighting bonfires and staging belligerent marches. Hundreds of Union Jacks still fluttered in Protestant neighborhoods. Catholic areas were decked out with the Irish tricolor, and with Palestinian flags—a sign of solidarity and a signal that, even now, many Republicans in the north consider themselves an occupied people.","1069","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"

Tribalism and its trappings remain so potent in Belfast, Haass told me, that the various sides could not agree on how to govern the display of regalia. When the Belfast city council voted, in 2012, to limit the number of days that the Union Jack could be raised outside city hall, protesters tried to storm the building, and riots erupted throughout Northern Ireland, with Unionist demonstrators throwing bricks and petrol bombs.","1070","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"

"One morning, I visited Billy McKee, one of the founders of the Provisional I.R.A., in a small brick house in West Belfast. Born in 1921, five years after the Easter Rising, he joined the I.R.A. in the thirties, acquiring a reputation as a formidable combatant. When Brendan Hughes was a boy, the reverence in his family for Billy McKee was so deep that he felt he should “genuflect” every time he passed McKee’s house. McKee was said to be armed at all times, and on one occasion, in a back room after a funeral, Hughes contrived to brush up against him and felt a .45 concealed beneath his belt.","1073","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"McKee came to the door dressed in a dark suit, having just returned from Mass. His hair was white and spiky, in the style of Samuel Beckett. As a clock ticked loudly in another room, I asked about the disappearance of Jean McConville. McKee said that he played no role in the decision to kill her. He was in prison in 1972, and was ceding control of the I.R.A. to other leaders. But he insisted that killing McConville was the right thing to do, because she was a tout. “I would have had her executed and left her there,” he said, with a level gaze. “I couldn’t understand why they took her away to disappear her.”","1074","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"When I told him that I was curious about the people who were responsible for that decision, McKee scowled, worrying his dentures with his tongue, so that they slid from one side to the other. “What would happen if I knew and I told you, and they all got arrested?” McKee said. “I would be the axe man. I wouldn’t like to put my enemies in jail, never mind some of my friends.”","1075","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"I expressed surprise that, in a city like Belfast, where everybody knows everybody else, it was so difficult to solve a notorious murder. “I don’t think anybody’s stupid enough to mention names,” McKee said. Then he muttered, “Too dangerous.” He shuffled with me to the door, and said, “If you see any of my old friends, tell ’em I’m still breathing.”","1076","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"If McKee is an unreconstructed militant who speaks without equivocation about the role that he played in the armed struggle, Gerry Adams has in recent decades gone through a metamorphosis. As the peace process got under way, during the nineties, Adams continued the transformation of his public persona from international pariah to statesman and champion of peace. Today, he is a Member of the Irish Parliament, representing County Louth, and Sinn Fein is an ascendant political party both in Northern Ireland and in the Republic. Adams is widely credited, even by his detractors, with having played an instrumental role in ending the Troubles. Yet he still maintains that he was never a member of the I.R.A. “Everybody knows he was in the I.R.A., except for Gerry,” Michael McConville said. At the height of the Troubles, there was an obvious motive to deny the affiliation: a charge of “membership” in the I.R.A. was enough to send you to prison. With the advent of peace negotiations, there was a further incentive for Adams to distance himself from his armed comrades—British officials could deal with him and not risk charges that they were negotiating with a terrorist. But if Adams initially crafted a fiction out of political expediency, he chose to stick with it, even after some of his closest collaborators unburdened themselves. In 2001, Martin McGuinness, the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, admitted publicly that, in the early seventies, he had been the second-highest-ranking member of the I.R.A. in Derry. This acknowledgment does not appear to have hurt his political career; McGuinness has won three elections since 2001.","1077","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Adams is now sixty-six and a grandfather, and his evolution into an approachable grandee has found its surreal culmination on Twitter. He intersperses studiously boring tweets about small-bore political issues with a barrage of cat pictures and encomiums to sudsy baths, rubber duckies, and Teddy bears. (“I do love Teddy bears,” he told the BBC. “I have a large collection of Teddy bears.”) One characteristic tweet, from last January: “Dreamt I was eating Cream Eggs. Woke up this morn. Pillow & beard covered in chocolate & cream thingymebob.” The Irish writer Damien Owens has likened all this to “Charles Manson showing you his collection of tea cosies.” But, cumulatively, Adams’s tweets suggest the giddiness of a man who has defied some very long odds. In 1984, Adams told a reporter that he had a ninety-per-cent chance of being assassinated. Later that year, he was shot and nearly killed by loyalist gunmen, and during periods of captivity he was tortured by British authorities. Improbably, Adams survived the conflict—and, more improbably, he flourished.","1078","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The new Gerry Adams never completely eclipsed the old one, however, and this may have been a conscious choice. The journalist Fintan O’Toole once observed that the ambiguity of the Adams persona was essential to the peace process: in order to participate in the negotiations, Adams had to be accepted as a democratic politician; but, in order to deliver the desired result, he needed to exercise enough control over I.R.A. gunmen so that if he ordered them to lay down their weapons they would comply. Perhaps in the interest of preserving this flexibility, Adams perfected a dog-whistle style of political rhetoric. Asked about his role in the armed conflict, he has said, “I’m very, very clear about my denial of I.R.A. membership. But I don’t disassociate myself from the I.R.A.” Adams is beholden to multiple constituencies, and for some faction of supporters his charisma has always derived, at least in part, from the whiff of cordite. At a public event in Belfast in 1995, Adams was delivering a speech when someone shouted, “Bring back the I.R.A.!” Adams responded, “They haven’t gone away, you know.”","1079","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Traditionally, Irish journalists have shown surprising deference to Adams’s sophistry about his role in the armed struggle. To be sure, Adams has never been convicted of a violent crime, or of any I.R.A.-related offenses. But as a young man he often published essays in a Republican newsletter, under a pseudonym, and in 1976 he wrote, “Rightly or wrongly, I am an I.R.A. volunteer.” Even so, most press accounts simply recycled his denials, and, because the I.R.A. was so disciplined, none of his comrades spoke out to contradict him.","1080","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"During the peace process, however, many rank-and-file members of the I.R.A. felt surprised and betrayed when Adams accepted the legitimacy of a government in Northern Ireland that remained part of the United Kingdom. Many also questioned his willingness to surrender the weapons they had amassed. Some former volunteers became so disillusioned by Adams’s concessions that they broke the code of silence and told their stories to the press.","1081","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In 2001, Ed Moloney, a veteran reporter for the Irish Times and other newspapers, published a landmark revisionist account, “A Secret History of the IRA,” which stated explicitly that Gerry Adams had been a military commander responsible for the Belfast Brigade. Adams and Moloney had known each other for decades, and had enjoyed a cordial relationship during the Troubles, meeting occasionally in a back room on the Falls Road; Adams would make a pot of tea and Moloney would interview him. Once, after a long session in Moloney’s hotel room, Adams stayed and slept on the floor. But their relations had grown strained by the time “The Secret History of the IRA” was published, and Adams accused Moloney of “innuendo,” declaring, “I have not been and am not a member of the I.R.A.”","1082","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"As Moloney was preparing the book for publication, he was approached by administrators at Boston College about creating an oral-history project that would gather accounts by paramilitaries from both sides of the Troubles. The idea excited him. Many of the combatants were still alive, and their testimony could provide an unparalleled resource for future historians—an exception to the rule of omertà. Given the sensitivities, Moloney pointed out, each interview would have to be conducted in secret, and remain secret until the participant died. “These people could be shot if it was discovered they were talking to us,” he told me. “They were taking a huge risk.”","1083","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland were too insular and suspicious for graduate students with tape recorders to make headway, so Moloney suggested an unorthodox solution: finding interviewers who had participated in the Troubles. For the Unionists, Moloney suggested a loyalist named Wilson McArthur; for the Republicans, he proposed a former I.R.A. volunteer named Anthony McIntyre, who had spent seventeen years in prison for the murder of a U.V.F. man. McIntyre, who was Moloney’s friend and source, had obtained a college degree in prison, and had gone on to write a dissertation on the Troubles at Queen’s University in Belfast. He had a gruff, genial manner, and was at ease with retired revolutionaries, which suggested that they might open up to him, on tape, about secrets they had kept for decades. They did. “It was cathartic,” a former I.R.A. member named Richard O’Rawe said of his interview with McIntyre. “I cried like a baby.”","1084","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"This clandestine undertaking became known, to the people who were aware of it, as the Belfast Project. One of McIntyre’s subjects was the man still widely known around Belfast as the Dark: Brendan Hughes. They were close, having served together in prison. When I visited McIntyre and his wife, Carrie, at their home, in Drogheda, a small city between Dublin and Belfast, they showed me photographs of Hughes giving Carrie away at their wedding. McIntyre and Hughes shared a deep antipathy toward Gerry Adams. McIntyre disapproved of Adams’s engineering of the Good Friday Agreement, and his interview questions reflected this animosity. But Hughes required no prodding to express anger at Adams. He and Adams had been close collaborators for years, but when Adams proved willing to compromise on the question of a united Ireland, in the interest of a peace deal, Hughes was incensed: Adams had been his Officer Commanding, the man who gave him orders to kill. Adams’s denial of his own I.R.A. past left Hughes and others “to carry the responsibility of all those deaths.” Everybody knows that Adams was in the I.R.A., Hughes told McIntyre. “The British know it. The people on the street know it. The dogs know it.”","1085","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Terry Hughes, Brendan’s brother, told me that Brendan felt that he had been unforgivably misled. He had been fighting a bloody war against British rule while Adams was quietly laying the foundation for a peaceful compromise. “There was a master plan,” Terry said. “Unfortunately, Brendan wasn’t told.”","1086","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Hughes confided to McIntyre that he felt like “a patsy,” and insisted that he had “never carried out a major operation without the O.K. or the order from Gerry.” Adams, in the 1976 essay referring to his membership in the I.R.A., wrote about the moral decision to use violence, maintaining that “only if I achieve the situation where my people genuinely prosper can my course of action be seen . . . to have been justified.” The Good Friday Agreement did not deliver the ends that Hughes and others had counted on to justify the I.R.A.’s brutal means. Adams’s political turn forced his subordinates to reappraise the righteousness of their own killing.","1087","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Divis Flats was demolished in the nineteen-nineties, except for the tower where the British had their observation post. In the years after the Good Friday Agreement, Brendan Hughes lived alone in an apartment at the top of the tower. Demoralized by the things he had done, he spent his days chain-smoking by a picture window, looking out over Belfast, past the peace walls and church steeples to the shipworks where, a century earlier, the Titanic was built. “I always got the sense that he lived a large part of his life on that windowsill,” Carrie McIntyre said. “And he couldn’t either jump out and end it all or jump back in and start really living.”","1088","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The Divis apartment is where McIntyre interviewed Hughes about the killing of Jean McConville. “She was an informer,” Hughes said. “She had a load of kids.” Hughes told McIntyre that McConville’s children had been acting as spies for the British Army, “gathering information for her, watching the movements of I.R.A. volunteers around Divis Flats.” She was exposed, Hughes continued, when a radio transmitter was discovered in her flat. According to Hughes, the I.R.A. learned of the transmitter when one of the McConville children mentioned to one of Hughes’s men that “his mammy had something in the house.”","1089","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Hughes sent his men to confront McConville, and they took her away for interrogation. According to Hughes, she confessed to being a tout. The I.R.A. confiscated the transmitter and released her onto the streets. This could align with the night when Jean McConville was taken from the bingo parlor, but when I asked Michael McConville about the transmitter he told me that Hughes must be mistaken—because no such transmitter existed. He and his siblings knew every nook of their apartment; if Jean had hidden such a device on the premises, he would have found it. Michael also dismissed the idea that he and his siblings had been spies. In the oral history, Hughes says that, a few weeks after McConville’s interrogation, “another transmitter was put into her house and she was still coöperating with the British.” At this point, a decision was made to kill her, and a “special squad was brought in” to carry out the operation.","1090","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"“There was only one man who gave the order for that woman to be executed,” Hughes told McIntyre. “That fucking man is now the head of Sinn Fein.” At the time, he continued, a senior I.R.A. official named Ivor Bell argued that they should leave McConville’s body on the street, just as Billy McKee would have done. But, according to Hughes, McConville’s gender would have generated bad publicity for the Provisional I.R.A., and so Adams pushed to disappear her. Recalling Adams’s subsequent meetings with the McConville children, Hughes said, “He went to this family’s house and promised an investigation into the woman’s disappearance. . . . The man that gave the fucking order for that woman to be executed! Now, tell me the morality in that.”","1091","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Hughes fell into a coma in 2008. Gerry Adams visited the hospital and sat, in silent vigil, by his bed. The two men had not spoken in years. Hughes had told friends, “There was a time in my life when I would have taken a bullet for Gerry. Now I’d put one in him.” When Hughes died, his casket was paraded through West Belfast, and thousands of people turned out, in frigid temperatures, to pay their respects. At one point, a figure in a dark overcoat shouldered through the crowd: Adams. He solemnly insinuated himself among the men bearing the coffin. “Brendan was a Republican icon,” Terry Hughes told me. “Gerry had no choice. He had to associate himself with that.”","1092","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Dolours Price also attended the procession. She, too, had split with Adams, and she wrote a scathing open letter, deriding him as a “lonely figure” who was “clearly uneasy” at the funeral of his former friend. If Adams could come clean about his past in the I.R.A., Price suggested, he might “feel better.” She noted that Adams had a habit of wrapping himself in the mantle of people who were no longer alive to snatch it back. At one point, Adams suggested that, had Bobby Sands survived, Sands would have supported the peace process. In an article, Price replied, acidly, “I often wonder who would speak for me had my circumstances in Brixton prison reached their expected conclusion. What praises would I be singing of the Good Friday Agreement?”","1093","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Price also recorded an oral history for the Belfast Project. When her life was a gesture—a headlong push for a united Ireland—it possessed a certain moral logic. But the Good Friday Agreement robbed her of that certainty. “Dolours was a woman who was deeply traumatized by what she had done,” McIntyre told me. Like many people who were drawn to the I.R.A., she saw herself as a member of the left, yet she had participated in forced disappearances—an atrocity, McIntyre pointed out, that is the “calling card of the war criminal, whether it’s in Chile or Kampuchea.”","1094","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In February, 2001, Price attended an I.R.A. event to commemorate the death of a hunger striker, and announced, in an impromptu speech, “Gerry Adams was my commanding officer.” She added that she had not endured “the pangs of hunger strike just for a reformed English rule in Ireland.” Shortly thereafter, McIntyre visited Price’s home, in the seaside town of Malahide, outside Dublin, where, surrounded by memorabilia from her I.R.A. days, they conducted a series of interviews. Price spoke about her role in the disappearances and, in particular, about her grief over the death of Joe Lynskey, a close friend of hers. Lynskey, who was known as the Monk—because he had trained for the Cistercian order before joining the armed struggle—was a brigade intelligence officer and an ardent believer in the mission of the Provisional I.R.A. In 1972, it emerged that he had been having an affair with the wife of another I.R.A. man, and had tried to have the man killed. The I.R.A. secretly sentenced Lynskey to death, and Price was told to drive him across the border to his execution. She picked him up at his sister’s house, on the pretext that he was being called to a meeting in the Republic. Lynskey walked out with a little overnight bag, as though he were leaving for a weekend in the country. As they drove south in silence, Price realized that Lynskey knew where they were going. He was a large man: he could have overpowered her. Instead, he sat there, meekly, with his bag in his lap. “She wanted him to get up and escape,” McIntyre recalled. When she handed him over, in County Monaghan, “Lynskey hugged her and told her not to worry.” His body has never been recovered.","1095","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Price informed McIntyre, before one of their recording sessions, that she wanted to go on the record about the role that she had played in the disappearance of Jean McConville. By this point, Price and McIntyre were good friends; she later became godmother to his son. “As a historian, I would love to get this,” McIntyre told her. “As your friend, I have to warn you. You have children. If you commit to being involved in the McConville disappearance, your children will bear the mark of Cain.”","1096","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"When I asked McIntyre whether Price said anything about Jean McConville on her recording, he chuckled ruefully, then shook his head. “I was disappointed,” he said. “She took my advice.”","1097","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"One day in the summer of 2003, a man walking on Shelling Hill Beach, near Carlingford, noticed a piece of fabric in the sand. He reached down to examine it and felt something hard: a human bone. When the authorities exhumed the remains, they found the skeleton of a middle-aged woman, still in her clothes. A forensic examination concluded that the cause of death was a “gunshot wound to the head.”","1098","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"At a nearby morgue, the children of Jean McConville were ushered into a room, one by one, so that they could examine the clothing, which was laid out on a table. Archie went in first, but he couldn’t bear to look. Instead, he asked a question: “Is there a nappy pin?”","1099","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"A police officer surveyed the garments and said no. Then he folded over a corner of fabric—and there it was. Thirty-one years after Jean McConville vanished, her body was found. She was buried in November, 2003. The streets of West Belfast were typically crowded with kids on bikes and people lounging in front of their homes. Someone who attended the funeral told me that, when the procession passed through, everything was eerily quiet, as if the locals had been told to stay away—as if they were shunning the McConvilles once again.","1100","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In an effort to challenge the allegation that Jean McConville was a tout, her children made a formal request to Baroness Nuala O’Loan, the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, to launch an inquiry into the case. Normally, British authorities would neither confirm nor deny whether an individual had worked for them as an informer, but O’Loan found that “the circumstances of the McConville family are most exceptional.” After consulting the files of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the British military, O’Loan produced an official report, in 2006, which held that McConville “is not recorded as having been an agent at any time.” In O’Loan’s judgment, McConville “was an innocent woman who was abducted and murdered.”","1101","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"At the time that the O’Loan report was released, the oral-history project at Boston College was a secret. But Price had been showing signs of increasing anxiety. In 2001, police raided her home and discovered several stolen prescription pads, an indication that she had been abusing prescription drugs. Her marriage to Stephen Rea ended in divorce, and her behavior became erratic. She showed up drunk at Maghaberry Prison and demanded to visit a hunger-striking inmate. She was accused of stealing a bottle of vodka from a supermarket. (In court, she blamed a “momentary lapse of concentration,” adding, with a flash of her old pride, that it was not in her “temperament or breeding” to shoplift.) Price began receiving treatment at a mental-health facility in Dublin.","1102","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"“One of the most remarkable aspects of the Troubles was that, with a few exceptions, the people that I know who did these terrible things were all perfectly normal people,” Ed Moloney told me. “This wasn’t some band of robbers who were thieving and raping for personal profit. This was war. They were all nice killers. I felt pity for them. They were victims of circumstances beyond their control.” Sometimes Price felt agonizing remorse for the lives she had ruined; on other days, she was defiant, even about McConville, insisting that the death sentence was appropriate for an informer in wartime. But, whatever her feelings of contrition, Price seemed intent on at least acknowledging her past acts.","1103","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"On February 21, 2010, the Belfast tabloid Sunday Life published a story linking Price to the disappearance of McConville. “In a taped confession, Old Bailey Bomber Dolours Price has admitted driving the mum-of-10 to her death,” the article reported, adding that Price claimed that the disappearance was “masterminded” by Gerry Adams. The paper quoted Michael McConville’s sister Helen calling for the arrest of Price and Adams. “It’s disgusting that the people involved in my mother’s murder are still walking the streets,” she said. “Adams and Price might not have pulled the trigger, but they are as guilty as the people who did.”","1104","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Adams issued an angry denial, observing that Price was “a long-standing opponent of Sinn Fein and the peace process,” and that she “clearly has her own issues to resolve.” But it was unclear whether Price had made this inflammatory disclosure directly to Sunday Life. The article’s author, Ciaran Barnes, wrote that he had listened to Price’s taped “confession” but did not say explicitly that she had made these disclosures to him. Instead, he asserted that Price had “made taped confessions of her role in the abductions to academics at Boston University.”","1105","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"By this time, the Boston College archive was no longer a secret. After the death of Brendan Hughes and of David Ervine, another participant in the oral-history project, Ed Moloney had written a book, “Voices from the Grave,” which was soon to be published. But the Sunday Life article contained the first public suggestion that Price had given an interview to Boston College. Moloney and McIntyre are both adamant that the tabloid was not given access to Price’s recording, and point to the mistaken reference to “Boston University” as proof. They also note that, in Price’s interview with Anthony McIntyre, she never speaks of Jean McConville. Moloney thinks that Sunday Life likely obtained a recording of an interview that Price had given to the Irish News, and that the mention of the oral-history project was a clumsy effort to launder the interview’s provenance. (Allison Morris, the journalist who interviewed Price for the Irish News, strongly denied this claim, saying, “The interview never left my office.” Ciaran Barnes said only that it would be “remiss of me to talk about my sources.”)","1106","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In March, 2011, the British government contacted the U.S. Department of Justice and explained that a criminal investigation had been initiated into McConville’s murder. Investigators at the Police Service of Northern Ireland wanted to consult the oral histories of Brendan Hughes and Dolours Price. If the I.R.A. had found McConville’s body, her case would have been covered by the immunity clause. But, because her remains were discovered by a civilian, the authorities were free to investigate—and bring charges. A subpoena was issued to Boston College, and in a legal filing the U.S. Attorney in Massachusetts declared, erroneously, that a Sunday Life reporter had been “permitted to listen to portions of Ms. Price’s Boston College interviews.” Moloney and McIntyre panicked. Turning over the interviews would not only violate the college’s promise to withhold an oral history until the subject’s death; it would also set a dangerous precedent. In an e-mail to administrators in Boston, Moloney wrote, “I would bet the mortgage that at this moment, there are teams of lawyers working in the bowels of the British government trying to discover ways to force B.C. to surrender the names of other possible interviewees.” The police simply could have asked Sunday Life for the recording, Moloney pointed out to me. In his view, they went after the Boston College archive because “they wanted to get the entire trove, for intelligence purposes.”","1107","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Moloney argued that there was a political aspect to the investigation. The police in Northern Ireland had made no serious effort to solve the McConville case until the notion arose that doing so might implicate Gerry Adams. Many police officers in Northern Ireland were former members of Special Branch and the Royal Ulster Constabulary—and for these men and women Adams was an arch antagonist. “At least in the back of their minds, there was the knowledge that we could get that fucker,” Moloney said. “All roads in that story were going to end at his door.” Tellingly, the British authorities hadn’t launched a broad-based inquiry into past atrocities on all sides; indeed, many appalling crimes committed by Unionist paramilitaries—and by state authorities—have not been investigated to this day. “They’re not digging up all the bodies,” Moloney said. “They’re being very selective.”","1108","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In August, 2011, a second subpoena was issued, seeking any interview in the archive that contained “information about the abduction and death of Mrs. Jean McConville.” A federal judge in Massachusetts ordered Boston College to hand over the material to the British government. John Kerry, who was then the chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, appealed to Attorney General Eric Holder and to Hillary Clinton, who was then Secretary of State, to push for the subpoenas to be withdrawn. He cited concerns about “the continued success of the Northern Ireland peace process.” Moloney and McIntyre fought the issue on appeal, eventually receiving a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court. But the Court declined to hear the case, and in September, 2013, Boston College turned eleven interviews over to authorities in Belfast.","1109","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Last April, Adams reported to a police station in Antrim and was arrested for questioning in connection with the death of McConville. After surrendering his belt, tie, comb, and watch, he was interrogated for four days. He proclaimed his innocence, blaming a “malicious, untruthful, and sinister campaign” against him. He also raised a concern about the timing of his arrest: Sinn Fein was involved in simultaneous campaigns for seats in the European Union and in local government elections. “Both Moloney and McIntyre are opponents of the Sinn Fein leadership and our strategy,” Adams said at a press conference after his release.

"At the press conference, Adams said that “the I.R.A. is gone—it’s finished.” But, during a Sinn Fein rally to protest his arrest, Bobby Storey—a close friend of his and a longtime Party operative with a thuggish reputation—alleged that there were sinister motives behind the investigation. Midway through the speech, Storey declared, “We haven’t gone away, you know.” During my time in Belfast, half a dozen people quoted that line to me, noting the presumably deliberate echo of Adams’s famous 1995 quote about the I.R.A. Storey “didn’t mean Sinn Fein hadn’t gone away,” McIntyre said. “He meant the I.R.A.” To Michael McConville, the message was clear: even after peace and decommissioning, the I.R.A. would brook no challenge to its leader. “It still rules by threats,” he said.","1111","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"By the time Adams was arrested, Dolours Price was dead. One day in January of 2013, one of her sons came home and discovered her in bed. “She wasn’t breathing,” he later told an inquest. Price had been drinking for several days, and had briefly been admitted to the hospital after falling down a flight of stairs. A medical examination found that she had died of a toxic combination of sedatives and antidepressants. Suicide was ruled out, but, when I asked Anthony and Carrie McIntyre if Price killed herself, Carrie said, “I believe it.”","1112","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"

"In Hughes’s oral history, he spoke to McIntyre about having been a hunger striker in prison. “The body is a fantastic machine,” he said. “It’ll eat off all the fat tissue first, and then it’ll eat the muscle, to keep your brain alive.” Long after Hughes and Price called an end to their strikes and attempted to reintegrate into society, they nursed old grudges and endlessly replayed their worst wartime abominations. They never stopped devouring themselves.

"The police did not charge Adams in the murder of McConville, and the investigation did not set back Sinn Fein: the Party did surprisingly well in the 2014 elections, winning more seats than expected. Today, it is the most popular political party in Ireland. According to polls, half the voters in Sinn Fein do not believe Adams’s claims about never having been a member of the I.R.A., but they do not appear to care. The beach where Jean McConville’s body was found is in Louth, Adams’s constituency in the Republic, yet Adams seems likely to retain the seat for as long as he wants it. In most countries, merely being implicated in a murder would be enough to derail a political career. But Adams has a knack for weathering scandals. During a trial in 2013, it was revealed that his brother Liam was a pedophile who had molested his own daughter, and that Adams had known but done little to intervene; last October, a woman named Maria Cahill alleged that she had been raped, as a teen-ager, by an I.R.A. man, and that Adams had failed to discipline the rapist. “I don’t know what the Irish word for Teflon is,” Richard Haass told me. “But he has it.”","1116","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In November, Adams flew to New York to give a speech to American supporters. In a vast hotel ballroom, the crowd whooped as he walked to the lectern. Adams has gleaming, outsized teeth, and I could make them out clearly from the back of the room. Standing in front of a banner bearing the words “United Ireland,” Adams spoke about the importance of American allies in ending “a very long war.” His voice is stentorian, and he speaks with schoolmasterly authority; he has the calm aura befitting a global celebrity who flies around the world advising armed factions and heads of state about how to make ceasefires stick.","1117","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Then, just as Adams was reminiscing about his first visit to the White House, in 1994, the brute in him came out. Speaking of the Irish Independent, which had been publishing critical stories about him, he observed that the paper had also been tough on Michael Collins, the Republican hero of 1916. And how did Collins deal with this affront? “He sent volunteers into their offices, held the editor at gunpoint, and destroyed the entire printing press.” The room, full of Irish-Americans, erupted in applause. Adams leaned into the microphone and murmured, “I’m obviously not advocating that,” prompting raucous, knowing laughter.","1118","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Michael McConville does not believe that Adams or anyone else will be brought to account for the murder of his mother. “We’re all adults here—we all know the score,” he told me. Several other people have been arrested for questioning in the case, but only one, Ivor Bell, has been charged. (Bell denies any involvement in McConville’s disappearance.) Bell reportedly gave an interview to the Boston College project, and if the case goes to trial prosecutors may use his recorded recollections—which he had offered for posterity, thinking that they would be sealed until after his death—against him. Bell’s lawyer, Kevin Winters, assured me that Bell “will fight the charges,” and it seems unlikely that the truth about McConville’s death will come out in any such proceeding. The physical evidence in the case is diffuse and decades old, so it would be difficult to sustain a conviction against any of the perpetrators. Because Dolours Price and Brendan Hughes are dead, they cannot testify against Adams; in legal terms, their interviews and oral histories amount to hearsay. Adams and his supporters have also gone to great lengths to attack the credibility of Price and Hughes. “Brendan was a friend of mine,” Adams told the Guardian, in 2011. “But Brendan had his issues and his difficulties. He was opposed to the peace process. He was politically hostile to what we were trying to do. Brendan said what Brendan said, and Brendan’s dead. So let it go.”","1119","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Adams is not wrong about the bitter resentment of his former comrades. Price once described her willingness to identify Adams as a former I.R.A. member as an effort to “settle scores.” Nevertheless, it’s hard to explain away the very specific, and similar, recollections that Hughes and Price shared about Jean McConville’s murder. When the journalist Darragh MacIntyre pressed Adams about McConville in a 2013 BBC documentary, “The Disappeared,” Adams, looking like a cornered animal, flashed a hostile grin and noted that Hughes and Price had “demons.” He added, vaguely, “All of us bear a responsibility, those of us who are in the leadership. I’ve never shirked that.”","1120","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Adams declined repeated requests to speak with me for this article, citing, through a representative, the “flawed” nature of the Boston College interviews, which focussed on testimony by “former Republicans who have accused Sinn Fein of betrayal.” He seems to have said his piece on the matter, and if no criminal charges are filed he may never be obliged to say anything further. (Adams continues to be forthcoming on other subjects. Last month, he informed an interviewer on Irish radio that he enjoys jumping on a trampoline. “I do it naked,” he said, adding that he is sometimes accompanied in this regimen by his dog.)","1121","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The question of whether or not Jean McConville was an informer will also likely remain unresolved. Michael McConville and his siblings are adamant that Brendan Hughes was mistaken about a transmitter being in the flat, and they doubt his claim that McConville confessed to being an informer. Helen once said, “If they were torturing her, she would have admitted to anything. What mother wouldn’t?”","1122","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Family members point to the O’Loan report, but the report says only that no official records were found to indicate that Jean McConville was an informer. If she was a low-level informer, such records might not exist. Moloney and McIntyre, who share an unshakable confidence in the credibility of Brendan Hughes, believe that the British government may also have suppressed the paper trail on McConville in order to conceal the fact that the Army allowed one of its confidential sources to be executed. In any case, the I.R.A. clearly believed that McConville was a tout, though that is no justification for what befell her. When McIntyre asked Brendan Hughes whether he regretted executing McConville, Hughes said that he had supported the decision at the time. “But not now,” he continued. “Because, as everything turned out, not one death was worth it.”","1123","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Ed Moloney observes that Adams’s cold-blooded detachment, which so maddened Price and Hughes, may have allowed him to imagine what they could not—a future beyond the armed struggle—and to create peace. Adams has many unkind things to say about Moloney, but Moloney believes that Adams should have won the Nobel Peace Prize. “Gerry’s a very hollow man,” Brendan Hughes’s brother Terry said, before adding, “But then maybe that’s politics.”","1124","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In the long run, the war may be won by demography. Sinn Fein has predicted that a Catholic majority will eventually preside in Northern Ireland, and the percentage of Catholics has increased in recent decades. But this doesn’t mean that the British will soon be voted off the island. After the 2008 fiscal crisis and the subsequent recession in Dublin, some polls found that most Catholics in the north prefer to remain part of the United Kingdom. “Outbreeding Unionists may be an enjoyable pastime for those who have the energy,” Adams has said. “But it hardly amounts to a political strategy.”","1125","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"For a small minority, the armed struggle never ended. I visited Belfast just before Christmas, and three different splinter factions of the I.R.A. were promising attacks in the city over the holiday. I had wanted to speak with Marian Price, but she was prevented by legal troubles: in 2013, she confessed to having provided a mobile phone that a Republican splinter group used to take responsibility for a shooting at an Army barracks; two British solders were killed in the attack.

He has refused, he told me, partly out of fear that his wife and children might become victims of reprisal. (He also refused to tell me any of the kidnappers’ names.) Several years ago, he had briefly considered identifying the perpetrators, but he says that when he told Adams of his intentions Adams replied, “I hope you are ready for the backlash.” (Adams has denied saying this.) The authorities offered to give Michael a new identity, and to move him and his family out of the country.

Michael opened one of the doors to reveal a wall lined with little cubbyholes, in which dozens of pigeons warbled and bobbed and shifted their feet. He keeps hundreds of pigeons now, and he races them competitively. “Through the whole Troubles, there was never any hassle between Protestants and Catholics raising pigeons,” he said, delicately cupping one of the birds in his hand.

"In 1974, the Ford Administration conducted nuclear talks with Iran. Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, heir to the Peacock Throne and an American ally, had asserted his country’s right to build nuclear power plants. Henry Kissinger and Brent Scowcroft sought a deal to reduce the risk that Iran could ever make an atomic bomb. They had to manage a restive Congress. A secret White House memo summarizing the problem noted that “special safeguards [that] might be satisfactory to Congress . . . are proving unacceptable to Iran.”","1135","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/a-calculated-risk"
"Ford’s talks failed, as did negotiations undertaken by the Carter Administration. In 1979, the Shah fell to the Iranian Revolution. Ayatollah Khomeini, believing that nuclear weapons were un-Islamic, initially put Iran’s program on ice. After Khomeini’s death, in 1989, his successors bargained, smuggled, and dissembled, and by 2009 they had installed enough equipment to make a bomb within a few years. This was President Obama’s inheritance. After six years of diplomacy, capped by energetic negotiations led by Secretary of State John Kerry—who seems on some days to be the only man in Washington enjoying his job—the Administration may at last have a deal in sight, judging from recent statements made by Kerry and by his Iranian counterparts.","1136","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/a-calculated-risk"
"The precise details of Obama’s offer are unknown. Broadly, Iran would freeze its program in such a way that, if it broke the agreement, it would need at least another year to make a bomb, and it would accept special inspections. In return, the U.S., the European Union, Russia, and China would agree to the lifting of economic sanctions. Republicans positioning themselves for 2016 have denounced any deal. Their opportunism, abetted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s divisive address to Congress earlier this month, has made it hard for Obama to clarify his argument: the bargain may carry risks, but it is better than any practical alternative.","1137","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/a-calculated-risk"
"One risk of any deal is that Iran will cheat successfully, as it has before. Between 2004 and 2009, it built a huge centrifuge facility under a mountain south of Tehran before Western intelligence agencies found out about the deception. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran still hasn’t come clean about its long history of secret weapons work. Yet Republican fear-mongering is overblown. The technology for detecting secret nuclear activity through atmospheric and water sampling, among other methods, isn’t foolproof, but it is very good. Large-scale cheating of the sort necessary to finish a bomb, which would require enriching uranium isotopes, would carry a significant risk of detection. If caught, Iran would likely face harsher economic sanctions, if not war.","1138","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/a-calculated-risk"
"A greater dilemma is that, by easing economic sanctions, a deal might empower Iran at a time when collapsing oil prices could reduce its ability to fund violent militias around the Middle East. The latest chapter of the Sunni-Shiite conflict is descending into a Thirty Years’ War of grotesquery—mass abductions, sexual slavery, tweeted beheadings. There are few innocents under arms, but Iran’s aggression is catalytic.","1139","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/a-calculated-risk"
"The Revolutionary Guards have trained Hezbollah’s fighters in Lebanon and Syria and provided the group with hundreds of millions of dollars. There is evidence that officers from Iran’s Quds Force, the hardcore Special Forces of the Guards, are fighting alongside the barrel-bombing military of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Iran’s proxy violence does not cut entirely against American interests. Some of its enemies are also American enemies: the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. But many more Iranian foes are American allies, including Israel. Last week, a fragmented Yemen saw its civil war deepen further as Saudi Arabian warplanes intervened to bomb Shiite rebels backed by Iran.","1140","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/a-calculated-risk"
"These days, however, Iran looks overextended. Sanctions have cut the country’s oil exports by half, and the economy is contracting. The apparent willingness of the radical wing of Tehran’s regime to consider the nuclear freeze offered by the Obama Administration—a deal similar to ones that have failed previously—might be explained by the need to replenish the Revolutionary Guards’ sectarian war chest.","1141","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/a-calculated-risk"
"How would lifting sanctions not simply revitalize Iran’s expansionism? If the Administration doesn’t have a plan, it should devise one. Last week, in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein’s home town, American warplanes, in tacit alliance with Iranian-backed Shiite militias, bombed Islamic State positions, only to have several of the militias withdraw in protest. Obama has committed the U.S. to what looks to be a long war in Iraq, with Iran’s help; an attack on the large city of Mosul is due soon. The Islamic State has thrived because it has captured the grievances and bitter desperation of Iraq’s Sunni minority. Attacking the Sunnis with Shiite fighters is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline. If Iran’s proxies in Iraq gain more access to guns and money because of a nuclear deal with the West, that may only make things worse.","1142","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/a-calculated-risk"
"The record of Washington’s interventions in the sectarian landscape of Iran and Iraq is so abysmal that the case for restraint should be obvious. The Reagan Administration carried out a morally debased effort to foster mutual destruction between the two countries during the war that they fought from 1980 to 1988. (At the war’s inconclusive end, as Saddam Hussein gassed Iranian positions, the head of the Revolutionary Guards wrote to Khomeini suggesting that, if Iran wanted to prevail, it needed nukes.) The Bush Administration invaded Iraq to topple Saddam, only to reignite sectarian fighting and, while disenfranchising Sunnis, open a pathway for Iranian aggression.","1143","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/a-calculated-risk"
"One aim of Kerry’s dealmaking in Switzerland is to help stabilize the region by reducing the chance that Iran’s bomb program could set off a local atomic arms race. That is an objective worthy of considerable risk-taking. But a deal might achieve more stability—and go down better in Congress—if it was accompanied by a broader political strategy designed to separate Shiite and Sunni fighters, promote autonomy and self-governance for Sunnis opposed to the Islamic State, reduce violence, and stop Iran from intervening in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, Bahrain, and Gaza.","1144","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/a-calculated-risk"
"For four decades, American Presidents of both parties have recognized that it is unacceptable for Iran to acquire a nuclear bomb, and that the only rational way to prevent this is to negotiate. After six years in office, and after repeatedly following the advice of his generals, only to see their predictions fail, Obama is choosing the risks of nuclear diplomacy over yet more war. It is the best of bad options, but it could be better still. ♦","1145","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/a-calculated-risk"
"Not long after Chris Christie was elected governor of New Jersey, in 2010, and before the memorable and antic 2012 Republican primaries got going, Henry Kissinger invited him to his office. As Christie recalled for the Washington Post’s Dan Balz, who wrote a book about the 2012 election, Kissinger said, “The country needs a change and you connect with people in a way that I haven’t seen a politician connect with someone in a long time and you need to think about doing this”—that is, running for President.","March 4, 2015","1146","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-presidential-candidates-greet-the-world"

"Despite Kissinger’s flattery, and his own demonstrable faith in himself, Christie was enough of a realist to raise perhaps the most important matter for anyone contemplating a run for the White House: “I said, ‘I haven’t given any deep thought to foreign policy.’”","1150","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-presidential-candidates-greet-the-world"
"Not a problem! In Christie’s recounting, Kissinger said, “Don’t worry about that. We can work with you on that. . . . Foreign policy is instinct, it’s character, that’s what foreign policy is. It’s instinct and it’s character that determines who are the great foreign policy presidents and who aren’t.”","1151","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-presidential-candidates-greet-the-world"
"Kissinger, who served Nelson Rockefeller, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford, among others, is a master of ingratiation, but Christie, who eventually endorsed Mitt Romney, resisted his charms, at least temporarily. Kissinger, meanwhile, seems to have moved on; he has met with Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, who has suddenly become one of the more serious Republican contenders in a race in which no one has declared his candidacy.","1152","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-presidential-candidates-greet-the-world"
"Kissinger, though, was not wrong to insist that character and instinct play a large role in a President’s approach to foreign policy. Curiosity, study, and engagement in the world also count for a lot. In 1951, when John F. Kennedy was a thirty-four-year-old Massachusetts congressman, he took a seven-week journey, accompanied by his brother Robert and his sister Patricia, to Saigon to learn about the conflict between France and the Viet Minh. As Fredrik Logevall wrote in “Embers of War,” Kennedy, speaking later in Boston, said, “In Indochina we have allied ourselves to the desperate efforts of the French regime to hang on to the remnants of an empire,” a view that did not find full reflection in United States policy in the region. Richard Nixon, too, was fascinated by the world; a sixty-eight-day trip to Asia that he made in the fall of 1953, when he was Eisenhower’s Vice-President, stayed with him all his life. Character and instinct helped define the Eisenhower years; Ike certainly made mistakes, but through it all you would hear his patience, his resistance to rash action and panic, even in the worst of times. In a diary entry from March, 1955, when some members of his Cabinet were certain that the United States would soon be at war with China, Eisenhower, once the Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in the war against Germany, wrote, “I have so often been through these periods of strain that I have become accustomed to the fact that most of the calamities that we anticipate really never occur.”","1153","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-presidential-candidates-greet-the-world"
"At this point in the 2016 campaign, insofar as there is a campaign, foreign policy has not yet supplanted such topics as immigration reform and the Affordable Care Act. Most candidates have not yet settled on their foreign-policy teams, although advice is plentiful. Among the Republicans, Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, is already being helped by such advisers as Paul Wolfowitz, who, when he was at the Pentagon during the Presidency of Jeb’s brother George, did his part to launch the disastrous Iraq war. (Wolfowitz doesn’t want to be typecast; after all, he’s pointed out, he also worked for George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, which is a bit like arguing that Dick Cheney should be judged by his work as President Ford’s chief of staff.)","1154","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-presidential-candidates-greet-the-world"
"When the candidates do touch on the subject, they often sound uneasy and out of touch; if their experience or interest in the wider world is limited, they reach and reduce it to irrelevant domestic analogies. At the recent Conservative Political Action Conference, when someone asked Scott Walker how he would deal with the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham, he talked about the success of Act 10, the Wisconsin law that curtailed collective bargaining by public-employee unions and set off angry demonstrations by union workers. “If I can take on a hundred thousand protesters, I can do the same across the world,” Walker said, an analysis that probably was not vetted by Henry Kissinger.","1155","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-presidential-candidates-greet-the-world"

It was hard to follow her when she wrote about Russia (in “Hard Choices”) that she had advised President Obama to “set a new course. The reset had allowed us to pick off the low-hanging fruit in terms of bilateral cooperation. And there was no need to blow up our collaboration on Iran or Afghanistan. But we should hit the pause button on new efforts. Don’t appear too eager to work together. Don’t flatter Putin with high-level attention.” It was odd to see the Secretary of State, on CBS News in 2011, exulting and laughing at the death of Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi, saying, in a variation of a line from Julius Caesar, “We came, we saw, he died.”","1156","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-presidential-candidates-greet-the-world"

"The conventional wisdom is that Cruz hasn’t got a chance, and, as far as the Presidency goes, it’s probably accurate. To many Americans, he is the loudmouth who, in the fall of 2013, less than a year into his first term as a senator, helped bring the federal government to a halt. Noted for railing against President Obama and denying the existence of climate change, he holds views that, according to an analysis by the Web site FiveThirtyEight, make him “more conservative than every recent G.O.P. nominee, every ’12 contender and every plausible ’16 candidate.”","1160","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"But if Cruz’s ultra-conservatism rules him out as a serious Presidential contender, it won’t necessarily work to his disadvantage in the Republican primaries, where his first goal is to distinguish himself from other right-wingers who are leading him in the polls, such as Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee, and Ben Carson. As Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich demonstrated in 2012, the conservative G.O.P. electorate is a fluid one, which falls for articulate rogues who can package age-old nostrums and prejudices in rhetoric that vaguely resembles a coherent political philosophy. Although Cruz is off to a slow start, this weakness should play to his rhetorical skills, which are superior to those of the rest of the G.O.P. field.","1161","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"At Princeton, Cruz was a national debating champion (and was, according to a roommate, known to carry a book entitled, “Was Karl Marx A Satanist?”). At Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1995, he was also known as a formidable public speaker. “He had brilliant insights and he was clearly among the top students, as revealed by his class responses,” the Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz told the Daily Caller last year.","1162","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"About ten hours after sending out his tweet, Cruz took the stage at Liberty University, which Jerry Falwell founded, in 1971, in Lynchburg, Virginia, and which is now the world’s biggest college for evangelical Christians. The weekly convocation at Liberty has long served as a platform for conservative Republicans, and it’s less than two hundred miles from Washington, D.C., which means that it is within easy access for the media hordes. All in all, it’s an ideal location for a conservative candidate in need of a lift.","1163","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"Cruz, clad in a conservative dark suit (what else?) and accompanied by his wife, Heidi, and their two young daughters, rose to the occasion. Prowling the stage, he talked for almost half an hour without notes, casting himself as the leader of a “grassroots army” of liberty-loving Christians who would pull America back from the jaws of secular damnation. Although most of the students in the crowd were obliged to attend, Cruz appeared to engage many of them, and he avoided making any slip-ups. As a piece of political theater, it was highly effective.","1164","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"He started out by talking about his background as the son of a Cuban immigrant who fought to bring down the dictator Fulgencio Batista during the Cuban revolution, but who subsequently turned against Fidel Castro and, at the age of eighteen, decided to move to the United States. “Imagine, for a second, the hope that was in his heart as he rode that ferry boat across to Key West and got onboard a Greyhound bus to head to Austin, Texas, to begin working, washing dishes, making fifty cents an hour,” Cruz said. But the thoughts of an immigrant fifty-odd years ago weren’t the only thing that he wanted the crowd to imagine. Indeed, as the speech developed, it sounded increasingly like he was channelling John Lennon. But not Lennon the atheist skeptic and peacenik: this was a Liberty University version of the Beatle.","1165","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"

"If there were any liberal Democrats tuning in, they were probably hurling things at the screen by now. Cruz wasn’t done. “Imagine repealing every word of Common Core,” he went on. “Imagine a President who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel.” (That one earned him his biggest cheer yet.) “Imagine a President who says, ‘I will honor the Constitution.’ … Imagine a President who says, ‘We will stand up and defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will call it by its name.’ ”","1167","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"Appearing to be thoroughly enjoying himself, Cruz conceded that some of his wish list might be difficult, or even impossible, to imagine. He reminded his audience that, in 1979, when Ronald Reagan started his second Presidential campaign, it would have been equally impossible to imagine the Berlin Wall coming down and the Soviet Union collapsing. “Compared to that, repealing Obamacare and abolishing the I.R.S. ain’t all that tough,” Cruz said. Then he asked the audience members, most of whom weren’t born when Reagan left office, to text the words “Constitution” or “imagine” to the number 33733.","1168","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"What did that mean? Most likely that Cruz intends to run as the Howard Dean of the religious right—a tub-thumping insurgent who uses social media to outmaneuver better-financed rivals. Speaking on Fox News, Joe Trippi, the Democratic strategist who ran Dean’s campaign in 2004, said after the speech, “I thought he did a great job.” Ed Rollins, the veteran Republican operative who was once Ronald Reagan’s campaign manager, was equally impressed. He raised the prospect of Cruz winning the Texas primary, which will take place next March, and emerging as a serious contender.","1169","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"

"One morning last week, as Washiqur Rahman, a shy, boyish-looking twenty-six-year-old Bangladeshi, left his house in Dhaka and started walking to the travel agency where he worked, three men set upon him with machetes and hacked him to death. The blows rendered his face unrecognizable. Two of the killers were captured by a transgender Bangladeshi beggar who lived nearby and handed over to the police. The killers, madrassa students, didn’t know Rahman; they scarcely knew one another. They explained that they had been separately recruited for the job two weeks earlier. Their teacher had said that Rahman was “an anti-Islamic person,” they told the police. “It was our responsibility as believers to kill him. So we killed him.”","1173","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/13/mute-button"
"They didn’t seem to know what blogging was, and they were not aware that Rahman was a secular blogger who had written critically about radical Islamists. He was part of a small, lively, embattled group of Bangladeshi freethinkers. Shortly before he was murdered, he changed his Facebook picture to the hashtag “#iamavijit.” Avijit Roy, a naturalized American citizen, was an outspoken atheist and the founder of the Bengali blog Free Mind. In February, on his way out of a book fair at Dhaka University, where he had gone to promote his book “The Virus of Faith,” Roy was killed by three machete blows to the head. Trying to save him, his wife, Rafida Ahmed, was wounded in the head, and one of her thumbs was severed, while onlookers and policemen stood by. The killers got away. For months, Roy had been receiving open threats on Facebook from radical Islamists. In recent years, other independent-minded Bangladeshis have been savagely attacked. The government seems unable or unwilling to protect them, and police investigations seldom produce convictions.","1174","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/13/mute-button"
"There’s nothing remarkable about any of this. Bangladeshis die tragically every day, in political violence and natural or man-made disasters. Citizens everywhere are too frightened or too indifferent to intervene when helpless people are attacked, and governments of all kinds are too corrupt or too craven to render justice. (Perhaps the transgender Bangladeshi was able to act as a human being, rather than as a member of a passive crowd, because she belongs to another ostracized minority.) The deaths of Rahman and Roy would hardly be worth noting, except for the idea that got them killed—one that is indispensable but increasingly endangered around the world.","1175","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/13/mute-button"
"The value of intellectual freedom is far from self-evident. It’s hardly natural to defend the rights of one person over the feelings of a group; to put up with all the trouble that comes with free minds and free expression; to stand beside the very people who repel you. After the massacre at the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo, in January, even defenders of free speech couldn’t help wondering why the cartoonists hadn’t just avoided Islam and the Prophet, given the sensitivities involved. Why be provocative? And when freethinkers are a tiny minority in a terribly poor and overwhelmingly religious country on the other side of the world, with no First Amendment or republican tradition of laïcité, it’s easy to feel that they’re admirable eccentrics who speak for nothing and no one beyond themselves—which may explain why they’ve received so much less attention than their brethren in Paris.","1176","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/13/mute-button"
"Even in this country, the loathsomeness of an incident in which University of Oklahoma students were caught on video singing a racist song made it seem churlish to argue that their expulsion from a public institution might be unconstitutional. Creating a “hostile environment” is what the Bangladeshi bloggers stood accused of. Hate-speech regulations put actual feelings, often honorable ones, ahead of abstract rights—which seems like common sense. It takes an active effort to resist the impulse to silence the jerks who have wounded you.","1177","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/13/mute-button"
"In a blog post, Rahman, using gently withering irony, addressed the notion that people like him are the problem, and that if only he would show some restraint things could settle down: “No, I will not write about war crimes, Islamic extremism, the country, or politics anymore. Writing does not change anything anyway; it serves only to appease the rage in my heart. Even then, writing is said to hurt people’s feelings, ruin the ‘peace,’ and impede progress. Therefore I should write only about topics that nobody would take any offense at.” So he set out to write about plants, education, movies, love, and himself—except that each of these inevitably led him into controversies that, he said, would bring down the wrath of the majority. He then asked, “Can someone tell me which topic I should choose to keep the government, the political parties, the Islamists, the general public, the groups in favor and in disfavor of independence, happy? Is there anybody with any ideas?”","1178","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/13/mute-button"
"Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, argues in his book “The New Censorship” that the explosion of data in digital media keeps us from seeing how extensively information is controlled. “Repression and violence against journalists is at record levels,” he writes, “and press freedom is in decline.” The worst cases include China (which became the world’s top jailer of journalists in 2014), Iran (No. 2), Eritrea, Turkey, and Egypt, but threats and killings are epidemic in the Middle East, South Asia, and Mexico. In Pakistan and elsewhere, blasphemy laws and mob rule make the subject of religion off-limits to all but the very brave. Islamic State-style terrorism has made whole regions lethal for journalists—for the notion of speaking one’s mind.","1179","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/13/mute-button"
"But, in some ways, an even greater danger than violence or jail is the internal mute button known as self-censorship. Once it’s activated, governments and armed groups don’t have to bother with threats. Here self-censorship is on the rise out of people’s fear of being pilloried on social media. In Russia, Vladimir Putin has been masterful at creating an atmosphere in which there are no clear rules, so that intellectuals and artists stifle themselves in order not to run afoul of vague laws and even vaguer social pressure. A Russian filmmaker, having agreed to remove cursing from her latest movie, assured the Times, “We dubbed it again, and I actually think it became even better.”","1180","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/13/mute-button"
"In Putin’s Russia, as in Narendra Modi’s India and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Turkey, majorities are on the side of silent conformity, and respect for dissent is disappearing under waves of nationalism. In India, books are frequently withdrawn after publication because of dubious legal cases brought on behalf of supposedly aggrieved groups. Last year, to settle a lawsuit, Penguin Books India—part of the world’s largest trade publisher—agreed to recall and pulp the critically acclaimed work “The Hindus: An Alternative History,” by Wendy Doniger. As part of the settlement, Penguin had to affirm that “it respects all religions worldwide”—a nice sentiment that has nothing to do with intellectual freedom.","1181","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/13/mute-button"

"I’ll get to that in a minute. First, back to the G.O.P. Presidential hopeful heading toward a courtroom confrontation with his local airport authority. It’s Donald Trump, of course. Speaking on a New York radio show over the weekend, Trump announced that he, too, is seriously—no, “very seriously”—considering a tilt at the Oval Office. “I’m going to Iowa. I’m going to South Carolina,” Trump said. “I’m going to New Hampshire. I’ve been invited by everybody.” And he went on: “I don’t know what it is, but I will tell you I do very well in the polls.”","1187","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"It wasn’t immediately clear what polls Trump was referring to. But, on Monday, he revealed a cunning campaign strategy, designed to appeal to an important demographic that, hitherto, has been sorely neglected by both major parties: Americans who live near busy airports. Speaking to the Associated Press, Trump said that he is suing Palm Beach County for deliberately directing low-flying planes over his upscale beachfront resort, Mar-a-Lago, whose central building was commissioned by Marjorie Merriweather Post in the nineteen-twenties. “I am saving one of the great houses of this country and one of its greatest landmarks, and it’s being badly damaged by the airplanes,” he said.","1188","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"At first glance, appealing to voters concerned about low-flying Boeing 737s might appear to be quixotic. But Trump isn’t as clueless as he sometimes appears to be. As a television celebrity who licenses his name to all sorts of projects, publicity is his lifeblood. Back in 2011, he briefly flirted with launching a Presidential campaign before deciding, quite sensibly, that his role on “The Apprentice” should take priority. Trump also knows that bashing an overweening government is a popular theme among what the G.O.P. activist Grover Norquist calls the “leave us alone coalition.” And Trump even acknowledges, if pressed, that there is a world beyond Palm Beach and the Trump Tower. “The real unemployment rate is twenty per cent,” he said on the New York radio show. “People are suffering out there. And the people that are most suffering are the people that don’t have much money to start out with.”","1189","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"After that touching peroration, perhaps Trump could lend some of his wisdom to Romney, who, in many people’s eyes, is still associated with his unseemly, and ultimately devastating, remarks about the shiftless “forty-seven per cent.” If Romney is in deadly earnest about 2016—and an article in Tuesday’s Washington Post said that he is “almost certain” to run—he needs to undergo a serious rebranding exercise.","1190","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"

What role is there for a second G.O.P. moderate who, just twenty-six months ago, in an economic environment that was far more friendly to Republicans than the one they are likely to face in 2016, lost handily to an unpopular President?","1191","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"

"One possible explanation, proffered by Romney supporters to Chris Cillizza, a blogger at the Washington Post, is that Jeb is far more vulnerable than he appears. Once the media starts chomping on all the lucrative business projects that Bush has been involved with since leaving the governor’s mansion in Tallahassee, this theory goes, his chances of gaining the nomination will fall sharply. (Actually, the chomping has already begun.) And once Bush goes down, there will be an opportunity for Romney or another establishment candidate.","1193","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"It’s also conceivable that Romney thinks he has learned from the mistakes he made in 2012, and that he matches up well against Hillary Clinton. (I haven’t seen any public polling that backs this up.) Evidently, he retains the faith in his own managerial abilities that was evident in 2008 and 2012. “There is something in Mitt that drives him to solve problems,” a Romney confidante told Cillizza. “When he sees something is a mess, he doesn’t have it in his DNA to sit back and let someone else just try to clean it up.”","1194","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"Of course, it’s possible that Romney’s confidantes and political strategists are encouraging him to run for their own reasons. During the Mittster’s ill-fated 2012 campaign, Vox’s Matt Yglesias reminds us, his seven senior aides all earned more than the highest-paid figure in the Obama campaign. “Romney is surrounded by associates who have every incentive to tell him not just that Barack Obama is a bad president, and that liberal ideas are inferior to conservative ones,” Yglesias notes, “but that he in particular has unique attributes that call him to the stage of national leadership.”","1195","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"In view of all this, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Romney hasn’t yet committed to anything. Some commentators think that he will come to his senses and forego another campaign. “He has to, right?” asks New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait. You would think so, but Romney has already been mulling this over for quite a while. The first stories suggesting that he was contemplating a third Presidential campaign appeared in the summer of last year.","1196","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"Perhaps the lesson is that Presidential candidates aren’t like the rest of us. The same qualities of overconfidence, manic ambition, and propensity for risk-taking that enable them to embrace the horrors of a modern campaign also make it hard for them to grasp reality.

For months now, the seventy-three-year-old Vermont senator has been indicating he would run for President. The official announcement, which came in the form of an e-mail to his supporters, merely confirmed that he’ll contest the Democratic primary rather than run as an independent.

"The contrast with the carefully orchestrated launches of the Clinton, Cruz, and Rubio campaigns, to name but three, wasn’t due to the fact that Sanders hasn’t got any money—he has almost five million dollars left over from his last Senate campaign. Sanders was sending the message that he isn’t so much a candidate as an anti-candidate. Even more than Howard Dean’s pitch, in 2004, Sanders’s will be based on the proposition that American politics are broken and corrupted to their core, and that only an insurgency can do anything about it. “Let’s be clear,” Sanders said in his e-mail. “This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It’s about a grassroots movement of Americans standing up and saying: ‘Enough is enough. This country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.’ ”","1201","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"That last line is one Sanders uses a lot, and it cuts across party lines. Mainly, he uses it to lambaste post-Citizens United Republicans, with their motley assortment of right-wing sugar daddies, from the Koch brothers to Sheldon Adelson to Harold Simmons. But Sanders has also accused the Democratic Party of playing the money game and pandering to wealthy donors. Last November, for example, he said that Party leaders had failed to make clear “that they are prepared to stand with the working-class people of this country, take on the big-money interests.” Now that he’s running in the Democratic primary, we can expect to hear him repeat this argument and apply it to the establishment candidate, Hillary Clinton. Indeed, he’s already doing this.","1202","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Asked by Jonathan Karl, of ABC News, what he thought about the controversy over donations from wealthy foreign interests to the Clinton Foundation, Sanders replied, “It tells me what is a very serious problem. It’s not just about Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton. It is about a political system today that is dominated by big money. It’s about the Koch brothers being prepared to spend nine hundred million dollars in the coming election. … We’re looking at a system where our democracy is being owned by a handful of billionaires.”","1203","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Sanders isn’t an attack dog. He likes to boast that he has never run a negative ad, and, rather than personalizing things, he generally sticks to the issues. Asked at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday why he was a better candidate than Clinton, he dodged the question. But the Clinton Foundation isn’t the only area where, in the past few days, he has raised questions about Clinton’s record. During an interview on CNN, he said that she ought to say whether she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade deal that the Obama Administration is trying to complete. And, in an interview with the Associated Press, Sanders reminded people that Clinton voted for the Iraq War and he voted against it.","1204","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Despite these pointed statements, the conventional wisdom in political circles is that Sanders’s entry into the race is good news for Team Brooklyn. He can’t win the primary, the argument goes, and he will occupy the space to the left of Clinton, thus denying it to more plausible candidates, such as Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland. That may be true. But if Sanders succeeds in building a vigorous grassroots campaign, as Dean did in 2004, he could still have a significant impact on the contest.","1205","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Admittedly, that’s a big if. For much of his career, Sanders has been a loner rather than a team player. His social-media presence is respectable but not huge. (His Facebook page has just under a million “likes”; on Twitter, he has close to three hundred thousand followers. ) Until he shows that he can attract big crowds and raise money from small donors, other players on the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, such as labor unions and environmental groups, will remain wary of endorsing him.","1206","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"But, for all the challenges Sanders faces, his presence in the Democratic primary field is surely a plus. As I pointed out a few months ago, when he released his Economic Agenda for America, he’s a genuine economic populist, and many of his policy proposals—such as spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure investment, introducing a carbon tax, and replacing private health insurance with Medicare for all—are eminently defensible, if politically unrealistic. Most of all, he will provide a voice to those Democrats who agree with him that the U.S. political system has been bought, lock, stock, and barrel. In the televised debates and elsewhere, he will demand that the other candidates, Clinton included, respond to this indictment and say what they intend to do about it.","1207","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"

"Ever since the dogs took the prize in last October’s New Yorker Festival debate “Cats vs. Dogs,” adjudicated by the nonpartisan judge David Remnick, I’ve been wondering why cats get such a bad rap. Was it really because, as Adam Gopnik put it, “All dogs are Democrats and all cats Republicans”? What about what Anthony Lane so wisely suggested, that the endless loyalty and good cheer of dogs is a dangerous misrepresentation of life, and that “truth is cats”? There’s an upcoming show at the Japan Society, “Life of Cats: Selections from the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Collection,” of woodblock prints from the Edo period (1615-1867), depicting the life of Japanese cats, from the cozy to the ferocious. The prints are divided into helpful subcategories like Cats and People, Cats Versus People, and Cats as People—in one piquant image, an elaborately berobed cat woman leans on the head of a giant octopus while swatting a soup ladle at some flying fish. (Cats as people is a popular fantasy in Japanese culture—the Kitty of Hello Kitty is apparently not a cat but a “little girl.”) One afternoon, while researching the Japan Society show, I typed “Japanese cats” into Google, hoping to find more Edo-period images. Instead, I unearthed this treasure: sushi cats. Or, if you want to sound like you know what you’re talking about: nekozushi. You can thank me later.—Shauna Lyon","1210","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/this-week-in-cultural-clicks-sushi-cats-post-internet-poetry-and-more"
"Having enjoyed Emmanuel Villaume’s conducting at the opening of “Manon” at the Met on Monday night, I’m looking forward to listening to “Héroïque,” a new album on Warner Classics in which he directs the Prague Philharmonia. The star of the recording is Bryan Hymel, the young American tenor who rose to fame when he substituted for Marcello Giordani in the role of Énée in Berlioz’s “Les Troyens,” at the Metropolitan Opera in 2012. The emergence of a first-rate tenor is always a cause for celebration, but Hymel’s rare gift for singing the French “heroic” repertory—which demands a unique mixture of power, refinement, and technical flexibility in the highest vocal register—makes him doubly valuable.—Russell Platt","1211","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/this-week-in-cultural-clicks-sushi-cats-post-internet-poetry-and-more"
"This week, Kenneth Goldsmith made a strong case for post-Internet poetry, writing on Page-Turner that the form has come into its own. This should come as no surprise, given that the Internet is a text-based medium, driven by code. What did surprise me was that Goldsmith restricted his argument to printed matter: a three-part volume, a book-length confession, an anthology. (In the past, he has championed YouTube’s jejune bard of ranting, Steve Roggenbuck.) The most radical aspect of post-internet art isn’t that it infiltrates old-media institutions like books and galleries; it’s that, as it does so, it continues to proliferate online like Tribbles on Star Trek. As part of its current triennial, the New Museum tapped the British poet Harry Burke to organize a series of Web-only projects by six other poets: Alex Turgeon, Penny Goring, Tan Lin, Ye Mimi, Melissa Broder, and the collective not I.

"Van Morrison turns seventy this year, and he’s taking stock by re-recording a handful of his three hundred and sixty songs. He enlisted the help of some of his favorite artists, including Mark Knopfler, Taj Mahal, Mavis Staples, Natalie Cole, and George Benson. The resulting album, “Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue,” his thirty-fifth studio release, comes out March 23rd. Morrison, never one to go for the obvious, focusses on his lesser-known material, and over the past few weeks he’s been posting singles on YouTube. The first one was “Real Real Gone,” with the jazz singer Michael Bublé. The last one, “Fire in the Belly,” with Steve Winwood, is coming next week, on March 17th. This week saw Mark Knopfler lending his earthy voice to “Irish Heartbeat.” But my favorite so far was the album’s opening track, for which the late Bobby Womack joined Morrison on a dressed-up and slightly funky version of “Some Peace of Mind.” It’s one of Womack’s last recordings, and his voice gives the chorus an added poignancy.—John Donohue","1213","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/this-week-in-cultural-clicks-sushi-cats-post-internet-poetry-and-more"
"There’s a noble tradition of directors exerting and even extending their art in commercials, and Nathan Silver is the latest one to rise to the challenge. The prolific filmmaker has made a feature a year since 2012. “Soft in the Head” came out last year; two (“Uncertain Terms” and “Stinking Heaven”) are still awaiting release. All three are harshly realistic, furiously histrionic glimpses into the harrowing lives of troubled people living in a variety of group homes—a mental-health facility, a home for pregnant teen-agers, a self-regulated rehab house. Silver’s commercial is an advertisement for a cell-phone camera and the processor that it runs on, and it’s both a work of great originality and a startling new direction for the filmmaker.","1214","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/this-week-in-cultural-clicks-sushi-cats-post-internet-poetry-and-more"
"The commercial has a title, “Family Affair,” and it’s essentially a meta-film, one in which the making of the commercial—the commission and Silver’s uncertainty about it—is folded into the action. The director builds the commercial around a recorded phone call with its creative supervisor, who responds to Silver’s queries by describing, in sketch-like form, the kind of film he wants. Silver puckishly takes that recording as a wry voice-over that he brings to life with a freewheeling visual style—and he cuts that voice-over up and edits it into a sort of musical score that lends the film a lyrical, through-composed structure. Silver appears in the film, along with his mother, Cindy Silver, who often acts in dramatic roles in his films. But here she plays herself—and she’s quite an engaging character on her own. I was walking through Grand Central Station one morning when I ran into Silver and the two members of his crew. He seemed happy and excited as he told me that he was waiting for his mother to arrive so that he could shoot a film with her there. Clearly, Silver found the ostensibly commercial premise of his film a springboard for his inspiration. So do I.—Richard Brody","1215","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/this-week-in-cultural-clicks-sushi-cats-post-internet-poetry-and-more"

Lizza joins fellow staff writer Jeffrey Toobin and host Dorothy Wickenden on this week’s Political Scene podcast to talk about Obama’s new approach to executive power in the face of a hostile Congress. They discuss the negotiations to avoid a Homeland Security shutdown, the use of the Administrative Procedures Act to halt the President’s executive action on immigration, and the significance of the upcoming Supreme Court case challenging the Affordable Care Act, King v.

"“The shadow of crisis has passed,” President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address Tuesday night. It was an oddly detached construction, as though one day the crisis had just got tired and walked away. At times, Obama’s closest allies have worried that, given his own intermittent aloofness, he might wander off; he is a lame duck with two hostile houses of Congress. His speech Tuesday spoke to that fear, in ways both scripted and improvised. At one point, he began, “I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda”—and was interrupted by a sarcastic patter of applause and laughter. He responded, with the sort of energy he sometimes keeps hidden, “I know, because I won both of them. Yeah.” There was much more applause; a partisan instinct had, for once, pushed Obama to seize the moment effectively.","January 21, 2015","1220","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-think-hes-won"
"","1221","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-think-hes-won"
"If this State of the Union had a message, it was that Obama thought he had already won more than the Republicans would admit, and that he wants to keep winning. At times, particularly when it came to his domestic agenda, he spoke in terms that were almost resounding—“In the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage”; “I’m sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college, to zero”—and had a certain populist consistency. But, on the whole, his idea of victory seemed to have more to do with relief than with triumphalism. His guide through the Obama recovery was one of the guests in the First Lady’s box, Rebekah Erler, who married her husband, Ben, seven years ago. “She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was on the way. They were young and in love in America. And it doesn’t get much better than that. ‘If only we had known,’ Rebekah wrote to me last spring, ‘what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.’ ” (The line echoed one from Michelle Obama’s convention speech: “We were so young, and so in love, and so in debt.”) Ben “took what jobs he could find”; Rebekah enrolled in a community college, and “slowly, it paid off,” Obama said. They “worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled”; they “made it through.” He quoted, and repeated, another line from Rebekah’s letter: “We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.” The crisis passed.","1222","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-think-hes-won"
"Is that enough? Obama stayed with the Erlers to make the case for affordable child care, a proposal with some ambition. But enduring, which Obama might regard as a personal goal for himself, too, is somewhat distinct from inspiring. For that, Obama’s best chance may be the minimum wage; he showed, Tuesday night, that he knows how to talk about it. (“And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: if you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than fifteen thousand dollars a year, try it.”) He might not get it through this Congress, but he could make sure it is an inescapable issue in the 2016 Presidential race.","1223","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-think-hes-won"
"It was when Obama moved away from what he called “middle-class economics” that it became harder to tell what he’d consider a win or a loss. If there was an energy policy in there, it was muddled. (“We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas.”) On Guantanamo, he proudly said, “I will not relent in my determination to shut it down”—a determination that was expressed in his first executive order, in January, 2009, and hasn’t been realized. And he spoke as though he might be the only man in town who still cared about N.S.A. overreach. (“So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not.”) If that’s his impression, he should get out more. The larger foreign-policy questions became clearest when seen through the same lens, with the same aspirations, that Obama directed at Rebekah and Ben. Take the steps that are available to you (in Cuba, for example, where Obama has acted less as a lame duck than as el pato libre); stick together (“from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris”); make it through and don’t, at any cost, mistake drama for success:","1224","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-think-hes-won"
"The winner, that is, is the one who doesn’t start a war—that’s one answer. But it presents another problem: the legal status of various foreign conflicts is murky, largely because of the mutual indulgence of Congress and the White House and their vague reliance on a 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force. One of the more interesting moments in Tuesday’s speech came when Obama said, “And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.” In the prepared text, the passage ends there, but, standing in the Capitol, he added, “We need that authority.” Recognizing such a need, an obligation by Congress to think over the situation in Syria and what it would mean to go to war, would be useful.","1225","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-think-hes-won"
"“You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston”—at the Democratic National Convention—“where I said there wasn’t a liberal America or a conservative America, a black America or a white America , but a United States of America,” Obama said Tuesday, in a tone that seemed to be an attempt at wry nostalgia. (A few degrees in one direction or the other, and he might have come across as awkward or sour.) He continued, “Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my Presidency hasn’t delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever.”","1226","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-think-hes-won"
"Quoting your own old oratory is a tricky rhetorical move. If not properly executed, it can leave the impression that the speaker is tedious or vain, and maybe a little pathetic. To pull it off, you have to avoid leaving the impression that you have nothing new to say, or are in love with your own old artful formulations, or with a person you’ve long ceased to be. Those are also, as it happens, the general risks a two-term President faces as he begins his seventh year in office. In extreme cases, rhetorical replays have an air of self-parody, or of pre-independent-counsel parsing. Defensiveness is doom.","1227","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-think-hes-won"
"Luckily for Obama’s speechwriters, the President was not defensive Tuesday night. The Times used the words “defiantly” and “emboldened,” even as it expressed doubt about what he might actually get done. At the Washington Post, Chris Cillizza wrote, “One thing was very clear tonight: Obama isn’t planning to go quietly over his final two years in office.” John Cassidy agreed.","1228","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-think-hes-won"
"Toward the end of his speech, Obama acknowledged an astronaut in the audience—an identical-twin astronaut, Captain Scott Kelly, who is about to be sent into space for a year so that scientists can compare the effects on his body and that of his brother, Mark. The idea is that this will help us get to Mars. Mark Kelly had been an astronaut, too, before his wife, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, was shot and almost killed. Now he’s an advocate for gun control, a policy area where progress has been as elusive as a Martian colony. Looking up at the balcony, Obama called out, “Good luck, Captain — and make sure to Instagram it!” One wonders which brother’s year he would rather have—blasting off into space, or lobbying Congress—and which promises a trip to the stranger planet.","1229","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-think-hes-won"
"In the original, British “House of Cards,” there’s a plot line that never made it into the American version, for good reason: President Frank Underwood could not, as Prime Minister Francis Urquhart does, design a scheme to force the new king to abdicate. The unnamed monarch—we know he’s meant to be Prince Charles—has just made what amounts to a campaign ad for Labour (Urquhart is a Tory), and so he must go. It’s a brilliant device for an anti-hero, because even though the King wants to help the poor and the marginalized, and even though we have seen the Prime Minister throw a young woman reporter from the roof of Westminster to her death, on this question of principle Urquhart is correct. What business does a king have in electoral politics?","April 2, 2015","1230","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"

"And what about the real Prince Charles, a man who isn’t king yet but who has a royal position and many, many strong opinions—on architecture, organic farming, school reform—along with a tendency to lobby for them? This is one of the questions raised in a decade-long British legal fight over twenty-seven letters that Charles sent to government offices in 2004 and 2005. They are known as the Black Spider Letters, because Charles hand wrote them rather than having them typed up, and his cursive is crawly. He also, reportedly, uses a lot of exclamation marks. That these letters exist at all—that there is someone with a feathered crest on his stationery who commands deference from public officials—enrages British republicans, who think that, at the very least, the government should not respond to or even receive his advice in private. (In addition to pestering British officials, he recently provoked the cancellation of a real-estate development in London, which he objected to on aesthetic grounds, by writing to the Emir of Qatar, who was involved in the financing of it, royal-to-royal.) But the case is also important in trying to determine the strength of the United Kingdom’s Freedom of Information laws and, perhaps even more consequentially, the relationship between the parliamentary government and the courts. The case ended up being very much about which one gets the final say. For Americans, in addition to providing an opportunity for royal voyeurism, it offers some perspective on the ambiguities and the absurdities of dynasties, at a moment in which, in our own political life, we could use some.","1232","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"
"The Guardian’s Rob Evans filed the first request for the newspaper in 2005, asking to see correspondence from September, 2004, to the following April. Britain’s Freedom of Information law was new and, apart from everything else, the paper wanted to test it. (Evans wrote that he was often asked if he’d “been given a tip-off that Charles had sent a particularly controversial letter to a minister” in that period; the “more prosaic” answer was that they’d limited it to eight months because the government could “refuse requests if you ask for too much.”) It was during the subsequent course of litigation that the paper learned that there were letters written in those months to seven departments. Some of the recipients were very Charles, such as the Departments of Culture and of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs. He also wrote to the Northern Ireland Office. In 2012, after several appeals, an Upper Tribunal (which is supposed to have the authority to rule in this area) said that the Guardian could see the letters. At that point, the attorney general, Dominic Grieve—instead of appealing to Britain’s Supreme Court—issued a veto, which he said he could do under Britain’s Freedom of Information law. The problem was that the law said he could do so only if there were “reasonable” grounds, and the Upper Tribunal, looking at that very point, thought there weren’t any. Grieve’s rationale was that the letters were “in many cases particularly frank,” and “contain remarks about public affairs which would in my view, if revealed, have had a material effect upon the willingness of the government to engage in correspondence with the Prince of Wales, and would potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality.” This would make it harder to be king: “The ability of the Monarch to engage with the government of the day, whatever its political colour, and maintain political neutrality is a cornerstone of the UK’s constitutional framework.”","1233","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"
"This is a strange bit of reasoning: the Prince behaved in a way that he probably shouldn’t have, and which would be potentially damaging to his future career as king. As a result, he deserves confidentiality. This is a dangerous fallacy of state secrecy everywhere: that “embarrassing” is synonymous with “damaging to national security,” and that protecting the career of a particular incumbent is the same as protecting the institution. We have certainly heard that in this country.","1234","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"
"But here there isn’t usually such open defiance of courts. (Sometimes there is, as when a C.I.A. official, Jose Rodriguez, shredded videotapes depicting torture, or, more broadly, when states ignore federal rulings.) It took two and a half more years before Britain’s Supreme Court ruled, last week, that the attorney general couldn’t just say that he understood the facts better than the judges did “without real or adequate explanation.” The court’s having the final say is not yet a completely accepted position in Britain: “A decision of a judicial body should be final and binding and should not be capable of being overturned by a member of the executive,” Lord Neuberger, the President of the Supreme Court, explained in the decision. (“Might this be seen as the case in which the supreme court asserts its authority and comes of age?” Joshua Rozenberg wrote in the Guardian.)","1235","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"
"Prime Minster David Cameron’s reaction has been fairly petulant—he says that the government needs time to redact the letters, and that Parliament should also weaken the F.O.I. law to make the veto stronger. That would be a mistake, as the new Parliament, which will come in after the general elections, next month, may decide. (The law has already been altered, with what’s known as the “Prince Charles Amendment,” to make future requests more difficult.) Cameron also said, “This is about the principle that senior members of the royal family are able to express their views to government confidentially. I think most people would agree this is fair enough.” That may be true in terms of the Queen, for whom there are formal mechanisms for such confidential exchanges, but “senior members” may be stretching it. (Does Prince Andrew count?) The worry about Charles is not that, at age sixty-six, he will be unprepared for the throne but that he will, to use the verb often associated with him, meddle. Cameron comes from the sort of background where one might be exposed, in the course of things, to the odd duke, but one can see the problem if a junior minister starts getting fancy letters.","1236","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"
"This recalls a different set of letters, or e-mails, that have been the subject of debate in this country. The Clintons don’t have a crest on their stationery, but they do have a private server. The Times has also reported that Jeb Bush (who has had a private server of his own) had a tendency to write letters to various departments when his father was Vice-President. This past weekend, Martin O’Malley, the former Governor of Maryland, said on “This Week” that “The Presidency of the United States is not some crown to be passed between two families.” One of the many problems with crowns, as the case of Charles’s letters makes clear, is that there isn’t just a king or a queen but all sorts of princes and duchesses. And Presidents have a lot more power than someone who has actually had a coronation. When politics becomes a family business, the private and the public can get hopelessly confused, in a way that is not helpful in terms of transparency or democracy. What is a missive from Bill Clinton going to mean if Hillary is President—or one from Chelsea? The need for real mechanisms to govern those situations can’t be ignored. Otherwise, the White House might be crawling with Black Spiders.","1237","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"
"Louis Freeh enjoys an exalted public reputation, though there may be reason to wonder why. As the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the nineteen-nineties, he ingratiated himself with congressional Republicans by conducting numerous investigations of the Clinton White House, which produced more news leaks than criminal convictions. The Central Intelligence Agency absorbed a great deal of blame for the intelligence failures leading up to 9/11, but those attacks took place on American soil, which the F.B.I. is also supposed to protect. Freeh has deftly turned, in recent years, to a profitable new career leading internal investigations of troubled institutions.","March 20, 2015","1238","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/new-twist-penn-state-case"
"Now Freeh’s most high profile post-F.B.I. assignment is coming under new scrutiny. In 2011 and 2012, Freeh led the internal investigation of Pennsylvania State University following the disclosure that Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach at the school, had been a serial child molester. The story has largely disappeared from the national media, but it remains big news in Pennsylvania. This week, Graham Spanier, the president of the university who lost his job in the scandal, filed a lawsuit against Freeh for defaming him in his report. (Spanier’s hundred-and-forty-three-page complaint is available online. I interviewed Spanier about the Sandusky case in 2012.)","1239","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/new-twist-penn-state-case"

"Sandusky is serving a much-deserved sentence of thirty to sixty years; he is seventy-one, and so will likely spend the rest of his life in prison. Joe Paterno, who had been Penn State’s head coach for more than forty years, was fired, and died soon afterward. Spanier, who had become president of the university in 1995 and was widely admired, resigned. Spanier took the fall for, according to Freeh, failing to follow up on reports of Sandusky’s abuse. Freeh wrote that Spanier acted in “consistent disregard … for the safety and welfare of Sandusky’s child victims.” He also wrote that Spanier “empowered Sandusky to attract potential victims to the campus,” and that Spanier “repeatedly concealed … Sandusky’s child abuse.” Spanier’s lawsuit claims that this is false. (Freeh’s spokeswoman told me that Freeh would have no comment on Spanier’s lawsuit against him.) Spanier and two other university administrators have also been criminally charged with perjury, obstruction of justice, and other charges, but that case is snarled in pretrial proceedings.","1241","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/new-twist-penn-state-case"
"Freeh’s case against Spanier focusses on two incidents that he failed to respond appropriately to: one, in 1998, and another, in 2001. In the first, a woman called the university police to report that Sandusky had showered with her eleven-year-old son. The police, as well as local social-services agencies, investigated the woman’s claim and closed the investigation after advising Sandusky not to take any more showers with children. (Though Spanier was made aware of the investigation, it’s not clear what Spanier knew about the incident.) Sandusky quit his university job in 1999, leaving to work at his children’s charity, the Second Mile, though he was given coach emeritus status and access to athletic facilities. In the second matter, from 2001, a graduate assistant named Mike McQueary witnessed an incident in the locker-room shower between Sandusky and a young boy; he later testified that he thought the boy was being raped. He reported it in some form to Joe Paterno, the head coach at Penn State. The precise nature of how McQueary described what he saw to Paterno, and how Paterno described it to others, has long been open to dispute, but witnesses testified that Spanier was never told directly that what McQueary witnessed had been a sexual assault. Spanier said that he understood it as “horsing around in the shower.” In any event, Spanier signed off on a plan for Sandusky to be told not to bring children to the main campus any longer, and to inform the head of the Second Mile about the situation. It is difficult to square Spanier’s behavior and Freeh’s broad condemnation.","1242","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/new-twist-penn-state-case"
"The Sandusky story set off an understandable, and immediate, storm of outrage. Many news reports condemned the university, especially Paterno and Spanier, for purportedly enabling a molester to operate in their midst. Freeh used his report to reinforce that initial impression. As it turned out, Freeh’s denunciations of Spanier were a lot clearer than his actual evidence against him. Indeed, in the years since, the story of the university’s behavior has turned out to be considerably more complex than it originally seemed. For its part, the N.C.A.A. has eased up on some of the sanctions that it initially imposed on Penn State. It restored a hundred and twelve football victories, which had been stripped from the university’s record, and allowed all of a $60 million fine paid by Penn State to be spent in Pennsylvania, instead of being spread around the country.","1243","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/new-twist-penn-state-case"
"To be sure, Spanier’s case against Freeh will always be a long shot. The legal standard for public figures, like Spanier, who bring a defamation case is extremely, and appropriately, high; Spanier will have to prove either that Freeh knew his report was false or that Freeh displayed reckless disregard for whether it was true. Still, the very complexity of the facts as they have eventually emerged should remind us of the risk of rushing to judgment.","1244","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/new-twist-penn-state-case"
"The French writer Michel Houellebecq has become a literary “case” to be reprimanded as much as an author to be read, and his new novel, “Soumission,” or “Submission,” shows why. The book, which will be published in English by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, is shaped by a simple idea. In France in the very near future, the respectable republican parties fragment the vote in a multiparty election, and the two top vote-getters are Marine Le Pen, of the extreme right, and one Mohammed Ben Abbes, the fictive leader of a French Muslim Brotherhood. In the runoff, the French left backs the Muslim, preferring the devil it doesn’t know to the one it does. Ben Abbes’s government soon imposes a kind of relaxed Sharia law throughout France and—this is the book’s central joke and point—the French élite are cravenly eager to collaborate with the new regime, delighted not only to convert but to submit to a bracing and self-assured authoritarianism. Like the oversophisticated Hellenists in Cavafy’s poem, they have been secretly waiting for the barbarians all their lives.","1245","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"Houellebecq is one of those writers who cause critics to panic, since placing him is tricky. He is probably the most famous French novelist of his generation. An immediately recognizable caricature of Houellebecq as a wannabe Nostradamus was the image on the last issue of Charlie Hebdo before the attack on its staff. But he is not a particularly graceful stylist, and it exasperates French writers who are to see him made so much of outside France, not to mention within it. Though he began as a poet, he doesn’t have much poetic grip, nor are his choices and phrases of a kind that make other writers envious. (One well-known French critic has pointed out, tartly, that no good writer would ever confuse, as Houellebecq does in the new novel, the French word for “vineyard” with the French word for “vintage.”) Yet it is a mistake to think of him as a provocateur, in the manner of authors who purposefully set out to goad and annoy as many people as they can with each new book, like Gore Vidal, or, for that matter, Céline.","1246","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"Houellebecq is, simply, a satirist. He likes to take what’s happening now and imagine what would happen if it kept on happening. That’s what satirists do. Jonathan Swift saw that the English were treating the Irish as animals; what if they took the next natural step and ate their babies? Orwell, with less humor, imagined what would happen if life in Britain remained, for forty years, at the depressed level of the BBC cafeteria as it was in 1948, and added some Stalinist accessories. Huxley, in “Brave New World,” took the logic of a hedonistic and scientific society to its farthest outcome, a place where pleasure would be all and passion unknown. This kind of satire impresses us most when the imaginative extrapolation intersects an unexpected example—when it suddenly comes close enough to fit. (As when Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared as living proof of Philip K. Dick’s prescience about the merger of American politics and the wilder shores of its entertainments, achieved by people with funny names.)","1247","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"In the novel that made Houellebecq famous, “Les Particules Élémentaires” (1998), he proposed that a society with an unchecked devotion to economic liberalism and erotic libertinism would come to a daylong oscillation between fucking and finance, where bankers would literally break their backs in the act of having sex for the hundredth time that day. The satire seemed ridiculously heavy-handed and overwrought—and then came Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the International Monetary Fund, who, in the brief time before dining with his daughter and boarding a plane, turned out to have budgeted fifteen minutes for sex (coerced or not) with a total stranger. D.S.K. was a character only Houellebecq could have imagined, and already had.","1248","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"Houellebecq is not merely a satirist but—more unusually—a sincere satirist, genuinely saddened by the absurdities of history and the madnesses of mankind. He doesn’t “delight in depicting our follies,” as reviewers like to say; he’s made miserable by them. French reviews and American previews of “Submission” might leave one with the impression of a sardonic, teeth-baring polemic about the evils of Islam, the absurdities of feminism, the terrible demoralization of French life. In truth, the tone of the book is melancholic rather than polemical. Life makes Houellebecq blue. “The totality of animals, the crushing majority of men, live without ever finding the least need for justification,” his narrator, a literature professor at the Sorbonne, reflects. “They live because they live, and that’s all, and that’s how they reason—and then I suppose they die because they die, and this, in their eyes, ends the analysis.” That’s Houellebecq’s typical tone; the book’s virtues lie in his mordant, disabused eye for depressing details of French life.","1249","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"Even if, sentence by sentence, Houellebecq is not a writer to envy, certainly he does have a voice of his own, one of slightly resigned sociological detachment. In the very first pages of the new book, he remarks, apropos the uses of a university degree in literature, that “a young woman applying for a job as a saleswoman at Céline or Hermès will, in the first place, have to take care of her appearance, but a literature degree could constitute a secondary attribute pleasing to the employer, suggesting a certain intellectual agility that might indicate a potential evolution of her career—literature, in place of useful skills, still has a positive connotation in the domain of the luxury industry.” You master Proust to become a better salesgirl, and what else would you expect? The commodification of the world and the art and the people in it leaves Houellebecq unexcited.","1250","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"This flattened tone seems, at first, like an affectation. But, reading “Public Enemies,” a collection of confessional letters exchanged by Houellebecq and the philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy, one realizes that it’s not an affectation at all. It’s an affect. It tells a truth about Houellebecq’s own disconcerted sense of detachment from human relations. He is, after all, a man whose mother wrote a bitter memoir about him, insisting that her son should say, “I am a liar, I am an impostor, I was a parasite, all I’ve done in my life is harm the people around me. And I ask forgiveness”—and it seems fair to say that, when your mom writes the bitter memoir, something really has gone screwy in your emotional life. His heroes always seem truly puzzled by the emotional rewards that other men claim to get from children and work and family and even sex.","1251","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"Anhedonic in the extreme, Houellebecq finds the conventional pleasure-seeking surface of French life entirely absurd, which is one reason he satirizes it so effectively. He can be very funny about the details of modern sex—his protagonists find the objective, clinical details underwhelming—and is fearless in admitting to his own inspection of them, as in this description from a moment of Internet porn: “The penis passed from one mouth to the other, the tongues crossing like flights of swallows, lightly troubled, in the somber sky . . . when they are ready to leave Europe for their winter pilgrimage.” The parodic note, neither contemptuous nor indignant but preternaturally calm, is distinctively Houellebecq’s.","1252","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"The other striking thing about Houellebecq is how literary he is—the first hundred or so pages of “Submission” depend on a complicated analysis of the work of the nineteenth-century writer J. K. Huysmans, best known as a novelist of Decadence and the Church, and for his influence on other French writers. This is, at least, an inadvertent compliment to the continued literary culture of France: no American satiric novelist, not Tom Wolfe or Christopher Buckley, could hope to hold a mass audience with hundreds of pages on the follies typically encountered in the university study of Hart Crane, or on how best to conceptualize his relationship with Wallace Stevens.","1253","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"The literary obsessions are important, since it turns out that the principal target of the satire is not French Islam—which is really a bystander that gets, at most, winged—but the spinelessness of the French intellectual class, including the Huysmans-loving narrator. The jokes are all about how quickly the professors find excuses to do what’s asked of them by the Islamic regime, and how often they refer to the literature they study to give them license to do it. The new Islamic administration at the University of Paris allows a professor of Rimbaud studies to carry on, but on the condition that he teach Rimbaud’s conjectured conversion to Islam as an established fact. The professor is happy to do it. Huysmans’s actual conversion to Catholicism makes the narrator contemplate the convenient possibility of crossing over: for all his supposed decadence, Huysmans might have welcomed the new religious regime.","1254","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"The charge that Houellebecq is Islamophobic seems misplaced. He’s not Islamophobic. He’s Francophobic. The portrait of the Islamic regime is quite fond; he likes the fundamentalists’ suavity and sureness. Ben Abbes’s reform of the educational system is wholesome, and his ambitions to rebuild France are almost a form of neo-Gaullism. (He succeeds in integrating Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Turkey into the European Union, creating a power bloc greater than the American one.) The reform of education, the reinforcement of the family, even the re-domestication of women are all held up for admiration. It’s the shrugging admiration of satire, of course, but neither Ben Abbes nor his government seems meant to be seen as contemptible, the way the French who assist them certainly are. One of the few objects of real scorn in the book is François Bayrou, the (actual) French centrist politician whose dancing between left and right in electoral politics is legend, and who becomes Ben Abbes’s chief apologist and mouthpiece.","1255","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"All the most eloquent spokesmen in the book are religious-minded and in favor of theocracy. Another collaborationist professor at the Sorbonne—which is soon funded solely by a Saudi prince, with all women veiled—eventually offers to let the narrator achieve his dream of editing the Pléiade edition of Huysmans, in exchange for converting to Islam. The struggle of the twentieth century was between two failed humanisms, the other professor explains—between the “hard” humanism of Communism and the “soft” humanism of liberal capitalism, each in its way “horribly reductive.” Both have failed, and some form of faith must take their place. Without faith, any idea of a French or a European revival is impossible. Why not Islam, whose deity is properly remote—and thus right for a cosmos that science has shown us to be immense—rather than provincially incarnate and local, like the Christian Messiah? The narrator converts.","1256","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"Like most satirists worth reading, Houellebecq is a conservative. “I show the disasters produced by the liberalization of values,” he has said. Satire depends on comparing the crazy place we’re going to with the implicitly sane place we left behind. That’s why satirists are often nostalgists, like Tom Wolfe, who longs for the wild and crazy American past, or Evelyn Waugh, with his ascendant American vulgarians and his idealized lost Catholic aristocracy. Houellebecq despises contemporary consumer society, and though he is not an enthusiast, merely a fatalist, about its possible Islamic replacement, he thinks that this is the apocalypse we’ve been asking for. What he truly hates is Enlightenment ideas and practices, and here his satire intersects with a fast-moving current of French reactionary thought, exemplified by “The Suicide of France,” a surprise best-seller by the television journalist Éric Zemmour.","1257","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"Zemmour’s is one of those polemical books, like Allan Bloom’s* “The Closing of the American Mind,” which carry everything before them, because they run right over every obstacle. For honest, thorough scrutiny of the opposition’s authors and actions, Zemmour makes Bloom look like John Stuart Mill: his argument depends on his never dealing with a specific instance. Everything flows by in a torrent of hysterical rhetoric. He hates feminism, but there is no extended treatment of feminist authors, or any attempt to discriminate between French feminism and the American kind; shrieking harpies dethroned the father, and now everything sucks. He hates ecologists, but there is no argument about why the world would be cleaner or pleasanter had environmentalism not happened. American universities, he says, have become playpens for empty legacies of the rich; there is no recognition that the historical trend has run in the opposite direction.","1258","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"In a weird but representative diatribe, he pines for the day when European football teams and players were happily rooted in their places. Never mind that pre-“liberal” soccer was notable for the almost unbelievable level of violence that the players, and their supporters, endured. (Before liberalism ruined football, thirty-eight fans were crushed to death at a Eurocup final.) The result of the new free market in football is that French footballers, like Thierry Henry and Arsène Wenger, have become heroes in North and West London, their exploits heralded, their pictures hung in giant murals high on the stadium façade. This leaves a lot of English footballers unemployed, I suppose, but in what way can having its actors idolized abroad be a loss for French prestige?","1259","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"And when was the better time from which France has fallen? Hardly the forties! Not the thirties, which led to them. It can’t be the twenties, when France was barely recovering from the disaster of the teens, with a million and a half dead, and not the aughts, when the Dreyfus case tore the country apart on savagely “communitarian” grounds. In the back of Zemmour’s mind, it seems, is an oddly singular and specific place to long for—the Gaullist France of the booming sixties, when Zemmour was a kid. Society held together, authority was firm and essentially benevolent, each man had a role, each woman could choose to stay home if she wanted, and Catherine Deneuve was in every other movie. This is a nostalgia that Houellebecq, who was also a kid then, shares. For him, too, this was the happier time: Pif Gadget, a charming French children’s magazine quietly run by the Communist Party, is one of the few things recalled with tender regard in Houellebecq’s work.","1260","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"Zemmour’s politics, though he is often accused of being a fellow-traveller with the National Front, are really those of an unreconstructed Gaullist, purer than the political kind of Gaullist still in existence, because the political kind had to become impure to survive. Houellebecq is innocent of the uglier schemes that this nostalgia produces and that are part of Zemmour’s program—the urge to return to that era by expelling Muslims from France or keeping them highly straitened within it.","1261","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"But the two writers do converge, inasmuch as their real sympathies lie outside contemporary political choices, in a revival of the old ideology of the far right, back before it disgraced itself—the ideology of conservative anti-capitalism in the form it took a century ago, more or less benignly in Chesterton and Belloc, and decidedly less benignly in the likes of Charles Maurras, the theorist of the monarchical (and ultimately pro-Vichy) Action Française movement. The tenets of the faith are simple: liberalism, cosmopolitanism, and international finance are the source of all evil. Liberal capitalism is a conspiracy against folk authenticity on behalf of the “internationalists,” the rootless cosmopolitans. The nation is everything, and internationalism is its nemesis. The bankers cosset us with narcotics of their civilization even as they strip us of our culture.","1262","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"Chesterton and Belloc and their ideas appear in “Submission” as a kind of secondary sound, a Greek chorus. Houellebecq takes very seriously the enterprise, in which Huysmans is also implicated, of rejecting Enlightenment modernity in favor of some kind of mystical-spiritual nation reëstablished on a foundation of faith. There is a passage in “Submission”—by Houellebecq’s own account the key scene in the book—in which the narrator goes south to contemplate the Black Madonna of Rocamadour and has a moment of blissful vision, one that he wishes to sustain but can’t. Islam rushes in to fill the absence. Houellebecq makes the entente of Islam and Catholicism attractive. “My book describes the destruction of the philosophy handed down by the Enlightenment, which no longer makes sense to anyone, or to very few people,” he said in an interview. “Catholicism, by contrast, is doing rather well. I would maintain that an alliance between Catholics and Muslims is possible.”","1263","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"While anti-Semitism has always been the active, evil form of extreme traditionalist ideology—get them out of here and we’ll be pure—Houellebecq’s half-infatuated fascination with Islam has always been the more fatalist form. If Judaism represents the corrupting, cosmopolitan alternative to the European nation, an Islamic invasion represents its apocalyptic end, the conqueror at the gate. The idea of an overnight Muslim takeover, where suddenly the University of Paris becomes the Islamic University of Paris, perches at the back of the European apocalyptic imagination, perhaps because it once really happened. On the morning of May 28, 1453, Constantinople was still a Christian city. The next day, it wasn’t. The great churches were turned into great mosques, and the Sultan’s flag flew over the conquered city. (The conquest never would have taken place had the Byzantines not first been fatally weakened by the fraternal Christian sack of the Fourth Crusade.) The notion that you wake up and there’s the Eiffel Tower with a crescent moon and star upon it haunts the Western imagination of catastrophe.","1264","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"The spectre of an Islamic re-reconquest is therefore mixed with admiration for its discipline and purpose. The Muslim warriors are taken to be antimaterialists inspired by an austere ideal—the very idea of submission to authority that we have lost. In the back-and-forth of fantasies of conquest and submission between panicked Catholics and renascent Muslims, Islam plays an ambiguous role, as both the feared besieger and the admirable Other. Charles Maurras feared Islam, and prophesied, in the twenties, that a mosque built in Paris would be an opening for the infidel. His brand of religious nationalism helped inspire the Turkish poet Necip Fazıl Kısakürek, who studied in Paris, to shape his dreams of a reborn authoritarian Islamic-nationalist state at home—a mirror image of Maurras’s idealized France, and both, naturally, hostile to Jews. For where the Jews in the European reactionary imagination are insidious termites, eating silently away at the foundations, the Muslims are outsized conquerors, arriving to take over when you’re weakened. Chesterton, suspicious of Jews, was terrified of Muslims: “A void is made in the heart of Islam which has to be filled up again and again by a mere repetition of the revolution that founded it. There are no sacraments; the only thing that can happen is a sort of apocalypse, as unique as the end of the world; so the apocalypse can only be repeated and the world end again and again.” The Jews are the poison of modernity, but Islam is the zombie state at its end.","1265","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"In “Submission,” the Islamic authority, with the author’s felt approval, turns toward Chestertonian distributism, with large enterprises denied subsidy and small artisanal ones encouraged. But all these wise things come too late for the indigenous French, arriving at the hands of a conqueror rather than at the pleasure of the nation. We left it too long to be salvaged; now we can be only slaves.","1266","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"All this belongs, of course, to the world of fervid fantasy and café millennialism. The real reasons for the French obsession with decline are no doubt simpler. French was once far ahead of English as a world language; now it’s not. (That’s one reason Houellebecq is resented at home; he’s one of the few writers who get translated. Even the Nobel Prize winner Patrick Modiano had a very patchy English résumé.) Meanwhile, the successive political failures of French governments have demoralized all political sides. The mood in Britain in the seventies was not very different. Then came Thatcherism, which, however its long-term record is scored, was certainly perceived as successful by its adherents, and gave a sense of efficacy to politics, one inherited by New Labour in its early euphoric days. (A small cultural sign: the benevolently imagined New Labour Prime Minister that Hugh Grant plays in “Love Actually” is unimaginable in a French film. No politician would be allowed that much heart, or good intentions.) The French Presidents Chirac and Sarkozy and Hollande have all been seen as failures, and their failure infects the social tone of the nation’s popular literature. For all this apocalyptic nihilism, there may be nothing here that five years of economic growth and a popular Presidency won’t cure.","1267","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"Imagining that what’s happening now will keep on happening is what satirists do. It is also what simpletons do. Every huckster on television tries to sell gold by pointing to an ascending price line and insisting that it can go only ever upward. In the real world, a vector never keeps going in a straight line. It meets a countervailing force or splits in two. We never got to 1984, or to boiling Irish babies. Other forces intervened.","1268","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"In France, countervailing forces seem sure to intervene, too. Enlightenment values are hardly as empty as Houellebecq pretends; there is surely more fight left in the light than people want to admit. The vast rally in Paris on January 11th may help revive the Fifth Republic. But, in any case, the great majority of Muslim kids will do what kids everywhere do: pursue their own interests by taking advantage of the system, which, for all its failings, is still meritocratic at heart. Sharia law is the last thing they want; it costs too much. What liberal values have going for them is liberty and value. In the recent horror, the two Muslim victims of the two Islamic terrorists were a cop and a copy editor, and this immersion in upwardly mobile ordinariness is likely to be more typical of the Muslim future than the apocalyptic fantasy of a fundamentalist triumph.","1269","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"Certainly, when French Muslims write about French Muslim experience, you get nothing like the calm triumphalism of Houellebecq’s imagination. Instead, there’s the usual human mixture of self-indictment, self-criticism, extreme resentment, and hope. In Kamel Daoud’s recent “Meursault, Counter-Investigation” (due out later this year, from Other Press), a tour-de-force reimagining of Camus’s “The Stranger,” from the point of view of the mute Arab victims, the author seeks not to re-indict the colonizing French but to relate all the disappointments that the dream of free Algeria has produced for the “natives,” particularly their degradation by political Islam. Sabri Louatah’s immense, and immensely popular, multivolume novel, titled, with deliberate irony, “Les Sauvages,” tells of the rise toward the French Presidency of a Muslim politician named Idder Chaouch—a rather more credibly fleshed-out figure than Houellebecq’s shadowy Ben Abbes—and shows a Franco-Algerian family in the provincial city of Saint-Étienne split several ways in pursuit of power, glamour, spiritual authority, and so on. Inspired less by Houellebecq’s high-literary French tradition than by American showrunners like David Chase, David Simon, and Vince Gilligan—Louatah claims to have seen the entire run of “The Sopranos” right through, three times—the work makes the point that French Arabs are just as divided, from violent fundamentalists to secular republicans, and just as open to the world’s influences, as everybody else. Common sense, and the book’s popularity, suggests that this view is largely credible. Louatah certainly shows that you can plausibly imagine a Muslim President of France in a non-hysterical, not to mention anti-apocalyptic, manner.","1270","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"
"This is not to say that Islam in France won’t continue to be problematic or that the extreme right won’t continue its rise or that the respectable republicans won’t be as fatuously self-destructive as Houellebecq imagines them to be. The next thing is just never likely to be the same thing. The fun of satire is to think what would happen if nothing happens to stop what is happening. But that’s not what happens. ♦","1271","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/next-thing"

"The state of the union is “strong,” President Obama declared last night, and so, it turns out, was the State of the Union address. Tuesday’s speech looked hale and fit, weighing in at around sixty-five hundred words and almost exactly sixty minutes and lifting members of Congress out of their seats like a speech half its age (two hundred and twenty-five years). This might come as a surprise; just last week, Politico accused the President of “killing” the speech by rolling out pieces of it in the days and weeks beforehand. Obama’s “SOTU Spoilers,” as the White House insisted on calling them, were said, by other commentators, to have “robbed the event of suspense.” (The White House delivered the ultimate spoiler when, minutes before the speech, it released the full text on the Web site Medium.)","January 21, 2015","1273","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"Never mind that the State of the Union usually has all the drama of the Queen’s annual Christmas message. Arguably, the spoilers—which included steps to normalize relations with Cuba and a proposal to finance middle-class tax cuts by raising capital-gains and inheritance taxes—kept President Obama and the speech at center stage over the past month, displacing the new Republican Congress. Of course, the Nielsen ratings, which will be released today, might show a further decline in viewership of the State of the Union; last year’s audience of 33.3 million was less than two-thirds that of Obama’s first address to Congress, in 2009. If so, it isn’t Obama’s fault so much as your own. The narrowing of the national attention span has not been kind to long speeches. Besides, the only proven way to gin up interest in the State of the Union is to gin up a preëmptive war in the Middle East, which is the approach that George W. Bush took in 2003. That year’s speech, which preceded the invasion of Iraq by several weeks, attracted sixty-two million viewers, the largest audience since 1993.

"Since most of President Obama’s initiatives were already familiar, the most notable aspect of Tuesday’s address was his tone: upbeat, unapologetic. Obama did not sound like a man whose party had just lost the Senate. (Senator Harry Reid, however, looked like that man.) Nor did he appear at all prepared to accept the limits that Republicans want to place on his Presidency. Last night, Obama had the punchy, self-assured air of a President on a roll, freed of old encumbrances (a narrow, nervous Democratic majority in the Senate) and buoyed by both a big jump in his approval ratings and, most important, a growing economy. “We have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth,” he said.","1275","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"In recent months, as job creation has heated up, some Democrats have warned the President against this kind of ebullience. “People are in trouble,” the political strategist Stan Greenberg told the Times, after reportedly saying the same thing to David Simas, the White House political director. Indeed, many are, as Obama acknowledged last night. “Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?” he asked. His legislative agenda—for example, his sixty-billion-dollar plan to make community college free for most students—shows his refusal to accept that reality, and aims squarely at the problem of income inequality. At the same time, Obama was unrestrained in his discussion of America’s economic progress—and the role that he has played in it. “At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,” the President said. “Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health-care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.” Here he paused, savored these statistics, then ad-libbed: “This is good news, people.” A wink, a smile, a sideways glance. This is a man who is pleased with himself.","1276","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"For Obama, this constitutes a meaningful shift. Long constrained by his own overcautiousness, he has, for several months now, been parting by degrees with his reluctance to talk about economic growth and job gains. As recently as April, in a speech about the minimum wage, he offered no indication that the economy was improving, except to say—a bit accusingly—that “those at the top are doing better than ever.” By summer, as the midterm elections approached, he had warmed to saying that, “by almost every measure, we are better off now than we were when I took office.” Last night’s address featured his most full-throated expression of satisfaction about the recovery yet. He has, in his phrase of choice, “turned the page.”","1277","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"The reason this matters is that it’s not, in the end, only about taking credit; it’s about credibility. President Obama won’t have much of the latter unless he claims more of the former. By reminding Americans how far the nation has come since the financial crisis of 2008, and what it took to get here, Obama can create at least a little more public confidence in his plans for the rest of his time in office. Of course, that doesn’t mean he’ll have much success getting his agenda through Congress. But, if he sticks to his own story, and tells it repeatedly, he might have at least a fighting chance of winning an argument with the G.O.P. over, say, what elements to include in a tax-reform deal, or which party can, in 2016, be trusted with the hopes of middle-class Americans.

We marched against the Vietnam War and for civil rights and women’s rights back then.” Then she started a family and opened her business; she hasn’t been involved in serious activism for some time, other than canvassing for Hillary Clinton in 2008. In the summer of 2012, she began toying with the idea of trying to get a woman on a banknote, but she didn’t quite know where to start. She e-mailed some friends (“HI SISTERS!” her message began) to ask them which women they would put on bills if it were up to them.","1280","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"

"Among the e-mail’s recipients was an old friend of Howard’s, Susan Ades Stone. Ades Stone is a journalist, and she saw the potential for a serious campaign. Together, Howard and Ades Stone decided to mount an organized effort to put a woman on a bill by 2020, the centennial of women’s suffrage. They settled on the twenty-dollar note, not only because of its resonance with the anniversary year but because they thought that Andrew Jackson was the best candidate for removal from U.S. currency. “George Washington and Abe Lincoln and Alexander Hamilton, who invented the Federal Reserve System”—technically, he created a predecessor to the system—“and Ben Franklin—they have a legacy that we’ve been honoring that would make them hard to remove,” Howard said. “But Andrew Jackson?” Jackson had strongly opposed the notion of central banking. Plus, he sought—and signed—the Indian Removal Act, which led to the expulsion of Native Americans from their homes.","1282","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"Howard and Ades Stone registered their nonprofit, called Women on 20s, and recruited others, including a co-founder of the National Women’s History Project, to join the campaign. Over several months, they built a Web site, and started a Twitter feed and a Facebook page. On Sunday, Women on 20s began inviting people to visit the site and vote for their favorite candidates to replace Jackson on the twenty-dollar bill; the choices include Alice Paul, Betty Friedan, Shirley Chisholm, Sojourner Truth, Rachel Carson, Rosa Parks, Barbara Jordan, Margaret Sanger, Patsy Mink, Clara Barton, Harriet Tubman, Frances Perkins, Susan B. Anthony, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. The women were selected from a longer list of a hundred names based on their societal impact and the difficulties they faced in pursuing their goals.","1283","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"It wouldn’t require a vote in Congress or Presidential approval to get a woman on the twenty-dollar bill. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for the designs that appear on paper notes, including the portraits. Nor do the people depicted on bills have to meet particularly stringent standards; according to U.S. law, they just have to be dead. Even so, the appearance of U.S. banknotes was hardly modified during the twentieth century; according to historians, this was partly to keep the bills recognizable and partly due to the American public’s resistance to change. “I think the choices of people on those bills, at this point, is more a tradition than it is a matter of consciously choosing these individuals,” Mark Tomasko, an expert on the history of currency, told me. He couldn’t recall any past campaigns to put a woman on a bill. Some Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have tried—and failed—to put Ronald Reagan on the fifty-dollar bill, replacing Ulysses S. Grant.","1284","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"Ades Stone and Howard are already facing some controversy, and they haven’t even brought their idea to the government yet. It turns out that settling on fifteen finalists, let alone choosing a winner, is easier said than done. The list includes several black women and an Asian-American woman; some people have expressed disappointment that more minority groups aren’t represented. “We would have liked a more diverse list that would have included Native-American women and Latino women, but we weren’t going to just put people in to be representative,” Howard said. “They had to meet the criteria.” Ades Stone added, “We’ve had a few people comment that if we were kicking Andrew Jackson off the bill, he should be replaced by a Native American.”","1285","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"Howard and Ades Stone hope to present the winning candidate to President Obama some time in the next several months, with the hope that he might help persuade the Treasury Secretary to sign off on a new twenty-dollar-bill design. (A spokesperson for the Treasury Department declined to comment on the campaign.) This might seem like a bit of a circuitous route, but Ades Stone believes that it will make for better P.R. She said, “We could approach the Treasury Secretary, but it’s much more compelling for the public to know that their wishes are being delivered to the President, and, if he wants it done, it’s within his power.” (Ades Stone and Howard have a feeling that Obama might be open to their suggestions, in part because of an offhanded comment he made in a speech last year about a young girl who had written to him asking why there aren’t any women on U.S. currency and offering a list of possible candidates. Obama said at the time that he thought this “was a pretty good idea.”)","1286","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"I asked Matthew Wittmann, a curator at the American Numismatic Society, which is dedicated to studying currency, what he thought of the campaign’s chances. He told me, “2020 seems doable, and Jackson seems like the low-hanging fruit as Presidents on the currency goes, so I think they probably have a shot.” (He also pointed out that, in the nineteenth century, before paper bills became prevalent, most of the money in circulation were coins that did picture a woman: Lady Liberty. There have also been coins featuring Susan B. Anthony and Sacagawea, though they haven’t gotten much use.) When I spoke with Howard and Ades Stone on Tuesday, they were still waiting for their campaign to go viral; it had received some press coverage online—Vox and Buzzfeed had written about it—but hadn’t yet gained the traction they were hoping for. Howard brought up a dashboard that tracked how many people had cast votes on the site; the number had reached eight thousand five hundred and fifty-two. I asked how many total votes they had hoped for when they began the campaign; Ades Stone said, “We thought five million.” Howard pointed out that it was early—it hadn’t been seventy hours since the voting had opened. The suffragettes’ campaign, it’s worth noting, took seventy years.","1287","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"The Times has reported that people involved in a series of Canadian uranium-mining deals channelled money to the Clinton Foundation while the firm had business before the State Department. And, in one case, a Russian investment bank connected to the deals paid money to Bill Clinton personally, through a half-million-dollar speaker’s fee. There were a number of transactions involved, and corporate name changes, but, basically, a Canadian company known as Uranium One initially wanted American diplomats to defend its Kazakh uranium interests when a Russian firm, Rosatom, seemed about to make a move on them; and then, after the company decided to simply let Rosatom acquire it (through Rosatom’s alarmingly named subsidiary, ARMZ), Uranium One needed State Department approval. (The approval was necessary because Uranium One controlled American uranium mines and exploration fields, a strategic asset.)","April 24, 2015","1288","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"

"The Times sums it up this way:","1290","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"The Times says that the donations were not properly disclosed—the paper confirmed them by looking at Canadian tax records. Complicating matters, Uranium One’s corporate forebear had acquired the Kazakh interests after its major shareholder, Frank Giustra, travelled with Bill Clinton to Kazakhstan in 2005 and met with the country’s leader. Giustra sold his interest in the company in 2007, according to the Times, and so was not involved in the ARMZ dealings. But Giustra has put tens of millions of dollars into the foundation’s work; the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, which bears his name, is a formal component of the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. And Ian Telfer, the Uranium One chairman, whose family foundation donated the $2.35 million dollars, said that it had done so because he wanted to support that coöperation: “Frank and I have been friends and business partners for almost 20 years.” He told the Wall Street Journal that he’d pledged the money in 2008, before the sale was on the table. Telfer also said that he’d never talked about uranium with Hillary Clinton. After the story came out, Giustra issued an angry statement, calling it baseless speculation and “an attempt to tear down Secretary Clinton and her presidential campaign.” He added a note of Canadian admonishment: “You are a great country. Don’t ruin it by letting those with political agendas take over your newspapers and your airwaves.”","1291","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"Brian Fallon, a Clinton campaign spokesman, told the Times, “To suggest the State Department, under then-Secretary Clinton, exerted undue influence in the U.S. government’s review of the sale of Uranium One is utterly baseless.” There have been reports that other companies—Boeing, for example—gave money to the foundation while Clinton was Secretary of State and they had business before the department. The Uranium One story is more troubling, and potentially damaging, because of the personal ties, the foreign interests, the opacity, and the denouement, which involves Putin allies publicly gloating over Russia’s increased dominance of the world’s uranium supplies. The Times was tipped off to the story by a forthcoming book, “Clinton Cash,” by Peter Schweizer, which a Clinton campaign spokesman has called a “smear project.” The Clinton people and others argue that Schweizer has an expressly conservative agenda, visible in his previous work, and ties to Republican candidates. The Times’ public editor, Margaret Sullivan, addressing those concerns, said that, though she was troubled by the way the Times had described its relationship with Schweizer as “exclusive,” the paper had done its own reporting, and the story addressed valid questions about a Presidential candidate.","1292","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"Here are five:","1293","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"1. Was there a quid pro quo? Based on the Times reporting, there was certainly a lot of quid (millions in donations that made it to a Clinton charity; a half-million-dollar speaker’s fee) and multiple quos (American diplomatic intervention with the Russians; approvals when the Russian firm offered a very “generous” price for Uranium One). The Clinton perspective is that, although the approvals were delivered by the State Department when Clinton led it, there is no evidence that she personally delivered them, or of the “pro” in the equation. The Clinton campaign, in its response to the Times, noted that other agencies also had a voice in the approval process, and gave the Times a statement from someone on the approvals committee saying that Clinton hadn’t “intervened.” The Clinton spokesman wouldn’t comment on whether Clinton was briefed about the matter. She was cc’d on a cable that mentioned the request for diplomatic help, but if there is a note in which she follows up with a directive—an e-mail, say—the Times doesn’t seem to have it.","1294","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"This speaks to some larger questions about political corruption. How do you prove it? Maybe the uranium people simply cared deeply about the undeniably good work the foundation is doing, and would have received the help and approvals anyway. In cases like this, though, how does the public maintain its trust? Doing so becomes harder when the money is less visible, which leads to the second question:","1295","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"2. Did the Clintons meet their disclosure requirements? The Times writes, of the $2.35 million from Telfer’s family foundation, “Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors.” This is one of the more striking details in the story, because it seems so clear-cut that the donation ought to have been disclosed. Moreover, the Times says that the foundation did not explain the lapse. I also asked the foundation to explain its reasoning. The picture one is left with is convoluted and, in the end, more troubling than if the lapse had been a simple oversight. The legalisms can be confusing, so bear with me: the Clinton Foundation has several components, including the Clinton Global Initiative and—this is the key one—the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, formerly known as the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative. The memorandum of understanding makes it clear that the donor-disclosure requirement applies to each part of the foundation.","1296","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"Craig Minassian, a Clinton Foundation spokesman, pointed out, though, that there are two legally separate but almost identically named entities: the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership and the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada). The second one is a Canadian charitable vehicle that Giustra set up—doing it this way helps Canadian donors get tax benefits. It also, to the foundation’s mind, obliterates the disclosure requirements. (There are also limits on what a Canadian charity is allowed to disclose.) Minassian added, “As complex as they may seem, these programs were set up to do philanthropic work with maximum impact, period. Critics will say what they want, but that doesn’t change the facts that these social enterprise programs are addressing poverty alleviation and other global challenges in innovative ways.” Minassian compared the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada) to entirely independent nonprofits, like AmFAR or Malaria no More, which have their own donors and then give money to the foundation’s work.","1297","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"This does not make a lot of sense unless you have an instinct for the most legalistic of legalisms. Unlike AmFAR, the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada) has the Clinton name on it. Money given to the Canadian entity goes exclusively to the foundation. Per an agency agreement, all of its work is done by the foundation, too. The Web site that has the C.G.E.P. name on it also has the Clinton Foundation logo and Bill Clinton’s picture; it also has a copyright notice naming the Canadian entity as the site’s owner. Anyone visiting the site would be justifiably confused. They are, in other words, effectively intermingled.","1298","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"And what would it mean if the Canadian explanation flew—that the Clintons could allow a foreign businessman to set up a foreign charity, bearing their name, through which people in other countries could make secret multi-million-dollar donations to their charity’s work? That structural opacity calls the Clintons’ claims about disclosure into question. If the memorandum of understanding indeed allowed for that, it was not as strong a document as the public was led to believe—it is precisely the sort of entanglement one would want to know about. (In that way, the Canadian charity presents some of the same transparency issues as a super PAC.) At the very least, it is a reckless use of the Clinton name, allowing others to trade on it.","1299","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"3. Did the Clintons personally profit? In most stories about dubious foundation donors, the retort from Clinton supporters is that the only beneficiaries have been the world’s poorest people. This ignores the way vanity and influence are their own currencies—but it is an argument, and the foundation does some truly great work. In this case, though, Bill Clinton also accepted a five-hundred-thousand-dollar speaking fee for an event in Moscow, paid for by a Russian investment bank that had ties to the Kremlin. That was in June, 2010, the Times reports, “the same month Rosatom struck its deal for a majority stake in Uranium One”—a deal that the Russian bank was promoting and thus could profit from. Did Bill Clinton do anything to help after taking their money? The Times doesn’t know. But there is a bigger question: Why was Bill Clinton taking any money from a bank linked to the Kremlin while his wife was Secretary of State? In a separate story, breaking down some of the hundred million dollars in speaking fees that Bill Clinton has collected, the Washington Post notes, “The multiple avenues through which the Clintons and their causes have accepted financial support have provided a variety of ways for wealthy interests in the United States and abroad to build friendly relations with a potential future president.”","1300","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"4. Putting aside who got rich, did this series of uranium deals damage or compromise national security? That this is even a question is one reason the story is, so to speak, radioactive. According to the Times, “the sale gave the Russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States.” Pravda has said that it makes Russia stronger. What that means, practically, is something that will probably be debated as the election proceeds.","1301","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"5. Is this cherry-picking or low-hanging fruit? Put another way, how many more stories about the Clintons and money will there be before we make it to November, 2016? The optimistic view, if you support Hillary Clinton or are simply depressed by meretriciousness, is that the Times reporters combed the Schweizer book and that this story was the worst they found. The pessimistic view is that it was an obvious one to start with, for all the reasons above, and that some names that stand out less than Uranium One and ARMZ will lead to other stories. Are the Clintons correct in saying that there is an attack machine geared up to go after them? Of course. But why have they made it so easy?","1302","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"The word “norm” seems to have crawled out of the swamps of sociologese, and into the public conversation, almost becoming the word of the week. Right now, it’s a way of saying that following (or fixing) a law isn’t enough: to do the right thing you have also to follow the unwritten rules, the accepted underlying practices, the norms, of societies and institutions. The Times’s David Brooks, in praise of a new book by the Harvard professor Robert Putnam, wrote a column recently arguing that we can’t solve the problem of poverty with cash handouts and good government alone—the social norms of the poor have to change, or be changed, first. Those social norms, like the expectation that, having made a woman pregnant, a man should marry and support her, are, Brooks writes, more important than any other element in making poor people rich, or at least richer. (Jill Lepore, to be sure, writing for this magazine, drew different conclusions from Putnam’s book.)","March 17, 2015","1303","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-inequality-and-the-battle-of-american-norms"
"In an ironically parallel move, the same Republican moralists who condemn the poor, or their politicians, for not enforcing social norms were accused all week of betraying an essential constitutional norm themselves—in this case, that you don’t effectively tell the nation’s enemies to ignore its twice-elected leader. Their pay-no-attention-to-the-President letter to the Iranian government wasn’t illegal, much less “treasonous,” but it certainly and grossly violated an unwritten but widely understood norm of political behavior. It wasn’t that no one had ever done something like this before. It was that there had been an assumption that it wasn’t remotely doable. That’s what made it a norm. If Barry Goldwater had written a letter to Khrushchev at the height of the Cuban missile crisis insisting that anything J.F.K. promised to do to resolve it should be ignored, it wouldn’t have just seemed destructive. It would have been unimaginable.","1304","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-inequality-and-the-battle-of-american-norms"
"","1305","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-inequality-and-the-battle-of-american-norms"
"That’s the difference. A law is something that exacts an announced cost for being broken. A norm is something that is so much a part of the social landscape that you wouldn’t think, really, that anyone could break it. Laws are plans, like the city grid, that must be followed; norms are landmarks, like the old Penn Station—you don’t think anyone could tear them down, and then someone does.","1306","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-inequality-and-the-battle-of-american-norms"
"Political norms matter because any constitutional arrangement known to man can break down if it isn’t played by the laws as well as by the rules. “The Constitution is not a suicide pact,” a great Justice famously said, but in truth any constitution can become a suicide pact if people ignore what’s left unwritten in it. If people choose not to buy the basic premise, the joke won’t land. Any social arrangement can disintegrate as much from misuse as repeal. If, as has happened in many an empire, the army figures out that it can buy and sell the emperors, pretty soon you no longer have an empire, or at least no longer much of an emperor. One shockingly violated norm of American constitutional practice was the old one against impeachment on a party-line vote. It’s always been the case that a simple majority in the House can send an American President to a Senate trial, with all the costs that involves. It was just taken for granted that no one would try this without bipartisan support and the likelihood of a conviction. Back in 1998, the Republicans decided to do it anyway—Why the hell not, the country’s booming and can run itself—at a cost that is still not fully understood.","1307","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-inequality-and-the-battle-of-american-norms"
"The social norms that Brooks writes about matter a lot. Putnam’s great accomplishment, in his earlier books about the social roots of democracy, including “Bowling Alone,” was to make the case that civil society did indeed precede democratic institutions. Learning to play nice with others before you ever saw a voting booth was the best guarantee that the voting booths would remain open. The number of glee clubs or volunteer firemen in a community was a better guide to how well they adapted to democracy than any other metric.","1308","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-inequality-and-the-battle-of-american-norms"
"Putnam’s earlier work certainly presupposes a feedback between prosperity and sane social practices. Do societies get rich because they have good norms, or do sound norms spread when societies get rich? One needn’t be terminally wishy-washy to think that a virtuous circle sets in, in which more money makes for more social peace (and more stable families), even as social peace and stable families help people make more money. Certainly, no one doubts the vicious circle of poverty producing social despair, with social despair producing more poverty. Isolating norms away from the booms and busts that help make them happen is as odd as isolating spare change from the pockets in which it sits.","1309","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-inequality-and-the-battle-of-american-norms"
"So norms like playing well together really do matter. But they are a lot more plastic and locally enforced, less organic and hallowed, than can sometimes seem plain. The sociologist Howie Becker spent a career documenting all the ways in which norms are not just malleable over time but a lot more fragmentary than the people with power choose to believe. There are norms alongside norms sitting by norms around the corner from other norms. Reefer smokers follow them as tightly as prohibitionists. Willie Nelson obeyed as many as Nancy Reagan; they were just harder to spot through the smoke. Some social norms that are taken to be obvious in certain times and circles (homosexuals should be prosecuted, blacks and whites shouldn’t marry) turn out to be intolerable, and others that look trivial (people should go bowling with each other) turn out to be indispensable. Which one is which often becomes apparent only after they’ve been altered.","1310","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-inequality-and-the-battle-of-american-norms"
"One way to get poor people to act like rich people is to give them more money. Prosperous societies have fewer social problems than poor ones, and when poor societies become more prosperous they generally become more placid. What the right wing is really asking is how you get poor people to act like rich people without actually giving them more money. That is a harder question. But the idea that there’s a causal connection between things like sexual permissiveness and social harm is obviously fatuous. The most astonishing change in American life in recent times has been the unlooked-for disappearance of violent crime. Had that sudden drop not happened, would conservatives be talking all the time about the need for reintroducing social norms to make it happen? The best explanations for the decrease, though, are either micro explanations of how behavior changes from experience—criminals learning that crime is a very bad business to be in—or else macro explanations about, say, lead poisoning, which are speculative but certainly have nothing at all to do with how many teens have sex with other teens.","1311","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-inequality-and-the-battle-of-american-norms"
"Nor are norms enforced, as swoony traditionalists like to pretend, by collective wisdom passed on lovingly from generation to generation. They really tend to be enforced by bribes and threats and clear punishments for their violation. Usually, when you go to search for the reason that a social or constitutional norm got discarded, it was not because people forgot its value; it was because it once obviously paid to obey it and now no longer does, or because those whom it harmed fought against it. Even if norms can be seen as laws in Lululemon leggings, they still cover the same areas. The old constitutional norm about senators not negotiating freelance with foreign countries was enforceable in circumstances where the Senate elders controlled the Senate newbies. In an era of minimal legislative discipline and maximal search for public exposure, being loud, young, obnoxious, and in the Senate is cost-free. Or at least it is when your base wants you to be loud and obnoxious and disrespectful. One of the most interesting phenomena in modern American politics is the silence of Al Franken, who is apparently respecting the Minnesota norm that you ought to be a Norm, a regular guy who doesn’t get too loud too soon, even in his second Senate term.","1312","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-inequality-and-the-battle-of-american-norms"
"The play between norms and laws is one of the great subjects of literature. Should Achilles give back Hector’s body to the Trojans? It’s only a battlefield norm, but the Iliad turns on it. The great novels of norms—American norms, at least—are the four books in John Updike’s Rabbit series, which are, exactly, all about the price of accepting the norms that a middle-class society imposes on the average sensual male (or female) citizen. Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom marries his pregnant girlfriend, stays with her dutifully after various failed attempts at escape to a life of more immediate gratifications, and then has the ironic sense, as the books go on, that he is the only one in America still sticking to the old self-imprisoning norms. Group sex comes in the door, and the inhibitions go right out the window. Is it an entrapping net or a reassuring pattern of premade choices? It depends on which side of the norm you’re sitting.","1313","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-inequality-and-the-battle-of-american-norms"
"Norms are choices that somebody else has made for you. Having to make them yourself can be disconcerting. What this shows us, class, is that to be modern is to be simultaneously aware of the value of norms to our sense of who we are, and of the cost of enforcing them to our sense of who we might become. At any moment, we may be more or less aware of the oppressive weight of social and constitutional norms, or of the lightness of head we feel, and the sense of justice gained, once they’re gone.

"When Akhmed Abdul Qadir Hussain was eighteen (or a little younger, by some accounts), in early 2002, he was arrested by the Pakistani police, who gave him to American forces, who sent him to Guantánamo Bay. When he was about twenty-five, in 2009, the Guantánamo Review Task Force cleared him for release. It had taken seven years, but, as a Pentagon press release put it, “this man was unanimously approved for transfer by the six departments and agencies comprising the task force.” But he remained in Guantánamo for more than five additional years. Finally, on Wednesday, the Obama Administration announced that it had put Hussain on a plane to Estonia. He is not Estonian; he was born in Yemen. But now, at the age of about thirty-one, he will presumably learn at least the rudiments of the Estonian language, maybe while taking in the architecture in Talinn’s old city and on the Baltic coast. Four other Guantánamo prisoners were sent to Oman; they were also Yemeni. Each of them had been held for a dozen years or more, and each had also been cleared for release five years earlier. Neither they nor Hussain had ever been charged with anything.","January 15, 2015","1315","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/sent-guantanamo-teen-ager-now-estonia"

"Congress is informed before such releases, which might explain why, the day before the announcement, Republican Senators John McCain, Kelly Ayotte, and Lindsey Graham came out with a proposal for new Guantánamo legislation. It was not an effort to find a way to prevent teen-agers from being locked up for no good reason until they are in their thirties. Instead, it called for what would effectively be a moratorium on any transfers from Guantánamo. Under the proposal, no prisoner could be transferred to Yemen (although there are dozens of Yemenis who have been cleared for release) because Yemen, according to Ayotte, is “the Wild West.” And for the next two years, no prisoner who had received a medium-risk or high-risk designation could be released at all—never mind if nothing had ever been proved against him.","1317","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/sent-guantanamo-teen-ager-now-estonia"
"The medium-risk designation seems to be pretty easy to get; until his case was finally reviewed, Hussain was called that, on the ground that he had spent time at a guest house associated with the Taliban, where, the government argued, he had been “trained” (in what, exactly, isn’t really clear) and had access to a gun. In a 2008 assessment, he was also labelled as “a HIGH threat from a detention perspective,” because he had been “non-compliant and hostile to the guard force.” He hadn’t actually tried to attack anyone, but he had accumulated seventy-five disciplinary infractions, including “inappropriate use of bodily fluids,” with “the most recent occurring on 6 March 2008, when he refused to return a library book.”","1318","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/sent-guantanamo-teen-ager-now-estonia"
"Reading the paperwork, such as it is, that explains Hussain’s detention, one is struck by how little anyone seems to have considered that he was a teen-ager, and perhaps a minor, when he was put in a jumpsuit in a prison camp. But he would not have been the only juvenile—or even the youngest prisoner—at Guantánamo. The United States’s blindness about child prisoners is not confined to terrorism suspects; far too many underage suspects are sentenced and incarcerated as adults. It was only last week that New York City officials decided to stop putting prisoners under the age of twenty-one in solitary confinement at Rikers Island. (See Jennifer Gonnerman’s harrowing account of a childhood lost in that jail.) But not so many end up in Estonia.","1319","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/sent-guantanamo-teen-ager-now-estonia"
"This befuddlement seems to have extended to earlier reviews of Hussain’s case. When Judge Reggie B. Walton denied Hussain’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, in 2011, he discounted Hussain’s account of what he had been doing in Pakistan and Afghanistan, in part because Hussain seemed suspiciously unrealistic about what kind of job he could get, clueless about the motives of the older men he was spending time with, aimless when it came to registering for school, and not in a hurry to go home and get married—this, again, when he was seventeen. (The blog Lawfare posted a link to the decision.) Hussain explained that he’d lingered in Lahore because when he looked for plane tickets home they’d seemed too expensive, with too many layovers, and he had wanted a cheaper, direct flight. The judge found this to be a “nonsensical” explanation, “given that the more layovers a traveler must experience to reach his or her final destination generally results in a less expensive ticket for the traveler.” Doesn’t everyone know that?","1320","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/sent-guantanamo-teen-ager-now-estonia"
"When the judges on the D.C. Circuit Court heard an appeal of Walton’s denial, two years later, they upheld it, although Judge Harry T. Edwards, in his concurrence, at least sounded frustrated by where the “vagaries” of Guantánamo jurisprudence had led. “Is it really surprising that a teenager, or someone recounting his teenage years, sounds unbelievable? What is a judge to make of this, especially here, where there is not one iota of evidence that [he] ‘planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such . . . persons’?” (Linda Greenhouse wrote about the opinion a few weeks ago, before news of Hussain’s transfer.) Edwards said that he was “disquieted.” Other relevant words might involve shame.","1321","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/sent-guantanamo-teen-ager-now-estonia"
"President Barack Obama’s first executive order, on January 22, 2009, called for the closing of Guantánamo. There are still a hundred and twenty-two prisoners there, fifty-four of whom have been cleared for release. Fewer than a dozen have any sort of prosecution pending against them. The cases that are in motion—some against dangerous, murderous people, such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed—have been bungled and delayed, far more so than they would have been if they had been brought in, say, the Southern District of New York, where the World Trade Center stood (and is now standing again). After a period of paralysis, during which the Administration appeared to have more or less thrown up its hands, the President is trying again, one plane ticket to Uruguay, or to the Baltic states, at a time.","1322","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/sent-guantanamo-teen-ager-now-estonia"
"The Republicans have been pushing back, citing the recent attacks in Paris, and talking about recidivism—although recidivist, with the implication of a return to a life of crime, is a strange thing to call a person whom you’ve never charged with a crime in the first place. According to the Times, the White House has a theory that if it can get the number of prisoners in Guantánamo down to between sixty and eighty, “keeping it open would make no economic sense”—as if it makes any economic sense now, at three million dollars per year, per prisoner. Does the White House’s strategy for closing Guantánamo involve Congress acting rationally? It will need a better plan than that.","1323","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/sent-guantanamo-teen-ager-now-estonia"
"In public, at least, the reaction among Republicans to the decision the Supreme Court issued on Thursday to let the Affordable Care Act subsidies stand was uniform and predictable: outrage. “#ObamaCare ruling is judicial tyranny,” Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, commented on Twitter. Not to be outdone, Ted Cruz, one of Huckabee’s rivals in the upcoming G.O.P. primary, tweeted, “Any candidate not willing to make 2016 a referendum on Repealing Obamacare should step aside.”","June 25, 2015","1324","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-supreme-court-just-did-republicans-a-big-favor"
"The language from the three leading Republican candidates was a bit more measured, but their basic sentiments were pretty much the same. “This decision is not the end of the fight against Obamacare,” Jeb Bush wrote in a statement on his campaign Web site. “As President of the United States … I will work with Congress to repeal and replace this flawed law with conservative reforms that empower consumers with more choices and control over their health care decisions.”","1325","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-supreme-court-just-did-republicans-a-big-favor"
"“I disagree with the Court’s ruling and believe they have once again erred in trying to correct the mistakes made by President Obama,” Bush’s fellow Floridian, Senator Marco Rubio, said on Twitter, adding, in two more tweets, “I remain committed to repealing this bad law and replacing it… with my consumer-centered plan that puts patients and families back in control of their health care decisions.”","1326","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-supreme-court-just-did-republicans-a-big-favor"

"Elsewhere, Republicans tore into Chief Justice John Roberts, who voted with the six-to-three majority and wrote the opinion justifying the court’s decision. Some of his critics suggested that he could no longer be termed a conservative. ”I don’t know that you can label the guy in any way, shape or form right now,” Matt Salmon, a Republican congressman from Arizona, said, according to the Wall Street Journal. Senator Cruz and Indiana Governor Mike Pence both said that Roberts and his colleagues had committed the heinous crime of “judicial activism.” (My colleagues Amy Davidson and Jeffrey Toobin have more on the particulars of the decision.)","1328","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-supreme-court-just-did-republicans-a-big-favor"
"But despite all this rhetoric, I’d be willing to wager that many Republican strategists were privately relieved at the court’s ruling. The Burwell v. King lawsuit provided a rallying point for conservative Republicans, but had it prevailed in the high court it would have blown up in the faces of the Party’s elected representatives. Not only would they have been held responsible for wrecking the federal health-care marketplace and making health insurance unaffordable for millions of Americans, they would have had to say what precisely they intended to put in its place. Despite the claims of Bush, Rubio, and others, this is a task that the Party wasn’t prepared to take on.","1329","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-supreme-court-just-did-republicans-a-big-favor"
"To be sure, over the past few months, various Republicans have put forward various suggestions for replacing all or parts of Obamacare. But these plans are all over the place. Some would maintain the generous federal subsidies as they are now; others would cut them. Some would leave the state exchanges alone; others would dismantle them. At least one proposal would jettison the requirement that insurers cover people with preëxisting conditions. And practically all of them would end the individual mandate, which would skew the risk pool toward sick people and drive up premiums. In a recent article in which she described how each of the plans would work, Vox’s Sarah Kliff wrote, “The result would likely be a world that looks much more like America before Obamacare—where fewer people are enrolled in coverage and are paying higher premiums.”","1330","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-supreme-court-just-did-republicans-a-big-favor"
"Going into an election year, that is hardly something that the G.O.P.’s 2016 candidates would want to advertise. Now that the Supreme Court has ruled against the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell, Republicans can go back to what they do best: railing against the evils of Obamacare and promising to repeal it, without committing to much in the way of specifics about its putative replacement.","1331","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-supreme-court-just-did-republicans-a-big-favor"
"To their credit, some commentators pointed out some of this before Thursday’s judgment came down. The New Republic’s Brian Beutler wrote that a court ruling in favor of the King v. Burwell plaintiffs would be “an administrative and political nightmare” for a newly elected Republican President. At Talking Points Memo, Josh Marshall wrote a post headlined “Did Republicans Swallow Their Own Grenade?” Greg Sargent, of the Washington Post, published figures showing the numbers of people in key swing states who stood to lose their health coverage if the Supreme Court voted to gut the federal exchanges. “In Florida we’re talking about 1.3 million people,” Sargent wrote. “In North Carolina it’s over 450,000; and in Virginia it’s nearly 300,000—suggesting the political stakes are high indeed.”","1332","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-supreme-court-just-did-republicans-a-big-favor"
"The people running G.O.P. Presidential campaigns were surely aware of these figures, and the dangers they implied. But such is the level of opposition to the Affordable Care Act among Republican activists that it made no sense for any of the candidates to do anything but toe the party line. Even Bush and Carly Fiorina, who are supposedly positioning themselves as moderates, went along with it—and they continue to do so. “It is outrageous that the Supreme Court once again rewrote ObamaCare to save this deeply flawed law,” Fiorina wrote on Facebook on Thursday, before adding the obligatory, “We need to repeal ObamaCare.”","1333","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-supreme-court-just-did-republicans-a-big-favor"
"During the upcoming G.O.P. debates, we will hear much more of this kind of rhetoric, although how much it will help the Party in the general election is unclear. Taken together, the opinion polls suggest that a plurality of Americans still oppose the Affordable Care Act. But there is some suggestion that opinion is shifting. This year, the numbers favoring Obamacare have been creeping upward, and in the most recent CBS News/New York Times poll, forty-seven per cent of respondents said that they approved of the reform, compared to forty-four per cent who opposed it.","1334","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-supreme-court-just-did-republicans-a-big-favor"
"It seems unlikely that Obamacare will decide the 2016 election, but it will continue to provide Republicans with something to rail against. For that, and more, the G.O.P. has John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy to thank.

"Hannity’s fears have proved to be well grounded. On Wednesday, the former senator Rick Santorum, who had been the runner-up to Mitt Romney in the 2012 G.O.P. primary, announced his candidacy. On Thursday, it will be the turn of George Pataki, the former governor of New York. Who knows whom Friday will bring? Lindsey Graham? Rick Perry? Donald Trump? Herman (999) Cain? Ted Nugent?","1354","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"Here, in alphabetical order, are the eight Republican candidates who, by Thursday, will be officially running: Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, Pataki, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Santorum. Then there are Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, two front-runners who have all but announced that they are in. Currently in the “exploratory” stage, we have Graham, Trump, Bobby Jindal, John Kasich, and the benighted Chris Christie. That makes fifteen, with other outlying possibilities, too.","1355","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"The number turns out to be too high for Roger Ailes, Hannity’s boss at Fox News. The network (along with Facebook) is set to host the first televised G.O.P. debate, in Cleveland, on August 6th, and it has said that it intends to limit participation to the top ten candidates in the polls, plus those who are tied. “It was a difficult call based on political necessity,” Howard Kurtz, the veteran media reporter, who now works for Fox, explained in a post on Tuesday. “With 17 or 18 Republicans gearing up to run, you simply can’t have a viable debate with all of them. Each candidate would receive a miniscule amount of time. No sustained questioning would be possible. And it would be bad television.”","1356","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"Not everyone associated with the Republican Party is happy about Fox’s decision. Appearing on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Wednesday, Bill Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard, accused Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, of colluding with Fox to cull the field prematurely. “There are fourteen candidates who are serious people,” Kristol said (doubtless prompting a protest call from Trump). “I think they all deserve to be on the stage.” He proposed that they have two debates, with the candidates split up randomly. “Republicans would be interested. They wouldn’t turn off the TV halfway through.”","1357","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"Kristol raises a good point. If Fox applied its proposed criteria on the basis of current polling data collated by Real Clear Politics, Santorum, who won eleven state primaries in 2012, would barely make the cut. Fiorina, the only female candidate, who has reportedly impressed Republican audiences in Iowa and New Hampshire, would miss out. So would Graham, Jindal, and Kasich, all experienced elected officials. That doesn’t seem fair, or even particularly democratic. So what to do?","1358","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"The G.O.P. needs a procedure that affords all of the candidates an opportunity to impress while also acknowledging that voters (and viewers) can’t be expected to take all fifteen or twenty candidates seriously. One solution might be to turn the early stages of the G.O.P. primary into a version of “Survivor,” the long-running reality-television series.","1359","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"Here’s how it could work. Following Kristol’s suggestion, Fox and Facebook would hold two debates on August 6th, with the candidates drawing lots to decide whether they appeared on the first or the second one. Each would receive the same amount of airtime, and the questions in the two debates would be broadly similar.","1360","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"For the second debate, which CNN is scheduled to host from the Reagan Library, in Simi Valley, on September 16th, things would be different. A limit of twelve candidates would be imposed. Rather than follow the “Survivor” template literally, and have the candidates themselves decide who gets to appear at the debate and who doesn’t, it would be best to rely on surveys of likely Republican voters. The top dozen candidates in the poll of polls on September 9th, a week before the debate, would make the cut; everybody else would miss out. I’d leave it to the network executives and the R.N.C. to decide whether this debate would need to be split in two, like the first one. (CNN has suggested an alternative format for its event, using the full slate of candidates, in which the top ten candidates appear in one debate and the rest in another.)","1361","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"The winnowing process wouldn’t end there. For the third debate, which will take place in October, there would be another cut, to ten candidates, with the poll of polls again deciding who is invited. And for the fourth debate, in November, there would be a final cut, to eight candidates.","1362","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"By that stage, the G.O.P.’s Iowa caucus would be on the horizon—it’s now slated for February 2nd, but may well move up a bit—and the field might be starting to narrow of its own accord, regardless. But for now, and for the next few months, there are too many candidates, and some way of treating them equitably needs to be found.","1363","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"My solution perhaps isn’t the best. Quite probably, it would favor candidates who have raised enough money to launch advertising campaigns and boost their poll numbers—but the current system does that anyway. Another possible objection is that focussing attention on the minor players would blur the message of the front-runners. I doubt that would happen. Bush, Rubio, and Walker would still get the bulk of the media’s attention.","1364","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"

"Since returning to the helm of the conservative Union for a Popular Movement (U.M.P.), six months ago, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been looking for ways to distract the nation from the divisive appeal of Marine Le Pen’s National Front, from the small triumphs of what is otherwise a desperately unpopular Socialist administration, and from an accumulating pile of lawsuits. His party’s victory in regional elections in March was a good start, which he helped along by flirting with the far-right National Front’s electorate, promising that, in line with French values, all public-school students would be required to eat pork for lunch. But his latest move is his most virtuosic yet: he is changing the name of the party. Sarkozy’s new outfit will be called “Les Républicains.”","May 28, 2015","1366","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-french-republican-party"
"For the U.M.P., a name change is not an unorthodox play—the party has done it five times in the past seventy years. In 1947, Charles de Gaulle founded the Rassemblement du Peuple Français (R.P.F.), the blueprint for the modern conservative party, which has taken on a new name about once a decade, as party leaders have attempted to consolidate power and occasionally distance themselves from scandal. Sarkozy’s motivation is, in part, an affair that has become known as Bygmalion, in which eleven million euros in false invoices were billed to the U.M.P. to hide overspending on Sarkozy’s unsuccessful reëlection campaign. Bygmalion forced the previous U.M.P. leader, Jean-François Copé, to step down, but it somehow hasn’t yet definitely touched Sarkozy. Since de Gaulle, French conservatives have rallied under three anodyne terms that yield three-letter acronyms (de Gaulle’s R.P.F. and U.N.R., Jacques Chirac’s R.P.R. and U.M.P.). A conservative splinter group called the Parti Républicain was founded in the nineteen-seventies, but for mainstream conservatism Sarkozy is opting for a radical break.","1367","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-french-republican-party"
"“Why do I hold tight to the word ‘Republic’?” Sarkozy asked during a speech in Nice, in April. “Because each one among us here today must know what he owes to the Republic. And the difference between the left and us is that the left is Socialist first, and then Republican; we are Republicans first, then Gaullist, liberal, centrist, radical. It’s a big difference,” he said, finishing with an authoritative flourish of the hand. This is immaculate posturing on Sarkozy’s part—far-right voters know that the idea of putting the Republic first speaks to their concerns about the changing face of France, while the phrasing allows Sarkozy to avoid charged and xenophobic invocations of “national identity.”","1368","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-french-republican-party"
"The difficulty, for Sarkozy, is that any graduate of L’Éducation Nationale can tell you what it means to be a subject of the French Republic—that is, a Republican—and Sarkozy’s attempt to appropriate the term has been viewed as a violation of the social pact, even by members of the U.M.P. “By definition, the Republic gathers together people who have different conceptions of the general interest, but who identify with something greater,” Edouard Philippe, a U.M.P. deputy who is allied with one of Sarkozy’s interparty rivals, told Libération. “In calling ourselves ‘The Republicans,’ it’s as though we are emptying the Republic of its meaning. I find that dangerous.” A group of attorneys and civil-society organizations filed a petition in court to try to stop Sarkozy from “monopolizing” the term, but the court found the claim to be baseless. “When the Republican Guard marches down the Champs-Élysées, children are going to wonder why the Sarkozian Guard is marching!” one of the attorneys complained.","1369","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-french-republican-party"
"Bewilderingly, Sarkozy doesn’t seem to be bothered by the name’s most obvious problems. Mitch McConnell and John Boehner are not popular politicians in Europe, let alone in France, where their party’s antics are often seen as symptomatic of the worst strains of American provincialism. Accordingly, Jean-Christophe Cambadélis, the secretary of the rival Socialist Party, prepared to coat Paris in twenty thousand flyers bearing a red-and-blue-star-studded image of Sarkozy, in jeans and a checked oxford shirt, sleeves rolled back and smirking through blackened Ray-Bans, atop (of all things) a white horse, “Texan-cowboy-style,” as Le Figaro put it. “Nicolas Sarkozy is fascinated by the American right, and George W. Bush in particular,” Cambadélis explained on the radio a few weeks ago, deploying a name that amounts to a virulent insult in French political culture.","1370","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-french-republican-party"
"Sarkozy is putting the name change to a vote at a U.M.P. Party congress in Paris this weekend, though its adoption is more or less a fait accompli. It is also only a preamble to the next movement of Sarkozy’s career, another run for the Presidency, in 2017, which looks increasingly likely to succeed. When Sarkozy ran for President for the first time, in 2007, his populist gloss, his unabashedly capitalistic tastes, and his fearlessness in the face of the unions were seen as a novelty in French politics. “A decade ago, it would have been inconceivable to have found a Parisian intellectual like the writer Pascal Bruckner supporting a rightist candidate like Sarkozy,” David Rieff wrote in the Times Magazine at the time. “But as Bruckner put it to me recently, Sarkozy ‘wants to give a kick in the rear to our old, decrepit country, to put an end to the French feeling of self-hatred.’”","1371","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-french-republican-party"
"Now Sarkozy’s style is no longer novel, but as a prospective candidate he may be benefiting from a dearth of other options. A recent poll revealed that seventy-seven per cent of French voters do not want Socialist President François Hollande to run for reëlection. Surely, much of the disregard for the current President has to do with his rhetorical deficits: in 2013, in one of the more memorable moments of his Presidency, he made an offer of amnesty to a deported Kosovar child while sounding, as usual, like he was establishing a bureaucratic subcommittee.

"Almost ten years after he assumed the Presidency, however, he has acquired some serious political liabilities. Pending lawsuits allege that Sarkozy accepted fifty million euros in campaign donations from Muammar Qaddafi, and conspired with his lawyer to obtain sealed information about the Qaddafi investigation by promising a judge a post in Monaco. He has picked up other bizarre alliances along the way. Lately, Sarkozy appears to have adopted an apologist stance on Vladimir Putin, putting himself at odds with most mainstream Western leaders. He stated during a party meeting in February that “Crimea chose Russia—we cannot reproach them for that,” and added, “It is certainly necessary to find the means to intervene to protect the Russophones in Ukraine so long as the situation there has not calmed down.” This may be more posturing, an attempt to make a show of support for the conservative values associated with the Russian President, but it will be a big problem for him should he retake the Presidency.","1374","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-french-republican-party"

Fox, the host of the first debate, has said that it will invite the top ten candidates in surveys of likely Republican voters.

(Smith said that the White House’s NASA budget request favored the earth sciences “at the expense of the other science divisions and human and robotic space exploration.”) Johnson tried to get the cuts eliminated from the bill, but her proposed amendment was rejected.

It means that not only will climate studies be ignored; some potentially useful data won’t even be collected.","1393","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/gop-war-on-science-gets-worse"
"The vote brought howls of protest from NASA itself and from wider earth-science circles. The agency’s administrator, Charles Bolden, issued a statement saying that the bill “guts our Earth science program and threatens to set back generations worth of progress in better understanding our changing climate.” In an opinion piece for the Washington Post, Marshall Shepherd, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Georgia and the former president of the American Meteorological Association, said that he could not sleep after hearing about the vote. “None of us has a ‘vacation planet’ we can go to for the weekend, so I argue that NASA’s mission to study planet Earth should be a ‘no-brainer,’ ” he wrote.","1394","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/gop-war-on-science-gets-worse"

"But before you think of moving to Canada for a year and a half, or tuning out and reading Tolstoy and Dickens, take a peek at a new analysis of the American political firmament by Sean Trende and David Byler, of the Web site Real Clear Politics. It’s a data-driven article that examines what’s happening not only in Washington but in legislatures and statehouses around the country, which also have a significant impact on people’s lives. Trende and Byler conclude that the Republican Party is already stronger than it has been for many decades. With a good result in 2016, including a takeover of the White House, it could virtually sweep the board. Indeed, Trende and Byler say, the Republicans could end up in their strongest position since 1920, the year women got the vote.","1401","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-2016-is-so-very-important"
"If the spectre of today’s Republican Party monopolizing most of the levers of power at the federal, congressional, and state levels isn’t enough to get people exercised about 2016, I don’t know what is. From tax and spending policy to health insurance, foreign policy, and social issues like gun control and gay marriage, the country would be subjected to a concerted effort to roll back time. While the Senate filibuster and the courts might exercise some restraint on the G.O.P. victors, many members of the Party would be determined to use their position of dominance to set the country on a regressive, rightward path.","1402","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-2016-is-so-very-important"
"Is this too alarmist? One can quibble with the power index that Trende and Byler constructed to gauge the political influence of each party, which consists of five equally weighted parts: Presidential performance, House of Representatives performance, U.S. Senate performance, gubernatorial performance, and state legislative performance. (“Performance” refers to measures of electoral performance, rather than of governance.) Perhaps the Presidency should be assigned more importance than the national and local legislatures. Another pertinent criticism is that the two analysts don’t weight state governorships by population, which means, for example, that the victory of a Republican governor in Arkansas counts for as much as that of a Democratic governor in California.","1403","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-2016-is-so-very-important"
"Still, the Trende and Byler power index has the merit of being straightforward, and it enables the analysis to be taken all the way back to the Civil War. In 1866, Lincoln’s G.O.P. scored a hundred and eight, a number it has never again attained. The Republicans’ worst ever score was recorded after the Roosevelt landslide of 1936: minus a hundred and nineteen. (A negative score for one party implies a positive score for the other.)","1404","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-2016-is-so-very-important"
"For much of the postwar period, the Democrats held a narrow lead over the Republicans on the power index, but this changed after the 2014 midterms, when the G.O.P. score jumped up to 33.8. The fifty-four seats the Republicans won in the Senate was their second-best result since 1928, and the two hundred and forty-seven seats they hold in the House is the highest since after the 1928 election, when Herbert Hoover trounced Al Smith. At the local level, the G.O.P. now has thirty-one governors, and it controls sixty-eight of ninety-eight partisan state legislatures, its best showing since 1920.","1405","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-2016-is-so-very-important"
"Trende and Byler concede that their portrait of Republican dominance “is at odds with the prevailing theme of a Republican Party with serious demographic problems,” which “make it difficult for the GOP to win the presidency.” But they also point out that “those same shifts have strengthened it in the states, which is where most lawmaking takes place.” (In an earlier article, Byler pointed out how partisan redistricting has also helped Republicans at the local level.) The two analysts conclude: “None of this is to say that Republicans are building a permanent majority of any sort. It is simply to say that when one takes account of the full political picture, the Republican Party is stronger than it has been in most of our readers’ lifetimes. This is important, and more analysis should take account of this fact.”","1406","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-2016-is-so-very-important"
"It should—and indignant voters should pay attention, too. At this stage, Democratic control of the White House is about the only thing holding the Republicans back, but they are far from invulnerable. Thanks to the big gains they made in the midterms of 2010 and 2014, they will be defending a lot of seats at the national and state level that are potentially up for grabs. Indeed, Trende and Byler note that, “a bad Republican year could place the party ‘in the red,’ with its share of the presidential vote, Senate, House and state legislatures falling precipitously.” In short, the 2016 election could bring a quick end to Republican gains, or it could assign the G.O.P. a position of dominance.

"However, what is good for the Party over all is not necessarily good for individual candidates.

"While there was widespread condemnation of Trump’s comments from Democrats and many media commentators, Trump’s Republican rivals remained largely silent. (Senator Lindsey Graham was a notable exception.) The obvious reason behind this silence is that many voters in the G.O.P. primaries are sympathetic to Trump on the issue of immigration. Yes, the typical Republican candidate might think that the G.O.P., in general, needs to condemn anti-immigrant bigots. But there’s no benefit for any one candidate to speak up. A look at the polls supports this cynical analysis: much of Trump’s rise, which has been fuelled by his immigration tirades, has come at the expense of his most conservative rivals, who all see their opening in the race to the right of Jeb Bush, the candidate of the Republican establishment.","1412","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"
"Unlike the “rapists” remark, however, the remark about McCain’s capture wasn’t a close call. With the exception of Ted Cruz, who seems to be setting himself up as the Trump voter’s second choice, every Republican Presidential candidate rushed to social media to pillory Trump. That, however, may be too little and too late. If the Party’s long-term existential crisis, especially at the Presidential level, is with Latinos, then it not only missed an opportunity to stand with a population being crassly caricatured by a demagogue, it also signalled that attacking immigrants is O.K., while attacking veterans is out of bounds. The condemnation of the “capture” comment, in that sense, then makes the lack of condemnation of the “rapists” comment look even worse.","1413","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"

"One possible interpretation of these figures is that we are witnessing a temporary phenomenon. At some not-too-distant point, Trump will blow up and the real business of electing a G.O.P. candidate will resume. Having argued along these lines myself a couple of weeks ago, I wouldn’t dismiss the argument, but it needs amending. The longer Trump stays in the race, the more damage he is doing to the Republican Party and its prospects of winning back the White House.","1427","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"At this stage, he isn’t merely leading in the horse-race polls, which can change rapidly. His overweening presence is driving the G.O.P. toward policy positions, particularly on immigration, that make it virtually unelectable. As Karl Rove and other Republican strategists have realized since the late nineteen-nineties, the party’s future depends on attracting Hispanic voters in such battleground states as Colorado, Florida, and Nevada. Now, Trump is pushing a plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, deport undocumented immigrants, and deprive the children of undocumented parents the right to U.S. citizenship. And other G.O.P. candidates are following his lead.","1428","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"Ted Cruz has praised Trump for focusing on immigration. On Monday, Scott Walker, said that he, too, would eliminate the automatic right to citizenship for children born to undocumented immigrants. Yet another candidate who is struggling in the polls, Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, said the same thing on Twitter. About the only Republicans who pushed back publicly against Trump’s immigration proposal were Carly Florina, who said it was “completely unrealistic”; Lindsay Graham, who described it as “gibberish”; and Kasich, who bravely defended the idea of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, calling them “a very important part of most of our communities.” Jeb Bush, who also supports a path to citizenship, was conspicuously quiet.","1429","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"Perhaps that’s not surprising. The problem that candidates like Bush and Kasich face is that it’s not just Trump’s celebrity and outspokenness that are attracting support. Many Republican voters say they like Trump on the issues, as unrealistic as his proposals are. When CNN’s pollsters asked Republicans which candidate could best handle illegal immigration, forty-four per cent of them said Trump. Bush came in second, with just twelve per cent.","1430","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"

On the economy, he led Bush by forty-five per cent to eight per cent. (Fiorina came in third place, with six per cent.) On handling ISIS, Trump’s lead was a bit smaller, but he still got thirty-two per cent compared to Bush’s sixteen per cent.

In a letter to Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, he observed that “having debates between Democratic and Republican candidates during the primary process” would “engage large numbers of voters who typically do not pay attention to the process until much later, when the general election begins to come into focus.” This, he said, would “get people to participate at higher levels.”","1436","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"

This might encourage a certain discipline. The members of each side would be reminded that what distinguishes them from one another is less important than what distinguishes them from the members of the other side. Nobody would want to be the one whose jab at a teammate provides an opportunity for real-time gloating by the other side. (“I have to agree with Mr. Chafee about Secretary Clinton’s scandalous speech fees.” “Senator Rubio said it better than I could about Jeb Bush’s mediocre record in Florida.”) Everyone on the stage would have to be conscious of an electorate beyond his or her own party’s base.

"This will be the first and the last time Donald Trump is described as a model of restraint, but let it be said: at his Presidential announcement speech, in New York last Tuesday, Trump managed to stand in front of a microphone for more than forty minutes, his mouth moving for the duration, without taking a single jab at Hillary Clinton. In this way he distinguished himself from the rest of the Republican field. The day before, in Miami, Jeb Bush swiped at Clinton—twice by name and a few more times by obvious implication—in his own announcement speech. Last month, launching his campaign, Marco Rubio posited himself as a perfect contrast to Clinton, warning that “a leader from yesterday began a campaign for President by promising to take us back to yesterday. Yesterday is over.” (So is Trump’s restraint: within hours of his speech, he flew to Des Moines and accused Clinton of “playing the woman card really big. I watched her the other day, and all she would talk about was ‘Women! Women! I’m a woman!’ ”)","June 22, 2015","1445","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"
"Even if Clinton weren’t the only viable Democrat in the race, she would hold a special place in the Republican line of fire. Hillary is hated by the right in a way that Martin O’Malley can only dream of being hated. This is true across the conservative spectrum. While some candidates (Rand Paul) are trying to lock in the libertarian vote, and others (Bush, Rubio) are wooing the reform-minded, all are playing to the anti-Clinton caucus (none more insistently than Carly Fiorina, the former C.E.O. of H.P., whose belligerence toward Clinton is approaching self-parody). Now, with Clinton officially running and the Republican field nearly complete, the scattershot censure of the past few months has begun to coalesce into several reasonably distinct lines of attack.

The “brick phone,” in fact, is a favorite reference of Rubio, who is forty-four, and who has said that the Clintons arrived in Washington back when people were lugging those two-pounders around. Never mind that Motorola’s DynaTAC 8000X is a relic of the Reagan era, not of the nineteen-nineties (the age of the clamshell).

"Savor the irony, if you’re into that sort of thing, that it was Mitt Romney who appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” last week and urged voters to “look at how much money [Hillary Clinton has] been making.” Romney questioned how Clinton can “sell a populist message when she makes in one hour a multiple of what the average American will make in a year.” Those would be the same Americans who, Romney claimed in 2012, “believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.” Though Romney is not running for President this time, he is lending a hand by stoking resentment against his own class. Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chairman, has also found his inner egalitarian, telling a gathering of conservatives in February that “if there’s not a private luxury jet and a quarter-million-dollar speaking fee waiting for her, you can forget” seeing Hillary Clinton in public. Among the candidates, Rick Santorum attacks Clinton as a tool of “corporate interests,” and Jeb Bush—the chairman and manager of at least three offshore private equity funds—paints her as one of the “pampered élites.”","1450","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"

"Critics have labelled Clinton a radical since at least 1980, when her refusal to change her last name to her husband’s became an issue in his losing campaign for reëlection as the governor of Arkansas. Her stewardship of the failed health-care plan during the Clinton Administration associated her with “big government,” though she has done little in the past twenty years to reinforce that impression. No matter. If the Democrats ran a blue dog for President—not a centrist “blue dog” Democrat but an actual, barking blue dog—Republicans would call it a “liberal,” as Fiorina, Bush, and others are calling Clinton now. To Fiorina, Clinton’s announcement speech was a “long litany of left-wing causes”; Walker saw it as confirmation that “her views are out of touch with mainstream America.” Bush has been more precise. In April, he e-mailed supporters about a speech that Clinton gave on the rights of women and girls. “Hillary Clinton,” Bush wrote, “said that people’s deep-seated religious beliefs need to be changed in order to advance her own personal political agenda. Wow.” She didn’t say that, but Bush—to ingratiate himself with the religious right, which distrusts him—repeated the charge last Monday. The Republican electorate is being primed to expect the annihilation of individual freedom under a Hillary Clinton Administration. (Obama, it appears, hasn’t finished the job.)

Fiorina has been goading Clinton to “name an accomplishment” from her time at the State Department, while Fiorina’s rivals see a highlight reel of destruction. Ted Cruz has been rumbling about the “Obama-Clinton” axis for months now. Bush charges that a “phone-it-in foreign policy” is “leaving a legacy of crises uncontained, violence unopposed, enemies unnamed, friends undefended, and alliances unravelling.” (If that sounds like the rap on his brother’s Administration, Jeb is leaving the ironies unacknowledged.)

"“I think people wonder,” Romney said on “Morning Joe,” “can they really trust Hillary Clinton?” Not if the G.O.P. can help it. And, in truth, Clinton has not helped herself on this score. Her use of a personal e-mail account to conduct State Department business and the Clinton Foundation’s acceptance of donations from foreign governments have stoked the engines of indignation on the right. Fiorina told a group of party activists that Clinton “tweets about women’s rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights.” To Cruz, Clinton “embodies the corruption of Washington,” which is putting it mildly compared to Rand Paul, who charges both Clintons, flatly, with thinking that “they are above the law.”","1456","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"

Last Wednesday, Quinnipiac reported a “continuing slide” in the percentage of swing-state voters who view Clinton as honest and trustworthy. In Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, the trust deficit is eight to fourteen points. It is unclear whether the Republican candidates can claim credit for this, or whether news coverage is what has driven Clinton’s numbers down.

"There is danger for Clinton in the trust gap, if it opens wider. When a candidate isn’t trusted to say what she means or do what she says, then it ceases to matter, really, what proposals she offers on renewable energy. But “trust,” as measured by polling firms, is an abstraction. The question that will decide the election is not “Do you trust this nominee?” but “Do you trust this nominee more than you trust the other nominee to make progress on the issues that matter to you?” On that question, Clinton should like her odds. While Bush, in the Quinnipiac poll, beats Clinton by four points on who’s more “honest and trustworthy,” Clinton tops him by fourteen points on “who understands the problems of people like you.” Bush isn’t alone in this deficiency. The whole Republican field is proudly, doggedly committed to a set of economic policies that reinforce the party’s identification with the already prosperous, and that has lost the popular vote in five out of the past six Presidential elections.","1458","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"

He defended the “broken windows” model of policing pioneered by Rudy Giuliani. He bemoaned the “pathologies being built around people who are poor, that they’re going to stay poor,” and asked, “How do you create a system of support that doesn’t create dependency?” He also praised Toya Graham, the Baltimore mother who was videotaped smacking her sixteen-year-old son for joining the rioters: “It was a nice visual symbol of what needs to be restored.”","1469","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/g-o-p-presidential-race-freddie-gray-baltimore"

"The long, bad aftertaste of NAFTA—the North American Free Trade Agreement, enacted in 1994—explains much of the Democratic opposition to the T.P.P. Ronald Reagan originally proposed NAFTA, but Bill Clinton championed it, got it through Congress mainly on Republican votes, and signed it. In many Democratic districts, NAFTA is still widely blamed for the loss of hundreds of thousands of American manufacturing jobs, and for long-term downward pressure on wages. When President Obama argues that the T.P.P. is not NAFTA, he is correct. It convenes Pacific Rim nations and economies of many stripes, from wealthy, democratic Japan to authoritarian, impoverished Vietnam, and it includes six countries with which the United States already has free-trade agreements. If enacted, it will encompass forty per cent of global economic activity. It is less a traditional trade deal than a comprehensive economic treaty and, at least for the United States, a strategic hedge against the vast and growing weight of Chinese regional influence. What exactly the T.P.P. will do, however, is difficult to know, because its terms are being negotiated in secret. Only “cleared advisors,” most of them representing various private industries, are permitted to work on the text. Leaked drafts of chapters have occasionally surfaced—enough to alarm, among others, environmentalists, labor groups, and advocates for affordable medicine.","1477","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-does-obama-want-the-trans-pacific-partnership-so-badly"
"Some of the fear and loathing inspired by the T.P.P. is hard to take seriously. Conservative opponents of immigration reform, for instance, have descried in the T.P.P. a Trojan horse, inside which, they fear, the dreaded immigration reform will be smuggled into law. (Paul Ryan has tried to debunk this notion, calling it an “urban legend.”) There are House Republicans who seemingly refuse to support any measure that Obama wants, simply because he wants it. Last week, contemplating the approaching fast-track vote, Representative Ryan Zinke, of Montana, said, “We are talking about giving Barack Obama—a President who negotiates with rogue nations like Iran and Cuba—exorbitant authority to do what he thinks is best.” Zinke, a former Navy SEAL commander, went on, “I don’t have faith that President Obama will negotiate in the best interest of Montana or America.”","1478","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-does-obama-want-the-trans-pacific-partnership-so-badly"
"More substantive objections to the T.P.P. have emerged from senators and representatives, who are now allowed, under strictly controlled conditions—in a guarded basement room under the Capitol, with no note-taking—to read drafts of the eight-hundred-page agreement. Senator Elizabeth Warren has criticized its provisions for “investor-state dispute settlement.” I.S.D.S. allows corporations to sue governments over laws that may adversely affect “expected future profits.” Environmental regulations, public-health measures, and even minimum-wage laws can be challenged under I.S.D.S., which is already a feature of many trade agreements. A Swedish power company is currently suing Germany, seeking $4.6 billion in damages, because of steps Germany is taking to phase out nuclear power, and Philip Morris is suing to prevent Uruguay and Australia from implementing policies to reduce smoking. Under the T.P.P., the international tribunals that would hear such cases would not, according to Warren, be staffed by judges but by a rotating cast of corporate lawyers. Challenges to American laws should at least be lodged, she argues, in American courts.","1479","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-does-obama-want-the-trans-pacific-partnership-so-badly"
"WikiLeaks has published T.P.P. draft chapters on investment, the environment, and two versions, from 2013 and 2014, of the intellectual-property-rights chapter. The environment chapter was a major disappointment to activists who had been led to believe that it would contain real enforcement mechanisms. In the Sierra Club’s analysis, the T.P.P. will generate a rapid increase in exports of American liquefied natural gas, which will in turn lead to more fracking, more methane emissions, a shift of the domestic energy market from gas toward coal, and the exacerbation of climate change. The proposed intellectual-property agreements appear to have been dictated by the entertainment, tech, and pharmaceutical industries. Doctors Without Borders declared that, if the drug-patent provisions do not change in the final draft, the T.P.P. is on track to become “the most harmful trade pact ever for access to medicines” in developing countries. With each glimpse of the draft chapters, the coalition opposing the agreement grows. Even a “sweetener” in the form of assistance for workers who lose their jobs because of trade agreements turns out to be partly financed by a seven-hundred-million-dollar raid on Medicare. Now Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder, is trying to raise a hundred thousand dollars through crowdsourcing, planning to offer the money as a reward to anyone who leaks the entire T.P.P. text—twenty-nine chapters’ worth.","1480","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-does-obama-want-the-trans-pacific-partnership-so-badly"
"With the fast-track authority that President Obama seeks, he would be able to negotiate trade agreements and present them to Congress for an up-or-down vote, with no amendments or filibusters permitted. Such agreements would then require only fifty-one votes, not sixty, to pass. Paul Ryan recently said, on CNN, that “every President since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had” some form of fast-track authority. That is not quite right—Richard Nixon never got it, although he initiated the modern version of it. Still, not having it plainly galls Obama. And his only realistic hope of enacting the T.P.P. now turns on getting fast-track authority from the House.","1481","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-does-obama-want-the-trans-pacific-partnership-so-badly"
"The Senate passed fast-track last month, sixty-two to thirty-seven, with only fourteen Democrats voting yes. Boehner and Ryan expect to be able to produce two hundred Republican votes. That means eighteen Democratic votes are needed. Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader, is reported to be working closely with Boehner and Ryan to come up with the number they need—although she still hasn’t said which way she’ll vote herself. That’s how strange the legislative politics of the T.P.P. have become. Nearly every constituency in the Democratic Party opposes it; and the more they learn about it, the more they oppose it. And yet their leader, Obama, wants it badly.","1482","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-does-obama-want-the-trans-pacific-partnership-so-badly"
"But why? Maybe it’s a better agreement—better for the American middle class, for American workers—than it seems in the leaked drafts, where it appears bent to the will of multinational corporations. John Kerry, the Secretary of State, and Ashton Carter, the Secretary of Defense, co-authored a column on Monday in USA Today arguing, in evangelical tones, that the T.P.P. will usher in a glorious new era of American-led prosperity, a “global race to the top” for all parties. Meanwhile, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. sees only a race to the bottom. Organized labor, by all accounts, plans to punish any elected Democrat who supports the T.P.P., or even supports fast-track for Obama, in the next campaign. It’s difficult, again, to evaluate the agreement when we can’t see it. And it will be difficult for Congress to do its job if its members can’t study each part of the many-tentacled T.P.P. on its merits, but must simply vote yes or no on the whole shebang. What’s the rush? Is it simply Obama’s wish to make his mark on history and to complete his pivot toward Asia before his time is up? Politicians are often accused of supporting pro-corporate policies to please wealthy backers, looking toward the next campaign. That can’t be Obama’s motive now.","1483","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-does-obama-want-the-trans-pacific-partnership-so-badly"

"On consecutive days last week, two Republican senators, both of whom are hoping to be the next President, released videos in which they destroyed stuff. First, Rand Paul went at a pile of paper, which he said was the United States tax code, with fire, a wood chipper, and a chain saw. (He wore safety goggles—he may be against regulations, but he’s also an ophthalmologist.) The next day saw Lindsey Graham attacking his Samsung flip phone with a cleaver, a blender, and a golf club. He also dropped a concrete block on it, threw it off a roof, and doused it with lighter fluid and ignited it. These videos suggest that Fox News, which is co-hosting the first G.O.P. Presidential debate, in Cleveland, on August 6th, should have in place firm rules regarding props, and that, perhaps, extra fire marshals should be deployed. With sixteen declared candidates, there is already a crowd-control problem; now the campaign threatens to be defined by demolition.","1489","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"The loose-haired agent of much of the chaos has been Donald J. Trump. About a week ago, John McCain, the Party’s nominee in 2008, told Ryan Lizza, a writer for this magazine, that Trump had “fired up the crazies” in the G.O.P. with his descriptions of undocumented immigrants as rapists. Trump demanded an apology, and said that, anyway, McCain is “not a war hero.” Graham then asked that Trump “stop being a jackass.” Any New Yorker, having witnessed decades of the Donald, could have told Graham that this wasn’t going to happen. On Tuesday, Trump gave out Graham’s personal cell-phone number at a televised event in South Carolina. “Let’s try it,” Trump told the crowd. That inspired Graham, who had complained that Trump was turning the race “into a circus,” to make his video.","1490","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"Some other numbers that became public last week may cause the Republican Party more worry. A Washington Post/ABC News poll showed Trump in the lead among the candidates, with twenty-four per cent of the vote. Scott Walker had thirteen per cent, followed by Jeb Bush (twelve), Mike Huckabee (eight), and then, in order of diminishing returns, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, Chris Christie, John Kasich (who signed on last week), Bobby Jindal, George Pataki, Rick Santorum, Carly Fiorina, and Lindsey Graham—in last place but with a chance of moving up, now that Trump has made sure that everyone knows where to reach him, as soon as he gets a new phone.","1491","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"The poll results matter, even now, more than a year before the election, because Fox and the Ohio Republican Party, which are co-hosting the first debate (with Facebook), have said that the final five national polls leading up to it will determine who takes part—just the top ten. If things keep going as they are, Trump will be front and center, and he may need to be restrained from slapping a gold-lettered nameplate on the lectern. Another reason that the stakes are so high is that other efforts to cull the field have failed. Jeb Bush, whose campaign and its associated super pac have raised more than a hundred million dollars, can’t shake off the insurgents. In an attempt to make the primaries less of a carnival than they were in 2012, Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, pushed to have only nine sanctioned debates. This creates a strong temptation for candidates to stage a scene while they can. The second debate, in September, hosted by CNN, will also use polls to limit the participants to ten. (CNN and Fox will both hold secondary events for any left-out candidates polling higher than one per cent.) For the hopefuls at the bottom of the list, this is the moment to make some noise.","1492","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"It’s hard enough to be heard in a crowded room without having to compete with a man who ended the week in Laredo, Texas, so that he could inspect the border, professing, “They say it’s a great danger, but I have to do it.” (He added that, once he is elected, “the Hispanics” are “going to love Trump.”) It’s harder still when you’re trying not to offend his supporters. After Trump insulted Mexicans last month, Bush said that he was personally offended, but others were more cautious. Christie commented that although some of Trump’s remarks may be “inappropriate,” he is “a good guy.” Cruz said, “I think he speaks the truth.” But if Trump weren’t around would the other Republicans behave that much more responsibly?","1493","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"There is a serious discussion to be had over the Iran deal, yet the G.O.P. contenders seem willing to shatter years of diplomacy in the name of grandstanding. Cruz announced that “the Obama Administration will become the leading financier of terrorism against America in the world,” and Graham thought that the deal looked like “a death sentence for the State of Israel.” Rubio, in a Trump-like move, said that Obama lacked “class.” Bush and Walker got into a fight about whether they’d renounce the deal and start planning military strikes on Inauguration Day or wait until the first Cabinet meeting. Saying it’s Trump who’s wrecking the Republican Party ignores the ways that he embodies it.","1494","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"Trump is not going to be elected, but he is intent enough on staying in the race to have filed financial-disclosure paperwork with the F.E.C.—a step that many observers thought he would stop short of—and he promptly put out a press release stating his worth at “ten billion dollars.” (Forbes estimates four billion; the biggest discrepancy comes from Trump’s assertion that his name alone is worth three billion.) In this election, the post-Citizens United financing mechanisms have fully matured, effectively removing the limits and the disclosure requirements for individual donations to campaigns. The money may have to be laundered through a super pac, but that is just a formality. This distorts the process in both parties and might help explain the large assortment of candidates. Cruz may seem like a preening opportunist, unpopular among his colleagues, but, having attracted more than fifty million dollars in contributions, he is a credible candidate. The Times reported that a significant portion of his early money came from a single donor: Robert Mercer, a hedge-fund executive who is so private that one of the few traces of his personal life in the public record is a lawsuit that he brought against a toy company that installed a model train set in his home and, he felt, overcharged him—by two million dollars.","1495","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"

At this stage, the important thing to remember is that there are really two spectacles taking place: a high-stakes horse race for the Republican nomination, and a circus held on the infield of the track. Although the events run concurrently, and are ostensibly geared toward the same end, they shouldn’t be confused with one another. One is a serious political contest. The other is a sideshow, designed to amuse the spectators, give the media something to cover, and further the ambitions, varied as they are, of the participants.","1500","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"Ostensibly, the G.O.P. field looks confusing and wide open. In many polls, nobody gets the support of even twenty per cent of potential Republican voters. But if you allow for some variability from survey to survey, a distinctive pattern has emerged. The Real Clear Politics poll of polls, which combines data from many individual polls, shows that Bush has been in the lead for most of the past six months, and that he’s still ahead, with a polling average of 15.5 per cent. Rubio has been gaining ground since he announced his candidacy three weeks ago, and is now in second place, at 14.3 per cent.

A new survey, by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, confirms this picture—indeed, it suggests that the front runners may be pulling a bit further ahead. The poll showed Bush at twenty-three per cent, Rubio at eighteen per cent, and Walker at fourteen per cent.

Carson, an African-American who grew up in a poor family in Detroit, has a compelling personal story to tell, and his message of small government and self-reliance goes over well with many Republicans. But the long buildup to his campaign launch has been marked by a series of inflammatory statements, including one, while he was discussing same-sex marriage, in 2013, in which he equated gays with members of NAMBLA, the North American Man/Boy Love Association. (He later apologized.) And in March of this year, he said that being gay is a choice, and added, “A lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they’re gay.’ ” It’s not clear whether Carson has been deliberately outrageous in order to attract the attention of right-wing talk-show hosts, or whether he is just gaffe-prone.

"The moderate-conservative end of the G.O.P. field has a bit more space open than the conservative end. With Chris Christie’s candidacy snarled up in the Fort Lee traffic, Bush and Rubio are the two leading contenders in this part of the spectrum—although, as I’ve noted before, it’s far from clear that either of them deserves to be called a moderate. Potentially, there is room for an avowedly non-ideological candidate who can reach across party lines, and Fiorina may be aiming to occupy it. Since entering politics, she has adopted conservative positions on issues such as climate change, same-sex marriage, and eliminating the estate tax. In the campaign video announcing her candidacy on Monday, however, she didn’t focus on any of these things. Instead, she attacked Hillary Clinton, but also, by extension, many of her Republican rivals, saying, “Our founders never intended us to have a professional political class….

However, her tenure as Hewlett-Packard’s C.E.O., from 1999 to 2005, was widely criticized, and ended with the board of directors forcing her out (albeit with the consolation of a twenty-million-dollar golden parachute). In 2010, she ran for the U.S. Senate in California, and Barbara Boxer beat her handily. During the campaign, the Los Angeles Times reported that Fiorina hadn’t voted in numerous elections.

But it wasn’t immediately clear when this vote will take place.

Less is known about Holt than about Baum, but Holt appears to have posted semi-regular comments on articles published by The Blaze, a conservative news site, including one comment claiming that blacks have “murdered about 200,000 whites in America since the mid-1960s.”","1515","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-extremism-problem-goes-beyond-the-confederate-flag"

"That’s all good to know, though a skeptic might wonder if anybody in the Republican Party thought to inquire earlier about the identity of this generous donor and the organization he leads. “Despite the group’s obvious racism, its mainstream political connections run deep,” Richard Cohen, the president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, wrote in a post published Tuesday about the C.C.C. “And they’re not entirely a thing of the past.” Links between the C.C.C. and G.O.P. politicians emerged in 1998, when it was reported that Congressman Robert Barr, of Georgia, had delivered the keynote address at the C.C.C.’s national convention. After that revelation prompted some negative publicity, the then chairman of the Republican National Committee, Jim Nicholson, called on his fellow party members to resign from the C.C.C., saying, ‘‘A member of the party of Lincoln should not belong to such an organization.’’","1517","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-extremism-problem-goes-beyond-the-confederate-flag"

In South Carolina, members of the C.C.C. participated in the political campaign to keep the Confederate flag flying from the dome of the State Capitol. (In 2000, it was moved to a flagpole nearby.) More recently, in 2013, it emerged that a prominent South Carolina Republican, Roan Garcia-Quintana, was a longtime member of the C.C.C. and a member of its national board. (According to the Southern Poverty Law Center’s profile of Garcia-Quintana, he acknowledged his ties to the C.C.C. but said that he had never read the organization’s statement of principles.)","1518","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-extremism-problem-goes-beyond-the-confederate-flag"

"“I can’t run again,” President Barack Obama said yesterday, speaking in Mandela Hall at the African Union headquarters, in Addis Ababa. “I actually think I’m a pretty good President—I think if I ran I could win.” Obama, at the end of what is likely to be his final trip to the continent as President, was addressing the habit that too many African leaders have of making themselves leaders for life. His message was that this was a bad idea, even if they, too, thought they were pretty good Presidents. But he may also have been thinking about tremors of the 2016 Presidential race, which had been making their way across the ocean. As yet, none of the Republican contenders has managed to look at once substantial, serious, and sane. In some cases (Trump), none of these attributes has been visible. And then there was the rush of alarming debate on the nuclear deal that the Obama Administration had concluded with Iran. This is where Mike Huckabee came in.","July 29, 2015","1544","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"“I have stood in that oven door,” Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, who is running for President, said on Fox News, on Monday. He was talking about a trip he had taken to Auschwitz, and also, by his reckoning, about the Iran deal. Over the weekend, Huckabee had said that the President “would take the Israelis and basically march them to the door of the oven” by agreeing to “the most idiot thing, this Iran deal.” That was a bit much, even for certain Fox personalities. Sitting across from Huckabee, Geraldo Rivera told him that he loved him and thought he’d be a great President, but that, as a Jew, speaking on behalf of his extended family—“the Levys, the Riveras, the Friedmans”—he was offended. Huckabee, who had just finished explaining why Obama was acting like Neville Chamberlain, another person who “did not take seriously threats that someone was going to kill massive amounts of Jews,” did not back down. If he wasn’t meant to compare the gas chambers to contemporary policy choices, “Why do we have the Holocaust museum?” Huckabee asked Rivera, whose mustache was quivering. If one is looking for a way to separate out the strands of extremism, theatre, and—maybe—serious policy discussion in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination, these people are not here to help.","1545","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"Huckabee also said, “When the President and Hillary Clinton are calling you out personally, must be a good day.” Both of them had taken issue with the oven line. Asked about the remarks during a press conference in Ethiopia, Obama said, “The particular comments of Mr. Huckabee are, I think, part of just a general pattern that we’ve seen that is”—here, he paused, as if trying to contain his mockery—“would be considered ridiculous if it weren’t so sad.” He noted, though, that Huckabee wasn’t alone: “We’ve had a sitting senator call John Kerry Pontius Pilate. We’ve had a sitting senator, who also happens to be running for President, suggest that I’m the leading state sponsor of terrorism. These are leaders in the Republican Party.” Those sitting senators are, respectively, Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, and Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Obama was not exaggerating the tone or the content of their statements. Cotton is the freshman senator who persuaded his colleagues to sign a “Dear Ayatollah” letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader, in a fairly open attempt to sabotage the negotiations. His comparison of the Secretary of State to the Roman official who is said to have allowed Christ to be killed was part of a complaint, on “Morning Joe,” about the International Atomic Energy Agency having drafted some of the details related to the inspections foreseen in the deal. “John Kerry acted like Pontius Pilate,” he said. “He washed his hands, kicked it to the I.A.E.A., knowing that Congress would not get this information unless someone went out to find it.” That “someone” was a certain intrepid senator from Arkansas, who was just back from Vienna, where he had gone to closely interrogate nuclear inspectors himself.","1546","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"Obama might have also mentioned Lindsey Graham, who called the deal a “death sentence” for Israel. Jeb Bush said of Huckabee’s Holocaust language, “Those types of words don’t help,” and that there was a need for candidates to be more “civil.” (He also called Trump “vulgar.”) But Bush has also called the deal “appeasement”—raising the question of whether he thinks that the civil thing to do is allude to Neville Chamberlain, rather than name him. Graham and Bush are running for President, too. Obama, in Ethiopia, noted that it was a noisy race: “Maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines.” But Obama also wondered why certain unhinged comments crossed the line, and others didn’t. Trump was condemned across the board when he said that John McCain wasn’t a war hero, but, Obama said, “when outrageous statements like that are made about me, that a lot of the same people who were outraged when they were made about Mr. McCain were pretty quiet.” That might sound petty—Obama wasn’t kept prisoner by the Vietnamese for years, as McCain was—until one takes a look at what’s being said in the field. Trump has attacked Obama’s parentage, citizenship, intelligence, patriotism, and legitimacy as a President.","1547","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"Huckabee’s comments were so crude that they offended members of an Israeli government that has condemned the deal as, in Benjamin Netanyahu’s words, a “historic mistake.” (“Nobody marches the Jews to ovens anymore,” Yisrael Katz, the transportation minister, said, according to the Washington Post. “If need be, we will know how to defend ourselves, by ourselves.”) But, as with Trump’s attack on McCain, it was also a reminder of how much nonsense gets a pass in politics—of all the defamation that doesn’t get decried.","1548","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"The argument that the Administration is making is that it’s not just vulgar to compare the Iran deal to the Holocaust. It is false to say that it endangers Israel, given that, in the estimation of experts who have examined it, the agreement is the best chance out there to keep Iran from having a bomb. That is the fight Obama is returning to: Congress has sixty days to pass a resolution of disapproval, setting up a vote that would likely fall between the September 11th anniversary and the second Republican candidates’ debate. For the deal to survive, Obama needs just enough votes to sustain a veto. On Tuesday, in testimony before Congress, Kerry spoke forcefully and in detail about centrifuges and inspections, and listened as Republicans told him what they thought he didn’t know. Representative Scott Perry, of Pennsylvania, who had taken his suit jacket off to better wave his arms as he tried to decide whether Iran was “a crocodile or a shark,” spoke over Kerry. “If the Ayatollah doesn’t like it, oh, boo hoo. We’re here for America. You represent America,” the congressman said. “So do you care more about this deal and the U.N.’s approval, or America sovereignty?” Kerry responded, “Congressman, I don’t need any lessons from you about who I represent. I’ve represented and fought for our country since I was out of college. So don’t give me any lessons about that, O.K.?” Kerry did not appear to be about to wash his hands of anything.","1549","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"

But if we are really interested in the outcome of the election in November, 2016, and the ultimate welfare of the country, they are much more significant.

"The first announcement is that the “big-government crisis” is over. What big-government crisis? you may ask. The one that the Republicans cooked up in the aftermath of the Great Recession, when, partly owing to a slump in output, and partly owing to the Obama stimulus and other recession-related outlays, federal spending as a proportion of G.D.P. rose by about four percentage points—from 19.1 per cent in 2007 to 23.4 per cent in 2010. On the back of these figures, some G.O.P. scaremongers portrayed the President as a crypto-socialist intent on strangling the private sector and turning the United States into Sweden, Norway, or some other bloated welfare state where living standards are considerably higher than they are in the United States.","1551","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"Of course, none of the Republicans mentioned the last bit, but you get my drift. With federal expenditures rising sharply, the critics demanded big cutbacks, and they are still demanding them. At last week’s G.O.P. debate, virtually all of the candidates talked about lifting the oppressive yoke of government, and Jeb Bush repeated his pledge to cut the federal work force by ten per cent.","1552","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"What the Republicans don’t seem to have noticed is that their demand for a substantial downsizing has already been met. Thanks to a prolonged, if unspectacular, recovery in G.D.P., and to budget cuts endorsed by both parties at the local and national levels, the size of the government has been steadily falling relative to the rest of the economy. You can see this in the official statistics for federal outlays, which in 2014 fell back to 20.4 per cent of G.D.P. And you can see it even more clearly in the figures for government spending of all types, which includes spending at the local and state levels, as well as transfer payments and interest on the national debt.","1553","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"At the start of 2008, according to a valuable new analysis by David Beckwith, an economist at Western Kentucky University who formerly worked at the Department of the Treasury, this broader measure of government spending came to about thirty-five per cent of G.D.P. By the start of 2012, the figure had risen to close to forty-two per cent of G.D.P. That’s not quite at Scandinavian levels of spending, but it represented a significant jump. Since then, however, there has been a big drop, and over-all spending is back close to thirty-five per cent of G.D.P. In Beckwith’s words, “The huge run up in total government expenditures during the crisis is largely gone.”","1554","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"

They show that the number of Americans without any health coverage has fallen from sixteen per cent of the population in 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was passed, to 9.2 per cent in the first three months of this year. For the first time in recent memory, the percentage of uninsured people is in the single figures. “The health law remains controversial, and that will likely continue to be the case,” Larry Levitt, a senior vice-president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which focusses on health care, told the Huffington Post’s Jonathan Cohn. “But we now have facts that can be used to judge the A.C.A. rather than hypothetical arguments, and there’s no doubt at this point that more people are getting insured and it’s making a difference in their lives.”","1556","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"

"A reasoned conservative response to the experience of Obamacare would be to accept the fact that it has done much of what it set out to do without bankrupting the country or destroying jobs, while also pointing out that it has had some nasty unintended consequences, such as a lack of competition among insurers in some areas and, in others, an increase in deductibles so large it may discourage people from seeking the care they need. But, rather than go down this route, almost all of the Republicans continue to demand an outright repeal of the law, without giving a coherent explanation of what they would replace it with.","1558","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"

"In the mid-nineteen-eighties, shortly after the convictions of six members of the House of Representatives and one senator in the F.B.I. bribery sting code-named Abscam, one of the bureau’s anticorruption units turned its attention to the California legislature, where an informant had reported that lawmakers were on the take. Agents posing as representatives of a shrimp-processing company announced plans to build a plant near Sacramento, provided that a state-loan guarantee could be procured. They offered to reward legislators who would help secure their financing. The operation, inevitably, was known as Shrimpscam.","1561","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"

He had already voted for a bill making the company eligible for the guarantee, but Governor George Deukmejian, who was aware of the sting, had vetoed it. Now one of the agents wanted to meet Nolan to entice him to intercede with Deukmejian. On June 29, 1988, Nolan and a legislative aide, Karin Watson, arrived at a bugged suite in the Sacramento Hyatt Regency, across from the Capitol. They declined the agent’s offer of champagne (it was not yet noon) in favor of Diet Pepsi, admired the view, engaged in some awkward small talk, and left twenty minutes later, with two five-thousand-dollar checks. One was made out to a Republican campaign committee. The other was left blank, apparently to see if Nolan would pocket the money. He filled in the name of a Party PAC.","1562","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Pat Nolan now lives outside Washington, D.C., in Leesburg, Virginia. Recently, he rummaged in his basement for a copy of the F.B.I. audiotape of the meeting. (There was a video, but Nolan’s copy seems to have got lost when he moved east, in 1996.) Nothing on the muddy soundtrack, which plays today like an outtake from “American Hustle,” is explicitly transactional, but the agent presses for help in changing the Governor’s mind, and Nolan explains that it would be beneficial for business in general if Republicans could capture a majority in the assembly.","1563","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The sting eventually resulted in a dozen indictments, but it took five years, and Karin Watson’s coöperation, for prosecutors to file charges against Nolan. On April 27, 1993, he was indicted on six counts, including racketeering, conspiracy, extortion, and money laundering. Nolan insists that he voted for the loan because the fictional venture promised jobs, and that he took the contributions because that’s how people help elect legislators who see things their way. But Nolan’s lawyers concluded that a public that had recently endured the scandals of Watergate, Abscam, and Iran-Contra would not be sympathetic to a politician’s claim that he was just doing his job. Nolan calculated that, if found guilty, he could be in prison until his young children were in their twenties. So he quit his seat and admitted to one felony count of racketeering in exchange for a sentence of thirty-three months.","1564","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Criminal-justice reformers like to say that if a conservative is a liberal who has been mugged, a liberal is a conservative who has served time. Nolan did not emerge from prison any less conservative, but he says he experienced a profound disillusionment, which has led him to play a central role in a cause that is only now finding its moment. These days, it is hard to ignore a rising conservative clamor to rehabilitate the criminal-justice system. Conservatives are as quick as liberals to note that the United States, a country with less than five per cent of the world’s population, houses nearly twenty-five per cent of the world’s prisoners. Some 2.2 million Americans are now incarcerated—about triple the number locked up in the nineteen-eighties, when, in a panic over drugs and urban crime, conservative legislators demanded tougher policies, and liberals who feared being portrayed as weak went along with them. African-Americans are nearly six times as likely as whites to be incarcerated, and Latinos are more than twice as likely. More than forty per cent of released offenders return to prison within three years.","1565","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Several Republican Presidential candidates—Rand Paul, Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, and Ted Cruz—have been embraced by Right on Crime, a campaign to promote “successful, conservative solutions” to the punitive excesses of American law and order. In February, the American Conservative Union’s Conservative Political Action Conference, which serves as an audition for right-wing Presidential aspirants, featured three panels on criminal-justice reform, including one called Prosecutors Gone Wild. Bernard Kerik, who was Rudolph Giuliani’s police commissioner and served three years in prison for tax fraud and other crimes, now promotes an agenda of reforms, including voting rights for ex-felons. The libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch are donating money to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, to help insure that indigent defendants get competent legal representation, and they are co-sponsoring conferences on judicial reform with the American Civil Liberties Union.","1566","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"In Congress and the states, conservatives and liberals have found common ground on such issues as cutting back mandatory-minimum sentences; using probation, treatment, and community service as alternatives to prison for low-level crimes; raising the age of juvenile-court jurisdictions; limiting solitary confinement; curtailing the practice of confiscating assets; rewriting the rules of probation and parole to avoid sending offenders back to jail on technicalities; restoring education and job training in prisons; allowing prisoners time off for rehabilitation; and easing the reëntry of those who have served time by expunging some criminal records and by lowering barriers to employment, education, and housing. As David Dagan and Steven M. Teles write, in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, “Retrenching the carceral state is becoming as orthodox on the Right as building it was just a few short years ago.” They conclude that this has created a “Nixon goes to China” opportunity to reverse decades of overkill.","1567","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"This conservative transformation is often portrayed in the media as a novelty, and some progressives regard it as a ploy to cut taxes and turn prisons over to the private corrections industry. Yet it has deep roots and a tangle of motives, one of which is indeed a belief that downsizing prisons promises taxpayers some relief. (Locking up an inmate for a year can cost as much as tuition at a good college.) But for many conservatives, Nolan says, reducing spending is “ancillary.” “It’s human dignity that really motivates us.”","1568","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"In September, I met Nolan in Washington, D.C., at a German deli downstairs from his office at the American Conservative Union Foundation, where he is the director of the new Center for Criminal Justice Reform. At sixty-five, he is tall and rotund, with a round, amiable face and a thatch of gray-white hair. Since 2011, he has suffered from restricted lung capacity, complicated by a lingering case of Lyme disease, and he uses a portable oxygen tank. But he still works full time, tracking the progress of reforms state by state, drafting op-eds for fellow-conservatives, planning conferences, rallying state legislators by phone, and firing off volleys on Twitter.","1569","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"There are two main styles of Southern California Republicanism: the home-spun anecdotal optimism of Ronald Reagan and the uneasy conspiratorial resentment of Richard Nixon. Nolan is in the Reagan mold, upbeat and engaging even when he is describing what he regards as the transformative injustice of his life. He grew up on Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles; his father was an accountant, and his mother, he said, “majored in raising kids”—nine of them. By the time he was old enough to have a paper route, the integrated middle-class neighborhood had turned rough. The family was devoutly Catholic, and Nolan remains so.","1570","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"At Notre Dame High School, he joined the Young Americans for Freedom—he and his friends liked to heckle Jane Fonda at anti-Vietnam War rallies, chanting, “Barbarella bombed, why can’t Nixon?”—and in 1966 he was a volunteer for Reagan’s first gubernatorial campaign. He tried three times to enlist in the Marine officer-training program, but each time he failed the physical, owing to a knee injury suffered when a car knocked him off his bike on his delivery route. After graduating from the University of Southern California and then its law school, he represented white-collar defendants in civil cases for a few years, served part time as a reserve deputy sheriff, and went into politics. By the time of Shrimpscam, he was widely viewed as a potential speaker of the assembly, even a plausible candidate for governor or for the Senate.","1571","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“I went to the legislature very pro cop and with a get-tough-on-crime attitude,” Nolan told me. He wanted to reinstate the death penalty, which the Supreme Court had temporarily suspended. He believed that the exclusionary rule, which disallows evidence improperly obtained by the police, had become a loophole that lawyers exploited to allow guilty clients to go free. He excoriated a colleague in the assembly for proposing a law that would extend workers’ compensation to inmates injured in prison labor programs. And he was a leading sponsor of a prison-building boom in the state, which included, to his eventual regret, the Pelican Bay supermax facility, where inmates are kept in long-term solitary.","1572","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The F.B.I. sting, he says, dispelled his unconditional faith in law enforcement. In Nolan’s telling of it, trophy-hunting agents browbeat his aides and his campaign supporters to build a case against him, leaking tidbits to the press in the hope of breaking his resolve. The prosecutor loaded the charge sheet so heavily that Nolan concluded that he couldn’t risk going before a jury. Like roughly ninety-five per cent of people convicted in America, he pleaded guilty and took a lesser sentence rather than take his chances at trial. He began to wonder how many of the people he had dismissed as bad guys had simply succumbed to prosecutorial bullying. He said, “I saw that the F.B.I. and the government prosecutors weren’t interested in the truth, and that was a shock to me.”","1573","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"By the standards of American incarceration, Nolan had it easy. He served twenty-five months in two prisons that housed the least menacing felons. The Federal Prison Camp at Dublin, near San Francisco, was a compound of former Army barracks surrounded by landscaped flower gardens. There was a small coterie of white-collar criminals, but the majority of the inmates were blacks and Latinos serving time for relatively minor drug convictions. Nolan helped organize religious-study groups, and—to judge by his accounts in an unpublished memoir—he treated his fellow-inmates as a constituency to be charmed. (He still corresponds with some of them.) From prison, Nolan produced a chatty newsletter that his wife, Gail, distributed to some two thousand supporters. He had regular visits from his family and a loyal band of political friends. After ten months, he was transferred to Geiger Corrections Center, near Spokane, where the supervision was even less oppressive. Still, his time in prison exposed him to what he came to see as the cynical cycle of American justice: sweep up young men, mostly from broken families in underprivileged neighborhoods, put them away for a while, send them back onto the streets with no skills, and repeat. To call this a “corrections” system seemed a sour joke.","1574","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“I had assumed they did all they could to help prepare the guys to return to society and make a better life,” Nolan told me. “But they were just warehousing them.” There was a pervasive sense of defeat. “The implication is: you’re worthless, you come from nothing, you are nothing, you’ll never be anything.” He added that when prisoners were released the guards would say, “See you in a few months.” He was surprised, too, at the number of elderly and infirm inmates. In his memoir, he wrote that “incarcerating people who aren’t a physical threat to society is expensive and counter-productive”—something that “only a nation that is rich and vindictive” would do.","1575","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Nolan was still an inmate when he ventured into the politics of reform. In 1994, in the California Political Review, he published an attack on that year’s crime bill—President Clinton’s signature contribution to mass incarceration, which earmarked $9.7 billion for prisons, imposed tougher sentences, and, among many punitive provisions, eliminated college grants for prison inmates. Many Republicans turned against the bill, because it also included a ban on assault rifles and funded remedial inner-city programs, such as “midnight basketball.” Nolan’s objections were different: he argued that the bill would bring profits to the prison industry but do little to reduce crime. He wrote, “Above all, conservatives should ask themselves how likely it is that these bloated bureaucracies . . . will turn out to be any less rapacious, irresponsible, or concerned with the rights of ordinary Americans than, say, the IRS, just because they are packaged and marketed under the dishonest label ‘tough on crime.’ ”","1576","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The following year, when Congress was reviewing the hundred-to-one disparity in the penalties for crack versus powder cocaine, Nolan used his phone privileges to urge Republican representatives to treat the two drugs equally. “The kid on the bunk above me was doing ten years for crack,” Nolan told me. “There’s essentially no difference” between the two forms of the drug, he said, “but so many blacks were doing absurdly long sentences for crack.” Nolan says that he helped line up support from thirty-four Republican members of the House, but lost half of them when Clinton’s Attorney General, Janet Reno, endorsed the harsher punishments. “How could they let Janet Reno get to their right on drug policy?” he asked.","1577","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Unlike most parolees, Nolan had a job waiting for him. Charles Colson, a Nixon White House aide who had become a devout Evangelical Christian shortly before serving seven months in a federal prison for his part in the Watergate scandal, had organized the Prison Fellowship, a network of volunteers who visited inmates and promoted faith as a path back into society’s good graces. When the volunteers reported appalling conditions and a permeating sense of hopelessness in the prisons, Colson decided to launch a political offshoot, called the Justice Fellowship. The idea was to build a grassroots campaign to lobby Congress and state lawmakers for more humane treatment of inmates during and after incarceration, but Colson was so busy running the evangelical network that the effort languished. Colson had heard of Nolan through mutual Republican friends, who portrayed him as equally at ease talking about God and dealing with politicians. So in the spring of 1996, as Nolan was preparing to leave prison, Colson asked him to move to Washington and run the Justice Fellowship. Once there, Nolan realized that a grassroots network was already in place: fifty thousand Prison Fellowship volunteers and a couple of hundred thousand donors.","1578","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Their first test came later that year, with a proposal moving through Congress that would have sharply limited the right of inmates to file lawsuits under the First Amendment. Many prosecutors favored the measure as a way to curb nuisance lawsuits, but Nolan argued that it would also inhibit legitimate religious freedom. “You’d get some inmate suing for steak dinners on the grounds that he belonged to the Church of Filet Mignon,” he said. “But you also had wardens who wouldn’t serve kosher meals to Orthodox Jews.” Crosses that Latino prisoners fashioned from plastic trash bags were banned in some prisons as “gang attire.” Nolan and Colson asked their network to contact their legislators and raise the issue at town-hall meetings. Nolan organized a press conference in which a Republican and a Democrat—Senators John Ashcroft and Edward Kennedy—defended the rights of inmates. The proposal died.","1579","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Next, Nolan sought to enlist the fellowship in the campaign against prison rape. Studies showed that as many as one inmate in five was the victim of sexual assault, by another inmate or by prison staff. Such attacks, when inmates dared to report them, were dismissed as a hazard of incarceration. “Prison rape was a secular issue, but with moral overtones,” Nolan told me. The direct-mail firm that handled Colson’s fund-raising “didn’t want to touch the issue,” he said. “They thought, Oh, it makes people uncomfortable. It’ll turn people off.” But the volunteers agreed to rally conservative support, and, in conjunction with human-rights organizations and liberal groups, they helped secure the unanimous passage of the Prison Rape Elimination Act, in 2003. Nolan is the first to admit that the law hasn’t come close to eliminating the problem. But it did make the Justice Fellowship a force for reform beyond issues of strictly religious interest. Its members subsequently helped on the passage of the Second Chance Act, which provides federal grants to help released convicts reënter society, and the Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the disparity—to eighteen to one—between sentences for crack and powder cocaine.","1580","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"During those years, Nolan discovered a number of prominent right-wing figures who had come to support criminal-justice reform from various directions. Some, like David Keene, the former president of the National Rifle Association, whose son was sentenced to ten years for a road-rage shooting, were, like Colson and Nolan himself, influenced by personal experience. Grover Norquist, an activist famous for extracting no-new-taxes pledges from members of Congress, was attracted to the issue partly by the odor of wasted tax money, and became an early Nolan ally. Richard Viguerie, who refined direct-mail fund-raising in the service of the far right, also came to the campaign early, on moral grounds. (A substantial minority on the right, notably Catholics, have turned against capital punishment. Nolan and Viguerie are among them.) Edwin Meese, President Reagan’s Attorney General, for the most part a classic law-and-order conservative, faulted the system for failing to provide indigent defendants access to adequate legal counsel and opposed the reclassification of minor regulatory violations as felonies. (A favorite conservative talking point is that Texas has eleven felonies related to the harvesting of oysters.) Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a co-author of the 1994 Contract with America, with its unforgiving anticrime provisions, told me that he was persuaded to embrace reform because of the high recidivism rates. “It’s just stunningly stupid to have a system that keeps returning people to jail,” he told me.","1581","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"After George W. Bush was reëlected, in 2004, and the Republican majorities in Congress were strengthened, Nolan attended a seminar in Richmond, Virginia, where conservatives debated what to do with their consolidated power. Norquist and Keene separately urged him to pull together the factions of conservatism on justice reform. So he began hosting occasional off-the-record lunches where you might have seen libertarians from the Cato Institute, advocates of judicial restraint from the Federalist Society, social conservatives from the Family Research Council, and hard-core fiscal conservatives like Norquist. Attendees found a unifying theme in the arrogance and the overreach of government and the toll that it took on individual freedom and responsibility. Nolan became, mostly behind the scenes, a trusted broker, strategist, theoretician, fund-raiser, diplomat, and whip. “If Pat says something, it’s kind of the final word,” Viguerie told me.","1582","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"One place where conservative interests coalesced was the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a free-market think tank based in Austin, which helped convert then Governor Rick Perry from an indiscriminate law-and-order enthusiast to a self-styled apostle of pragmatic reform. In 2007, Perry joined reformers in the state legislature in a plan to cancel a major expansion of the state’s prisons and redirect some of the savings to addiction treatment for low-level drug offenders, as an alternative to incarceration. The prison population dropped sufficiently that Texas closed one facility in 2011 and two more in 2013.","1583","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The feat was less impressive than it seemed. When Perry became governor, in 2000, he inherited the largest and fastest-growing prison population in the country, the legacy of a prison-building program under his predecessors Ann Richards and George W. Bush. The state could easily afford to release hundreds of minor offenders without risking a spike in crime. Still, Perry’s example was one that Nolan and others could hold out to politicians who worried about being pilloried as soft on crime. Vikrant Reddy, a former Texas Public Policy Foundation lawyer who is now a criminal-justice fellow at a think tank backed by Charles Koch, said, “This is the ultimate hang-’em-high state. If you say you’ve done these impressive things on prison reform in Vermont, nobody’s really listening. If you say they did it in Texas, then you have a captive audience.”","1584","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The next step was to replicate the Texas story in other states. Marc Levin, a conservative lawyer who headed the Texas foundation’s justice-reform operation, came up with a catchy name—Right on Crime—for a new advocacy group set up out of the foundation in 2010 to share policy ideas and mobilize prominent conservatives for reform. Levin and Nolan realized that, instead of building a new coalition of name-brand conservatives for each battle, they could get supporters to sign on to a statement of principles—transparency and accountability, individual liberty, cost-effectiveness, a chance for rehabilitation, limited government, a voice for crime victims, a preference for solutions based on family and community. That way, the signatories’ names could be invoked without having to ask for permission every time.","1585","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“Sort of like Henry Ford inventing the assembly line, it allowed us to handle a large number of issues,” Nolan said. Variations on the Texas approach to reducing the prison population have since been adopted in Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky, and Mississippi. “You now have all these conservative and liberal governors touching what used to be a third rail,” said John Malcolm, a former prosecutor who oversees the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, at the Heritage Foundation. Last year in California, Right on Crime, with financing from B. Wayne Hughes, Jr., the son of a storage-locker billionaire, and with Nolan working the phones to legislators in his home state, provided support for Proposition 47, which downgraded minor drug and property crimes to misdemeanors. It passed in November.","1586","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Although right and left generally agree on the scale of the problem, they diverge on the question of its causes. The view of many on the left is distilled to its essence by the legal scholar Michelle Alexander in her best-selling 2010 book, “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness.” Alexander posited that the criminal-justice system as it exists today is the product of the country’s economic and racial history.","1587","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The fact that nearly a third of black men in this country are destined to spend time in jail or prison, Alexander argued, cannot be explained as simply a society defending itself against urban predators. In her view, Nixon’s tough-on-crime agenda and Reagan’s escalation of the war on drugs were aimed, consciously or not, at halting the advances of the civil-rights movement and perpetuating the neglect of the underclass. While race has influenced the administration of justice in this country from its beginning, she says, since the nineteen-eighties mass incarceration has decimated minority neighborhoods to the extent that it has become a malign form of containment. “It is no longer concerned primarily with the prevention and punishment of crime, but rather with the management and control of the dispossessed,” she wrote. On many days, the news seems to provide evidence for Alexander’s case: racial profiling; stop-and-frisk; the targeted prosecution of drug laws in black and brown communities; the disproportionate arrest, remand, and sentencing of minorities; the xenophobic alarm about immigration; and the quick resort to force by police and corrections officers against citizens of color.","1588","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Alexander told me that during the five years that she has been travelling around the country talking about her book she has often found conservatives “more advanced in their thinking” than liberal politicians, who, after many years of having to play tough for voters, “have become comfortable with the criminal-justice system as it is.” Religious conservatives in particular, she said, “really appreciate the moral and spiritual dimensions of mass incarceration.”","1589","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"As a theory of how we got to this point, Alexander’s view supplies a powerful logic but is of little comfort to advocates of piecemeal reforms, which she regards as “utterly insufficient.” She told me, “Some people who might have spent more than a decade behind bars may spend only a few years. Children who might not otherwise have ever known their parents may have a shot at having relationships with their mother or father, and people may receive additional support—job training or education.” However, she added, “I’m deeply concerned that many people will mistake these reforms for the kind of cultural and institutional transformation that is necessary.” The current bipartisan ferment might improve a few lives, she conceded, but repairing criminal justice requires “a radical restructuring of our society,” potentially driven by “third parties and new political formations” rather than by Republicans or Democrats. She told me, “I’m not enlisting the very people who constructed the system to take charge of now reforming it.”","1590","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“Michelle Alexander has gotten a lot of publicity, and a lot of people have been attracted by it,” Nolan said. “But I think it’s counterproductive to go and start off by punching people in the face, saying, ‘You’re part of the white slave-master mentality that has done this.’ ” On the right, the excesses of the system are most often explained as the result of too much government coddling and a breakdown of families, resulting in a surge of crime and a corresponding rise in public alarm. The war on drugs and the ensuing explosion of the prison population, many conservatives argue, were not acts of racism but responses to legitimate fears. But Nolan says, “Our rhetoric helped grow the climate in which the government could overreach. Prison became the default choice when it should be the last resort. I guess I’m somewhat defensive, because a lot of liberals say that this is a way of making up for the wrong things we did. I think that both hands were on the knife.”","1591","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Nixon and Reagan—and the 1988 campaign of George H. W. Bush, with the infamous Willie Horton TV ad—tapped a vein of white anxiety, but liberals were co-architects of the current situation. The “war on drugs” had no more outspoken champion than the liberal Massachusetts Democrat and House Speaker Thomas P. O’Neill, Jr. Reacting to the death from a crack overdose of Len Bias, a promising Boston Celtics recruit, O’Neill helped push through the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which imposed mandatory sentences, asset forfeitures, and the severe sanctions on crack. The 1994 crime bill was introduced by a Delaware liberal, Joe Biden, and championed by Bill Clinton. (In this Presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton can expect to be attacked for her husband’s tough-on-crime expedience—from the right.)","1592","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The year that Clinton signed that bill, thirty-seven per cent of Americans identified crime as the nation’s most important problem. By 2012, the number was two per cent. The crime rate has plateaued at its lowest level in decades, a development variously attributed to the ebbing of the crack epidemic, an improved economy, smarter policing, the aging of the baby boomers, and, at huge expense, mass incarceration. A new generation has come of age in safer cities, and now Democratic officials who dared not endorse less punitive approaches to crime have conservatives to give them political cover. “What I tell conservatives is liberals cannot lead on reforming the criminal-justice system,” Viguerie told me. “And so, if conservatives don’t lead, nothing happens.”","1593","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"There is a tendency, on both sides, to make ending mass incarceration seem easier than it is. In March, I went to Washington for the Bipartisan Summit on Criminal Justice Reform, hosted by the liberal activist Van Jones, the Democratic consultant Donna Brazile, Gingrich, and Nolan, and attended by several hundred reform enthusiasts. Jones called it “the Woodstock of criminal justice.” The only discordant note I heard came from Senator Cory Booker, the New Jersey Democrat who campaigned as a criminal-justice reformer. One of the sponsors of the summit—a roster that included Koch Industries and the A.C.L.U.—was #cut50, a bipartisan organization that advocates halving the prison population over the next ten years. (Nolan is listed as a partner on the group’s Web site, although he says that thirty per cent is a more realistic goal.) To accomplish such a drastic cut, Booker suggested, would entail releasing not only pot smokers and shoplifters but also people guilty of more serious crimes. He invited the audience to talk about reëxamining some offenses now categorized as violent. Nobody seemed inclined to take him up on the offer.","1594","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"There are whole areas of policy where bipartisan consensus remains far out of reach. Guns, for starters, are untouchable. (Norquist likes to provoke liberals with the creative theory that the crime rate has fallen because more Americans have concealed-carry permits.) For most Republicans, outright legalization of drugs, even marijuana, “is one we can’t touch,” Nolan says. The idea of restoring voting rights to ex-felons, which has the support of Rand Paul and Nolan as well as Bernie Kerik, appeals to many Democrats but terrifies most Republicans. “They have this image of hordes of criminals” flocking to the polls to vote for Democrats, Nolan said. Conservatives tend to look more favorably on privatizing prisons, prison services, and probation, a scheme that liberals view with deep distrust. The death penalty, which divides the right, is not on the shared agenda.","1595","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The most significant question is whether conservatives are prepared to face the cost of the remedies, from in-prison education and job training to more robust probationary supervision and drug and mental-health treatment. Joan Petersilia, a criminologist who teaches at the Stanford Law School, points to the last great American exercise in decarceration, half a century ago: President Kennedy’s Community Mental Health Act, which aimed to reduce by half the number of patients in state mental hospitals. The promised alternatives—hundreds of community care facilities—were never fully funded, and thousands of deeply troubled people were liberated into homelessness. The mentally ill now make up a substantial portion of inmates in state prisons and county jails.","1596","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“The direction forward is not really clear, because, on the one hand, the right is saying less government, less spending,” Petersilia told me. “And the left is saying we need more investment.” She offers the example of California, which for nearly five years has been under a Supreme Court order to cull the overcrowded prisons that Nolan once helped build. “The success story of downsizing prisons in California is like nothing the nation has ever experienced,” she said. “We have downsized in less than five years twenty-five per cent of all prison populations. But look what is happening at the local, community level, which is that they’ve upsized jails, and they’ve got a homeless population, they’ve got police officers complaining about the mentally ill. We didn’t answer the question: if not prisons, what?”","1597","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Nolan agrees about the cost of alternatives: “In each of the Right on Crime states, we have insisted that a large part of the savings be put back into the system.” As for his home state, Nolan says, “we were not a part of that mess.” Nolan thinks that Governor Jerry Brown failed to plan adequate prison alternatives because “he just wanted to get the court off his back.” When conservatives did venture into California, last November, to help pass Proposition 47, the measure required that two-thirds of any money saved be funnelled into alternative correctional programs. Nolan said, “Conservatives have insisted that money be plowed into services because we know that just releasing prisoners or diverting them from prisons without services would increase crime.” That is true, but it tends to be relegated to the fine print in conservative reform literature. The headlines promise tremendous savings to taxpayers.","1598","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Nolan has another worry: that one sensational crime, or a spike in the crime rate, or the distraction of more polarizing issues could send Republicans and Democrats back to their corners. “We’ve all said we’re one bad incident away from having this erode on us,” he said. But if the bipartisan movement can accomplish the things it agrees on, Nolan has a wish list of additional reforms that he will pitch to conservatives. He would like to see abusive prosecutors lose their licenses. He would require the police to videotape interrogations from beginning to end, not just a confession that may have been improperly extracted.","1599","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"And, mindful of the prisoners who have been exonerated while waiting on death row, he would like to end capital punishment. In the last week of May, Nolan was urging Republican state senators in Nebraska to repeal that state’s death penalty, over the governor’s veto. The repeal prevailed without a vote to spare, making Nebraska the first conservative state in four decades to do away with the death penalty. Nolan was jubilant.","1600","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“I think the Nebraska vote is a pivot point,” he e-mailed me. “You can’t get more red than Nebraska, and the cooperation of flinty conservatives and urban blacks was unstoppable.

The plaintiffs charge that, based on a strict reading of single sentence (actually, four words), federal health-insurance subsidies should be available only in the sixteen states (and the District of Columbia) that set up their own health exchanges, or marketplaces. This means, they argue, that there should be no subsidies for people who now buy insurance on the federal exchange in the other thirty-four states. At the moment, about thirteen million people receive those subsidies.","May 21, 2015","1602","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"
"The people with the most riding on the outcome, of course, are those thirteen million. Without subsidies, it’s likely that most of them will no longer be able to afford their insurance. Until recently, the perception has also been that the Democrats had the largest political stake in the case. After all, the A.C.A. is the signature achievement of the Democratic President. Suddenly, though, and paradoxically, it has come to seem that Obamacare’s Republican opponents are most at risk if the decision goes their way. They have the most to lose by winning. As Jonathan Chait wrote recently, “The chaos their lawsuit would unleash might blow back in a way few Republicans had considered until recently, and now, on the eve of a possible triumph, they find themselves scrambling to contain the damage.” In this view, the peril is especially great for Republicans, because, as Jonathan Cohn recently pointed out, the G.O.P. has failed to propose any kind of plan to address the loss of insurance for so many millions of people.","1603","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"
"So that’s the theory: millions will suddenly be uninsured, and will blame Republicans. As Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, put it recently, “I don’t think they will [win the case]. If they do, that’s a problem that the Republicans have.”","1604","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"
"No, it’s not. If the Obama Administration loses in the Supreme Court, the political pain will fall almost exclusively on the President and his Party. To paraphrase Colin Powell and the Pottery Barn rule, President Obama will have broken health care, so he owns it. To the vast mass of Americans who follow politics casually or not at all, Obamacare and the American system of health care have become virtually synonymous. This may not be exactly right or fair, but it’s a reasonable perception on the part of most people. The scope of the Affordable Care Act is so vast, and its effects so pervasive, that there is scarcely a corner of health care, especially with regard to insurance, that is unaffected by it. So if millions lose insurance, they will hold it against Obamacare, and against Obama. Blaming the President in these circumstances may be unfair, but it’s the way American politics works.","1605","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"
"Republicans, of course, will encourage this sentiment. The precise legal claim in King v. Burwell is an esoteric one. It is not based on a claim that Obamacare is unconstitutional. (The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law three years ago.) Rather, the central assertion by the plaintiffs is that the Obama Administration violated the law itself. In any event, the subtlety of the issue at the heart of the case will surely be lost in its aftermath. The headlines will read, correctly, “Court rules against Obamacare,” and this will be all that matters. The Republicans will argue that the Supreme Court showed that the law was flawed from the start, that the Obama Administration is lawless, that a full repeal of the law is the only appropriate response to the Court’s decision—and that the millions who lose their subsides should blame the sponsor of the law. Watch for references to a “failed Presidency.” There’ll be plenty of them.","1606","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"
"Understandably, perhaps, the Administration has courted this kind of reaction. Better than anyone, Administration officials know the scale of the problems that would be created by a loss in the Supreme Court. Advertising this possibility makes sense as a litigation strategy; Obama officials don’t want to make it easy for the Supreme Court to rule against them. In testimony before Congress and elsewhere, Sylvia Burwell, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (and the defendant in the case), said that the Administration has no contingency plan for an adverse ruling in the Supreme Court. But playing chicken with the Justices only works if it works. If the Supreme Court strikes down the subsidies, the Administration will also have to answer for why it didn’t prepare for this possibility.","1607","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-game-of-chicken-with-the-supreme-court"

It’s why he gets the credit and blame for so many things, like the economy, where his influence can be hard to discern.

"How many Republicans are running for President? It’s a trick question. Some of those who are clearly running—Jeb Bush, for example—are still pretending that they aren’t, mostly because declaring would change the fund-raising rules. And if you counted everyone who, against all evidence, takes himself (or herself) seriously as a candidate, the locker room depicted in Mark Ulriksen’s “Suiting Up,” this week’s cover, would look as crowded as the departures hall at Penn Station, and almost as disconcerting. As it is, Ulriksen presents seven contenders with seven varieties of preening. Maybe it’s hard to tell a vision for America from a delusion of grandeur, at least until the debates and primaries get under way. Until then, Marco Rubio’s got his phone, Rand Paul his comb, and Huckabee his Bible. Ted Cruz’s eyes flit between his copy of the Constitution and his mirror, while Scott Walker seems on the lookout for unionized gym attendants.

"On July 23rd, Donald Trump’s red-white-and-navy-blue Boeing 757 touched down in Laredo, Texas, where the temperature was climbing to a hundred and four degrees. In 1976, the Times introduced Trump, then a little-known builder, to readers as a “publicity shy” wunderkind who “looks ever so much like Robert Redford,” and quoted an admiring observation from the architect Der Scutt: “That Donald, he could sell sand to the Arabs.” Over the years, Trump honed a performer’s ear for the needs of his audience. He starred in “The Apprentice” for fourteen seasons, cultivating a lordly persona and a squint that combined Clint Eastwood on the high plains and Derek Zoolander on the runway. Once he emerged as the early front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, this summer, his airport comings and goings posed a delicate staging issue: a rogue wind off the tarmac could render his comb-over fully erect in front of the campaign paparazzi. So, in Laredo, Trump débuted a protective innovation: a baseball hat adorned with a campaign slogan that he recycled from Ronald Reagan’s 1980 run for the White House—“Make America Great Again!” The headwear, which had the rigid façade and the braided rope of a cruise-ship giveaway, added an expeditionary element to the day’s outfit, of blazer, pale slacks, golf shoes—well suited for a mission that he was describing as one of great personal risk. “I may never see you again, but we’re going to do it,” he told Fox News on the eve of the Texas visit.","1629","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"When Trump announced his candidacy, on June 16th, he vowed to build a two-thousand-mile-long wall to stop Mexico from “sending people that have lots of problems.” He said, “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” Three of the statements had no basis in fact—the crime rate among first-generation immigrants is lower than that for native-born Americans—but Trump takes an expansive view of reality. “I play to people’s fantasies,” he writes in “The Art of the Deal,” his 1987 memoir. “I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration—and a very effective form of promotion.”","1630","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s campaign announcement was mocked and condemned—and utterly successful. His favorability among Republicans leaped from sixteen per cent to fifty-seven per cent, a greater spike than that of any other candidate’s début. Immigration became the centerpiece of his campaign. “Donald Trump has changed the entire debate on immigration,” Rush Limbaugh told his listeners last month. As the climax of events in Las Vegas and Phoenix, Trump brought onstage Jamiel Shaw, Sr., whose seventeen-year-old son was killed, in 2008, by a man who was in the country illegally. Trump stood by while Shaw told the crowd how his son was shot.","1631","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Before departing for Laredo, Trump said, “I’ve been invited by border patrols, and they want to honor me, actually, thousands and thousands of them, because I’m speaking up.” Though Trump said “border patrols,” the invitation had in fact come from a local branch of the border-patrol union, and the local, after consulting with headquarters, withdrew the invitation a few hours before Trump arrived, on the ground that it would not endorse political candidates. Descending the airplane stairs, Trump looked thrilled to be arriving amid a controversy; he waded into a crowd of reporters and described the change of plans as the handiwork of unspecified enemies. “They invited me, and then, all of a sudden, they were told, silencio! They want silence.” Asked why he felt unsafe in Laredo—which has a lower crime rate than New York City or Washington, D.C.—he invoked another “they”: “Well, they say it’s a great danger, but I have to do it.

Other Republicans offer “canned bullshit,” Rice went on. “People have got so terribly annoyed and disenchanted and disenfranchised, really, by candidates who get up there, and all their stump speeches promise everything to everyone.” By the night’s end, Rice was sold. “I heard echoes of Ronald Reagan,” he told me, adding, “If I had to vote today, I would vote for Trump.”","1653","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Dave Anderson, a New Hampshire Republican who retired from United Parcel Service, told me, “People say, ‘Well, it’d be nice to have another Bush.’ No, it wouldn’t be nice. We had two.

She worked at a furniture company, she said. “But the industry went down the tubes.” Her husband, Charlie, used to build household electricity meters at a General Electric plant, until the job moved to Mexico. Now he parks cars at a hospital. Trump, in his speech, promised to stop companies from sending jobs abroad, and the Merzes became Trump Republicans. They are churchgoers, but they don’t expect Trump to become one, and they forgive his unpriestly comments about women. “There are so many other things going on in this country that we’ve got be concerned about,” Nancy said. “I’ve seen a lot of our friends lose their houses.”","1655","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s fans project onto him a vast range of imaginings—about toughness, business acumen, honesty—from a continuum that ranges from economic and libertarian conservatives to the far-right fringe. In partisan terms, his ideas are riven by contradiction—he calls for mass deportations but opposes cuts to Medicare and Social Security; he vows to expand the military but criticizes free trade—and yet that is a reflection of voters’ often incoherent sets of convictions. The biggest surprise in Trump’s following? He “made an incredible surge among the Tea Party supporters,” according to Patrick Murray, who runs polling for Monmouth University. Before Trump announced his candidacy, only twenty per cent of Tea Partiers had a favorable view of him; a month later, that figure had risen to fifty-six per cent. Trump became the top choice among Tea Party voters, supplanting (and opening a large lead over) Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Governor Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, both Tea Party stalwarts. According to a Washington Post /ABC News poll conducted last month, the “broad majority” of Trump’s supporters hailed from two groups: voters with no college degree, and voters who say that immigrants weaken America.

On June 28th, twelve days after Trump’s announcement, the Daily Stormer, America’s most popular neo-Nazi news site, endorsed him for President: “Trump is willing to say what most Americans think: it’s time to deport these people.” The Daily Stormer urged white men to “vote for the first time in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests.”","1658","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Ever since the Tea Party’s peak, in 2010, and its fade, citizens on the American far right—Patriot militias, border vigilantes, white supremacists—have searched for a standard-bearer, and now they’d found him. In the past, “white nationalists,” as they call themselves, had described Trump as a “Jew-lover,” but the new tone of his campaign was a revelation. Richard Spencer is a self-described “identitarian” who lives in Whitefish, Montana, and promotes “white racial consciousness.” At thirty-six, Spencer is trim and preppy, with degrees from the University of Virginia and the University of Chicago. He is the president and director of the National Policy Institute, a think tank, co-founded by William Regnery, a member of the conservative publishing family, that is “dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of European people in the United States and around the world.” The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Spencer “a suit-and-tie version of the white supremacists of old.” Spencer told me that he had expected the Presidential campaign to be an “amusing freak show,” but that Trump was “refreshing.” He went on, “Trump, on a gut level, kind of senses that this is about demographics, ultimately. We’re moving into a new America.” He said, “I don’t think Trump is a white nationalist,” but he did believe that Trump reflected “an unconscious vision that white people have—that their grandchildren might be a hated minority in their own country. I think that scares us. They probably aren’t able to articulate it. I think it’s there. I think that, to a great degree, explains the Trump phenomenon. I think he is the one person who can tap into it.”","1659","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Jared Taylor, the editor of American Renaissance, a white-nationalist magazine and Web site based in Oakton, Virginia, told me, in regard to Trump, “I’m sure he would repudiate any association with people like me, but his support comes from people who are more like me than he might like to admit.”","1660","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"From the beginning of the current race, the conservative establishment has been desperate for Trump to be finished. After he disparaged the war record of Senator John McCain, the New York Post gave him a front-page farewell—“DON VOYAGE”—and a Wall Street Journal editorial declared him a “catastrophe.” But Trump carried on—in part because he had activated segments of the electorate that other candidates could not, or would not. On July 20th, three days before his trip to Texas, Ann Coulter, whose most recent book is “¡Adios, America! The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole,” appeared on Sean Hannity’s show and urged fellow-Republicans to see Trump’s summer as a harbinger. “The new litmus test for real conservatives is immigration,” she said. “They used to say the same thing about the pro-life Republicans and the pro-gun Republicans, and, ‘Oh, they’re fringe and they’re tacky, and we’re so embarrassed to be associated with them.’ Now every one of them comes along and pretends they’d be Reagan.”","1661","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"From the pantheon of great demagogues, Trump has plucked some best practices—William Jennings Bryan’s bombast, Huey Long’s wit, Father Charles Coughlin’s mastery of the airwaves—but historians are at pains to find the perfect analogue, because so much of Trump’s recipe is specific to the present. Celebrities had little place in American politics until the 1920 Presidential election, when Al Jolson and other stars from the fledgling film industry endorsed Warren Harding. Two decades ago, Americans were less focussed on paid-for politicians, so Ross Perot, a self-funded billionaire candidate, did not derive the same benefit as Trump from the perception of independence.","1662","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s signature lines—“The American dream is dead” and “We don’t have victories anymore”—constitute a bitter mantra in tune with a moment when the share of Americans who tell Gallup pollsters that there is “plenty of opportunity” has dropped to an unprecedented fifty-two per cent; when trust in government has reached its lowest level on record, and Americans’ approval of both major parties has sunk, for the first time, below forty per cent. Matthew Heimbach, who is twenty-four, and a prominent white-nationalist activist in Cincinnati, told me that Trump has energized disaffected young men like him. “He is bringing people back out of their slumber,” he said.","1663","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

But, on July 9th, VDARE, an opinion site founded to “push back the plans of pro-Amnesty/Immigration Surge politicians, ethnic activists and corrupt Big Business,” hailed Trump as “the first figure with the financial, cultural, and economic resources to openly defy elite consensus. If he can mobilize Republicans behind him and make a credible run for the Presidency, he can create a whole new media environment for patriots to openly speak their mind without fear of losing their jobs.” The piece was headlined “WE ARE ALL DONALD TRUMP NOW.”","1664","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s admirers hear in his words multiple appeals. Michael Hill heads the Alabama-based League of the South, a secessionist group that envisions an independent Southern republic with an “Anglo-Celtic” leadership. In 1981, Hill began teaching history at Stillman College, a historically black college in Tuscaloosa. He applied for jobs at other schools, and was turned down, which he attributes to affirmative action. In 1994, he co-founded the League, which put him at odds, he said, with “civil-rights-age, older black faculty and administrators, looking down their nose at this uppity white boy coming out here, talking about the Confederate flag and all that kind of stuff.” In 1999, he left Stillman. He told me, “If academia is not for me, because of who I am—a white Southern male, Christian, straight, whatever—then I’m going to find something that is. I’m going to fight this battle for my people.” Hill was moved by Trump’s frequent references to Kathryn Steinle, a thirty-two-year-old woman who, on July 1st, was walking with her father on a pier in San Francisco when she was fatally wounded in what police described as a random shooting. When police arrested Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a repeat felon who had been deported from the United States five times, Trump adopted the story of “that beautiful woman” as “another example of why we must secure our border immediately.” Hill told me, “That struck such a nerve with people, because a lot of this political stuff is abstract, but, as a father, I’ve got a daughter as well, and I could just see myself holding my daughter, and her looking up at me and saying, ‘Help me, Daddy.’ ” Hill, who condemns immigration and interracial marriage and warns of the influence of “Jewry,” said, “I love to see somebody like Donald Trump come along. Not that I believe anything that he says. But he is stirring up chaos in the G.O.P., and for us that is good.”","1665","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"I joined Hill at a League of the South meeting one afternoon in July, at its newly built headquarters, on a couple of verdant acres outside Montgomery, Alabama. It was the League’s annual conference, and there were about a hundred men and women; the older men were in courtly suits or jackets, and the younger set favored jeans, with handguns holstered in the waistband. The venders’ tables had books (“The True Selma Story,” “Authentic History of the Ku Klux Klan”), stickers (“The Federal Empire Is Killing the American Dream”), and raffle tickets. The prize: a .45-calibre Sig Sauer pistol.","1666","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"After years of decline, the League has recently acquired a number of younger members, including Brad Griffin, a thirty-four-year-old who writes an influential blog under the name Hunter Wallace. Short and genial, he wore Top-Siders, khaki shorts, and a polo shirt. As we talked, Griffin’s eyes wandered to his two-year-old son, who was roaming nearby. Griffin told me that he embraced white nationalism after reading Patrick Buchanan’s “Death of the West,” which argued, in Griffin’s words, that “all of the European peoples were dying out, their birthrates were low, and you had mass immigration and multiculturalism.” Griffin once had high hopes for the Tea Party. “They channelled all that rage into electing an impressive number of Republicans in the South, but then all they did was try to cut rich Republicans’ taxes and make life easier for billionaires!” he said. “It was all hijacked, and a classic example of how these right-wing movements emerge, and they’re misdirected into supporting the status quo.”","1667","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Griffin had recently told his readers that his opinion of Donald Trump was “soaring.” He sees Trump’s surge as a “hostile takeover of the Republican Party. He’s blowing up their stage-managed dog-and-pony show.” Griffin is repelled by big-money politics, so I asked why he spoke highly of Trump. “He’s a billionaire, but all of these other little candidates are owned by their own little billionaires.” He mentioned Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers. “So I think Trump is independent.”","1668","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"The longer I stayed, the more I sensed that my fellow-attendees occupied a parallel universe in which white Americans face imminent demise, the South is preparing to depart the United States, and Donald Trump is going to be President. When Hill took the stage, he told his compatriots that the recent lowering of the Confederate flag was just the beginning. Soon, he warned, adopting the unspecified “they,” they will come for the “monuments, battlefields, parks, cemeteries, street names, even the dead themselves.” The crowd was on its feet, cheering him on. “This, my friends, is cultural genocide,” he said, adding, “Often, as history has shown, cultural genocide is merely a prelude to physical genocide.” I ducked out to catch a flight to Des Moines: Trump was speaking the next day in Iowa.","1669","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

The buffet was serving free pulled-pork sandwiches, and Trump’s warmup act, Tana Goertz (runner-up, “The Apprentice,” Season 3), told the crowd, “Please go eat!

"It must be stated clearly that (to the delight of the far-right extremists I spoke with) a great many Republicans are mortified by Trump—horrified by his campaign of fear, embarrassed that others in the Party are not, and desperate to move on. But Trump’s strategy has its logic. Gary Johnson, who as a Republican served two terms as the governor of New Mexico, before becoming the 2012 Libertarian Party Presidential candidate, told me that anyone who runs for office discovers that some portion of the electorate is available to be enraged and manipulated, if a candidate is willing to do it. “I ran across this constantly,” he said. “This eight per cent out there that bangs their fist on the table and says, ‘The biggest problem we’re facing is immigration!’ And I’m going, ‘No! No! This is not the case!’ ” Johnson cited a poll that at that point put Trump’s support among Republicans at eighteen per cent, and told me, “I don’t think there’s an eighteen-per-cent element of this country that is just outright racist. But there is a segment out there that is, and he has definitely appealed to that.” Most people, in Johnson’s view, are animated by other parts of Trump’s pitch—“that he’s going to get in and make the tough deals, and nobody’s going to screw with him, because he’ll drop bombs.” That coalition—the fearful and the frustrated—is powerful. “That’s how you begin to get to eighteen per cent,” Johnson said.","1671","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"As people turned up in Oskaloosa, I encountered some of the fearful. A construction worker named Ron James, wearing a T-shirt that said “Every-Juan Illegal Go Home,” told me that the “invasion of illegals” is eroding American culture: “We’re getting flushed down the toilet.” But the vast majority of the room, as best I could tell, was more like Stephanie DeVolder, an elegant fiftysomething, with blond hair and bright-green eyes, who had worked as a sales rep for Dice, a job-search site. She was glad that Trump had “brought up the horrific treatment of the veterans,” and that “he is a foremost believer in the military,” and she admired his work on television. “I bought the videos of ‘The Apprentice,’ and watched the whole thing,” she said. “He is a phenomenal judge of character, and he actually does have a heart. He is absolutely amazing.” His fame had guided her to his political views, and, in time, she had concluded that he was “absolutely right about border security.”","1672","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Emerging from the wings, in a navy suit, a white shirt, and a pink tie, Trump paused midway across the stage to spread his arms in a gesture of astonished, grateful embrace. For years, Trump has been compared to P. T. Barnum, but the comparison doesn’t capture his range; on the campaign trail, he is less the carnival barker than the full cast—the lion, the fire-eater, the clown with the seltzer—all trussed into a single-breasted Brioni suit. Music from the “Karate Kid” soundtrack blared—“You’re the best around! Nothing’s gonna ever keep you down!”—and, for a moment, Trump looked genuinely startled by the ardor of the stargazers in the crowd. At the lectern, he said, “It’s a terrific place, Iowa.” Then he monologued for an hour, off the cuff, on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server (“What she did is very criminal”); Scott Walker (“Finally, I can attack!”); the Veterans Administration (“the most corrupt group of people in all of Washington”).","1673","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"As always, he created a powerful set piece about Mexican criminals who are allowed to “roam around, shooting people and killing people,” as he put it. He described this as a hidden scourge: “Such a big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it.” He reminded the crowd of his trip to Laredo: “I told the pilots, I said, ‘Fly a little bit away from the border, please. Fly a little bit inland.’ It’s a whole scary thing.” He said that when he returned to New York his wife had greeted him in tears. “You made it safely from the border!” she cried. As always, he spoke of Kathryn Steinle’s murder—“Kate, beautiful Kate”—and of the death of Jamiel Shaw’s son, “shot by an animal, an animal that shouldn’t have been in this country.” He urged Iowans to be afraid, even if they didn’t see the threat. “When you’re afraid to walk into your own country, it’s pretty bad,” he said. “Hard to believe. You don’t have that problem in Iowa, in all fairness. But it’s pretty rough out there.”","1674","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"Trump has always weaved in and out of racially charged controversies. In 2000, he secretly ran ads opposing a Catskills casino backed by the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, because it would rival his businesses in Atlantic City. Beneath a picture of drug paraphernalia, the ad asked, “Are these the new neighbors we want?” Tribal leaders denounced the message as “racist and inflammatory,” and Trump and his associates were fined by New York State for concealing the true source of the ads. In March, 2011, Trump, who was considering a Presidential run, resurrected the crackpot theory that Barack Obama is not an American citizen, declaring, “I want him to show his birth certificate.” (It had already been publicly available for more than three years.) Trump’s declaration gave the issue new prominence. At the time, Trump’s on-again, off-again political adviser, the former Nixon aide Roger Stone, said that the decision to become a birther was “a brilliant base-building move.”","1676","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s phantasmagorical visions of marauding immigrants are part of a genre in which immigration and race are intermingled. In recent years, hoaxes and theories that were once confined to the margins have been laundered through mainstream media outlets. In 2013, Fox News repeatedly broadcast warnings about the “knockout game,” based on a self-published book by the white nationalist Colin Flaherty, which described black men randomly attacking white pedestrians. In a study published in the journal Race & Class, Mike King, a sociologist at SUNY-Oneonta, searched for a single actual case of the knockout game and found none. The news reports were largely patched together from unrelated viral videos of street violence.

"Taylor, who calls himself a “racial dissident,” was slim and decorous in gray trousers and a button-down when we met. For years, he and others have sensed an opportunity on the horizon to expand their ranks. When Obama was elected in 2008, Stormfront, the leading white-supremacist Web forum, crashed from heavy traffic. The Klan, weakened by lawsuits and infighting, barely exists anymore, but the Internet draws in young racists like Dylann Roof, who is accused of the June 17th massacre of nine people at a church in Charleston. The attack inspired a broad effort to remove the Confederate flag—from the state capitol and from the shelves of Amazon and of Walmart and a host of other retail stores. Defenders of the flag were galvanized, and they organized more than a hundred rallies around the South, interpreting the moment, months after racial unrest in Ferguson and Baltimore, as a sign of a backlash against political correctness and multiculturalism. Trump’s language landed just as American hate groups were more energized than at any time in years. Griffin, the blogger for the League of the South, told me that the removal of the flag had crystallized “fears that people have about what happens when we become a minority. What happens when we have no control over things? You’re seeing it play out right now.”","1679","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

In a study published in 2011, Michael Norton, a professor at Harvard Business School, and Samuel Sommers, a professor of psychology at Tufts, found that more than half of white Americans believe that whites have replaced blacks as “the primary victims of discrimination” today, even though, as Norton and Sommers write, “by nearly any metric—from employment to police treatment, loan rates to education—statistics continue to indicate drastically poorer outcomes for Black than White Americans.”","1681","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

I watched it on television with Matthew Heimbach, the young white nationalist in Cincinnati, and some of his friends. Heimbach, whom anti-racist activists call “the Little Fuhrer,” for his tirades against “rampant multiculturalism,” founded the Traditionalist Youth Network, a far-right group that caters to high-school and college students and pushes for the separation of blacks and whites. Stocky and bearded, Heimbach is ambitious.

Like many ultraconservatives, Heimbach had largely given up on the Republican Party.

"The Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington-based organization that seeks to reduce immigration (it is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center), hailed Trump’s plan as the “American Workers’ Bill of Rights.” Mark Meckler, the co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, described it as a new standard “that all the other candidates will now have to meet,” and Scott Walker immediately echoed Trump’s call for building a wall and ending birthright citizenship. Other Republicans recoiled, convinced that Trump’s nativist turn would taint the Party’s image as ruinously as Mitt Romney’s “self-deportation” comments in his race against Barack Obama. At the time, Trump himself disapproved of Romney’s approach, saying, in November, 2012, “He had a crazy policy of ‘self- deportation,’ which was maniacal. It sounded as bad as it was, and he lost all of the Latino vote. He lost the Asian vote. He lost everybody who is inspired to come into this country.” Trump now faced the risk that his new stance could eventually undo him.","1695","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"Before dawn on Wednesday, two brothers from South Boston allegedly attacked a homeless Hispanic man, breaking his nose and urinating on his face. The police said that, after the men were arrested, one of them, Scott Leader, justified the assault by saying, “Donald Trump was right—all these illegals need to be deported.” (Both men pleaded not guilty.) When Trump was asked at a press conference about the case, and about threats of other violence, he replied, “I think that would be a shame, but I haven’t heard about that. I will say that people that are following me are very passionate. They love this country, and they want this country to be great again, and they are very passionate, I will say that.” (Two days later, Trump, under fire, tweeted, “Boston incident is terrible. . . . I would never condone violence.”)","1697","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"When Trump leaped to the head of the Republican field, he delivered the appearance of legitimacy to a moral vision once confined to the fevered fringe, elevating fantasies from the message boards and campgrounds to the center stage of American life. In doing so, he pulled America into a current that is coursing through other Western democracies—Britain, France, Spain, Greece, Scandinavia—where xenophobic, nationalist parties have emerged since the 2008 economic crisis to besiege middle-ground politicians. In country after country, voters beset by inequality and scarcity have reached past the sober promises of the center-left and the center-right to the spectre of a transcendent solution, no matter how cruel. “The more complicated the problem, the simpler the demands become,” Samuel Popkin, a political scientist at the University of California in San Diego, told me. “When people get frustrated and irritated, they want to cut the Gordian knot.”","1698","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump has succeeded in unleashing an old gene in American politics—the crude tribalism that Richard Hofstadter named “the paranoid style”—and, over the summer, it replicated like a runaway mutation. Whenever Americans have confronted the reshuffling of status and influence—the Great Migration, the end of Jim Crow, the end of a white majority—we succumb to the anti-democratic politics of absolutism, of a “conflict between absolute good and absolute evil,” in which, Hofstadter wrote, “the quality needed is not a willingness to compromise but the will to fight things out to a finish. Nothing but complete victory will do.” Trump was born to the part. “I’ll do nearly anything within legal bounds to win,” he wrote, in “The Art of the Deal.” “Sometimes, part of making a deal is denigrating your competition.” Trump, who long ago mastered the behavioral nudges that could herd the public into his casinos and onto his golf courses, looked so playful when he gave out Lindsey Graham’s cell-phone number that it was easy to miss just how malicious a gesture it truly was. It expressed the knowledge that, with a single utterance, he could subject an enemy to that most savage weapon of all: us.","1699","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Trump has bequeathed a concoction of celebrity, wealth, and alienation that is more potent than any we’ve seen before. If, as the Republican establishment hopes, the stargazers eventually defect, Trump will be left with the hardest core—the portion of the electorate that is drifting deeper into unreality, with no reconciliation in sight. ♦","1700","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"When Martin O’Malley, one of the back-running Democratic Presidential candidates, accused “party bosses” of fixing the nomination process, it was enough to bring on a wave of nostalgia. Party bosses! The concept is as distant as a time when there really were party bosses, people like Thomas Pendergast, whose machine ran Kansas City when Harry Truman was a senator (bosses often came with “machines”), or Chicago bosses like Edward Kelly, in the Roosevelt era, or Richard J. Daley, in the Eisenhower-Kennedy-Johnson-Nixon era. But, despite O’Malley’s complaint, it is hard to make a case that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman who heads the Democratic National Committee, is a boss or controls a machine, even if the debate schedule—four “authorized” debates before the Iowa caucuses, on February 1st, and just six in all—does skew suspiciously toward the already widely known Hillary Clinton. Eight years ago, when Barack Obama won the nomination, the contenders met twenty-five times.","August 11, 2015","1729","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-the-g-o-p-need-a-new-machine"

Priebus can seem like the dad in an old-time situation comedy, the ineffectual, slightly comic figure who accidentally switches shopping lists with a shady neighbor. Priebus aside, the Republican Party may nonetheless have acquired a new sort of boss, or perhaps anti-boss—Fox News Channel’s Megyn Kelly, who is politically alert, unflinching, and, to judge from the evidence of recent years, attuned to reality. That’s what so annoyed the onetime “mastermind” Karl Rove when, on the night of the 2012 election, he refused to accept the arithmetic of the decisive Ohio vote. Kelly tried to help him with the math, and their curious dialogue continued two days later, when Rove insisted several times that Obama’s victory wasn’t all that impressive and Kelly said, “You keep saying that, but he won, Karl, he won … and that’s what the Republicans care about, what the Democrats care about.”","1730","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-the-g-o-p-need-a-new-machine"

Rather, the beginning of the slow-motion end for Trump, if indeed it is the end, won’t have come from a private conversation among city bosses or a shove from Reince Priebus—or from the other Republican candidates, who are either ineffectual or have shied away. It may take years to understand what it means to give a cable anchor the power, and authority, to try to push a leading candidate off the bus.

"Here in America, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, sexism is very much on the wane, but misogyny is not. Sexism—the conviction that women don’t deserve equal pay, political rights, or access to education—can be combatted by argument, by anti-discrimination laws, and by giving women the opportunity to prove their ability. Misogyny is not amenable to such advances; they can in some circumstances exacerbate it, though they may drive it underground. An example of misogyny is when someone online threatens to rape and mutilate a woman whose opinions that person does not like. Another is when a Presidential candidate says of a female journalist whose questions he finds impertinent, “There was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her—wherever.”","1751","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-g-o-p-s-misogyny-primary"
"The day after Trump made his comment about Megyn Kelly, he was disinvited from the RedState network’s annual conference of G.O.P. leaders. RedState’s editor-in-chief, Erick Erickson, who is also a Fox News commentator, explained, “As much as I do personally like Donald Trump, his comment about Megyn Kelly on CNN is just a bridge too far for me.” He went on, “There are just lines of decency a person running for president should not cross.” That may have been cheering to Republican women. The defense of some sort of decorum in public life seems like a reasonable position to stake out, especially for a true conservative. Ross Perot, the last shoot-from-the-hip, vote-for-me-I’m-a businessman, Republican-ish candidate we saw on the Presidential debate stage, was not given to insulting women. So on one level, Trump’s preening misogyny and gross-out insinuations are something new—a weird product of his own personality and the id-indulging media through which he generally communicates. In their exchange at last week’s debate, Kelly reminded him, “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals,’ ” and then asked if that called to mind “the temperament of a man we should elect as President.” It was a legitimate question, but Trump offered no real answer, let alone regret; the problem, he said, was “political correctness.” None of the other nine candidates onstage countered this interpretation. So, if a fellow Republican were put off enough to cancel a speaking invitation for Trump, that seemed promising. It was a little deflating when one considered that Erickson himself was prone to Trump-like woman-baiting. (A tweet from 2010, spotted by my colleague Ryan Lizza: “Good thing I didn’t suggest the feminists … you know … shave. They’d be at my house trying a post-birth abortion on me”).","1752","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-g-o-p-s-misogyny-primary"
"The Republican Presidential candidates’ debate last week, in Cleveland, provided an opportunity to think about the relationship between this kind of misogyny and the eagerness to stake out a more and more draconian position on abortion. I’ve never believed that being anti-abortion makes you a woman-hater. People hold anti-abortion views for many reasons, including, most fundamentally, the belief that life begins at conception. But it’s hard not to see some sort of misogyny in the unseemly scramble to plant a flag at the very farthest frontier of anti-abortion territory, positively eager to reiterate, as Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker did, that bans on abortion should include no exception to save the life of a woman. Rare as such situations are—anti-abortion advocates are right to say that they don’t occur often—why would you want to bar even the possibility of saving a woman’s life over that of the fetus she is carrying? And whatever their motivation or intentions, the effect of the substantial restrictions on abortion that the Republican candidates favor would be damaging to women.","1753","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-g-o-p-s-misogyny-primary"

"Ted Cruz has an inflated sense of many things, but irony is not one of them. This explains how the Harvard Law School graduate and former Supreme Court clerk, in the wake of last week’s rulings on the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage, could take to the airwaves and attack the Court as a bastion of privilege, overstuffed with Harvard (and Yale) Law graduates. (Cruz was echoing another Harvard Law graduate, Justice Scalia, also among the irony-deficient.) In interviews, in a broadside for the National Review, and in a fiery hour-long speech in Des Moines, Cruz has promised to put the Court’s “lawlessness” at the center of his campaign for President. He is not alone in his indignation. Mike Huckabee vowed that he “will not acquiesce to any imperial court any more than our Founders acquiesced to an imperial British monarch.” Bobby Jindal, for his part, joked (presumably), “Let’s just get rid of the Court.” Other candidates—Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio—offered milder reproaches to the rulings, but the prevailing sentiment on the right is one of retribution. “We can’t just sack up our bats and go home because the Supreme Court overreached,” Representative Steve King told reporters as he waited for Cruz to arrive at a campaign appearance in western Iowa. “We’re going to have to crack them in the knuckles instead.”","June 30, 2015","1762","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"On Monday, the Court ended the term with a few decisions that conservatives could cheer: one blocked President Obama’s effort to regulate emissions from coal-fired power plants; another permitted states to continue administering a drug in executions, despite questions about its effectiveness; and, looking ahead to the next term, the Court agreed to hear a challenge to the way public-sector unions collect their dues, and to reconsider a case on affirmative action in college admissions. Neither development bodes well for progressives. At the same time, a 5-4 majority, which included Justice Kennedy, gave conservatives further cause for knuckle-cracking: first, it upheld an independent redistricting commission created by Arizona voters, and, second, it allowed ten Texas abortion clinics to remain open while they appeal a Fifth Circuit ruling that would, in effect, force them to shut down. So the Republican candidates are taking nothing back. Cruz is pressing forward with his plan to provide “the means [of] throwing off judicial tyrants”: a constitutional amendment that would subject Supreme Court justices to a national “retention election” every eight years. Forget Ready for Hillary. We’re (Still) Ready for Ruth!","1763","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"The Iowa caucuses are more than half a year away. But emotions on the right—chiefly fear and fury—about the legalization of same-sex marriage and, to a lesser extent, the survival of Obamacare, will be raw for a long time. (Roe v. Wade, recall, was decided forty-two years ago.) Grassroots Republican rage means that there is little margin for the Party’s Presidential candidates in moving on, as Hillary Clinton urged (or baited) them to do last week. Most will roll out the old tropes about “out of control” judges—“liberal activists” who “legislate from the bench” and “trample the Constitution” (when they are not busy shredding it)—and promise to appoint the other kind of judges. This is standard campaign fare, like red, white, and blue bunting, or country music, and will excite, enrage, or bore you, depending on your predilections. Cruz’s idea that voters should be granted, as he puts it, “periodic power to pass judgment on the judgments of their judges,” is a more radical notion—one that finds favor among social conservatives. Cruz cites, as inspiration, a successful 2010 effort to remove three Iowa state Supreme Court judges who upheld same-sex marriage as constitutional, and similar campaigns to remove judges who defied conservative orthodoxy on the death penalty and on term limits for state legislators. “We’ve done it before, and we will do it again,” he said in Des Moines. Hedging his bets, Cruz—along with another Republican hopeful, Scott Walker—wants to strip the federal courts of their jurisdiction over the issue of marriage.","1764","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"Cruz is not just posturing; he is stoking a pervasive and potentially destructive strain of anti-court sentiment within the G.O.P. He is not just attacking particular opinions or judges; he is attacking the judiciary itself as inherently unrepresentative, unaccountable, and in need of restraint. The same mindset can be seen in Kansas Governor Sam Brownback’s threat to wipe out funding for the state judiciary if the state Supreme Court defies him and strikes down a law restricting its own authority. It is also apparent in the attempt, in 2013, by House and Senate Republicans to eliminate three vacant seats on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in order to deny President Obama the chance to fill them with his appointees, and in Newt Gingrich’s call, in 2011, to empower Congress to subpoena judges and haul them to the Hill to justify their decisions.","1765","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"This is not a string of scattered events; it is a strategy, and is not without precedent. In another irony that Cruz is unlikely to acknowledge, his crusade recalls that of a Republican progressive—Senator Robert M. La Follette, of Wisconsin—who, in 1922, charged that America was “ruled by a judicial oligarchy.” Speaking to the American Federation of Labor, in Cincinnati, La Follette condemned the Court—which had long been hostile to social reform and economic regulation—for overturning a federal ban on child labor, a workmen’s-compensation act, and other progressive legislation. “By a bare majority,” La Follette said, “the court has repeatedly overridden the will of the people as declared by their representatives in Congress and has construed the Constitution to mean whatever suited their peculiar economic and political views.”","1766","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"“The time has come,” La Follette shouted, as A.F.L. delegates stood on chairs and banged on tables, “when we must put the axe to the root of this monstrous growth upon the body of our government.” The axe: a constitutional amendment granting Congress a veto over Supreme Court decisions.","1767","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"La Follette’s proposal went nowhere, but his attack on the judiciary, his demand that it “be made responsive to the popular will,” had a lasting influence. It helped to condition a generation of progressives to see the problem with the Court, and with courts generally, as inherent—requiring fundamental, structural changes in the shape and function of the judiciary, not merely a batch of new and better judges. By the middle of the nineteen-thirties, when a conflict erupted between Franklin Roosevelt and the Supreme Court over the New Deal, liberals rushed to embrace radical solutions—amendments that would have rewritten key clauses of the Constitution and eroded or ended the system of checks and balances. Roosevelt’s plan to pack the Court emerged in that atmosphere. (The plan famously failed, but only just barely.) Cruz’s punitive proposals—and the campaign of judicial intimidation in Kansas and other states—can be seen, in this light, as a seeding of the ground that might well, someday, yield a bitter harvest.","1768","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"Two months ago, in the first speech of his Presidential campaign, Donald Trump departed from his prepared text in order to speak—vehemently and apparently extemporaneously—about the issues that concerned him most. One of the first was immigration, and he suggested, somewhat paradoxically, that unauthorized immigrants from Mexico were out-competing American workers (“They are beating us, economically”) and also undermining American society. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems,” he added, and then he provided a taxonomy: “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists—and some, I assume, are good people.”","August 19, 2015","1769","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"Some observers thought that the speech was a political disaster, especially because of that one extraordinarily inflammatory word: “rapists.” But it’s clear, in retrospect, that this speech marked the beginning of the Trump surge. The speech inspired weeks of coverage, making Trump—who was unapologetic—the biggest story in political media. A few weeks after the speech, NBC announced that, “due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants,” it would no longer broadcast his Miss U.S.A. or Miss Universe pageants, and he would no longer appear on “The Apprentice,” the long-running reality show. It is possible that, by disrupting Trump’s television career, NBC only made him more motivated to succeed in politics. Less than a month after his launch speech, a poll put Trump, for the first time, atop the Republican heap. It is likely that, by using the R-word, Trump helped establish himself as the only Republican candidate eager to speak his mind on an issue that most of the field would prefer to avoid: immigration.","1770","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"This past weekend, Trump released his first detailed policy statement, on the topic that made him a front-runner; it is called “Immigration Reform that Will Make America Great Again.” He called for more immigration officers, tougher penalties for visitors who overstay their visas, a “pause” in the issuing of new green cards, the end of “birthright citizenship,” and the construction of a “permanent border wall”—to be paid for, he said, by Mexico. This last proposal drew plenty of scorn, since it is hard to imagine how the Mexican government might be induced to spend billions of dollars on a barrier at the behest of U.S. politicians. (Trump suggested that, in the face of Mexican recalcitrance, the U.S. could “impound” remittances from unauthorized workers and charge higher fees to visitors from Mexico.) But some Trump skeptics seemed pleasantly surprised. The editors of National Review, who had previously accused Trump of “intellectual failure” for his unclear statements on immigration, offered qualified praise for the new plan. “It is sensible in its basic outline,” they wrote, “and better in many respects than the ideas presented by his rivals.”","1771","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"On Tuesday night, during an interview with Bill O’Reilly on Fox News, Trump reiterated his call for “a big, beautiful, powerful wall” to be built on the border with Mexico. On the matter of birthright citizenship, O’Reilly said that Trump’s plan to abolish it would be foiled by the Fourteenth Amendment, which says, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.” Trump, needless to say, was unperturbed. “Many lawyers are saying that’s not the way it is,” he replied—referring, perhaps, to advocates and scholars who argue that the Fourteenth Amendment has been widely misinterpreted.","1772","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"Earlier this summer, it seemed that Trump’s presence in the race could actually make it easier for the other Republican candidates to avoid talking about immigration. They could merely affirm that Trump’s comments about “rapists” were “extraordinarily ugly” or “offensive and inaccurate,” repudiating him without making any specific commitments of their own. Trump’s new proposal may compel them to have the kind of policy discussion that Presidential campaigns are, in general, designed to avoid.","1773","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"In early June, Pew published a new poll chronicling the country’s mixed feelings about immigration. Among other things, the poll provided yet more proof that, when it comes to immigration, Republican politicians are often out of step with Republican voters. When asked to choose between two assertions about the impact of immigration on the U.S., sixty-three per cent of Republicans agreed that immigrants “burden” the country by taking jobs, housing, and health care; only twenty-seven per cent agreed that they “strengthen” the country “through hard work & talents.” But the Republican majority was in the national minority: over all, respondents chose “strengthen” over “burden,” by a margin of fifty-one to forty-one. The numbers explain why, especially in general elections, Republican candidates like Mitt Romney and John McCain have taken pains to emphasize America’s hospitability to immigrants. But the numbers also help account for the frustration among Republican voters who have noticed that, when it comes to immigration, their own party is ignoring them.","1774","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"At the same time, the Pew poll captured a broader ambivalence about immigration. Although Democrats said that they wanted unauthorized immigrants to be able to remain in the country, only forty-eight per cent said that they should be able to apply for citizenship; only twenty-four per cent said that legal immigration should be increased. Meanwhile, a majority of Republicans agreed that granting legal status to unauthorized immigrants was “like a reward for doing something wrong”—and yet a majority of Republicans, even conservative Republicans, said that unauthorized immigrants should nevertheless be “allowed to stay legally.”","1775","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"It is hard to have a consistent position on U.S. immigration laws, partly because the laws themselves seem so inconsistent, and inconsistently enforced: an immigrant who evades armed guards at the border might subsequently arrive in a so-called sanctuary city, in which the federal statutes seem not to apply. Immigrants rearranging—and sometimes risking—their lives must take into account not only the laws that currently exist but also the ways in which those laws will or will not change in coming decades. One of Trump’s simplest and boldest ideas is to end birthright citizenship, the constitutional doctrine under which anyone born inside the U.S. is considered a citizen of it. (Immigration-restriction advocates argue that birthright citizenship incentivizes unauthorized immigration.) Automatic birthright citizenship is widespread in the Americas, but not beyond them; European and Asian countries have more restrictive rules. In other words, birthright citizenship is both an American tradition and a global anomaly, which means that ending it could seem either radical or common-sensical, depending on one’s perspective and objectives.","1776","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"Already, Trump’s call for an end to birthright citizenship has brought some clarity to the Republican conversation on immigration. Scott Walker, who used to support a comprehensive reform that would allow unauthorized immigrants to remain in the country, told Fox News in March, “My view has changed.” In an interview with Breitbart last week, he talked about the need to “secure the border,” but offered few details. It wasn’t until earlier this week, when a reporter asked him about Trump’s proposal, that Walker seemed to say, apparently for the first time, that the U.S. should “absolutely” end birthright citizenship. Meanwhile, Marco Rubio said he was “open to doing things that prevent people who deliberately come to the U.S. for the purposes of taking advantage” of birthright citizenship, but said that Trump’s proposal to eliminate the doctrine was “really not a workable plan.” And Jeb Bush said, “We ought to fix the problem, rather than take away rights that are constitutionally endowed.”","1777","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"For a time, it seemed that Trump’s campaign might be merely a spectacle, albeit a captivating one. But with the release of his plan, he seems to have started something even more engrossing: a substantive political debate. After offering qualified praise for Trump’s proposal, the National Review editorial concluded on a note of skepticism: “Immigration is too important to be left to The Donald.” But perhaps the topic was too politically risky to be broached by anyone else.","1778","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"If the 2016 Presidential campaign seems unusually gloomy, it’s not hard to see why, starting with the cowardice revealed by those Republicans who, after the sickening murders in Charleston, were, for too long, unable to utter a declarative sentence when asked whether the Confederate flag flying over the South Carolina statehouse (the one that went up in 1962, to protest the civil-rights movement) should come down and whether the flag had a proper place in any public building. Other Republicans took a break from that line of thought to promise to “resist” marriage equality, now legal in fifty states. So much for the Party of Lincoln.","June 30, 2015","1779","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"Charleston seems to be forcing at least some Republicans to confront the party’s post-Barry Goldwater problem with race.

"Otherwise, seventeen months before the general election, and despite the welcome offstage diversions of those Supreme Court decisions—affirming same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act—the language of the 2016 race has been unnervingly free of thought. It’s as if a politically themed Pandora has been supplying the words and phrases most likely to please each constituency. On Roosevelt Island earlier this month, for instance, when Hillary Clinton tried to explain why she’s running, she promised to be in just about everyone’s corner: “For the successful and the struggling. For the innovators and inventors. For those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases. For the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day. For the nurses who work the night shift. For the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us. For the veterans who served our country. For the small business owners who took a risk. For everyone who’s ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.”","1781","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"If that sounded familiar, it may be because Vice-President Al Gore said something very similar fifteen years ago, when he accepted the Presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention and said “Whether you’re in a suburb or an inner city, whether you raise crops or drive hogs and cattle on a farm, drive a big rig on the interstate or drive e-commerce on the Internet, whether you’re starting out to raise your own family or getting ready to retire after a lifetime of hard work, so often powerful forces and powerful interests stand in your way and the odds seem stacked against you, even as you do what’s right for you and your family.”","1782","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"Gore also got there first with the “everyday Americans” whom Clinton intends to keep meeting and to “champion.” He spoke, he said, for “those who need a voice, those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up, so they are never left behind,” and he promised “to go out to you, the people, because I want to stay in touch with your hopes, with the quiet everyday heroism of working families.”","1783","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"When Senator Marco Rubio launched his campaign, in mid-April, he said, “If we reform our tax code, reduce regulations, control spending, modernize our immigration laws, and repeal and replace Obamacare”—still the required Republican cri de coeur—“the American people will create millions of better-paying modern jobs.” Clinton said, “We will restore America to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments. And we will make America the clean-energy superpower of the twenty-first century …. Now, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable America to lead the global fight against climate change.” Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush accompanied dreamy projections of economic growth with an actual number: “There is not a reason in the world why we cannot grow at a rate of four per cent a year. And that will be my goal as President—four-per-cent growth, and the nineteen million new jobs that come with it.”","1784","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"As for American muscularity, Rubio talked about reclaiming the “mantle of global leadership,” Bush accused the Obama Administration “of running us straight in the direction of the greatest risk of all—military inferiority,” and Rick Perry said that “America has entered a time of testing, and our leaders are failing the test.” Former Secretary of State Clinton, as the front-running Democrat, faces some barriers to endorsing the “feckless Obama” theme. Rather, as John Cassidy has pointed out, she’s still explaining her 2002 vote to authorize the disaster in Iraq as well as her interventionist impulses that arguably contributed to making the situations in Syria and Libya worse. Voters may begin to wonder if lessons about the goals, and limits, of American power will ever be learned.","1785","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"With all this, voters certainly want to hear real ideas with even a scintilla of originality, and some of these are coming from candidates who are not high in the polls, such as Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, who has introduced legislation that would invest a trillion dollars—no more than the cost of a small Mideast war—to modernize the nation’s infrastructure over a five-year period. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul has introduced what he calls the “Read the Bills Act,” which would require members of Congress to actually read the bills they vote on, a fascinating concept.","1786","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"

"There are two gambles, President Barack Obama said in his press conference on Wednesday, that he was neither making nor relying on with regard to his nuclear deal with Iran. The first was that the Iranian government was ever going to change—“Will we try to encourage them to take a more constructive path? Of course. But we’re not betting on it.” The other was that his political opponents would evaluate the agreement “on the facts, not on politics, not on posturing, not on the fact this is a deal I bring to Congress as opposed to a Republican President, not based on lobbying but based on what’s in the national interest.” That would be nice, “but we live in Washington,” and so, the President said, “I am not betting on the Republican Party rallying behind this agreement.”","July 15, 2015","1796","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-on-the-iran-deal-whats-your-alternative"
"The first point is one that he emphasized, as well, in his interview with Thomas Friedman, of the Times. This deal is not the fall of the mullahs, nor was it meant to be. It addressed a “very specific, narrow, but profound issue—the possibility of Iran getting a nuclear weapon.” And it made that possibility far less likely. Obama was not going to build his case on the idea that an Iran more open to the world might become less militant; maybe it would, but “this deal is not contingent on Iran changing its behavior. It’s not contingent on Iran suddenly operating like a liberal democracy. It solves one particular problem, which is making sure they don’t have a bomb.” Iran might still sponsor terrorism and start wars, but “it’ll be a lot easier for us to check Iran’s nefarious activities if they don’t have the bomb.”","1797","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-on-the-iran-deal-whats-your-alternative"
"Can’t we do both? This is where Obama pushed hardest: on the question of what the alternative to the deal might be. “With this deal, we cut off every single one of Iran’s pathways to a nuclear program, a nuclear-weapons program. And Iran’s nuclear program will be under severe limits for many years. Without a deal, those pathways remain open.” Indeed, if talks broke down Iran could do what it wasn’t doing now—begin to openly, heedlessly, build a bomb. The criticism is that the Iranians will not only do it anyway, in ten years, when the restrictions start to expire, but will have an easier time, because the lifting of sanctions will have made them richer. Jeb Bush, the Republican contender, said that the deal “paves Iran’s path to a bomb.”","1798","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-on-the-iran-deal-whats-your-alternative"
"This brand of criticism, Obama said, was premised on the idea that, if the United States walked away, we’d be “able to keep sanctions in place with the same vigor and effectiveness as we have right now. And that, I can promise you, is not true.” Over the past few years, countries in Europe and Asia have agreed to support sanctions, in some cases at a cost to themselves, not because they wanted Iran permanently impoverished but because they didn’t want it to have a bomb. Obama tried to make it clear that, for much of the world, the nuclear threat was “the reason” for a sanctions regime, not just a rationale. (And, as the North Koreans have demonstrated, you don’t need to be all that rich to get a bomb.)","1799","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-on-the-iran-deal-whats-your-alternative"
"“With this deal, if Iran violates its commitments, there will be real consequences. Nuclear-related sanctions that have helped to cripple the Iranian economy will snap back into place,” Obama said. “Without a deal, the international sanctions regime will unravel with little ability to re-impose them.”","1800","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-on-the-iran-deal-whats-your-alternative"
"Other Republican contenders have attacked Obama for giving Iran “legitimacy,” for not taking seriously enough Israel’s concerns about Iran’s long-term development (“This could be a death sentence for the state of Israel,” Lindsey Graham said), and for being naïve about the essential untrustworthiness of the Iranians. (“That means, presumably, that you can’t negotiate, and what you’re really saying is that you’ve got to apply military to guarantee that they don’t have a nuclear program,” Obama said, adding that he found the argument “not persuasive.”) The immediate option the Republicans have is a vote, within a sixty-day window, opposing the deal.

The President was eager to put out the message that if people had questions he had answers—and, as the exegeses on the technical aspects of inspection regimes demonstrated, he pretty much did. Toward the end, with the reporters in the room seeming somewhat drained, Obama almost fished for challenges, taking out a piece of paper and saying, “O.K., I’m just going to look—I made some notes about many of the arguments, the other arguments that I’ve heard here.” Someone shouted out a suggestion—it had to do with when the deal expired—“O.K. Yeah, that’s a good one,” Obama said, and jumped into it. Assume, he said, that it was ten years later, and some of the restrictions started to expire. And then, after fifteen, more of them did. There’d still be inspections, and, after all those years of investigation, the international community would have insight into Iran’s programs.","1802","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-on-the-iran-deal-whats-your-alternative"
"April Ryan, of American Urban Radio Networks, provided a break from Iran, asking whether Obama might revoke Bill Cosby’s Medal of Freedom. The President, after saying that “there was no mechanism” for taking the medal back—no snapback sanctions, one might say—emphasized that the main issue was pretty clear: “If you give a woman, or a man, for that matter, without his or her knowledge a drug and then have sex with that person without consent, that’s rape. And I think this country, any civilized country, should have no tolerance for rape.”","1803","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-on-the-iran-deal-whats-your-alternative"
"On Iran, again and again, Obama practically dared his critics to explain why they really didn’t like the deal—was it him, maybe?—given that, as he sees it, it achieves what they had said they wanted. There were moments when Obama’s calling-their-bluff cheer gave way to a tougher tone. One came when Major Garrett, of CBS News, asked about four American citizens in Iranian prisons (these include the reporter Jason Rezaian)—“Can you tell the country, sir, why you are content, with all the fanfare around this deal, to leave the conscience of this nation, the strength of this nation, unaccounted for in relation to these four Americans?”","1804","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-on-the-iran-deal-whats-your-alternative"

"They had kept the negotiations separate, Obama said, to prevent the Iranians from using the prisoners to get concessions on the nuclear issue, and to make it easier for the Americans to walk away. Here, and elsewhere in the press conference, he circled back to his main questions: what are your alternatives, really? And are you rejecting mine in good faith?","1806","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obama-on-the-iran-deal-whats-your-alternative"

"People on both sides of the ideological divide—along with the millions in the middle—seem to agree. But how can we reduce the number and the rate of abortions? Roughly half of the more than six million pregnancies in the United States each year are unintended. And many of them are to young mothers: according to the Guttmacher Institute, the rate of unintended pregnancies among sexually active teens is double that of all women.","1809","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/planned-parenthood-means-fewer-abortions"

"That group could really lower the abortion and teen-age pregnancy rates in this country. Oh. Wait. We have that organization. It’s called Planned Parenthood. Yes, Planned Parenthood offers abortions—which are legal in the United States. Nonetheless, according to Planned Parenthood, just three per cent of its services involve abortions. The vast majority of those services are devoted to the organization’s more central goal—helping people avoid unwanted pregnancy altogether.","1811","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/planned-parenthood-means-fewer-abortions"
"And who doesn’t support that? Few federally funded organizations can realistically claim to have had more success. There is an almost unending stream of data showing that the numbers of abortions and pregnant teen-agers in the U.S. are at their lowest levels in forty years. The drop has been sharp. In 1991, sixty-two out of every thousand females between the ages of fifteen and nineteen gave birth to a child. In 2013, the figure was twenty-seven. The birth rate has fallen in every geographic region. It has fallen among whites, blacks, and Hispanics. It’s fallen in big cities and rural outposts. It has fallen on college campuses and in the workplace. Fewer pregnant teens also means fewer abortions.","1812","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/planned-parenthood-means-fewer-abortions"
"Could it be that education works? The U.S still has the highest teen-pregnancy rates in the developed world. But it is hard to understand how more restrictive abortion laws would reduce the need for abortions. Clearly, however, better access to birth control and sex education has made significant impacts on unwanted pregnancies. The rate of abortions among adolescents in the U.S. is the lowest it has been since abortions became legal, in 1973. The numbers have fallen by two-thirds since 1988.","1813","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/planned-parenthood-means-fewer-abortions"

"Stripping the funding from Planned Parenthood, as Jeb Bush and other Republicans have proposed, would add to the burden.

"As it happens, the Bush family has a track record when it comes to depriving people of contraceptives and even of the opportunity to learn about them. George W. Bush’s Administration was devoted to the idea that abstinence was the only solution to pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and, of course, abortion. Once, he sent federal officials to lecture experienced scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta, on the value of refraining from sex. Truly. In fact, almost every political group involved in the issue supports abstinence. But relying on it as the primary method of birth control is another thing entirely, because those programs often fail.","1816","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/planned-parenthood-means-fewer-abortions"
"Several years ago, researchers at Yale and Columbia set out to study the impact of virginity-pledge programs. They found that many participants did delay having sex, but that, when it came to preventing sexually-transmitted diseases or pregnancy, students in the programs fared no better than those in the control group. The study also found that students who promised to remain virgins were less likely to use contraception when they did have sex, and they were less likely to seek S.T.D. testing.","1817","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/planned-parenthood-means-fewer-abortions"

Obviously somewhat taken aback, Trump tried to downplay his sexist remarks as “fun, it’s kidding,” and then complained, peevishly, that Kelly hadn’t been nice to him.","1822","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

Given a record like that, Wallace asked, why should we trust you with the nation’s finances? Trump replied that these were just four deals out of hundreds he’d done, and that, like many businessmen, he had only been using the bankruptcy laws to his advantage. And he personally had never gone bankrupt, he added. He should have stopped there, but he didn’t. When Wallace followed up with a question about the last bankruptcy, of the Atlantic City-based Trump Entertainment Resorts, in 2009, which cost nearly a thousand jobs, he couldn’t resist another tribute to his capitalist acumen: “I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City before it cratered,” he said. “I made a lot of money in Atlantic City, and I’m proud of it.”","1823","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

"But, of course, the judges are ordinary Republican voters, many of whom share Trump’s disdain for the political class, including political journalists. (“They are a very dishonest lot, generally,” he said at one point.) In the recent past, Trump’s run-ins with the media have only helped him, and we’ll have to wait for some post-debate polls to see whether this happens again. Although on the defensive for much of the time, he didn’t back down, and he came across, as he always does, as a man apart from the rest of the field. That, of course, is the key to his popularity.","1825","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Perhaps the most bizarre moment was when Trump responded to yet another tough question, this one from Baier, about why, in the past, he had made financial contributions to Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton. Trump said that he had contributed to “everybody,” including several people on the stage, and explained that his donations were strictly transactional. “When they call, I give,” he said. “And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me.” His donations to the Clinton Foundation provided an example of how this worked, Trump went on. “Hillary Clinton: I said, ‘Be at my wedding,’ and she came to my wedding. She had no choice, because I gave to a foundation.”","1826","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

Walker took an early lead by bringing up Planned Parenthood and Hillary Clinton’s e-mail troubles. But Cruz, who never allows anyone to outflank him on the right, made up some ground late by suggesting that he had led the fight against Planned Parenthood, and pledging that, on his first day in the White House, he would “rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama.”","1828","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

Ben Carson, the neurosurgeon turned politician, spoke softly, rarely pausing to sully his presentation with actual policy details. “I’m the only one to separate Siamese twins,” he said in his closing statement. “The only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it.”","1829","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

Then again, Rubio almost always gets good reviews from the professionals. It is the Republican voters who have left him languishing, with about five-per-cent support in the opinion polls. Kasich, cheered by the crowd, appeared to be positioning himself as a more proletarian, Midwestern version of Bush. Most of his policy positions are solidly right-wing; his record is solidly right-wing. But he has one issue on which he’s broken ranks with his party—Medicaid.

"The Republican Convention is fifty-one weeks away, but, earlier this week, Politico published its first post-mortem of the campaign season. The subject was Senator Rand Paul, who last fall was hailed by Time as “The Most Interesting Man in Politics,” but now seems, in the estimation of Politico, to be the most interesting man who’s struggling to stay in the Republican primary. A recent CNN/ORC poll found him tied with Ted Cruz for fifth place in the field, with support from only six per cent of those polled, behind Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio. An NBC/Marist poll found him in sixth place in Iowa, and in ninth place in New Hampshire.","July 31, 2015","1841","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"Last fall, Rand Paul seemed like a less quirky—and therefore, perhaps, more electable—version of his father, the former Congressman Ron Paul, whose 2008 and 2012 campaigns for the Republican Presidential nomination were grand cultural phenomena. Ron Paul toured the country, telling Republican voters things you might think they wouldn’t want to hear. In the 2012 primary, he finished in second place, behind Mitt Romney, in New Hampshire, with 22.8 per cent of the vote. Four years later, one poll has Ron Paul’s less recalcitrant son at only four per cent. The Web site FiveThirtyEight points out that, nationwide, Rand Paul’s support is currently lower than his father’s was at this point in 2012.","1842","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"What went wrong? There is no shortage of explanations, partly because contemporary politics has no shortage of professional explainers. The Politico story claimed that Paul is “allergic” to buttering up big donors, and suggested that his campaign is chaotic. (It included a particularly vivid anecdote about a near-physical altercation between Paul’s campaign manager and a member of his security staff, who was described as a “a 280-pound retired New York police detective and Paul family loyalist.”) Paul himself told a reporter for the Boston Globe that one of the obstacles he faced was a crowded Republican field. “Obviously, everybody’s numbers come down when you divide it many different ways,” he said.","1843","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"None of this quite explains Paul’s collapse, especially considering that some polls from last summer put him in the lead. Writing in this magazine last year, Ryan Lizza traced Paul’s incomplete journey from an idea-driven libertarian—he once supported the legalization of all drugs, and argued that a free society should tolerate “unofficial, private discrimination”—to an elected politician more willing to consider the exigencies of party loyalty. After Mitt Romney lost to Obama in 2012, many voices in the Republican Party were calling for a change, and the official G.O.P. post-election report warned that “public perception of the Party is at record lows.” This seemed like an opening for a nonconformist such as Paul.","1844","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"In 2012, Paul opposed the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, a government corporation that loans money to foreign customers of U.S. companies. He said it was absurd for the government to borrow money from overseas while also loaning money to foreign companies, and he was one of twenty Senators who voted against its reauthorization. Since then, the anti-Ex-Im movement has grown, and what was once considered a fringe movement celebrated a triumph when the Bank’s charter expired on the last day of June this year. Then, this past Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved to revive the Bank, angering many of his fellow Republicans. Senator Ted Cruz, another Presidential candidate, accused McConnell of having told a “flat-out lie” by denying, at a lunch meeting, that he had a secret plan to revive the Ex-Im Bank. Cruz, canny as always, probably calculated that his blunt language would get him plenty of press, and he was right. (The effort to revive the bank seems to have failed.)","1845","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"Paul, by contrast, has forged a strategic relationship with McConnell, who also happens to be Kentucky’s other Senator, and his eagerness to argue against the Ex-Im Bank suddenly seemed to have cooled. Late on Friday afternoon, during a radio interview, Sean Hannity asked Paul about Cruz’s claims. “I wasn’t at that lunch,” Paul said, executing a rather inelegant pivot. “But what I can tell you is that there’s a disconnect—conservatives want to vote on defunding Planned Parenthood.” Paul often wants to talk about defunding Planned Parenthood, these days, and while primary voters surely agree with his position, it doesn’t much distinguish him from the rest of his Republican competitors. (Bush, Rubio, and Walker also support defunding.)","1846","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"So what makes Paul stand out? For a time, one of his signature issues was opposition to the National Security Agency’s bulk data-collection practices, but the issue grew muddier in June, with the passage of the USA Freedom Act, which ruled that data would be collected by telecommunications companies, instead of by the government; Paul considered this a very partial victory, and he delivered a long and equivocal speech expressing his mixed feelings. Paul’s interest in criminal-justice reform once marked him as an unorthodox Republican, but an increasing number of Republicans are now talking about changing the way we fight crime. On national security, Paul used to be skeptical about the need to confront regimes deemed hostile—last fall, he parted company with many Republicans by calling for “an effective diplomatic solution for limiting the Iranian enrichment program.” But when the Obama Administration announced its nuclear deal with Iran, Paul joined his Republican rivals in calling it “unacceptable.” Finally, Paul has failed to establish himself as the candidate of Silicon Valley, which is often described as a libertarian-friendly community. The Politico story explained how Paul has failed, so far, to cultivate fruitful relationships there. And when Hillary Clinton suggested we ask “hard questions” about the “gig economy” typified by companies such as Uber, Paul responded with acerbic tweets—only to be upstaged by Bush, a few days later, who used Uber to visit a start-up in San Francisco.","1847","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"Some of the people who should be most enthusiastic about Paul’s Presidential campaign have found themselves disheartened by it. Last week, Nick Gillespie, the editor-in-chief of the libertarian site reason.com, laid out the many un-libertarian things Paul has done and said. He called his campaign “doubly frustrating”—that is, neither principled nor successful. Maybe Paul would always have struggled to win over Republican primary voters. And maybe, during the gruelling months to come, he will rebound and, like a number of candidates in 2012, have a moment near the front of the pack.","1848","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"But whatever happens, potential supporters like Gillespie shouldn’t be so disappointed. Even as his campaign struggles, many of his issues are doing surprisingly well—in fact, that’s a big part of the reason why Paul has struggled to define himself. The formerly indomitable Ex-Im bank has been vanquished, though perhaps it will return in another form; the N.S.A. has been reformed, though lightly; a “diplomatic solution” seems imminent in Iran, though of course people disagree about its effectiveness; criminal-justice reform has bipartisan momentum, though it may yet meet with resistance; politicians wishing to hamper companies like Uber are meeting stiff resistance, though they will keep trying. These are all tentative, partial, and temporary victories—but then, politics rarely offers any other kind. Rand Paul is struggling in the polls, but Paulism looks pretty healthy. That’s not good news for the Presidential candidate, but it’s also not such bad news for the guy who may still be, come 2017, a Senator from Kentucky.","1849","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"

Nobody should underestimate Trump’s ability to manipulate the media, or his willingness to do or say anything to further his goals and draw attention to himself. In racing to the head of the G.O.P. polls, he has displayed these talents to the fullest. Underneath it all, though, he’s the same carnival barker that New Yorkers have had to put up with for decades: an aptly named tub of hot air, whose noisy and odiferous utterances rarely withstand serious scrutiny.

The name Trump denotes ostentatiousness: overselling the product is almost part of the appeal. And, in any case, with most of Trump’s ventures he is just the front man: others do the actual work of satisfying the customers.","1853","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"A Presidential candidacy is different. After the first burst of publicity, it turns into a fraught, extended exercise in withstanding attacks and critical examinations. This has never been Trump’s forte. When challenged in the past, he has often resorted to sliming his critics or stomping off. In his off-color comments about Rick Perry and John McCain, we have already seen the first of these tactics being repeated. As the level of media scrutiny increases, we could well see him look for cover.","1854","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"The Daily Beast story was the latest indication of what lies ahead. For weeks after Trump entered the race, cable networks treated him as a novelty candidate (and a ratings boost from the gods), according him practically unlimited airtime to say whatever he wanted. Now, finally, some broadcast journalists are starting to ask Trump awkward questions. This weekend, for example, CNN’s Jake Tapper pressed him on how he would deal with illegal immigrants—an issue he has placed front and center in his campaign.","1855","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"As Rob Garver, of the Fiscal Times, pointed out in a brutal post, Trump’s responses amounted to “a sort of immigration-related word salad.” “We have some really bad dudes right here in this country and we’re getting them out. We’re sending them back where they came from,” Trump said, then went on, “The bad ones are going to get out. Then, from that point on, we’re going to look very, very strongly at what we do. And I’m going to formulate a plan that I think people are going to be happy with.”","1856","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"Tapper tried repeatedly to elicit some details, pressing Trump, for instance, on the millions of undocumented immigrants without criminal records who would remain. All he got back was verbiage. “We’re going to see what we’re going to see,” Trump said. He added, “We’re going to take the high ground: we’re going to do what’s right. Some are going to have to go, and some—hey, we’re just going to see what happens. It’s a very, very big subject, and a very complicated subject.”","1857","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"So it is, and that’s one reason why Trump’s rivals for the Republican nomination have struggled to compete with his inflammatory statements. Even in today’s G.O.P., though, rabble-rousing takes you only so far. As time goes on, he will face more questions about his evasions and exaggerations, and the vacuity of his rhetoric will be increasingly difficult to ignore.","1858","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"To take another example, we have Trump’s claim, two weeks ago, that he is worth more than ten billion dollars. In my experience dealing with his more outlandish estimates of his own wealth, a useful, if not entirely reliable, rule of thumb is to move the decimal point one place to the left. That would place his net worth at about a billion dollars, which is actually pretty close to the $1.15 billion figure cited as his minimum net worth in an analysis, by Tim Mullaney of CNBC, of a financial-disclosure form released by the Federal Election Commission last week. (Because most of Trump’s companies are private, any net-worth figure is only an estimate. Forbes reckons he is worth about four billion dollars; Bloomberg says around three billion.)","1859","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"CNBC also questioned the valuation of Trump’s golf businesses at between five hundred and fifty million dollars and more than six hundred seventy-five million dollars. When Mullaney took a closer look, he found that Trump was valuing his golf courses, some of which are well known, at somewhere between two and four times the revenue they generate, whereas most people in the golf industry use a multiplier of one to one and a half times a course’s revenue. “Stacking it up against the universe of other golf-course sales, he is kind of off the charts,” Buddie Johnson, an Arizona-based course developer who wrote a book about valuing golf courses, told Mullaney. “Anyone can say anything. … Such is his verbosity that, when he talks about the valuation of his golf clubs, he talks louder than anyone else, and he thinks that makes it true.”","1860","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"Mullaney’s story didn’t garner a great deal of attention, but it displayed the sort of scrutiny that Trump hates. Back in 2005, Timothy L. O’Brien, a former Times reporter who is now the publisher of Bloomberg View, wrote a book about Trump in which he cited reports estimating his net worth at well under a billion dollars. Months later, Trump sued O’Brien—for five billion dollars. (The case was dismissed. Last week, O’Brien recalled the episode in a column entitled “Dear Mr. Trump: I’m Worth $10 Billion, Too.”)","1861","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"At some point, Trump will have a choice to make. Does he try to shake off the media intrusions, hire some credible policy advisers, and put together some semi-serious proposals, backed up by actual facts? There’s been speculation that he could even run in the general election as an independent or third-party candidate, as George Wallace did, in 1968; as John Anderson did, in 1980; and as Ross Perot did, in 1992 and 1996. But does Trump have the conviction of a Wallace, the bravery of an Anderson (who broke with Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan), or the rigor of a Perot? Merely to pose the question is to answer it.","1862","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"

"Almost immediately from its founding, in 1909, the charity-benefit game pitting Republicans against Democrats in America’s national pastime was an event of great pageantry. In a 1926 pre-game parade, the Army and Navy bands marched behind a donkey and an elephant; in 1933, the comedian Al Jolson served as guest umpire. Commanders-in-Chief started gracing the stands in 1917, when Woodrow Wilson witnessed the Democrats pull out a 22-21 squeaker. In 1953, Joe DiMaggio and Lefty Grove were Dwight Eisenhower’s guests at the game, by then being played annually at the Senators’ Griffith Stadium.","1867","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat"
"But this golden era of congressional baseball didn’t last. In 1958, House Speaker Sam Rayburn called an end to the game out of concern for injury. When it was revived in the sixties, the event was a shell of its former self: a few-inning appetizer to a Senators game. Some familiar names had some notable moments during this period: Michigan congressman Gerald Ford slugged the first known grand slam in the game’s history; former Yale baseball captain George H. W. Bush played four years at first base for the G.O.P. and hit a home run of his own. But no sitting Presidents returned to the much-diminished game. After the Senators left D.C., in 1971, the tradition downsized to a new home in suburban Virginia: an austere field with only a cage behind home plate, a chain-link fence in the outfield, and a set of bleachers along the third-base line. There the game stayed for decades, drawing only a few hundred fans a year and raising just a handful for charity.","1868","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat"
"In the nineties, due to a wave of expansion and whispers of relocation, Major League Baseball took notice of the congressional contest. The game moved to the home of the minor-league Bowie Baysox, in Maryland, and started receiving logistical and philanthropic support from M.L.B. Attendance and revenue spiked. When M.L.B. returned to the capital city, in 2005, so did the Congressional Baseball Game.

Her co-worker Katelyn Phillips quipped, “Eric Cantor’s pollster is predicting a G.O.P. win.” On the other side of the stadium, “Rand Slam” and “Take Me Out to the Paul Game” banners were raised by a crowd of at least twenty Rand Paul staffers.","1870","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat"

It’s rare for a senator to play at all—the House fills most of the rosters—let alone one as high profile as Paul.","1871","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat"
"Presidential hopefuls from Eugene McCarthy to Barry Goldwater had played in the game before, but never while running. Two of Paul’s potential 2016 rivals, Rick Santorum and Ohio governor John Kasich, are also Congressional Baseball alumni. Paul made his run for President official on April 7th, seemingly endangering his games-played streak. But, a few weeks later, he announced that he would play in the Congressional Baseball Game after all, becoming the first active Presidential candidate ever to do so. “I need something to keep me sane,” Paul explained, as the press mobbed the G.O.P. dugout to speak to him on game day.","1872","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat"
"Paul’s dedication to the game makes sense when you learn that his father, the former Texas representative Ron Paul, is a member of the Congressional Baseball Hall of Fame. In seven career games (all preceding his own three Presidential runs), the elder Paul hit .294, with six runs scored and six R.B.I.—including the first over-the-fence home run in the game’s history. As a high-school and college student, Rand Paul, who grew up an avid Pittsburgh Pirates fan and baseball-card collector, would accompany his father to Republican team practices.","1873","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat"
"Rand was a faithful attendee of this year’s practices, even as his own personal spring-training schedule took him to Iowa and New Hampshire. He didn’t miss a single 7 A.M. scrimmage until the morning of May 21st, after he concluded a ten-and-a-half-hour filibuster of the Patriot Act. A “liberty Republican” in the mold of his father, Paul has built his reputation on slashing government involvement in all aspects of life, from Wall Street to guns to health care. (The one regulation he supports, he jokes, is a rule that forbids Democratic ace Cedric Richmond, the representative from Louisiana with an eighty-mile-per-hour fastball, from pitching more than two innings per game.) On national security, these positions put him at odds with the more hawkish members of his own party. His recent crusade against the N.S.A.’s surveillance program was a hit with his libertarian base, but it alienated him within the Republican caucus. Asked if his contrarian ways have ever created friction with his teammates, Paul shrugged it off. “Everybody razzes each other; you just have to not take yourself too seriously.” (Fans joined in the razzing too: another Swalwell staffer’s sign read, “Rand Paul Can’t Delay This Game for 10 Hours.”)","1874","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat"
"It only took an hour for the game to reach the top of the fourth and Paul’s second at-bat. By the time the Nationals mascots George, Tom, Abe, Teddy, and Bill dashed around the warning track for the traditional Presidents’ race, everyone’s attention was on another President working the crowd. Barack Obama, often maligned for his distaste for congressional schmoozing, had become the first President in decades to attend one of the top schmoozing events on the congressional calendar.

Four more years!” On the right side, Republican partisans reminded the players of the political calculation behind the President’s visit: “Tee-Pee-Ay! Tee-Pee-Ay!,” or Trade Promotion Authority. The next day, the House of Representatives was to hold a hotly contested vote to approve T.P.A. (better known as “fast track” negotiating authority), the rare Obama Administration priority supported by more congressional Republicans than Democrats. To lubricate the voting process, perhaps, Obama brought a gift: twenty-four bottles of home-brewed beer for the victors of the game.","1876","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat"

"On Monday night, the brief, frantic skirmish between Donald J. Trump and other forces in the Republican Party seemed to have stalled. The weekend had started so well for those in the G.O.P. who thought that their cohorts’ Trump fever might break; on Friday evening, he had besmirched Megyn Kelly, of Fox News—their own Megyn Kelly—in terms that seemed disqualifying. Trump appeared, in short, to have said that a woman they admired was having her period when she was asking hard questions as the moderator of the G.O.P. candidates’ first debate. And who, even among those who took pleasure in Trump’s disparagement of Mexicans (and other immigrants), John McCain (and other prisoners of war), and Rosie O’Donnell (and women generally), wanted to think about something like that? And yet, two days later, it was Trump who, catching his breath from calling his critics “deviants” and “sick,” was tweeting that Kelly’s boss, Roger Ailes, had called him to negotiate a peace. “He is a great guy & assures me that ‘Trump’ will be treated fairly on @FoxNews. His word is always good!”","August 11, 2015","1880","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"A few hours later, Ailes put out a statement confirming the accord, and Kelly, of whom Trump had also said, “She’s zippo … I have no respect for her,” told Fox viewers that it was “time to move forward.” By then, Reuters/Ipsos had released a new, post-debate poll; it found Trump still, somehow, in the lead among Republicans, with twenty-four per cent. Jeb Bush came in second, with twelve per cent. It was a small poll, with a margin of error of more than six per cent, but it was another indication that the debate and the Donald, rather than helping to narrow the field, have left it even more wide open than it was before. And Trump is still crashing through it.","1881","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"Why did the other Republicans think that Trump would crumple in shame? He never has before. It is a measure of the 2016 Presidential race that the strongest point Trump raised in his defense over the weekend—he called into the Sunday news shows on every major channel except Fox—was that, a minute or two after crudely insulting Kelly in a CNN interview (“And you know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her—wherever”), he had crudely insulted her colleague Chris Wallace in similar terms (“You know, blood pouring out of his eyes, too”). By “wherever,” he told George Stephanopoulos, on ABC, “I was referring to nose, ears. They’re very common statements. And only a deviant would think of what people said.” He hadn’t specified those parts, he said, because he just wanted to move on and talk about important things, like “jobs.” In fact, he moved on to talk about how Chris Wallace, in his view, compared to his father, Mike, the longtime CBS correspondent. “The great Mike Wallace was a friend of mine. In fact, he interviewed me on ‘60 Minutes.’ It was a phenomenal ‘60 Minutes’ .… And the son is only a tiny fraction of Mike, believe me.” The lady is a lightweight; the loser never lived up to his dad. These are stock characters in Trumpland, where one can also bump into the occasional Killer or Great Guy.","1882","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"There are, after all, a few problems with Trump’s argument that he was just, in the Wall Street Journal’s memorable phrase, using “facial hemorrhages as a metaphor for anger.” One can begin with the obvious: more of Kelly’s body was implicated than was Wallace’s, and Trump has a long history of slurs aimed at women’s anatomy, which was what Kelly was asking him about. But stranger still is the idea that there was any anger to describe, literally or metaphorically. “Look, she asked me a very nasty question. I have nothing against Megyn Kelly, but she asked me a very, very nasty question,” Trump said. She was “very inappropriate,” and “very angry.” And yet, in the video, she is calm, and never stops smiling. She did not, it is true, surrender or laugh appreciatively when he interrupted her to make a joke about how he thought another woman was ugly. Is that what an angry woman looks like from the Republican debate stage?","1883","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"If Trump is betrayed by the “wherever,” the Republican Party is undermined by its capacity to look at every manner of assault on women and say, in effect, “Whatever.” There is a muddle in the matter of the Party’s message on Trump and Kelly. For one thing, the Republican men rushing to Kelly’s defense do not look much like beacons. Erick Erickson, the conservative activist, said that he was so appalled that he was disinviting Trump from his RedState Gathering conference. Erickson is the man who called Wendy Davis, the Texas legislator, “Abortion Barbie,” and, writing about Michelle Obama, speculated about whether “Obama’s Marxist harpy wife would go Lorena Bobbitt on him.” Kelly once chastised Erickson on Fox for saying that wives contributing more to the family income than their husbands was unnatural and bad for children. (As I’ve written before, Kelly is a smart woman who, occasionally, stops pretending that the men around her at Fox are making any sense at all.) At the RedState conference, Jeb Bush congratulated Erickson on his gentlemanliness in disinviting Trump, saying, “I tell you what, you’re on the side of women.” Bush, who had turned to the topic when Erikson mentioned his wife, continued, “Come on! Give me a break. I mean, do we want to win? Do we want to insult fifty-three per cent of all voters? What Donald Trump said is wrong.”","1884","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"The problem is that Bush and the other Republicans are not clear in their own minds about why Trump is wrong. Last week, Bush said, “I’m not sure we need half a billion dollars for women’s health issues” (he later said that he “misspoke”)—a quote Trump brought up on the Sunday shows, when talking about how he would be “phenomenal to the women” who were, themselves, phenomenal. There is plenty of menstruation-free misogyny at play, starting with the assumption that women are an alien group “we” have to be careful not to offend. The hope among Republicans is that they will never have to say whether their politely unspoken assumptions are the same as Trump’s loudly stated one—that, having roused the base, Trump is so crass that he will flame out. Jeb Bush seems particularly vulnerable to this presumption. But this does not seem to be a political moment in which tackiness alone is going to get someone off the debate stage. The greatest fear, within the G.O.P., seems to be that Trump will force them to look rude. And it has left them paralyzed.","1885","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"It was a classic Trump move to ask, with outrage and wounded innocence, why anyone would think that mentioning blood and a woman’s anger in the same sentence would have a certain implication. (It’s actually a decent question, as disingenuous as Trump was to pose it.) His G.O.P. opponents thought that the answer was too obvious and unpleasant to talk about. The offense for them was the application of a stereotype to Kelly. They weren’t about to engage with or challenge any stereotypes about women themselves.","1886","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"When the other G.O.P. candidates challenge Trump, it tends to be by arguing that he is not a real Republican—he was once pro-choice, and he has given money to Democrats. On the first point, the G.O.P. risks alienating women voters when candidates, like Marco Rubio, rush to stake out ever more extreme positions on restricting reproductive rights, a point that Hillary Clinton seized upon on Monday. On the issue of political donations, Trump’s comment, in the debate, that he gives money to all sorts of candidates to buy access and to get them to do what he wants, has been a hard one for his opponents. They seem to find talking about their donors almost as mortifying as talking about Megyn Kelly’s body. At the debate, Trump had said that Clinton had to go to his wedding because he’s donated to her family’s foundation. Clinton said that she’d gone because she “thought it was going to be fun.” Did the G.O.P. think that a Trump candidacy would be fun, too?","1887","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"

"Donald Trump’s campaign slogan is “Make America Great Again!” A better one might be “Only in America.” You could not ask for a better illustration of the complexity of ordinary Americans’ attitudes toward class, wealth, and social identity than the fact that a billionaire’s popularity among working-class voters has given him the lead in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination. In a recent Washington Post/ABC poll, Trump was the candidate of choice of a full third of white Republicans with no college education. Working-class voters face stagnant wages and diminished job prospects, and a 2014 poll found that seventy-four per cent of them think “the U.S. economic system generally favors the wealthy.” Why on earth would they support a billionaire?","1889","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"
"Part of the answer is Trump’s nativist and populist rhetoric. But his wealth is giving him a boost, too. The Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg, who’s published reams of work on white working-class attitudes, told me, “There is no bigger problem for these voters than the corruption of the political system. They think big companies are buying influence, while average people are blocked out.” Trump’s riches allow him to portray himself as someone who can’t be bought, and his competitors as slaves to their donors. (Ross Perot pioneered this tactic during the 1992 campaign.) “I don’t give a shit about lobbyists,” Trump proclaimed at an event in May. And his willingness to talk about issues that other candidates are shying away from, like immigration and trade, reinforces the message that money makes him free.","1890","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"
"Trump has also succeeded in presenting himself as a self-made man, who has flourished thanks to deal-making savvy. In fact, Trump was born into money, and his first great real-estate success—the transformation of New York’s Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt—was enabled by a tax abatement worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Yet many voters see Trump as someone who embodies the American dream of making your own fortune. And that dream remains surprisingly potent: in a 2011 Pew survey, hard work and personal drive (not luck or family connections) were the factors respondents cited most frequently to explain why people got ahead. Even Trump’s unabashed revelling in his wealth works to his benefit, since it makes him seem like an ordinary guy who can’t get over how cool it is to be rich.","1891","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"
"For someone who talks a lot about winning, Trump has a résumé dotted with more than a few losses. On four occasions, companies he’s been involved with have gone bankrupt. Yet these failures haven’t dented his reputation at all, contributing instead to a sense that he’s had to deal with adversity. In other countries, such failures would make it very hard for him to campaign as a visionary businessman. But the U.S. has always been exceptionally tolerant, in terms of both attitude and the law, toward business failure and bankruptcy. Indeed, Trump brags about how he used the bankruptcy code to get better deals for his companies; as he put it not long ago, “I’ve used the laws of the country to my advantage.”","1892","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"
"Trump is hardly the first Western plutocrat to venture into politics. Think of William Randolph Hearst or, more recently, Silvio Berlusconi. But both Hearst and Berlusconi benefitted from controlling media empires. Trump has earned publicity all on his own, by playing the role of that quintessential American figure the huckster. As others have observed, the businessman he most resembles is P. T. Barnum, whose success rested on what he called “humbug,” defined as “putting on glittering appearances . . . by which to suddenly arrest public attention, and attract the public eye and ear.” Barnum’s key insight into how to arrest public attention was that, to some degree, Americans enjoy brazen exaggeration. No American businessman since Barnum has been a better master of humbug than Trump has.","1893","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"
"Take the debate over how much Trump is worth. It’s impossible to get a definitive accounting of his wealth, since almost all of it is in assets—mainly real estate—that don’t have clear market values. Still, he’s clearly enormously rich. Bloomberg estimates his wealth at $2.9 billion, while Forbes pegs it at $4.1 billion—both tidy sums. But Trump will have none of that: thanks to the value of his brand, he says, he’s worth at least a cool ten billion. This number seems so absurdly over the top as to be self-defeating. But there is a kind of genius in the absurdity. Trump understands that only an outrageous number can really “attract the public eye and ear.”","1894","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"
"Trump’s lack of interest in policy and his inflammatory rhetoric make it easy to dismiss him as a serious candidate, and it’s highly improbable that he could ultimately win the nomination. But his bizarre blend of populist message and glitzy ways has allowed him to connect with precisely the voters that any Republican candidate needs in order to get elected (including many whom Romney couldn’t reach). As Greenberg says, as long as he’s in the race, “Trump is a huge problem for the Party. He’s appealing to a very important part of the base, and bringing out the issues the other candidates don’t want to be talking about.” Republicans may be praying that his campaign is just a joke, but right now Trump is the only one laughing. ♦","1895","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"

"On Thursday, some of Hillary Clinton’s top campaign officials held a briefing for about three dozen members of the 2016 hack pack. Their message was a positive one. “The view inside the campaign is that voters are concerned about kitchen-table issues Clinton wants to talk about, rather than media reports and Republican attacks on the [Clinton] foundation, the officials said,” Vox’s Jonathan Allen reported. “There’s no conflict between her promise to represent ‘everyday Americans’ and the access big donors have had to Clinton and her husband over the years, they said, arguing that voters will trust her to represent them in the White House.”","May 29, 2015","1906","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"That was partly spin, of course. There is no end in sight to the stories about the finances of the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton e-mails, or the activities of some of the Clintons’ associates. But as spring rolls into summer, Team Brooklyn has successfully accomplished its two initial goals: heading off the possibility of a serious challenge for the Democratic nomination and surviving a barrage of negative publicity that was inevitable at some stage, and which was, therefore, best confronted early on.","1907","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"The entry into the Democratic contest by Bernie Sanders was welcome from a Clintonite perspective, because it filled a potentially dangerous vacuum. With his long record of service to progressive causes, Sanders is popular enough to garner a decent-sized following among liberal Democrats, but he’s almost certainly too far to the left to represent a serious threat to Hillary. So far, at least, his presence has been more of a problem for Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who is set to officially announce his candidacy on Saturday. As I noted back in March, O’Malley is a serious figure who demands some respect. As governor, he eliminated the death penalty, legalized gay marriage, and championed various good-government initiatives. But with Sanders already out there on the stump, O’Malley has struggled to gain traction.","1908","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"A new poll of likely Democratic voters conducted by Quinnipiac University illustrates the scale of the task that is facing Clinton’s challengers. The survey, which was carried out from May 19th to May 26th, showed her getting fifty-seven per cent of the vote. Sanders was in second place, with fifteen per cent. O’Malley got just one per cent, and so did two other possible candidates, Jim Webb, a former U.S. senator from Virginia, and Lincoln Chafee, a former governor and U.S. senator from Rhode Island. Of course, it is early in the process, and anything could happen between now and the end of the primaries. At this stage, though, Clinton is sitting pretty.","1909","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"Something similar, if somewhat less definitive, could be said of her position vis-à-vis her potential Republican opponents. Opinion polls positing head-to-head matchups with likely G.O.P. candidates have consistently shown Clinton winning, and the Quinnipiac survey was no exception. It showed her with double-digit leads over Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, two of the Republican front-runners. Interestingly, the closest hypothetical contests were with Rand Paul, the libertarian senator from Kentucky, and Florida senator Marco Rubio, whom some in the Clinton camp have reportedly identified as her biggest potential threat. Clinton’s leads over both Paul and Rubio were four points.","1910","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"The Quinnipiac poll also contained some valuable clues as to how Clinton has been able, so far, to navigate all of the negative media coverage she has received while sustaining relatively little damage to her overall polling numbers. In terms of the level of personal trust that voters have in Clinton, the drip-drip-drip of stories does seem to be having an effect. Fifty-three per cent of respondents to the Quinnipiac survey said that they do not consider her to be “honest and trustworthy,” while only thirty-nine per cent said that they did. Among self-identified Independents, the numbers were even more lopsided: sixty-one per cent to thirty-one per cent.","1911","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"The number of people who question Clinton’s trustworthiness must be of concern to her team, and it’s a figure that Republican ad-makers and opposition-research shops will be seeking to increase. But this issue needs to be weighed against the fact that Presidential elections are about leadership—and most Americans think of Clinton as an experienced and strong leader. One of the survey questions asked, “Would you say that Hillary Clinton has strong leadership qualities or not?” Sixty per cent of respondents said yes, and thirty-seven per cent said no. Among Independents, fifty-eight per cent answered yes, and thirty-eight per cent said no.","1912","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"These findings suggest that voters are more sophisticated than they are sometimes given credit for. Rather than looking at politicians in black-and-white terms, they are able to size up candidates’ strengths and weaknesses, and to reach an over-all view based on what they are looking for in a leader. At a time when the world seems like an increasingly dangerous place and a majority of Americans believe that the country is on the wrong track, perceived strength and decisiveness may well count for a great deal. “Can you get low marks on honesty and still be a strong leader?” said Tim Malloy, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll, in a news release. “Sure you can.

Monday’s other poll, from Fox News, produced very similar numbers. It also showed Trump with twenty-six per cent of the vote; Bush had fifteen per cent, and Walker had nine per cent. The two polls released on Tuesday were in the same vein. A CBS News survey showed Trump with twenty-four per cent, Bush with thirteen per cent, and Walker with ten per cent.

"These numbers raise the question of just how enduring Trump’s support will be. Last week, I suggested that the vacuity of his message would ultimately catch up with him, a position that I am sticking with.

"I’ll start with the new Monmouth University poll numbers, which suggest that Trump is drawing support from across the Republican spectrum. While some of his pitch, such as his comments critical of Mexican immigrants, appears designed to curry favor with Tea Party supporters and other right-wing ultras, he’s also saying something, or doing something, that appeals to Republicans who don’t think of themselves as staunch conservatives.","1919","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Among Republicans who self-identify as “very conservative,” he’s leading his closest challenger, Walker, by twenty-seven per cent to sixteen per cent—an eleven-point gap. Among “somewhat conservative” G.O.P. supporters, he is leading Bush by twenty-two per cent to fourteen per cent—an eight-per-cent gap. And, among “moderate to liberal” Republicans, he is ahead of Bush by twenty-eight per cent to twenty per cent—also, an eight-per-cent lead.","1920","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Trump’s appeal also extends across most major demographic groups, the Monmouth poll found. Among Republican voters aged fifty and up, he is leading Bush by eleven percentage points and Walker by fourteen points. Among G.O.P. voters under fifty, his lead is even bigger: sixteen percentage points over Bush and seventeen points over Walker. As might have been expected, he has a big lead among Republican men: about twenty percentage points. But he’s also picking up considerable support among Republican women: twenty per cent said that they supported him, compared to twelve per cent for Walker and eleven per cent for Bush.","1921","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Numbers like these make it difficult to pigeonhole Trump as the right-wing protest candidate, or as the tribune of any particular group. “Republican support for Donald Trump just continues to grow with no clear sense of who his constituency really is,” Patrick Murray, who directs the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement accompanying the release of the poll results. “This makes it very difficult for his opponents to figure out how to take him on in the upcoming debate.”","1922","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Obviously, that is good news for Trump, but the polling data also contain some less encouraging signs for him. According to the latest survey from Quinnipiac University’s polling unit, which came out late last week, fifty per cent of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Trump, and thirty-three per cent have a negative opinion. If you subtract the latter figure from the former one, you get get a “net positive” rating of seventeen per cent. Far from placing Trump at the front of the G.O.P. field, this figure suggests that he is in thirteenth place, sandwiched between John Kasich and Chris Christie.","1923","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"According to this metric, Marco Rubio is leading the G.O.P. race, with a net positive rating of sixty-one per cent. Walker is in second place, with fifty-five per cent, and Bush is in third place, with fifty per cent. Of course, if Trump performs well in the debates and avoids any major slip-ups, his numbers could improve. But the reason that political professionals monitor this figure closely is that it often indicates the amount of upward (and downward) potential a candidate has. Once negative impressions get entrenched, they are tough to shift, and, relative to most of the other candidates, Trump already has fairly high negative ratings among Republican voters. (Among the electorate as a whole, his negatives are much higher—the highest of any candidate in either party—but that’s not the point here.)","1924","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"As the campaign unfolds and scrutiny of Trump increases, historic precedent suggests that his negative ratings will rise further. That doesn’t mean that he can’t win the nomination or put up a strong showing. It does suggest that it might be worth recalling the fate of previous candidates who have surged to the front of the G.O.P. field in the summer before election year.","1925","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"In early August of 2007, Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who is a friend of Trump, was leading in some of the G.O.P. polls, and one of his closest competitors was Fred Thompson, a former Republican senator from Tennessee, who hadn’t yet officially announced his candidacy. For example, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey of likely Republican voters showed Giuliani at the top, with thirty-three per cent, and Thompson in second place, with nineteen per cent. John McCain, who went on to win the primary, was in third place, with seventeen per cent. The prominent showings of Giuliani and Thompson both proved ephemeral. By January, 2008, when the primaries began, both had seen their poll ratings fall back. McCain and Mike Huckabee emerged as the leading candidates.","1926","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"The 2012 G.O.P. primary also involved a lot of twists and turns. In July of 2011, a survey by the research firm Public Policy Polling showed Michele Bachmann, the conservative congresswoman from Minnesota, narrowly leading Mitt Romney, the favorite. In August, Bachmann went on to win the Ames Straw Poll, in Iowa, with 28.6 per cent of the vote, and Newsweek featured her on its cover. After that, Bachmann fell back steadily.","1927","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"In August of 2011, Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, surged to the front of the field. In mid-September, he reached a peak of 31.7 per cent in the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, before falling back sharply. Shortly after that, Herman Cain, a businessman and syndicated columnist, replaced Perry as the front-runner. At the start of November, Cain, who was wielding a tax-cutting economic program he called his “9-9-9 plan,” hit twenty-five per cent in the R.C.P. poll average: some individual polls showed him with even more support. By the end of the year, he was back in single figures.","1928","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Trump’s candidacy is sui generis. It shouldn’t necessarily be compared with any of its predecessors, each of which succumbed in a slightly different way. Giuliani and Cain were both hit by allegations of marital infidelity. Perry embarrassed himself in a televised debate. Thompson and Bachmann both committed a series of lesser blunders, which eventually took their toll. Trump, conceivably, could avoid these sorts of errors—although his latest statement, that he’d be willing to shut down the federal government to deprive Planned Parenthood of funding, suggests that he’ll continue to be embroiled in controversy. But my point here is a broader one about the G.O.P. primary electorate. History shows that it’s a volatile and disgruntled beast, which often responds well to candidates it perceives as outsiders. Often, however, the romance doesn’t last. Trump is the latest glamorous newcomer to have tickled the fancy of Republicans. By swallowing up the attention of the media, he’s already done a good deal of damage to other candidates, especially the mid-ranking ones, such as Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, who are now starved of attention. But, until we see how Trump responds to the scrutiny that comes with being the front-runner, and how he performs in the debates, it would be premature to read too much into his current position. In Republican primaries these days, early leads don’t count for much.","1929","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"

"As the British Prime Minister David Cameron puts together his new government, the opposition Labour Party’s inquest into last Thursday’s election result is getting going. Following the resignation of its leader, Ed Miliband, there is already a concerted effort to drag the Party back to the political center. Speaking over the weekend, Lord Mandelson, one of the architects of Tony Blair’s centrist “New Labour” project, back in the nineteen-nineties, said of the election, “The reason we lost it, and lost it so badly, was because, in 2010, we discarded New Labour rather than revitalizing it and reënergizing it and making it relevant for new times that we faced.” On Monday, David Miliband, the former Labour foreign secretary who lost the 2010 leadership election to his brother, weighed in from New York, where he now heads the International Rescue Committee, saying, “I think that the voters have delivered a very clear verdict. And unless Labour is able to embrace a politics of aspiration and inclusion, a politics that defies some of the traditional labels that have dogged politics for so long, then it’s not going to win.”","May 12, 2015","1944","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"

"This debate is sure to intensify in Britain as Labour chooses a new leader. But what are the lessons of the election for the upcoming Presidential contest in this country? Historically, British and American politics have often moved roughly in sync—one thinks of the Reagan-Thatcher years—and even today there are strong links between the major parties on both sides of the Atlantic. During the election campaign, David Axelrod, President Obama’s longtime strategist, worked for Labour, and Jim Messina, Obama’s campaign manager in 2012, worked for the Conservatives. (Yes, many Democratic eyebrows were raised at Messina’s decision to cross the aisle.) In addition, some of the internal party dynamics that drive the major British parties have counterparts here. In the Democratic Party, as in the Labour Party, liberal-leaning progressives are perennially seeking to shift the Party to the left, and running up against opposition from centrists. Meanwhile, the Republicans, like the Conservatives, are struggling to come to terms with the issue of immigration.","1946","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"Inside Hillary Clinton’s campaign, there will doubtless be people echoing the Blairites’ argument that Labour’s heavy defeat demonstrates the dangers of straying too far to the left. And to some extent, at least, these people have a point. The Labour platform, which included a vow to raise the top income-tax rate and introduce a new property tax on multimillion-dollar homes, went over well in some areas, particularly the big cities, which are home to lots of liberal, college-educated residents, as well as many immigrants. In Greater London, for example, Labour increased its number of seats from thirty-eight to forty-five. But, in the suburbs and small-town England, the party’s progressive message fell flat, allowing the Conservatives to win an over-all majority in the House of Commons.","1947","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"Despite this failure, it would be a misleading oversimplification to say that Labour lost because the voters rejected its redistributive tax plans, which actually polled well individually, as did many of its other progressive proposals, including raising the minimum wage, reducing college fees, and guaranteeing twenty-five hours of free day care each week to families with young children. Miliband got his biggest bump in the polls after he promised to close a tax loophole that allowed some rich British residents to pay no tax on their overseas earnings. And his claim that the Tories weren’t adequately funding the National Health Service prompted the Conservatives to come up with extra money for the socialized system.","1948","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"It would also be an error to interpret the election result as an unqualified endorsement of the Conservatives’ austerity policies, which largely defined their first term of office under Cameron. Although the Tories slightly increased their share of the vote compared to the 2010 election—from 36.1 per cent to 36.9 per cent—the Liberal Democrats, whose participation in a coalition government had enabled the Conservatives to carry out their economic plan, suffered an unprecedented drubbing: their vote share fell from 23.1 per cent, in 2010, to just 7.9 per cent. As Matthew Yglesias pointed out in a post at Vox, the “total vote count of the austerity coalition … collapsed.”","1949","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"Labour’s problem was that, while it managed to increase its vote share slightly compared to 2010—from 28.9 per cent to 30.4 per cent—it didn’t pick up enough of the non-Tory vote. In Scotland, it was decimated by the Scottish National Party; in England, it lost a significant number of votes to the anti-immigrant U.K. Independence Party. Among those defeated was Douglas Alexander, Labour’s chief foreign-affairs spokesman, who lost his seat in Paisley and Renfrewshire South, near Glasgow, to a twenty-year-old college student representing the S.N.P., and Ed Balls, Labour’s chief economic spokesman, who lost his seat in Morley & Outwood, a suburb of my home town of Leeds, to the Conservatives largely because a UKIP candidate took about an eighth of the vote.","1950","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"The fate of Alexander and Balls, two experienced and moderate Labour politicians, demonstrates why it is dangerous, from an American perspective, to read too much into what happened to Labour. The Democrats have their challenges, to be sure. But getting squeezed simultaneously by a left-wing nationalist party and a right-wing nationalist party isn’t a danger that Hillary Clinton, or whoever else emerges as the Democratic candidate, will face. Indeed, because of the rapidly growing Hispanic vote in many areas, the issue of immigration, which was central to UKIP’s appeal, represents a big danger to the G.O.P. If the Republican candidate can’t find a way to neutralize this potential problem, he or she may well struggle to win key states like Colorado, Florida, and Nevada.","1951","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"And that’s not the only difference between the United States and Britain. Another huge one is that the Democrats are the incumbent party, which means that they, like the Conservatives in Britain, stand to benefit from the recent improvement in the economy. As I’ve pointed out numerous times before, the performance of the British economy has been disappointing. Compared to previous recoveries, G.D.P. growth has been weak, and the average person’s living standard is still below the level it reached in 2008. During the past couple of years, however, things have improved somewhat: the U.K.’s G.D.P. has grown faster than that of any other economy in Europe, and employment growth has been strong. This upturn allowed the Conservatives to argue that things were getting better, and that, after all the sacrifices the country had made, it wasn’t worth taking a risk on Labour—a party many voters, rightly or wrongly, associated with overspending and large budget deficits. Focus groups and opinion polls confirm that the Tory message about the economy got through.","1952","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"The U.S. economy, like its British counterpart, has enjoyed a modest recovery in terms of G.D.P., with strong job growth. Many Americans still tell pollsters they don’t see much sign of the rebound in their own lives, but this was also true in Britain: the lack of a “feel-good factor” was one of the reasons that many commentators thought Labour stood a good chance of winning. In the end, though, the voters rewarded the Conservative Party for its stewardship of the economy. If the U.S. economic recovery continues into next year, which most economists expect to happen, the Democrats should reap at least some electoral reward.","1953","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"None of this means that Labour didn’t make any mistakes, or that the Democrats can’t learn from some of them. Ed Miliband’s struggles since he defeated his brother, in 2010, demonstrate the importance of picking a credible leader who has a track record and is an effective communicator. Miliband, despite a better-than-expected performance during the campaign, never really met these standards. Practically everything he said about rising inequality, stagnant living standards, and Tory attacks on the needy and jobless was accurate. So were his arguments that the tax system has been skewed in favor of the wealthy ever since Mrs. Thatcher abolished residential property taxes, or, rather, replaced them with a poll tax (hence Labour’s proposal for a “mansion tax”), and that Britain needs to invest in education and infrastructure to build a high-skill, high-wage economy. But, although Miliband and his colleagues had the right diagnosis, they couldn’t persuade the British public that they had the right policies to tackle them. Labour’s proposals were individually popular. However, many voters apparently believed the Tories’ claims that Labour would spend irresponsibly and bankrupt the country.","1954","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"Here again, though, the situation facing the Democrats is very different, and incumbency is an advantage. Whatever economic platform Hillary Clinton cobbles together (and here I am assuming she gets the nomination), she will be able to point to a track record of growth and responsible fiscal management. Since 2010, the U.S. budget deficit has fallen from almost ten per cent of G.D.P. to less than three per cent. Despite Republican claims that Obama’s spendthrift policies were leading the country to rack and ruin, this prediction clearly hasn’t come true, and public opinion is starting to reflect that fact. As recently as 2012, according to Gallup, more than sixty per cent of Americans identified the economy as the most important problem facing the country. By April of this year, this figure had fallen to thirty-four per cent. And the number of people identifying the budget deficit or federal debt as the biggest problem was just five per cent.","1955","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"It could even be argued that Labour’s defeat should be more disturbing to Republicans than to Democrats. It is the G.O.P., after all, that is seeking to unseat an incumbent. It is the G.O.P. that is the more ideologically driven party. And it is the G.O.P. that has a record of squandering budget surpluses on its pet projects, such as tax cuts and military adventures. Miliband, despite his best efforts, couldn’t persuade voters that Labour wouldn’t go back to what many of them perceived (largely unfairly, as it happens) to be its old, bad ways. Come next year, Jeb Bush, or whoever wins the Republican primary, will face a similar challenge.","1956","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"

"A week after it began, the flap over Jeb Bush and Iraq still hasn’t fully died down. With his changing answers to the question that Megyn Kelly first posed to him, last Monday on Fox News, about whether he would have ordered an invasion in 2003 knowing what he knows now, the former Florida governor has provided campaign reporters with something juicy to write about, and Republican fretters with something to fret about.","May 19, 2015","1965","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"If Dubya’s younger brother can’t avoid friendly fire in the confines of a Fox News interview, how will he handle it when the campaign proper begins?* The benign explanation is that he’s ring-rusty—thirteen years since his last election, and all that. But, on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, darker suspicions are lurking. Perhaps Bush isn’t up to speed on international issues, or, worse, he’s too tied to his younger sibling to give the obvious answer to Kelly’s question: “No, no, no—a thousand times, no.”","1966","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"In Democratic circles, the sight of Bush floundering was a welcome one. Barely had he emerged from the Fox interview when the Democratic National Committee put out a video, entitled “Don’t Get Fooled Again,” which intersperses his comments to Kelly with some footage from 2002 of George W. saying “Fool me once, shame on me. … You can’t get fooled again.” The jabs keep coming. In Monday’s Times, Paul Krugman, one of the few commentators in the mainstream press who expressed skepticism in the run-up to the March, 2003 invasion, took the opportunity to get in another dig at George W. Bush, Don Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, et al, reminding his readers, “We were lied into war.”","1967","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Since 2007 or thereabouts, opinion polls have consistently showed that a sizable majority of Americans regard the Iraq invasion as a mistake. If the Democrats were likely to field a candidate in 2016 who opposed the war all along, they’d be in a position to exploit the issue for all it’s worth, just as Barack Obama did in 2008. But, unless something unexpected happens, the Democratic nominee will be Hillary Clinton, who, in October, 2002, voted for a congressional resolution that authorized the use of force against Iraq, and whose current take on the decision to go to war isn’t terribly easy to distinguish from the one that Jeb Bush has stumbled into.","1968","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Bush’s position, as he explained it in his second clarification last week, is the following: “ ‘Knowing what we know now, what would you have done?’ I would’ve not engaged; I would not have gone into Iraq. That’s not to say that the world is safer because Saddam Hussein is gone—it is significantly safer. That’s not to say that there was a courageous effort to bring about a surge that created stability in Iraq—all of that is true. … But we’ve answered the question now.”","1969","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Clinton’s public statements, like Bush’s, have gone through several iterations. In September, 2007, she argued that she hadn’t, in fact, voted for a preëmptive war, and said, “Obviously, if I had known then what I know now about what the President would do with the authority that was given him, I would not have voted the way that I did.” Since many people regarded the resolution, at the time it passed, in October, 2002, as a blank check (twenty-one Democratic senators voted against it), this explanation didn’t do Clinton much good, but she stuck with it throughout her 2008 Presidential campaign, refusing to describe her vote as a mistake. In her 2014 memoir, “Hard Choices,” Clinton changed tack, fessing up and saying that she had relied heavily on prewar intelligence about Saddam’s programs to build weapons of mass destruction. “I should have stated my regret sooner and in the plainest, most direct language possible,” she wrote. She went on, “I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn’t alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.”","1970","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"That language was commendably clear. It means that Clinton and Bush are now agreed upon the proposition that, knowing what we know now, invading Iraq was an error. The two of them also agree that, once Saddam had been overthrown, the U.S.-led occupation bungled things by not providing adequate security inside Iraq. In her book, Clinton wrote that the United States “went to war in Iraq with only half a strategy.” In his interview with Kelly, Bush said, “Once we invaded and took out Saddam Hussein, we didn’t focus on security first, and the Iraqis in this incredibly insecure environment turned on the United States military because there was no security for themselves and their families. By the way, guess who thinks that those mistakes took place as well? George W. Bush.”","1971","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"It was pretty rich of Jeb to cite his brother’s post-White House ruminations in an effort to exculpate the tragic errors of the Bush Administration. Nonetheless, Jeb’s statements to Kelly, in which he also included a direct reference to Clinton’s 2002 vote, highlighted the dilemma facing the Democratic front-runner. If she tries to use the Iraq issue against the Republicans, by, for example, warning that a G.O.P. President could end up blundering into another war, she will open herself to criticisms, counterattacks, and endless rehashings of her 2002 vote.","1972","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Is there a way around this problem? I think that perhaps there is. Rather than apologizing and complaining about faulty intelligence, Clinton could say that we all make mistakes, but the key thing is what we learn from them. In the case of the Republicans in general, and Jeb Bush in particular, she could argue convincingly that the learning process has hardly begun.","1973","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Despite Bush’s claim, during the big foreign-policy speech that he delivered in Chicago in February, that “I’m my own man,” it has been widely reported that he’s been consulting with some of his brother’s former advisers, including Paul Wolfowitz, who famously said that the Iraqis would “welcome us as liberators.” The speech itself relied on standard G.O.P. boilerplate—“Weakness invites war. Strength encourages peace”—and was devoid of novel ideas. Setting aside Rand Paul, who has virtually no chance of winning the nomination, there is precious little evidence of new thinking elsewhere in the Republican field, either. Indeed, Marco Rubio’s speech last week at the Council on Foreign Relations suggests that the candidates are trying to outdo each other in bellicosity.","1974","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Clinton, for her part, still has work to do to explain what she learned from the Iraq disaster. Clearly, it didn’t turn her against the concept of overseas military intervention. In 2011, as Secretary of State, she helped orchestrate air attacks on Libya that aided in bringing down Muammar Qaddafi, unleashing a civil war that is still raging. In 2013, after she left office, she supported U.S. military action against the Syrian regime, a course that President Obama eventually backed away from. In “Hard Choices,” however, she struck a cautious note. “As much as I have wanted to, I could never change my vote on Iraq,” she wrote. “But I could try to help us learn the right lessons from that war … I was determined to do exactly that when facing future hard choices, with more experience, wisdom, skepticism, and humility.”","1975","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"As the 2016 campaign unfolds, Clinton might want to say more about how her views have changed, and how, as President, she would reconcile her urge to exercise American power—both to protect U.S. interests and to do some good in the world—with the harsh realities of experience. Such a discussion would help shift attention away from her 2002 vote and allow her to draw a contrast with the Republicans’ empty rhetoric. More importantly, it would focus the campaign debate on the question that, ever since March, 2003, has been hovering over practically everything: Whither America after Iraq?","1976","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"In his measured responses to international crises and his occasional flip-flops, President Obama has provided one answer, which harkens back to the cautious realism of the former national-security advisers Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft. Would Clinton stick to Obama’s “Don’t do stupid stuff” philosophy? Based on her history, some analysts suspect that she remains, at heart, a neo-liberal interventionist, à la Tony Blair, or even, perhaps, an old-school Democratic hawk from the Scoop Jackson school. Understandably enough, given the controversy that followed critical remarks that she made last summer about the U.S.’s cautious policy in Syria, Clinton hasn’t said much during the past nine months that would help voters place her on the foreign-policy spectrum. Now that she’s officially a candidate for President, it’s time she helped them out a little.","1977","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"

"On the night of October 11, 2012, Barack Obama loped across the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base, looking as if he were trying hard not to grin. It was a change of mood; eight days earlier, he had done poorly in his first Presidential debate with Mitt Romney, and the feeling in his campaign was gloomy. But, that evening, Vice-President Joe Biden had had his first debate with Paul Ryan, during which he called out the Romney campaign on its “malarkey.” Some commentators thought that he had looked foolish—he’d laughed a lot, and when Biden laughs, he throws back his head. (Mark Salter, the Republican operative, called the Obama-Biden debate combination “sleepy cop/crystal-meth cop.”) But even many of the critics thought that he’d won. He had reminded a lot of people of why they wanted a Democrat in the White House, particularly on questions like income inequality. One of those people seems to have been Obama himself. He’d watched the debate on Air Force One and, though there wasn’t a plan for him to speak to reporters, he swung over to where they were standing.","June 12, 2015","1979","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"

That was the case when what was scoffed at as yet another instance of Bidenic indiscipline—getting ahead of his boss by saying that he was “absolutely comfortable” with full legal recognition of same-sex marriage—led Obama, too, to say what he actually believed, and arrive at a place where he felt proud to be.","1981","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"The idea that a person could make those around him better came up again this past weekend, when Obama delivered the eulogy for Biden’s son, Beau, who had died of brain cancer, at the age of forty-six. The Vice-President, by all accounts, was hit hard by his son’s death. In 1973, he had taken his Senate oath next to the hospital bed where Beau lay, at age three, after surviving the car crash that had killed Biden’s wife and daughter. He was also the son who had served in the reserves in Iraq, been elected as the attorney general of Delaware, and one day, perhaps, could go even further in politics than his father had. “He even looked and sounded like Joe, although I think Joe would be first to acknowledge that Beau was an upgrade—Joe 2.0,” Obama said. He added, “That’s who Beau was. Someone who cared. Someone who charmed you, and disarmed you, and put you at ease. When he’d have to attend a fancy fund-raiser with people who took themselves way too seriously, he’d walk over to you and whisper something wildly inappropriate in your ear.” (Joe Biden, for his part, has been known to whisper wildly inappropriate things, but when he was, for example, caught on an open mic telling Obama that the passage of the Affordable Care Act was “a big fucking deal,” he was reminding Obama that he should take something seriously.) At the funeral, Obama said that he loved Biden.

Decide.’ ’’ Biden is seventy-two. Hillary Clinton is sixty-seven. More tellingly, Biden added, “I watched my father. I made a mistake in encouraging him to retire. I just think as long as you think you can do it and you’re physically healthy….”","1984","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"The Clintons have become very wealthy as a result of their book deals, speaking fees, and other endeavors—they have made thirty million dollars just since Hillary left the State Department. (Bill Clinton recently said that he would consider giving up paid speeches—after Hillary wins.) Joe Biden is not a very wealthy man. By one estimate, his net worth is between thirty-nine thousand and eight hundred thousand dollars; by another, with his mortgage figured in, it is a negative number. (Biden: “But I got a great pension and I got a good salary!”) Which way does that cut, for each of them? Perhaps it makes a Biden campaign less feasible, in that he has less flexibility; it might also make it more desirable, depending on one’s definition of independence.","1985","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"Last week, Hillary Clinton almost lost to Bernie Sanders in a Wisconsin straw poll (the tally was forty-nine per cent to forty-one), but Sanders, who can reasonably be called a socialist, is not likely to be the one who makes clear what her real general-election vulnerabilities are, or how to overcome them. Biden would. He may have no chance of winning. But he is a more plausible candidate than anyone Clinton is facing now, and perhaps the best answer to the fear that, as the Republicans fight it out among themselves, she will drift through until the convention, with a stray glance at Martin O’Malley, and enter the general election unprepared for the fight. Obama was right about Biden’s debate with Ryan: rewatching it is a good reminder of his ability to speak plainly and in detail about Democratic economic policies—something that involves more than just throwing out lines about level playing fields. (Republicans have been doing that, too.) Maybe Hillary Clinton, in a speech she’s scheduled to give on Saturday, will find a way to make those themes work for her. She hasn’t yet.","1986","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"

His 2006 proposal for Iraq—reshaping the country into a loose three-part federation—also much derided, does not, in light of recent events, look all that bad.

"But how, might one ask, could Biden win in a general election when Obama, his boss, is so unpopular? That question points to what may be one of the most interesting results of having Biden in the race. Hillary Clinton would have to decide where she really stands on the Obama Presidency, in all its aspects, and say what she thinks about it. (He was her boss, too.) Her advisers have made it clear that she’s counting on the Obama coalition; how tied are their votes to the Obama legacy? Clinton needs a response that doesn’t just involve hinting that everything would have been better if she’d been elected in 2008. She tried out some jabs at Obama, in an interview with the Atlantic last August, in which, quoting one of his mantras, she said, “Great nations need organizing principles, and ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle,” and called his choices on Syria a “failure.” Her spokesman said afterward that she hadn’t meant to criticize the President, and looked forward “to hugging it out.” The message there, whatever it was, got muddled. Biden’s presence might clarify it, and present some interesting choices to Democratic primary voters—and to Obama, who might not endorse anyone before the nomination, but could give a few hints of his preference along the way.","1988","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"

McCrory’s veto put the Republican governor at odds with a Tea Party legislature, which immediately promised to override it. On June 1st, the state senate voted to override, and, this morning, the house of delegates did, too, making it legal for North Carolina magistrates to turn away gay couples.","June 11, 2015","1990","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-gop-opts-out-of-equality"
"The Bartleby-like public official who “would prefer not to” marry same-sex couples would not have been asked to just one year ago. In 2012, North Carolina adopted a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, in line with thirty other states where a majority at one point opposed it. Then, in June, 2013, the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, and federal courts turned decisively in favor of gay marriage. In October, 2014, a federal judge ruled North Carolina’s marriage amendment unconstitutional, and same-sex ceremonies began. That month alone, court decisions also lifted same-sex-marriage bans in thirteen other states—Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Nevada, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming—more than twice the number of states where same-sex marriage was legal in 2010.","1991","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-gop-opts-out-of-equality"
"Following this rout, conservatives have moved rapidly from enforcing a unified public morality based on traditional marriage to speaking the language of pluralism as they seek exemptions from the rising legal norm of marriage equality. Their model has been the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (R.F.R.A.), of 1993, which exempts believers from federal laws that “substantially burden” their religious exercise, except where the regulation is the least burdensome way to fulfill a “compelling governmental interest.”","1992","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-gop-opts-out-of-equality"
"The R.F.R.A.—which was intended to protect neglected religious minorities, such as Native American worshippers who had recently lost public-sector jobs in Oregon because of their ritual use of peyote—was the basis of last year’s Supreme Court decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, which held that certain business owners can refuse to offer insurance coverage for contraception based on their religious objections. The Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was signed into law this March, is a model for the state-level expansion of religious exemptions, applying its protections to all corporations and making religious belief a defense in private legal actions, such as anti-discrimination suits. A similar bill passed in Arkansas later that month.","1993","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-gop-opts-out-of-equality"
"Supporters describe the state R.F.R.A.s and other religious accommodation laws as acknowledging the “increasing religious pluralism in American culture,” and protecting “religious liberties and the freedom to live out religious convictions,” as Russell Moore, the president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, put it in March. These exemptions, for the individuals, public officials, and business owners who wish to say, “I would prefer not to,” have become the new front in the culture war, the redoubt of attitudes that were recently in the majority. Invoking tolerance to defend intolerance is ironic at best, but at a moment when disapproval of gay marriage looks ever more like plain bigotry, it is better to say not, “I disapprove of you,” but rather, “This is who I am.”","1994","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-gop-opts-out-of-equality"
"The Bartleby strategy has taken center stage in conservative resistance to a wide range of liberal policies. In 2012, the Supreme Court nearly overruled the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that individuals buy insurance. Five justices voted to protect the consumer’s freedom to opt out of a market, such as the health-insurance market, warning that, if Congress could require this purchase, it could also command people to buy health-club memberships, American cars, or broccoli. (The insurance requirement survived through a sleight of hand, as Chief Justice John Roberts, who agreed with the rest of the Bartleby argument, found a hook for the law in Congress’s constitutional power to impose taxes.) In 2014, the Court held that certain members of public-sector unions could opt out of paying their union dues, which fund organizing and advocacy. Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito argued that mandatory dues impinge on the First Amendment’s rights of free expression and voluntary association, and hinted that dues requirements in general might be found unconstitutional in the future.","1995","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-gop-opts-out-of-equality"
"As conservatives press these claims for personal exemptions, they have also been highly solicitous of states that would prefer not to accept new federal standards. The Supreme Court did real damage to the Affordable Care Act when, as part of its 2012 ruling, it found that states could not be penalized for refusing to expand Medicaid, which was an essential part of the A.C.A.’s path to near-universal coverage. As a result, twenty-one states have not signed on to the Medicaid expansion, and nearly four million low-income Americans have not obtained health insurance that the federal government intended them to have.","1996","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-gop-opts-out-of-equality"
"Similarly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is urging state governments to disobey the Obama Administration’s order to develop climate-change regulations. McConnell has some support for his argument that the Clean Air Act does not stretch far enough to require these regulations, and there is sure to be litigation on the issue. But his call for a coordinated strategy of passive resistance in the meantime is extraordinary. The more opt-outs any climate policy includes, the more likely it is to fall apart in a wave of free-riding, as everyone decides to let someone else make the sacrifice, leaving no one to make the sacrifice at all.","1997","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-gop-opts-out-of-equality"
"Of course, a state refusing to make law is different from an individual refusing to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple. Medicaid policy and pollution regulation directly affect millions of people and billions of dollars of economic activity. The argument for conscience-based individual exemptions is that they concern the exempted individual most of all. The problem with this argument is that an individual’s conscience is never just a personal matter when, as in the case of the Hobby Lobby decision, it bears on the terms of employment. Then the person denied contraceptive benefits, or who is looking for a new job where she can get those benefits, is also part of the picture. Economic life is deeply interdependent, and involves conflicting interests and unequal power. This is why, from the New Deal until very recently, the Supreme Court did not permit many opt-outs from economic regulation. The new raft of conscience claims is creating unprotected spaces within an already precarious economy.","1998","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-gop-opts-out-of-equality"
"A second problem with individual opt-outs is just as basic. Conscience is never just personal when the occasion is a fraught debate over public morality. Once public laws banning same-sex marriage are gone, authorizing supposedly private discrimination against same-sex couples continues the cultural fight by other means. In hindsight, no one doubts that allowing business owners to discriminate against black people during the Civil Rights era would have denied them full equality and hampered desegregation. (Arguably, the continued tolerance of discrimination by private clubs also undermines desegregation, though club membership is less essential to daily life than shopping.) Similarly, allowing private discrimination against gay couples is not an exemption from a new rule of full equality; it is a compromise that allows inequality to persist. Proposals to let magistrates withhold marriage licenses have the same problems, with the added insult that the discrimination is effectively coming from the state. If officials can decide not to implement laws they dislike, then equality under the law—for gay couples, at least —is just a slogan.","1999","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-gop-opts-out-of-equality"
"The Bartleby position appeals to touchstone liberal values: personal conscience, diversity, tolerance, and autonomy. On their face, these values seem to promise there are no hard conflicts: there is room for everyone’s conscience, everyone’s outlook, and tolerance enough for each person’s freedom. The new generation of opt-outs show that this is a misconception: there is conflict over what these values mean, and there is never enough room for all their meanings. The politics of tolerance, diversity, and autonomy are distributive politics, with winners and losers.","2000","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-gop-opts-out-of-equality"

As in much else, initiative in this tradition of creative refusal belongs to the political right today. There is no paradox in conservatives using liberal values and tactics to their ends.

"Democrats and Republicans disagree on a lot, but leaders of both parties are as keen now as they were decades ago to embrace manufacturing jobs. G.O.P. Presidential candidates, including Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, have spoken of a “renaissance” in American manufacturing; Rubio, for his part, told a Los Angeles audience in April that taxes and regulations need to be relaxed to create more factory jobs. Meanwhile, a group of Democratic senators have joined forces with labor unions and some big businesses to support an ongoing campaign, backed by legislation, called Manufacturing Jobs for America (M.J.A.). “America’s manufacturing sector has enormous potential to create new jobs and accelerate our economic recovery,” the campaign declares.","August 6, 2015","2033","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has increased modestly the past few years, but when parties offering different economic visions rush to take credit for a renaissance, it suggests that some kind of larger deception is at work. To many Americans who’ve worked in factories, including me, the hype feels misplaced and anachronistic. What few politicians will tell you is that most factory jobs are decidedly unpleasant. Having any job usually beats unemployment, of course, and today’s factory workers are far better off than those who toiled in the nineteenth century’s dark Satanic mills, but their jobs often epitomize what Karl Marx identified as the alienation of the laborer from his or her labor. They lead the human employee to be treated, in the enduring phrase of Marx and Friedrich Engels, as “an appendage of the machine.”","2034","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"It says something about the nature of the work that so many manufacturing tasks have proven to be replaceable by automation. Machines are better equipped to handle numbing repetition, and are immune to the unsafe and unhealthy conditions of much industrial work. Despite the advent of modern workplace-safety regulations, factories remain likely, for example, to damage employees’ lungs and hearing. (In the screw-machine factory where I worked in college, there was an earplug dispenser on a wall, but anyone who wore plugs was considered a wuss.) Furthermore, workers in low-autonomy, repetitive manufacturing jobs display disproportionately high rates of alcoholism, drug abuse, and depression.","2035","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"Moreover, it’s evident that an advanced, twenty-first-century economy can grow even as manufacturing shrinks. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 17.2 million manufacturing jobs in the United States twenty years ago; today the figure is 12.3 million. Yet America’s gross domestic product during that period rose from about ten trillion dollars to more than sixteen trillion, adjusted for inflation.","2036","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"Why, then, is America so in love with manufacturing jobs? Historically, manufacturing played a unique and vital role in economic development. Some economists, particularly those influenced by Nicholas Kaldor, who taught at Cambridge and developed a set of “laws” about economic development, emphasize that there is a strong correlation between the health of a country’s manufacturing sector and the pace of its economic growth. And common sense tells us that few countries have joined the world’s élite solely by farming or extracting natural resources. Manufacturing is also vital during wartime, when it’s important for a country to have access to its own supply of tanks, bombers, and materiel. In addition, producing physical objects holds a nostalgic, psychological attraction.","2037","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"None of this, however, has much to do with why today’s politicians tout manufacturing. Its main attraction for them, and for workers, lies in its perceived economic benefits. “Workers in manufacturing jobs earn 24 percent more in annual pay and benefits than the average worker in other industries,” the M.J.A. campaign claims, citing figures from the National Association of Manufacturers. Many basic factory jobs also require little skill, training, or language ability, which means that most adults can perform them. Because unskilled workers still make up a significant portion of the American workforce, manufacturing is for millions of people the best economic choice available.","2038","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"There’s nothing intrinsic to assembling widgets that guarantees higher wages, though. On the contrary: one of the main reasons that the U.S. has lost so many manufacturing jobs in recent decades is that the same work can be done elsewhere for a fraction of the cost. Manufacturing pays better than many low-skilled jobs in large part because it was for a long time a highly unionized sector, and workers were able to lock in higher wages over years of collectively bargained contracts. Yet even that advantage is not what it once was. A manufacturing employee today is far less likely than a government employee to be represented by a labor union. (You probably won’t hear a lot of political rhetoric, even from Democrats, about how we need more well-paying government jobs, however).","2039","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"Indeed, some of the jobs created in the recent manufacturing “renaissance” are distinguished by their low pay. When Los Angeles passed a law this year that will raise the minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour by 2020, some local apparel manufacturers grumbled that they would move their operations outside the city limits to avoid paying more than the state’s minimum wage, which will rise next year to ten dollars an hour. If these businesses make good on their threat, Los Angeles could end up as a city in which fast-food workers are better paid than manufacturing workers not far from its borders.","2040","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"
"As anomalous as that situation may appear, it might help us rethink some outdated notions of work and value. If our society’s goal is good wages and benefits, there’s not much point in fretting about whether the jobs our globalized economy creates are in the manufacturing sector. The deeper challenge is to find ways to insure that the jobs created by the American economy pay well and promote social goals such as health, the environment, and worker satisfaction, regardless of sector. The resistance to higher wages among some of Los Angeles’s producers suggests that this won’t be easy in manufacturing. To the extent that a lack of skills in all areas holds back American workers from higher wages, it could take generations for the workforce to develop those skills. Still, the problem of low and stagnant wages won’t disappear or get any easier by continuing to pretend that manufacturing ought to be our only, or even our highest, priority.","2041","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whats-so-great-about-manufacturing"

Now she lived in a modest, well-kept high-rise overlooking the factory where they made Bonomo Turkish Taffy. The reward for passable behavior during these visits was the promise of a ride on the Cyclone (this occurred precisely zero times) or a warning-laden “stroll” on the beach: “Careful!

One son, Donald Trump, took up his father’s example, slathered it in gold leaf and topped it with world-class cubic zirconia, cultivated a head of pumpkiny, multidirectional hair, accumulated billions of dollars (though likely fewer billions than he’s claimed), and, by the eighties, became the P.

But it’s always been more than buffoonish entertainment. The sheer number of people and peoples who Trump has managed to insult, bully, and mistreat is, in its way, awe-inspiring. He congratulated Alejandro González Iñárritu for winning numerous Oscars for “Birdman” with this gracious remark: “Well, it was a great night for Mexico, as usual in this country.” He once told Bryant Gumbel, in an interview for an NBC program on race, what he thought about affirmative action: “If I was starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black, because I really do believe they have the actual advantage today.” In the seventies, the Trump real-estate company was sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in its rental practices in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Queens. After settling the case with Trump, the Justice Department sued yet again for non-compliance. In 1989, Trump took out an ad in the Daily News, and three other newspapers, about the Central Park jogger rape case, in which he declared that the “criminals of every age” who had been arrested twelve days earlier—five African-American and Hispanic teen-agers—were “crazed misfits,” part of “roving bands.” “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY,” the ad read. “BRING BACK OUR POLICE!” Years after it turned out that someone else had committed the crime, and the young men had finally been released from prison, Trump wrote an unapologetic op-ed for the paper in which he called the city’s push for restitution payments to the men “a disgrace.” He made it plain that, to him, their lives were nothing, and, besides, “These young men do not exactly have the pasts of angels.”","2045","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"

NBC, which came under heavy pressure from a Hispanic media-watchdog group and many viewers, severed ties with him, as has Macy’s, which carried his clothing line. Trump’s political and ideological forays have generally been promotional brand extensions, lasting only as long as they were, in his view, good for business; the whole con might end well before the first snows in Sioux City and Manchester.","2048","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"

Jeb Bush, the one Republican in the mobbed field who is running ahead of Trump in New Hampshire, waited a few weeks before commenting on the latest outrage about Mexican rapist-immigrants storming our southern borders. Bush, who is married to a Mexican-American woman, did say the comments were “ugly,” and added that he was “absolutely” offended on a personal level. And yet his remarks, like those of other candidates, were calibrated to assure the public that Trump’s comments were “not reflective of the Republican Party.” As if this had been a misstep, an aberration, and not typical Trump. Some are unwilling to go even that far. Chris Christie distanced himself from Trump’s rant, too, but he was quick to add, “I like Donald.

Trump, he said, with a wily smile, “has been, believe it or not, uncommonly nice to Hillary and me.” Perhaps. Not long ago, on MSNBC, Trump said that Clinton was “probably” the best of the four most recent Presidents. Then he added, “Frankly, had he not met Monica, had he not met Paula, had he not met various and sundry semi-beautiful women, he would have had a much better deal going.” That “sundry semi-beautiful” bit was an especially, even uncommonly, nice Trumpism. Hillary Clinton, for her part, could not bring herself to do anything more than tap Trump on the wrist. She told CNN that she was “very disappointed” in Trump’s remarks about Mexican immigrants—which, considering the fact that the Clintons attended one of Trump’s weddings, seems quite polite.

"History is replete with joke candidates for high office. Will Rogers ran for President, in 1928, as the standard-bearer of the Anti-Bunk Party, and wrote a book about his experience: “He Chews to Run.” One Yetta Bronstein, an (imaginary) citizen of the Bronx and the creation of a hoax artist named Alan Abel, was on Presidential campaign posters, in 1964 and 1968, promoting fluoridation, sex education, and, oddly, bingo. (“Vote for Yetta and watch things get better.”) At the 1968 Democratic Convention, in Chicago, the Yippies put forward their candidate: Pigasus.

"Donald Trump is a joke, too, but of a different sort. His intention is not to inspire laughter or relief; his targets are not the powerful. He doesn’t punch up. He spews forth ugliness everywhere he goes. It would be nice, and maybe wise, simply to ignore him, in the hope that he will, after all these many years, just go away. But he never really does, and the most immediate concern is not that he will win the office he pursues but that he will get in the heads of the candidates around him.

"In some future footnote or parenthetical aside, it may be observed that although General Robert E. Lee surrendered in 1865, the Confederacy’s final retreat did not occur until a century and a half later. The rearguard movement of Republicans in the aftermath of the slaughter in Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church marked the relinquishing of the Confederacy’s best-fortified positions: the cultural ones. We have for decades willfully coexisted with a translucent lie about the bloodiest conflict in American history and the moral questions at its center. Amid the calls last week to lower the Confederate battle flag at the state capitol, the defenders of the flag averred that it represents “heritage, not hate.” The great sleight of hand is the notion that these things were mutually exclusive.","2056","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/the-confederacys-final-retreat"
"Americans, both in the South and beyond, attach a particular brand of exceptionalism to the region. This is the reason that there is a Southern Historical Association but not a Northern one; a genre known as Southern literature but no Northern corollary; and a concept of Southern politics as something distinct from the national variety. The notion of the Confederate flag as a benign tribute to that exceptionalism rests upon another premise that illustrated, long before our present concerns with climate change and vaccination did, the political usefulness of denial: the idea that the Civil War was not fought over slavery—a claim that would have bewildered those who served in it—allowed Southerners to memorialize the leaders of an armed insurrection without the sticky moral baggage of bondage attached.","2057","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/the-confederacys-final-retreat"
"That interpretation held that the war was sparked by a conflict over tariffs that penalized Southern agriculture to the benefit of Northern industry. Or, more vaguely, that the war was fought over “states’ rights.” This evasion proved amazingly effective. Monuments to the valor of the Confederate ideal dot the South like matériel left on a battlefield. But none of these arguments bear scrutiny. Were the Southerners who erected those monuments concerned primarily about the valor of men, there would be many more dedicated to the former slaves who fought for the Union and risked death or, arguably worse, reënslavement. Were the war mainly about tariffs, we would be left to think that these fugitives fled farms and plantations to join the Union Army because of their abiding belief in trade protectionism. Or that the nearly forty thousand of them who died did so defending their views on Federalism. The Confederates themselves did not believe this. Here is the South Carolina convention in 1860, explaining the rationale for secession:","2058","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/the-confederacys-final-retreat"
"The South is exceptional not primarily because of its literature or its food or its politics but because, as historians have pointed out, it is the only region of the United States that has lived for the majority of its history with the experience of military defeat. Four decades after the U.S. withdrawal from Saigon, Vietnam remains a spectral presence in American foreign policy and military strategy. But when the Vietnam War began the South had already been familiar with that kind of recrimination and self-doubt for a hundred years. It not only fought tenaciously for the right to own human beings; it did so unsuccessfully. Neither of these facts can be easily accepted, but only one of them can be easily denied. So detached from slavery is the conception of the war that the controversial Memorial Day tradition of sending a Presidential wreath to the Confederate Memorial, in Arlington National Cemetery, which began with Woodrow Wilson, continued into the present. (President Obama amended the tradition by also sending a wreath to the African American Civil War Memorial, in Washington, D.C.)","2059","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/the-confederacys-final-retreat"
"Such denialism has governed an important portion of our national affairs and distorted our self-image, but it collapsed in the hail of fire in the sanctuary of Emanuel A.M.E. Church. As is often the case, tragedy was the burden we shouldered for a moment of square introspection. This is probably why the eulogy that Barack Obama delivered for the Reverend Clementa Pinckney on Friday was sober and self-reflective in a way that we seldom hear. “The flag,” the President said, “has always represented more than just ancestral pride. For many, black and white, that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation. We see that now. Removing the flag from this state’s capitol would not be an act of political correctness.” He added, in reference to the Confederate soldiers, that “it would simply be an acknowledgment that the cause for which they fought, the cause of slavery, was wrong.”","2060","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/the-confederacys-final-retreat"
"It may seem odd, decades after the civil-rights movement, to note that for a sitting President to say that the Confederacy fought for the institution of slavery—and that doing so was a moral wrong—is a radical statement. Yet it is, and shortly after making it the President fell silent. It appeared that perhaps he had lost his way, but then, in a remarkable moment, he began to sing “Amazing Grace,” a hymn that is at once a lament, a prayer, and a hope—written by John Newton, a onetime slave trader who became an abolitionist. Immediately after the speech, people began debating whether the song had been part of the prepared text or whether the President sang it out of an impromptu spiritual imperative. In either case, he was likely hoping to see in the national culture precisely the transformation that Newton had experienced in himself, one that facilitated his first truthful accounting of the evil of slavery. ♦","2061","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/the-confederacys-final-retreat"

Among other subjects, he spoke about his big lead in the polls and joked about holding the 2016 election early. “I’d like to have the election tomorrow,” Trump said. “I don’t want to wait.” In another sign of the progress he is making, one of Alabama’s two Republican senators, Jeff Sessions, greeted Trump onstage and praised his tough stance on immigration.","August 22, 2015","2062","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"To say that Trump is flying high would be an understatement. Not only is he crushing his Republican opponents in the polls, many of his critics in the media have thrown in the towel. Having dismissed his candidacy, poked fun at him, and portrayed him (with every justification) as a draft-dodging, racist, sexist huckster, the campaign press is now paying him the ultimate compliment and taking him seriously.","2063","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"On the day of the rally, USA Today reported, with no evident irony, that Trump and his allies were plotting “a path to victory” in the G.O.P. primaries. The Washington Post said that Trump’s Republican rivals were being forced to adopt new strategies to ride out the “Trump tornado.” And a front-page story in the Boston Globe quoted Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, who said, “What is happening with Trump is not a fluke. Yes, he is a great entertainer, but he is able to take advantage of a number of dynamics in American politics as they exist right now. This is an important moment.”","2064","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"We shall see. Perhaps Skocpol is right, and Trump’s rise in the polls represents a deep and lasting political phenomenon. Perhaps, as I suggested a couple of weeks ago, it will wither away, like the candidacies of previous G.O.P. candidates who tickled the party’s base at roughly this stage of the campaign, such as Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain. In any case, setting aside Trump’s ultimate fate, his current position demands explanation. How is he doing it? Here are five vaguely plausible theories that I have seen put forward recently.","2065","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"1. He’s a rich celebrity. “Trump is the personification of a 21st-century America fascinated by the super rich and obsessed with celebrity,” James Pindell wrote in the Globe’s Friday story, citing interviews that he’d conducted with a number of historians. It’s not just that Trump’s ceaseless self-promotion and his role on “The Apprentice” have created a level of name recognition that his rivals can’t hope to match. With his status as a bona-fide celebrity, he can get his message out without having to worry about how it is intermediated by the political press, or about whether he is winning the “invisible primary” for the support of moneyed élites. Indeed, rather than being tested by the media, Trump is exploiting it mercilessly, especially the broadcast media.","2066","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Virtually everywhere you look on cable television there is an “exclusive” Trump interview. Since he draws much higher ratings than any other candidate, he knows the cable networks will keep inviting him on and giving him lengthy prime-time interviews, regardless of what he actually says. (This, surely, was the message of the Megyn Kelly dust-up.) The other candidates are forced to rely on occasional onscreen appearances (the debates, especially) and paid media (that is, advertising)—if they can afford it. The celebrity gulf puts them at an enormous disadvantage, which, for now at least, they are failing to surmount.","2067","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"2. He can’t be bought. As the political success of Michael Bloomberg showed, the idea of a billionaire candidate who doesn’t need to kowtow to vested interests can have considerable appeal to American voters. Trump is a populist version of Bloomberg, and he has no compunctions about pointing out how beholden his opponents are to rich donors—who are largely guys like him. During the first televised G.O.P. debate, he was eager to say that he had contributed to the past campaigns of many of his rivals in the full expectation of receiving something in return. He also claimed, effectively, to have paid Hillary Clinton to appear at his wedding. This wasn’t just boasting: it was exploiting his unique position to the maximum.","2068","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Given the widespread belief among voters that most politicians have been hopelessly corrupted by the demands of fund-raising, Trump’s appeal isn’t necessarily confined to ultra-conservatives. Appearing on the Fox Business Network recently, Ralph Nader, the longtime crusader against money in politics, who has mounted two Presidential campaigns as an independent and two as the Green Party nominee, called Trump “a breath of fresh air.” “The two-party tyranny that blocks voter choices and dominates the political scene on behalf of big business needs to be broken up and Trump is the one to do it. It takes a billionaire,” he said. When even someone with Nader’s progressive credentials is making this argument, is it any wonder many other Americans find it attractive?","2069","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"3. G.O.P. voters like his policies. When Trump accuses the Mexican government of sending its criminals to the United States and talks about deporting millions of undocumented workers en masse, many commentators, myself included, see him as engaging in misleading, impractical rabble-rousing. But, as I pointed out earlier this week, the demagoguery is working. Trump isn’t merely matching the more conservative Republican candidates on the immigration issue: he’s beating them. In arecent CNN poll, forty-four per cent of likely Republican voters picked Trump as the candidate who could best handle illegal immigration. (Jeb Bush came in second, with just twelve per cent.)","2070","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"And immigration isn’t the sole issue on which Trump’s views are striking a chord. His tough-on-trade rhetoric resonates with G.O.P. voters, particularly middle-income and low-income white men. Indeed, a recent survey by Pew Research suggested that Republicans, as a group, are now more skeptical of trade agreements, such as the new Trans-Pacific Partnership, than the Democrats are. As Newsweek’s Matt Cooper pointed out in a prescient piece back in June, Trump largely has this issue to himself. Dependent as they are on corporate money, most Republican candidates—from Jeb Bush to Marco Rubio to Scott Walker to Ted Cruz—support trade agreements. Trump, by contrast, is free to take a populist line, which he is doing with great enthusiasm.","2071","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"4. He’s the rider on a white horse. On the radio a while back, I heard Pat Buchanan, who ran for President as a conservative insurgent twice in the nineteen-nineties, and again in 2000, compare Trump to Huey Long, the legendary Louisiana populist who assailed the rich, the corporations, and the metropolitan élites during the twenties and thirties. Like Long, Trump could speak to ordinary folk in a language that they could understand and relate to, Buchanan said. Long was a Democrat, of course, who espoused some policies—such as expanded public services, stricter regulation of business, and higher taxes on the rich—that Trump, in his current incarnation, might well dismiss as socialism. But there still might be something to the comparison. Long “spoke so directly to the people, and that is Donald Trump’s appeal,” Richard D. White, the author of “Kingfish: The Reign of Huey P. Long,” told the Boston Globe. “It is a purely personal relationship with his listeners. It is not based on factual issues.”","2072","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Of course, the divide between populism and demagoguery is often in the eye of the beholder. White, who is now the dean of E.J. Ourso College of Business, at Louisiana State University, highlighted Trump and Long’s penchants for dressing in fancy suits and using incendiary language toward minorities. “The oversimplification of issues is very dangerous, and when you combine that with negativity and fear, the combination is classic populism,” he said. At least one Republican, Frank Luntz, the pollster and strategist, has also suggested that Trump’s candidacy could be dangerous. “There’s something happening out there that is profound, but you gotta be careful; when you tap into it you better have a way to direct it,” Luntz told Politico. “Trump has tapped into it. Bernie Sanders has tapped into it and they’re doing well, but you’re tapping into fire—that’s how hot the anger is. We are in a dangerous political environment that requires a higher standard for the candidates running. It requires them not just to stoke the anger, it’s already there. It requires them to provide the balm of solutions.”","2073","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"5. He’s just a summer diversion. Asked about Trump’s performance in the televised debate and his subsequent comments about Megyn Kelly, Hillary Clinton said, “It’s all entertainment. I think he’s having the time of his life, being up on that stage, saying whatever he wants to say.” Despite Trump’s comments about why she attended his wedding, Clinton is doubtless enjoying the sight of him toying with his Republican rivals, one of whom she may well end up running against. But she also raised a serious point. These days, Presidential campaigns are ludicrously long and bloated. Is there anyone, faced with the prospect of another year and a half of focus-group-tested politicking, who wasn’t secretly (or not so secretly) a bit relieved that Trump entered the fray and provided a diversion?","2074","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"In a column published on the Cook Political Report earlier this week, Amy Walter compared the G.O.P. electorate’s embrace of Trump to a post-college summer fling. “The summer before a presidential election year is a lot like dating in your early 20s. You are unattached and care-free. You want to connect with someone passionately and fall hopelessly in love,” she wrote. “Meanwhile, your parents want you to meet a guy like Jeb Bush.” No wonder G.O.P. voters are dallying with Trump, Walters added. He’s “everything your parents hate. He’s loud. He’s disrespectful. He probably smokes and drives a motorcycle. But, you don’t care.” Eventually, though, you settle down with the responsible guy.","2075","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Which explanation is the most persuasive? Obviously, there is a bit of truth in all of them. I still tend to think his appeal will fade, but it could take a while. In the meantime, Hillary Clinton is right about him enjoying himself. “It’s been wild,” he told the crowd in Mobile, adding, “The reason I am leading is because I know the game. . . . You people are looking for somebody who knows what he is doing.”","2076","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"

"Seventy years ago this month, when the news came that Germany had surrendered and that the war in Europe was over, there were exuberant celebrations in London, Paris, and other European cities; in New York, a million people danced in the streets on May 7th, keeping it up for hours, until, as the Times reported the next day, Mayor La Guardia suggested that they ought to go home, or “just remain on your jobs as a tribute to the men who have won the war in Europe.” In Washington, though, the reaction was fairly subdued, probably because an outbreak of spontaneous cheering would have seemed a little forced; after all, the war with Japan wasn’t over. Though the capitulation of the Nazi regime had been expected for a while, with several German cities already under Allied control, the troops there couldn’t just celebrate, either. The Army Chief of Staff, George C. Marshall, said that “the destruction of the German Army now makes it possible to deploy mighty forces in the Pacific to crush the enemy.” (This was two months before the atomic bomb had its first successful test, in Alamogordo, New Mexico.) Harry Truman, who had been President for less than a month, delivered a modest radio message that proclaimed May 8th as V-E Day (“I only wish that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to see this day”), and James Forrestal, the Secretary of the Navy, read a short message over a public-address system. Then civilian and military government workers returned to their jobs.","May 14, 2015","2078","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/after-the-v-e-day-cheering-stopped-arthur-vandenbergs-legacy"

"That would be good practice, as it turned out, for V-J Day, on August 15, 1945—another moment of intense jubilation joined with a sense of work undone. After the cheering stopped, Truman and his advisers also knew that they had to face the international difficulties presented by the postwar peace, a prospect that became more complicated after the 1946 midterm election, which, for the first time since 1928, gave Republicans control of Congress. That was a considerable setback for an unelected, already unpopular President like Truman. He needed help from the new majority, and, while he wouldn’t get it from isolationists like Senator Robert A. Taft, he was able to turn to Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Vandenberg had opposed most of President Roosevelt’s New Deal measures, but found himself “evolving” during wartime. The attack on Pearl Harbor, he said, “ended isolationism for any realist,” and his words meant a lot when, in early 1945, on the floor of the Senate, he spoke in favor of a United Nations organization. Vandenberg didn’t stop there. In 1947, he supported the European Recovery Program—the Marshall Plan—and, in 1948, the Vandenberg resolution, which opened a constitutional path to an American role in NATO, a peacetime military alliance that Vandenberg, in his last major Senate speech, called “a fraternity of peace.”","2080","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/after-the-v-e-day-cheering-stopped-arthur-vandenbergs-legacy"
"Vandenberg might be a useful model for the current chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Tennessee’s Bob Corker, who seems to be one of the few Senate Republicans not running for President, although he once considered the idea. In his new role—Corker became chairman after the 2014 midterms, which gave his party control of the Senate—he has, at times, seemed willing to chart something of an independent course. A couple months ago, he was one of only seven Republicans who refused to sign an irresponsible letter, drafted by the freshman Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, warning Iran’s leaders not to make a nuclear deal with the Obama Administration. “I just didn’t view the letter as constructive,” Corker told Politico.","2081","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/after-the-v-e-day-cheering-stopped-arthur-vandenbergs-legacy"
"Working with the committee’s ranking Democrat, Benjamin Cardin, of Maryland, Corker recently guided to nearly unanimous Senate passage the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, a bill that allows Congress to review and then hold a vote on a nuclear deal with Iran. The bill is structured to allow Congress’s judgment to be trumped by a Presidential veto, one that simple arithmetic suggests would be easy to sustain. (Cotton was the sole nay.) President Obama certainly doesn’t like the bill, but he’s realistic enough to accept the result and knows that the bill cannot, by itself, prevent the Administration from reaching an agreement with Iran.","2082","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/after-the-v-e-day-cheering-stopped-arthur-vandenbergs-legacy"
"It’s a considerable stretch to compare Corker, who until recently never showed much interest in foreign policy, with Vandenberg, not least because the problems facing postwar America were, in many ways, so different from those of the present age—and our political institutions, including the Senate, are different, too. Back then, Republican Presidential aspirants like Taft still nurtured strong isolationist leanings; today’s leading contenders, excepting Senator Rand Paul, are promoting a “muscular” foreign policy, flaunting their hawkishness as if a regular workout in the interventionist gym will return America to lost greatness. (Jeb Bush, before insisting that he misheard the question, said that he would still vote to authorize the war in Iraq, even knowing how that turned out.)","2083","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/after-the-v-e-day-cheering-stopped-arthur-vandenbergs-legacy"
"Vandenberg himself might not have thrived in modern-day America. “Politicians as a class are vain, but he was vain beyond most of the tribe,” a Chicago Tribune correspondent wrote. Journalists knew about his affair with the Danish wife of a Canadian attaché, among other women, but were inclined to consider one’s personal life to be a personal matter. Vandenberg was free to practice statesmanship, urging a Republican Congress determined to cut taxes and spending to commit billions of dollars not only to Britain and France but to Italy and West Germany. Referring to the NATO debates, Vandenberg, in his diary, wrote, “I get so damned sick of that little band of GOP isolationists who are always in the way that I could scream.” (The line is quoted in James T. Patterson’s biography of Taft, “Mr. Republican.”)","2084","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/after-the-v-e-day-cheering-stopped-arthur-vandenbergs-legacy"
"Corker has not yet shown that sort of impatience with fellow-Republicans, but, after watching the Iran bill nearly sabotaged by self-serving and impractical amendments (one, offered by Senator Marco Rubio, would have required Iran to recognize Israeli statehood as a condition for a deal), it doesn’t seem impossible that he might be driven to that point. Nor, despite having recently called Obama’s Presidency the “worst in modern history,” does more bipartisan accommodation on his part appear out of reach. Other Republican senators, among them John McCain and Rand Paul—and not only in their cranky moments—have demonstrated the same capacity, but there has not been much to show for it.","2085","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/after-the-v-e-day-cheering-stopped-arthur-vandenbergs-legacy"
"Years after he left public life, Dean Acheson, Truman’s Secretary of State, viewed Vandenberg as someone capable of rising to a great occasion, doing so in a time when no one else in his party appeared willing to assume that role. The nation, Acheson wrote, would always be grateful to Vandenberg for “the service of bringing together in support of a foreign policy, dictated by the necessity of events, an administration which could carry it out and an opposition which could have prevented it from doing so.” That’s a pretty noble accomplishment—something for Corker, now a key member of the opposition, to think about.","2086","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/after-the-v-e-day-cheering-stopped-arthur-vandenbergs-legacy"

"For the conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts, Jr., wrote, “Our country has changed” since the statute became law fifty years ago. Devices that once blocked minorities’ access to the ballot, like the voter fees known as poll taxes, had been outlawed for more than forty years. The percentages of whites and minorities who register to vote and then go to the polls are approaching parity in the South and other parts of the country where, half a century ago, they were far apart. It is no longer necessary, Roberts went on, for the federal government to pre-approve any proposed changes to election laws in states with records of entrenched discrimination, as the statute had required since 1965.","2088","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"For the moderate liberals, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg responded that pre-approval, or pre-clearance, was still necessary to “facilitate completion of the impressive gains thus far made” against discrimination that kept blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities defined by race or color from voting and to “guard against back sliding.” The tactics that are used today to limit the voting power of minorities, like racial gerrymandering and the adoption of at-large voting districts, are more subtle than the devices that blocked access to voting half a century ago, Ginsburg wrote. But these second-generation barriers cut “down the right to vote as certainly as denial of access to the ballot.”","2089","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"The Roberts view reflects what the Harvard historian Alexander Keyssar, in “The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States,” called the “triumphalist presumption: a deeply embedded, yet virtually unspoken, notion that the history of suffrage is the history of gradual, inevitable reform and progress.” The Ginsburg view takes into account what Keyssar described as cycles of gain and loss in the right to vote—“a history of both expansion and contraction, of inclusion and exclusion, of shifts in direction and momentum at different places and at different times.”","2090","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"Keyssar documented why Ginsburg is correct. In his authoritative and prize-winning account, he explained, “Our history is complex, at times contradictory, befitting a nation that began as a republic that tolerated slavery. The evolution of democracy rarely followed a straight path, and it always has been accompanied by profound antidemocratic currents.”","2091","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"The latest expression of these currents are strict voter-I.D. laws, which allow a voter to exercise his right to vote only if he presents a government-issued photo ID or another designated form of identification, like a utility bill or a bank statement. These laws are now in effect in ten states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures—in southern states like Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee, and in Republican strongholds like Arizona and Kansas. A state court has struck down the laws in three other states, one state agreed to soften its law at the insistence of the Justice Department in a pre-clearance process, and one state’s law is scheduled to go into effect next year.","2092","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"

"The type of fraud they supposedly guard against is impersonation, when a would-be voter pretends to be someone else. This fraud, Keyssar reported, “is exceedingly rare”—especially compared with voter fraud in absentee balloting, which is abundant yet largely unaddressed. There were no documented cases of voter impersonation in the history of Indiana when, a decade ago, the state legislature passed its strict photo-I.D. law, with every Republican and not one Democrat voting for it.

Strict voter-I.D. laws, he wrote two years ago in his book “Reflections on Judging,” are “now widely regarded as a means of voter suppression rather than of fraud prevention.” In a dissent last October about another I.D.-law case, he added that the “net effect of such requirements is to impede voting by people easily discouraged from voting, most of whom probably lean Democratic.” A group of political scientists wrote last year in Political Research Quarterly that Republican-backed voter-I.D. laws “mobilize the base and champion electoral reforms that incidentally may demobilize Democratic supporters.”","2095","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"In 2012, The Government Accountability Office found that the strict voter-I.D. laws in Kansas and Tennessee had reduced voter turnout from 2008 to 2012 by approximately two to three per cent. The Brennan Center reported that, in 2014, voter-I.D. laws may have been factors in the election of Republicans to the U.S. Senate in North Carolina and to the Governor’s office in Florida and Kansas. Michael Waldman, the president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, told the Times, “There had not been this many restrictive voting laws in the states since the Jim Crow era.”","2096","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"In 2011, the Texas Legislature passed a strict photo-I.D. law, even though, in the decade before the law went into effect, only two cases of voter-impersonation fraud in the state had yielded convictions. Last October, the federal district judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi, Texas, struck down the law, holding that, in ostensibly addressing a “negligible” problem, the Texas law “creates an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote, has an impermissible discriminatory effect against Hispanics and African-Americans, and was imposed with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose” and that, in addition, it “constitutes an unconstitutional poll tax.” Ramos emphasized that voting restrictions are just one facet of the racial discrimination that has “permeated all aspects of life in Texas”—“in education, employment, housing, and transportation, which are the natural result of long and systematic racial discrimination.” She also underscored that the voter-I.D. law is just one of the forms of bullying that minorities face when they go to vote, which “poll watchers who dress in law enforcement-style clothing for an intimidating effect.”","2097","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"These efforts “to suppress minority voting” stretch back to “the early days of Texas,” Ramos wrote. From 1895 to 1944, the state used all-white primaries to disenfranchise minority voters. From 1905 to 1970, the state used literacy restrictions to keep blacks who had been enslaved or had limited opportunities for education in the Jim Crow South from voting. From 1902 to 1966, the state required that voters pay to vote, which, Ramos made clear, “was intended to, and had the effect of, suppressing the African-American vote.” Even more important, “In each instance, the Texas Legislature relied on the justification that its discriminatory measures were necessary to combat voter fraud,” as it now has with its voter-I.D. law.","2098","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"
"This week, by a vote of 3-0, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which includes Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, decided the state’s appeal of the judgment in the trial court.

"The Fifth Circuit agreed that Texas’s law “has a discriminatory effect in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,” overturned the holding that the law “is a poll tax,” and, most significantly, ordered Ramos to reconsider her holding that the law “was enacted with a racially discriminatory purpose.” She must reconsider the question by asking “not whether legislators were aware of” the law’s “racially discriminatory effect, but whether the law was passed because of that disparate impact.” And, as the Supreme Court had required in its 2013 ruling, among other decisions, the Fifth Circuit wrote that she must do so by focussing on “relatively recent history, not long-past history.”","2100","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"

Stone has written, the average age of the Justices who have retired in the past half century is seventy-five. Four of the current Justices are older than that.

Republicans have used the pretext of protecting the security and integrity of elections to suppress the ranks of Democratic voters, while Democrats have sought to increase the ranks of voters. More significantly, Republicans have seen voting rights as an area of constitutional law in which they should take a stand against race-based decision-making. Democrats have viewed those laws and rights as areas in which they must remain vigilant about the continuing effects of racial and ethnic discrimination, which, in the past year, has been viscerally evident in Ferguson, Missouri, in Charleston, South Carolina, and in countless other communities.","2104","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-limited-victory-for-voting-rights-in-texas"

"A remarkable thing almost happened to the two-party system in the summer of ’44: Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic President, about to be nominated for a fourth term, began a political flirtation with Wendell Willkie, the businessman Republican he’d defeated four years earlier, with the idea of forming a joint venture. No matter that, in 1940, Willkie had criticized the slowness of the economic recovery and, as Hitler’s Germany overran Europe, what he saw as American unreadiness. The two candidates had mostly agreed on big questions—above all, on sending military aid to Great Britain. Willkie’s sharpest criticism of F.D.R. focussed on his quest for a third term, a break with a two-term tradition that dated back to George Washington. “The doctrine of one man’s indispensability is a new doctrine for this country,” the Times editorial page noted, not approvingly, when the newspaper endorsed Willkie.","July 28, 2015","2124","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"As is still true today, party labels did not always mean what they seemed to mean. Willkie, a former Democrat, was never completely trusted by his party, though he had more in common with his 1944 primary competitors—Thomas E. Dewey, the New York governor; Harold Stassen, the former “boy governor” of Minnesota; even General Douglas MacArthur, the Pacific commander, whose vanity overcame his soldierly responsibilities—than many Republicans in this year’s free-for-all have with each other. Willkie quit the race in April, after Dewey won the Wisconsin primary, and Roosevelt was soon informed that Willkie was unhappy about being beaten by conservatives. More than that, F.D.R. told his special counsel, Samuel I. Rosenman, Willkie had been mulling “the possibility of a new setup in American politics.” Roosevelt, as Rosenman wrote in a memoir of his years at the White House, added that some Democrats “are out for my scalp, too”—referring to anti-New Deal sentiment in Texas and the South. “I think the time has come for the Democratic Party to get rid of its reactionary elements. … and to attract the liberals in the Republican Party. Willkie is the leader of those liberals.” It would have to be a long-term project, the President continued, “But we can do it in 1948, and we can start building it up right after the election this fall.” Roosevelt said that “Willkie and I together” could form this new party.","2125","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"Roosevelt dispatched Rosenman to New York, where, secret-agent-style, he visited Willkie’s hotel suite and told him that Roosevelt “wants to team up with you.” Willkie was receptive and, on July 13th, even as F.D.R. was getting ready to ask Senator Harry Truman to be his running mate, he dictated a letter to Willkie saying, “I want to talk to you about the future, even the somewhat distant future, and in regard to the foreign relations problems of the immediate future.” This was a hard-to-keep secret. A headline reading “Willkie Asked by Roosevelt to Meet with Him” appeared in the August 11th edition of the New York Herald Tribune, followed by more stories, all suggesting that one topic would be the direction of the postwar world. Willkie’s initial reaction was “No comment,” while Roosevelt was at his most evasive, at first denying that the letter existed—which prompted an August 21st apology to Willkie—and then admitting that it was genuine. Willkie wrote, but never mailed, a letter to F.D.R. saying, “If it is agreeable with you, I would prefer postponement of any such talk until after the November election.” (Willkie was feeling pressure to support Dewey, his party’s nominee.)","2126","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"But this political serial ended abruptly when Willkie, on October 8th, died of a strep infection that spread to his heart. He was fifty-two. Six months later, Roosevelt, too, was dead, and so was his hybrid-party plot.","2127","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"It’s hard, though, to resist the thought that a new political force—a fusion party—might have been born that summer, that a Roosevelt-Willkie alliance, drawing on the moderate impulses of the major parties, might have planted roots and become a counterweight to an era like the present, when men and women professing all sorts of highly personal beliefs keep leaping into the Presidential race. Forget Donald Trump; just consider the “mainstream” Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, who announced his candidacy by saying, “We defunded Planned Parenthood and enacted pro-life legislation. We passed castle doctrine and concealed carry.” That sounded like a man running as a divider, not a uniter.","2128","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"A fusion party would accentuate coöperation, an urge present in 2004, when the Democrat John Kerry apparently asked the Republican John McCain to be his running mate. McCain said no, but the race would have been enthralling. President Eisenhower, in private, sometimes sounded off about breaking away from his party, and, when he contemplated dropping Richard Nixon from the ticket, in 1956, he considered asking the Ohio governor, Frank Lausche, a Catholic Democrat, to take his place. (Under very different circumstances, Abraham Lincoln, in 1864, took the border-state Democrat Andrew Johnson as a running mate.) Some possible alliances have gone unrealized—or unrecognized—because of party labels. On foreign policy, for instance, Hillary Clinton has often had more in common with the Republican Senator Lindsey Graham than with the Democrats Bernie Sanders or Jim Webb or, for that matter, Barack Obama.","2129","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"And, if it would have been too much to hope that, after the 2012 election, President Obama and a restless Mitt Romney could have discussed a centrist coalition, odd pairings can still happen.

"Certainly, if Willkie and Roosevelt had lived and followed through, their venture might have seemed far-fetched. But a short-lived alliance might have demonstrated that in a divided nation—even one with sixteen Republican Presidential contenders running wild—there might be a path to that calmer center, where, polls suggest, most people still want to live.","2131","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is a conservative Republican. Senator Barbara Boxer is a liberal Democrat. So the fact that they’ve worked together to come up with a plan to fund highway spending for the next three years might seem like a good thing, a rare moment of bipartisanship in a Congress riven by ideological hostility. And, in fact, you could see the thousand-page bill they’ve produced as, in the words of the Times, “real progress,” except for one thing: their complicated, jury-rigged plan is only necessary because of the continued refusal by Congress to embrace the obvious, economically sensible solution to highway funding, namely raising the gas tax.","July 24, 2015","2132","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"The federal gas tax is, as it should be, a key source of funding for highway spending. Currently, the tax is 18.4 cents per gallon. The problem is that it has been 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. And since the cost of building and, above all, repairing roads has risen substantially in the past twenty-two years, because of inflation and because the federal highway system is deteriorating, while the revenue from the gas tax hasn’t risen nearly as much, Congress has had to find other ways to make up the difference. In recent times, those fixes have all been short term, which is why the Boxer-McConnell plan, which would fund spending for three entire years, seems to some like a real improvement.","2133","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"The problem is that the funding mechanisms the plan relies on are as gimmicky and haphazard as ever. The bill would raise money by, among other things, lowering the dividend rate paid to banks in the Federal Reserve system, raising certain customs fees, increasing collection rates on unpaid taxes, and selling off a hundred and one million barrels of oil from the country’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Some of these may, on their own, be reasonable ideas—although, if you’re going to have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve, you should probably only sell oil from it for strategic reasons, not just because you want to raise some cash. But they are, for the most part, stopgap measures, meaning that Congress won’t be able to rely on them the next time around. And, from an economic perspective, paying for operating expenses by selling off assets is not a good way to manage your money.","2134","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"What’s especially infuriating about the bill is that we already have, in the gas tax, an ideal tool for raising money to pay for highway repairs. It’s a user tax: if you don’t drive you don’t pay it, and if you drive less it costs you less. It helps to correct, at least mildly, a clear market failure: people who drive don’t pay the full costs of the externalities they create, including the wear and tear they put on roads, the pollution they emit, and the congestion they help produce. And while certain taxes disincentivize, to some degree, things we like (such as work or investment), the gas tax, by raising the cost of driving, gets us less of things we don’t like (pollution, carbon emissions, and road wear). That’s why even conservative economists, like Gregory Mankiw, have been ardent advocates of gasoline taxes. This is also an excellent moment to raise the gas tax, since oil and gas prices are so much lower than they were, making any price increase at the pump more palatable to drivers.","2135","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"Members of Congress have tried to get Washington to do the logical thing. Last year, Republican Senator Bob Corker and Democratic Senator Chris Murphy worked together on a bill that would have increased the gas tax by twelve cents over two years and then indexed it to inflation, in an attempt to insure that it kept pace with infrastructure needs. The plan wasn’t perfect (in order to make the hike palatable to conservatives, it made some temporary tax breaks permanent), but it was well considered, and would have made the value of today’s tax roughly equivalent to what it was in 1993. But the bill never even came up for a vote.","2136","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"The fundamental problem, of course, is that raising taxes, no matter how economically sensible those taxes might be, is anathema to a huge swath of the Republican Party. (It’s hardly a coincidence that the last gas-tax increase came in 1993, just before the G.O.P.’s Contract with America transformed Congress.) And Republican resistance, in turn, makes it harder for Democrats to vote for tax increases, at least those that affect ordinary citizens, because they know that Republican challengers will use their votes against them.","2137","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"
"Indeed, the refusal of Congress to raise the gas tax is the ultimate expression of how reflexive and irrational the resistance to taxes has become. Opposition to higher income taxes has some theoretical justification: higher marginal rates discourage people from working more and investing. Seen in one light, they’re a penalty for success. But no such argument exists against the gas tax: all it does, in essence, is ask drivers to pay for the roads they use. It’s not even fair to say that keeping this tax at its current level is a check on big government, since most federal highway spending now goes toward rebuilding and repairing roads—maintenance that even conservatives recognize we must do.","2138","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/raise-the-gas-tax-already"

"Trump’s fear of Asians taking advantage of Americans, though not as well known as his suspicion of Mexican criminals, has a long history. In 1987, he ran an ad in three newspapers, calling for “a little backbone” in U.S. foreign policy. “For decades,” it said, “Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States.… Let’s not let our great country be laughed at anymore.” An aide at the time, John R. O’Donnell, later wrote that the ad was “tailored to blue-collar resentments over the trade deficit and to rally Middle America against the machinations, real or supposed, of our foreign allies.” In 2012, Trump updated his view of Asians with a comment about his belief that climate change is a hoax. He tweeted, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”","2147","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-doctrine-we-want-deal"
"Trump’s range as a performer is often described as vaudevillian, and that description should be applied to his world view as well. He often appears to be reënacting conversations about other countries that took place a century or two ago. When he talks about Mexico “sending people that have lots of problems,” including drugs, crime, and “rapists,” he echoes Francis Walker, the administrator of the 1870 and 1880 censuses, who described new arrivals as “beaten men from beaten races, representing the worst failures in the struggle for existence.” Or Senator Pat McCarran, the Nevada Democrat, who told his colleagues in 1953 that they must be wary of “hardcore, indigestible blocs which have not become integrated into the American way of life, but which, on the contrary are its deadly enemies.” McCarran warned, “Today, as never before, untold millions are storming our gates for admission, and those gates are cracking under the strain.” The quota system that he favored remained in place until 1965.","2148","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-doctrine-we-want-deal"
"Since Monday, when I published a piece on Trump’s popularity with white nationalists and anti-immigration activists, events have moved rapidly. At a news conference in Dubuque, Trump ejected Jorge Ramos, the most influential Latino news anchor, when Ramos tried to ask a question without Trump’s approval. “Sit down. Sit down. Sit down,” Trump scolded him, before signalling to his security team, who forcibly removed Ramos from the room. Trump said, “Go back to Univision.” While Ramos was in exile in the hallway, a well-dressed man in a suit jacket, wearing a Donald Trump sticker, approached Ramos (who is a U.S. citizen), and said, “This is not about you. Get out of my country.” Trump, ever alert to when he is losing a room, later permitted Ramos to rejoin the group, and they had an awkward debate.","2149","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-doctrine-we-want-deal"
"A few days earlier, Trump received generous praise from David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. Though Duke was initially skeptical of Trump, he had become a believer. “Trump, he’s really going all out. He’s saying what no other Republicans have said, few conservatives say. And he’s also gone to point where he says it’s not just illegal immigration, it’s legal immigration,” Duke said on his radio show. He urged his listeners to support Trump because it was a “great opportunity.” “So he’s certainly the best of the lot. And he’s certainly somebody that we should get behind in terms, ya know, raising the image of this thing.” When Trump was asked, on Bloomberg television, about the support that he has received from Duke and other white nationalists, he said, “I don’t need his endorsement; I certainly wouldn’t want his endorsement.” Asked whether he would repudiate it, Trump said, “Sure, I would if that would make you feel better.”","2150","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-doctrine-we-want-deal"
"By now, it’s well known that Trump’s strategy of emphasizing racial and ethnic divisions contradicts the way that the Republican establishment had hoped to run the 2016 race, but, as Trump’s lead has grown—defying predictions that he would peter out—disagreement from within the Party has given way to a kind of despair among traditional Republicans. In the Washington Post this week, George Will wrote, “Every sulfurous belch from the molten interior of the volcanic Trump phenomenon injures the chances of a Republican presidency.” Will ran through a possible arithmetic of defeat: in 2012, Mitt Romney lost non-white voters by sixty-three points. He had relied almost exclusively on white voters—they were ninety per cent of his support—and next year the white percentage of the electorate will be two points smaller than in 2012. Will wrote, “Romney did even slightly worse among Asian Americans—the fastest-growing minority—than among Hispanics.”","2151","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-doctrine-we-want-deal"
"In returning to a primordial American politics, Trump has fortified his primary campaign and attracted the admiration of Duke and others who hear in his message a return to the past. In the next fifteen months, that approach may collide with the arithmetic of modern American politics, and Trump will face a strategic decision. But, for the moment, he remains consistent, and faithful to the political credo of Roger Stone, the former Nixon aide who has advised Trump over the years (and who left the campaign earlier this month). Stone likes to say, “Hate is a stronger motivator than love.”","2152","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-doctrine-we-want-deal"
"After living in this country for almost thirty years, I confess I find it hard to write about gun massacres. They are just too familiar, and too depressing. An alienated post-adolescent, almost always white, gets a gun, or guns, and exorcises his demons by killing as many people as he can. Then follows an equally predictable media outpouring, with round-the-clock coverage on cable, lengthy accounts in the serious papers, harrowing profiles of the victims, and why-oh-why editorials aplenty. Flags are flown at half-mast. Politicians, especially those who represent the area in which the massacre occurs, say that something needs to be done about gun control.","June 22, 2015","2153","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"
"Nothing much happens, of course, and, after a while, we move onto the next incident. Back in the nineteen-eighties and -nineties, for some reason, fast-food restaurants and post offices were the sites of some of the deadliest incidents. Then came a series of school massacres, including at Columbine, where Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed twelve high-school students and a teacher, and at Virginia Tech, where Seung-Hui Cho killed thirty-two people before taking his own life. In Newtown, Connecticut, in December, 2012, a twenty-year-old misfit named Adam Lanza murdered twenty elementary schoolchildren, and six of their teachers, before taking his own life, too. Then there were the 2012 shootings in Aurora, Colorado: twelve people gunned down at a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises.”","2154","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"
"Which leads us to Charleston, and the latest atrocity. In this case, of course, we have the complicating and insidious factor of racism to consider. The suspected shooter, Dylann Roof, didn’t choose the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church at random. The evidence suggests that his alienation took the form of embracing white-supremacy claptrap, and that he wanted to kill black people specifically. When Roof reached Emanuel A.M.E., which is one of the oldest and best-known black churches in the country, on Wednesday evening, the members of a prayer group he encountered were so nice to him that he hesitated to go through with his “mission,” he has reportedly told police. Sadly, he managed to overcome his humane impulses.","2155","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"
"President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and many others, including my colleagues David Remnick and Jelani Cobb, have pointed out how this tragedy reminds us that, in Obama’s words, “We don’t have to look far to see that racism and bigotry, hate and intolerance, are still all too alive in our world.” Did we really need reminding, though? The United States was partly built on racial cleansing and slavery: racism, and racist violence, have long been a part of its social fabric, as have efforts to root out these evils and eradicate them.","2156","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"

But the historic battle against racism and racial subordination shouldn’t distract from the other pressing policy issue at hand. On the death certificates of eighty-seven-year-old Susie Jackson, seventy-year-old Ethel Lance, and the rest of the victims, the cause of death won’t be listed as racism: it will be gunshot wounds. Roof’s despicable views didn’t kill anybody: the weapon he used was a .45 mm Glock handgun, which, according to the police, he bought at a local gun store.","2157","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"

"Americans have always owned firearms, but the numbers have been increasing. Fifty years ago, according to government estimates, there were about a hundred million privately owned guns, or roughly one for every two people in the country. By 2009, the number of guns had more than tripled, to three hundred and ten million: one hundred and fourteen million handguns, one hundred and ten million rifles, and eighty-six million shotguns. Since many more guns are sold every day, it’s probably safe to assume that the over-all number is now closer to three hundred and fifty million. That’s more than one for every resident of the United States, the highest number, per capita, of any country in the world.","2159","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"

"To his credit, Obama told the mayors’ conference, “I refuse to act as if this is the new normal.” And Hillary Clinton, in a speech at the same venue on Saturday, echoed the President’s remarks, saying, “We must tackle this challenge with urgency and conviction.” But does anybody really think that will happen? After the Newtown massacre, the White House tried to persuade Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and to expand background checks for gun purchases.

(Since 1996, when Australia banned rapid-fire rifles, made it more difficult to buy handguns, and launched a national gun-buyback program, the number of gun deaths has fallen sharply, and there have been no mass murders by firearm.)","2162","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"
"In this policy area, as in others, the American political system has largely lost the capacity to learn and react. The Republican Party is in league with the National Rifle Association, one of whose board members reportedly suggested that Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who died in the Charleston shootings, was partly to blame for the massacre because, as a state senator, he had voted against concealed-carry laws. The Democratic Party, although it contains many individuals who support gun control and have campaigned for it, remains wary of alienating rural voters. Hillary Clinton, for example, while calling for “common-sense gun reforms that keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the violently unstable,” was also careful to say “gun ownership is part of the fabric of a lot of law-abiding communities.” She added that reforms could be introduced “while respecting responsible gun owners.”","2163","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"
"There is good reason for this caution. In 1993 and 1994, Bill Clinton’s administration pushed through two significant gun-control measures, including a ban on assault weapons, sparking an N.R.A.-led backlash that some Democratic leaders blamed for the Republicans’ sweeping victory in the 1994 midterm elections.

"A part of the Patriot Act that the National Security Agency relied on to collect bulk intelligence on Americans expired just after midnight on Monday—and that’s just fine. This country is not any less safe; it may be a little more so, if one factors in the advantages of forcing the N.S.A. to think rationally about the benefits and the harms of what it’s doing, and how it should expend its resources. And Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, deserves some credit for that. The only pity is that the measure, known as Section 215, won’t simply stay dead.","June 1, 2015","2166","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-mitch-mcconnell-proved-rand-paul-right"
"The Senate will almost certainly pass some version of a compromise replacement bill, known as the U.S.A. Freedom Act, in the next day or two, which will allow the collection of data to continue, with new limits. A version of the Freedom Act has already passed the House 338-88, and it has certain qualities that recommend it. It was crafted, in large part, by legislators, like Patrick Leahy, of Vermont, who care strongly about civil liberties and have acted with good will to find a bipartisan way to balance those concerns with national security. (Paul and others who prefer the expiration of Section 215 argue that the new bill still gives the government too much leeway in searching phone records, which would be retained by private companies.) And yet the behavior of the Republicans in the Senate, particularly of the Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in the past few weeks, has not only been an insult to the efforts of Leahy and others, it has thrown the premise of the compromise—that with some tweaks, the N.S.A. can be trusted with broad access to Americans’ phone records and metadata—into doubt. Paul may have stage-managed the measure’s expiration, but it was McConnell who forfeited Section 215 of the Patriot Act.","2167","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-mitch-mcconnell-proved-rand-paul-right"
"The Freedom Act could have passed more than a week ago, leaving no gap in the N.S.A.’s capabilities, if McConnell had not pushed, instead, for what he insisted on calling a “clean” renewal of Section 215. (Two other provisions had June 1st sunsets, too, but they are rarely used.) McConnell did so utterly unchastened by a Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling last month, which said that the law did not actually allow the N.S.A. to do the things that the agency did in its name. Section 215 says that the N.S.A. can, after going to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court, compel the production of “tangible things” that are “relevant” to an “authorized investigation.” As the Second Circuit found, the N.S.A. treated the entire universe of American phone records as one tangible thing, broadened relevance to the point of meaninglessness, and ignored the limitations that the law placed on what counted as a specific investigation, to the point that “the government effectively argues that there is only one enormous ‘anti-terrorism’ investigation, and that any records that might ever be of use in developing any aspect of that investigation are relevant to the overall counterterrorism effort.” In other words, the N.S.A., despite having enormous legitimate powers, was breaking the law. McConnell seemed outraged that anyone should suggest that it stop.","2168","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-mitch-mcconnell-proved-rand-paul-right"
"McConnell also seemed oblivious to the public’s unhappiness about bulk collection, the government’s own conclusion that the practice had not actually foiled any terrorist plots, and to arguments from his own party’s libertarian faction. Paul had argued that the language of the Freedom Act is still too expansive and leaves potential for abuse that Congress lacks the will to prevent—and McConnell has done his best to prove him right.","2169","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-mitch-mcconnell-proved-rand-paul-right"
"And so, just before the Memorial Day break, when the Senate voted on whether the Freedom Act could come to the floor—the kind of move that requires sixty votes in our strange Senate—McConnell pressured just enough senators to make it fail, 57-42. His preference, a two-month extension of Section 215, then failed by a much wider margin, 45-54. McConnell, who is known as an expert vote-counter and parliamentarian, was uncharacteristically dismayed. He seems to have thought that fear alone would force the renewal he wanted. Into the early morning hours on Saturday of the holiday weekend, he tried a series of shorter extensions—a week, four days, two days, one day. They all failed. He then called the Senate back this past Sunday, but, given Senate rules, that wasn’t enough time. That is why Section 215 expired. Paul didn’t even need to try hard to push things past the June 1st deadline.","2170","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-mitch-mcconnell-proved-rand-paul-right"
"Speaking from the floor on Sunday evening, Paul said that the Freedom Act would pass and that, despite his doubts, he would “look for silver linings.” Earlier, John McCain, one of Paul’s strongest Republican critics on national security, tried to use procedural maneuvers to prevent Paul from speaking. According to the Times, McCain later said that Paul, who is running for the Republican Presidential nomination, “would be the worst candidate we could put forward.” (One of McCain’s allies, Lindsey Graham, who announced his own candidacy on Monday, was recently seen on camera rolling his eyes while Paul spoke.) But for all his grandstanding—he has been selling anti-N.S.A. T-shirts, and tweeting up a “Stand with Rand” storm—Paul had sensible things to say in that speech. One of them was a reminder that, if the government has suspicions, it has plenty of ways to get a real warrant without collecting everyone’s phone records: “I think we spend so much money on people for whom there is no suspicion that we don’t have enough time and money left to go after the people who would actually harm us.” He added, “The people who argue that the world will end and we will be overrun by jihadists tonight are trying to use fear. They want to take just a little bit of your liberty but they get it by making you afraid.” Ron Wyden, the Democratic senator from Oregon, who has been a leader in trying to get Congress to fulfill its intelligence-oversight responsibilities, picked up on the theme of trust in his own speech on Sunday evening, in which he pointed out that James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, lied to him in a Senate hearing when asked about bulk collection—even though Wyden had told him in advance that he’d ask the question.","2171","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-mitch-mcconnell-proved-rand-paul-right"
"McConnell used his time on the floor on Sunday to rail against a supposed “campaign of demagoguery and disinformation.” The Times reported that he was looking at Paul; that was the wrong direction. And McConnell is not done yet. He said that he hoped to introduce some “modest amendments” to the Freedom Act in the next day or two. But enough compromises have already been made, and the only amendments there ought to be room for are ones that McConnell wouldn’t like.","2172","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-mitch-mcconnell-proved-rand-paul-right"

Didion was thirty-two, and she had been a magazine writer for eleven years. She and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, had moved from New York City to Southern California three years earlier, and, in March, 1966, they had adopted a daughter and named her Quintana Roo, after an area on the Yucatán Peninsula.","2174","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"In the summer of 1967, the Haight was a magnet for people looking for a place to do drugs. Didion hung out mainly with runaways and acidheads. She met people like Deadeye, a dealer, and his old lady, Gerry, who wrote poetry but gave it up after her guitar was stolen. Deadeye tells Didion he is looking for a ride to New York City. She shows him a sign offering a ride to Chicago. He asks her where Chicago is.","2175","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"She meets Jeff and his fifteen-year-old girlfriend, Debbie, who has run away from home. Didion asks them about their plans. “We’re just gonna let it all happen,” Jeff says. She meets Steve, who says, “I found love on acid. But I lost it. Now I’m finding it again. With nothing but grass.” She meets Vicki, who dropped out of Laguna High, “because I had mono,” and followed the Grateful Dead to San Francisco. She meets a Hare Krishna named Michael, whose brother-in-law explains that “if everybody chanted there wouldn’t be any problem with the police or anybody,” and a five-year-old named Susan, who takes LSD and informs Didion that she is in High Kindergarten.","2176","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Didion got plenty of material, but she had no idea how to make a story out of it. Under deadline pressure, she decided to create a verbal montage of scenes from the Haight. She chose a phrase from Yeats’s “The Second Coming” for the title, and, in September, “The Hippie Generation: Slouching Towards Bethlehem,” with photographs by Streshinsky, was a cover story in The Saturday Evening Post. An editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Henry Robbins, encouraged Didion to turn the piece into a book. Nine months later, “Slouching Towards Bethlehem” appeared as the title essay in her first collection of nonfiction. It is the phrase everyone knows Joan Didion by.","2177","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"“Slouching Towards Bethlehem” is a classic of what was later named the New Journalism. Didion used a vernacular voice that mimicked the laid-back aimlessness of Haight speech. More New Journalistically, she adopted a Haight personality. She blended into the scene; she internalized its confusions. She gave readers the sense that she was putting herself at risk by reporting this story, that she might get sucked into the Haight abyss and become a lost soul, too:","2178","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"“Slouching Towards Bethlehem” is not a very good piece of standard journalism, though. Didion did no real interviewing or reporting. The hippies she tried to have conversations with said “Groovy” a lot and recycled flower-power clichés. The cops refused to talk to her. So did the Diggers, who ran a sort of hippie welfare agency in the Haight. The Diggers accused Didion of “media poisoning,” by which they meant coverage in the mainstream press designed to demonize the counterculture.","2179","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"The Diggers were not wrong. The mainstream press (such as the places Didion wrote for, places like The Saturday Evening Post) was conflicted about the hippie phenomenon. It had journalistic sex appeal. Hippies were photogenic, free love and the psychedelic style made good copy, and the music was uncontroversially great. Around the time Didion was in San Francisco, the Beatles released “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” and soon afterward the Monterey Pop Festival was held. D. A. Pennebaker’s film of the concert came out in 1968 and introduced many people to Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and Ravi Shankar. Everybody loved Ravi Shankar.","2180","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Ravi Shankar did not use drugs, however. The drugs were the sketchy part of the story, LSD especially. People thought that LSD made teen-age girls jump off bridges. By the time Didion’s article came out, Time had run several stories about “the dangerous LSD craze.” And a lot of Didion’s piece is about LSD, people on acid saying “Wow” while their toddlers set fire to the living room. The cover of the Post was a photograph of a slightly sinister man, looking like a dealer, in a top hat and face paint—an evil Pied Piper. That photograph was what the Diggers meant by “media poisoning.”","2181","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"There was nothing unusual about finding, at the core of a life-style trend of which the use of controlled substances is an integral feature, a group of full-time dropouts. Seven years earlier, the sociologist Ned Polsky had gone to Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side to study the Beats. He found the same mixture Didion found in San Francisco: runaways and people who, when he interviewed them, rehearsed the Beat mantras. Having a job is selling out; politics are a drag; and so on. What they all had in common, Polsky concluded, was drugs. Only a small proportion were addicts, but a Beat’s day was basically about buying and taking drugs.","2182","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"And there weren’t that many of them. Most of the people who walked around the Village looking like Beats in 1960, like most of the people who walked around San Francisco or Berkeley or Cambridge looking like hippies in 1967, were weekend dropouts. They were contingent rebels. They put on the costumes; they went to the concerts and got high; and then they went back to school or back to work. It was a life style, not a life.","2183","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Even if you factored in the contingent leisure force, the hippie counterculture was small. The sensationalized press coverage of the period has left a permanent image of the late nineteen-sixties as a time when everyone was tripping or stoned. In 1967, when Didion’s article came out, only one per cent of college students reported having tried LSD. In 1969, only four per cent of adults said they had smoked marijuana. Recreational drug use soared in the nineteen-seventies, but the press was no longer interested. The whole thing had stopped being sexy.","2184","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Didion presented her article as an investigation into what she called “social hemorrhaging.” She suggested that what was going on in Haight-Ashbury was the symptom of some sort of national unravelling. But she knew that, at the level of “getting the story,” her piece was a failure. She could see, with the X-ray clarity she appears to have been born with, what was happening on the street; she could make her readers see it; but she couldn’t explain it.","2185","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"In the preface to the book, she noted that no one had understood the article. “I had never gotten a feedback so universally beside the point,” she wrote. A few years later, in a radio interview on KPFR, she blamed herself. “Usually on a piece there comes a day when you know you never have to do another interview,” she said. “You can go home, you’ve gotten it. Well, that day never came on that piece. . . . That piece is a blank for me still.”","2186","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"People liked the collection “Slouching Towards Bethlehem” (though it was not, at first, a big seller). People were intrigued by “Play It as It Lays,” Didion’s second novel, which came out two years later (though it got some hostile reviews). Mainly, though, everyone was fascinated by the authorial persona, the hypersensitive neurasthenic who drove a Corvette Sting Ray, the frail gamine with the migraine headaches and the dark glasses and the searchlight mind, the writer who seemed to know in her bones what readers were afraid to face, which is that the center no longer holds, the falcon cannot hear the falconer, the story line is broken.","2187","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Didion created the part—she was a master of the author photo—and she could have played it right up to the final curtain. But, after “Slouching Towards Bethlehem” and “Play It as It Lays,” she completely reassessed not only her practice as a journalist but her understanding of American life, her politics, and even the basis of her moral judgments. She decided she wanted to get what she had failed to get with the hippies. She wanted to get the story.","2188","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Tracy Daugherty’s “The Last Love Song” (St. Martin’s) is a biography of Joan Didion written partly in the style of Joan Didion, a style of ellipses, fragments, and refrains. This is not what you ideally want in a biography. The point of a biography is to reveal what’s behind the ellipses. Daugherty operated under difficulties, though. He was unable to persuade Didion to coöperate, and it’s obvious that many people close to Didion refused to talk to him as well.","2189","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"That doesn’t mean that he wasn’t thorough. He had access to Didion’s papers, housed at Berkeley, and a large amount of information was already out there. For someone with a reputation for being guarded and tongue-tied, Didion did a lot of promotion. She went on book tours and submitted to profiles. She did radio; she did television; she talked to Publishers Weekly. It added up.","2190","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"She also wrote obsessively about herself—not only in her memoirs, “The Year of Magical Thinking,” about the death of her husband, and “Blue Nights,” about the death of her daughter, but in reported pieces and in personal essays, which she started producing almost as soon as she started publishing. (She eventually got bored with the genre and gave it up. “I didn’t want to become Miss Lonelyhearts,” she said.) She once delivered a lecture called “Why I Write.” She began by pointing out that the sound you hear in those three words is “I, I, I.”","2191","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Much of “The Last Love Song” is therefore an intelligent and elegant paraphrase of things Didion has already said or written. There is some sniping from the odd acquaintance or estranged friend, but revelations weren’t in the cards. The “real” Didion Daugherty shows us is just the obverse of the image: ambitious (hence the anxiety), controlling (hence the brittleness), and chic (hence the Corvette).","2192","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"You could work up a dichotomy here, but it doesn’t get you very far. Didion and Dunne made an excellent living as Hollywood screenwriters and script doctors. They lived in Malibu and then in Brentwood Park, O.J.’s old nabe, and were part of the Hollywood talent élite. Dunne’s brother Dominick was a producer for movies and television; their nephew was Griffin Dunne, the actor. And Didion knows something about fashion and style—she began her career at Mademoiselle and Vogue. But there’s no reason that any of this should be incompatible with one day writing about death squads in El Salvador.","2193","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"John Dunne was a gregarious man, a social drinker and a raconteur, and he and Didion worked up a sort of Penn and Teller routine. One sang, the other mostly didn’t. They rarely gave separate audiences. If you asked to speak to one, you almost invariably spoke to both, even on the telephone. “I was at first surprised that John Dunne sat through most of the interview and did nearly all the talking,” Susan Braudy wrote after interviewing Didion for Ms., in 1977. Didion’s explanation is that she isn’t a talker; she’s a writer. “I’m only myself in front of my typewriter,” she finally told Braudy. There is no reason to doubt this. The person we’re interested in is the person on the page.","2194","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"It’s a common mistake, in assessing Didion’s work, to interpret her sensibility as a reflection of the times—to imagine, as Daugherty puts it, that she has “always spoken for us.” That’s certainly not the way she has presented herself. In a column she started writing for Life in 1969, she introduced herself as “a woman who for some time now has felt radically separated from most of the ideas that seem to interest other people.” She’s not like us. She’s weird. That’s why we want to read her.","2195","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Didion came from a family of Republicans. She was born in Sacramento in 1934, a fifth-generation Californian. Her father started out in insurance, speculated in real estate, and ended up spending most of his career in the military, a very California trifecta. Turned down by Stanford, Didion attended Berkeley, in an era when campus life was socially conventional and politically dormant. In 1955, she won a guest editorship at Mademoiselle and spent a few months in New York City. A year later, she won a similar contest at Vogue, and she moved to New York in the fall of 1956 and began her magazine career there. Leaving home, she later said, “just seems part of your duty in life.”","2196","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Didion worked at Vogue for ten years. She continued to write for Mademoiselle, and, in 1960, she began contributing to National Review, William F. Buckley’s conservative magazine. She wrote pieces about John Wayne, her favorite movie star, and, in the 1964 Presidential election, she voted for Barry Goldwater. She adored Goldwater. It was hardly a surprise that she found Haight-Ashbury repugnant. Her editors at the Post understood perfectly how she would react. They designed the cover before she handed in the piece.","2197","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Didion’s transformation as a writer did not involve a conversion to the counterculture or to the New Left. She genuinely loathed the hippies, whom she associated with characters like Charles Manson, and she thought that the Black Panthers and the student radicals were both frightening and ridiculous. She found Jim Morrison kind of ridiculous, too. Polsky, in his study of the Beats, had dismissed the theory, endorsed by some social critics in the nineteen-fifties, that disaffected dropouts are potential recruits for authoritarian political movements. Didion never rejected that theory. She thinks that dropouts are symptoms of a dangerous social pathology.","2198","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"What changed was her understanding of where dropouts come from, of why people turn into runaways and acidheads and members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, why parents abandon their children on highway dividers, why Harlem teen-agers go rampaging through Central Park at night, why middle-class boys form “posses” and prey sexually on young girls—and, above all, why the press fixates on these stories.","2199","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Didion later said that her period of self-doubt began around 1966. “Everything I was taught seems beside the point,” she wrote in Life in 1969. “The point itself seems increasingly obscure.” She had said something similar in her piece about the hippies: “We had somehow neglected to tell these children the rules of the game we happened to be playing.”","2200","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Most readers would have had a hard time knowing exactly what rules she was talking about, or what “the point” was that everything seemed beside. She probably didn’t have a very clear idea herself. Her moment of insight came in 1971 or 1972, during a summer visit with Quintana, then five or six, to Old Sacramento, an area of the city reconstructed to look like downtown Sacramento, where Didion’s father’s great-grandfather owned a saloon, circa 1850.","2201","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"She began telling Quintana about all the ancestors who had once walked on those sidewalks, and then she remembered that Quintana was adopted. Quintana had no relationship to Old Sacramento and its sidewalks and saloons. And this thought made her realize, as she put it later, that, “in fact, I had no more attachment to this wooden sidewalk than Quintana did: it was no more than a theme, a decorative effect.” Looking back, she decided that this was the moment when the story she had grown up with—“the entire enchantment under which I had lived my life”—began to seem foreign.","2202","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Didion described the Old Sacramento episode in her book about California, “Where I Was From.” That book, with its grammatically pointed title (the phrase, of course, is “where I am from”), was published in 2003, but she had tried to write it thirty years earlier. She decided to wait until her parents were dead.","2203","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"She also changed her publishing venue. She began writing for The New York Review of Books in 1973, at first about the movies, but increasingly about politics. Her editor there, Robert Silvers, was one of the people not interviewed by Daugherty, and this leaves a major hole in the biography. For Silvers was the key figure in Didion’s journalistic transformation. Her books “Salvador” (1983), “Miami” (1987), and “Political Fictions” (2001) are all based on pieces she wrote for him.","2204","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"In 1988, after she and Dunne returned to New York, she began writing for The New Yorker as well. Daugherty didn’t interview her editors there, including Robert Gottlieb and Tina Brown. Yet many of the essays in the nonfiction collection “After Henry” (1992) and important parts of “Where I Was From” were first published in The New Yorker. (Full disclosure: you are reading this piece in The New Yorker.)","2205","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"“Where I Was From” is the central book in Didion’s career. The subject is American self-deception. The California version has to do with what Didion calls “the crossing story as origin myth.” This is the legend of the pioneers in covered wagons who trekked across the Rockies and settled the state, the men and women who made the desert bloom—Didion’s ancestors. It’s a story about independence, self-reliance, and loyalty to the group. Growing up, Didion had been taught that for the generations that followed the challenge was to keep those virtues alive. There was always a new wave of settlers ready to sell out the pioneer spirit.","2206","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"After the Old Sacramento moment, Didion came to see the whole pioneer mystique as bogus from the start. The cultivation of California was not the act of rugged pioneers, she decided. It was the act of the federal government, which built the dams and the weirs and the railroads that made the state economically exploitable, public money spent on behalf of private business. Didion called it “the subsidized monopolization” of the state.","2207","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Big business had always run California. First, there were the ranches, then the corporate agribusinesses, and then, after the Second World War, the aeronautics industry, Boeing and Douglas, Lockheed and Rockwell. Defense contracts and government-funded infrastructure kept these businesses flush. Everyone else was a pawn in the game, living in a fantasy of hardy individualism and cheering on economic growth that benefitted only a few.","2208","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Social stability was a mirage. It lasted only as long as the going was good for business. When conditions got cheaper elsewhere or defense contracts shrank or mergers became appealing, the plants were shut down, workers were laid off, and the middle-class dream vanished in the smog. “This process,” Didion wrote, “one of trading the state to outside owners in exchange for their (it now seems) entirely temporary agreement to enrich us . . . had in fact begun at the time Americans first entered the state, took what they could, and, abetted by the native weakness for boosterism, set about selling the rest.”","2209","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"When the social structure starts to crack is when the dropouts and the delinquents and the crazies turn up. These are not people who don’t know the rules. These are people who can see, without understanding why, that the rules no longer make sense. But, once people like that are thrown out of the system, once they become druggies or panhandlers or abusers of various sorts, no one wants them back in. They get scapegoated. Individual moral failure is taken to be the problem. It can’t be the system.","2210","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Part of wagon-train morality was leaving the weakest behind to freeze in the mountain passes. Survival, not caring, is what Didion thinks that ethos finally boiled down to—“careless self-interest and optimism,” the California mentality. California’s answer to the problem of broken people was to build more prisons to put them in.","2211","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Didion’s most famous work in this mode is “Sentimental Journeys,” her article on the Central Park Jogger, which appeared in The New York Review in 1991. “Sentimental Journeys” is not really about the crime—the beating and rape in Central Park, in 1989, of a young white professional named Trisha Meili*—and it’s not about the trial of the mostly African-American teen-agers who were supposed to have confessed to it. The article is really about the coverage.","2212","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"There were 3,255 reported rapes in New York City in 1989, some of them horrific. The press and the politicians seized on the Jogger story, Didion thought, because they saw a way to make it into an exemplary tale. The key to that story was that Meili, although terribly battered, survived. Her personal fortitude could be made a symbol of the fortitude that all true New Yorkers display when the healthy frictions inherent in the city’s “gorgeous mosaic,” as its mayor, David Dinkins, called it, spin temporarily, if tragically, out of control. Nous sommes the Jogger.","2213","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Didion argued that Meili’s story was milked to distract attention from the city’s underlying problems—specifically, the decay of its economic base, a condition that had been laid bare by the stock-market crash of October 19, 1987, Black Monday. “Stories in which terrible crimes are inflicted on innocent victims,” she wrote, “have long performed as the city’s endorphins, a built-in source of natural morphine working to blur the edges of real and to a great extent insoluble problems.” (Son of Sam may have performed a similar role in the nineteen-seventies, the “Bronx is burning” decade.)","2214","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Didion thinks that this is why the press latches on to stories like the Jogger’s. It’s not because those stories tell us who we are. It’s because they don’t. They leave unexamined and untouched the class antagonisms and economic failures that are the underlying causes of socially destructive events. Personal stories feed the American illusion that the system is never the cause of anything. Those stories are always about fortitude, character, loyalty to the group.","2215","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"The journalistic nut of the Jogger piece is the case of Laurie Sue Rosenthal. She was the mistress of an assistant city commissioner for elevator and boiler inspections, a man named Peter Franconeri, who happened to own an apartment at 36 East Sixty-eighth Street, between Madison and Park, and a house in Southampton. On the night of April 26, 1990, Rosenthal called her parents, in Queens, from the Sixty-eighth Street apartment and said she was being beaten. Sometime after that call, she died. In the morning, Franconeri rolled her body up in a carpet, put it out with the building’s trash, and went to work.","2216","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"The story did get into the papers, but officials downplayed the significance. “There were some minor bruises,” said a spokeswoman for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. A police officer complained to a reporter about Franconeri, “Everybody got upside down because of who he was. If it happened to anyone else, nothing would have come of it. A summons would have been issued and that would have been the end of it.”","2217","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Essentially, it was. Laurie Sue Rosenthal was determined to have suffered an accidental death from the combined effects of alcohol and Darvocet. Franconeri pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and got seventy-five hours of community service. The suspects in the Jogger case got sentences of five to fifteen years, for crimes including a rape that, it turned out, they had not committed. But the Central Park suspects did not belong to what Didion called “the conspiracy of those in the know, those with a connection, those with a rabbi at the Department of Sanitation or the Buildings Department or the School Construction Authority or Foley Square, the conspiracy of those who believed everybody got upside down because of who it was, it happened to anybody else, a summons gets issued and that’s the end of it.”","2218","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"“Sentimental Journeys” was a brilliant interpretation of the Jogger story, and an impressive display of journalistic intuition. Didion was right to suspect that the accused teen-agers were wrongly convicted, something that was not established until 2002. She was wrong to suspect, though, that the city was on the rocks. Her hunch was that a shift from manufacturing to financial-services jobs was unsustainable. It did look that way for a while. But after 1992 the market took off, real-estate values along with it, and the city has not looked back. It is no longer fear of violent crime that is driving the middle class out of Manhattan.","2219","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Didion has always disliked interviewing. This is partly a matter of temperament: she doesn’t think on her feet; she thinks in front of a keyboard. But it’s also because she is convinced that you don’t learn anything from interviews. “It doesn’t matter to me what people say to me in the interview,” she has said, “because I don’t trust it.” She considers reporters who fetishize the personal interview vacuous. “In any real sense,” she wrote in a piece on the best-selling books by the Washington Post’s Bob Woodward, “these books are ‘about’ nothing but the author’s own method.” She prefers documents, and most of her political journalism is based on a careful reading of newspaper stories, press releases, hearing transcripts, and the like.","2220","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"This makes her later work, particularly the pieces collected in “Political Fictions,” which treat subjects like the Iran-Contra affair and the Starr Report, seem a little more like literary criticism than like reporting. Didion was an English major at Berkeley at a time when close reading was the gold standard in literary analysis, and Daugherty suggests that those methods stuck with her. She has said as much herself.","2221","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"There is a small but immitigable fallacy in the theory of close reading, though, and it applies to political journalism as well as to the reading of poetry. The text doesn’t reveal its secrets just by being stared at. It reveals its secrets to those who already pretty much know what secrets they expect to find. Texts are always packed, by the reader’s prior knowledge and expectations, before they are unpacked. The teacher has already inserted into the hat the rabbit whose production in the classroom awes the undergraduates.","2222","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"Didion interprets the political text of American life according to a set of beliefs about disparities of wealth and class. She arrived at those assumptions worthily: by analyzing her own education and experience. And that’s what she sees when she reads the newspaper or follows a campaign. She is never less than amazed by the willingness of everyone in the press to pretend, in the name of keeping the show going, that American life is really not about money and power.","2223","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"In 1988, she covered Michael Dukakis’s campaign for President. Dukakis was having “regular guy” problems running against George H. W. Bush, a Connecticut blueblood who had somehow managed to trans-class himself into a self-made Texan. It was just the sort of non-issue issue that Didion thinks has completely divorced electoral politics from the needs of the actual electorate. To address the guy gap, Dukakis and his aides came up with the plan of having the candidate, whenever his plane landed somewhere, play catch with his press secretary on the tarmac. Reporters duly filmed this performance, often in hundred-degree heat, to be shown on the evening news. It was, as Didion wrote, “a repeated moment witnessed by many people all of whom believed it to be a setup yet most of whom believed that only an outsider, only someone too ‘naïve’ to know the rules of the game, would so describe it.”","2224","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"She thinks that this is how what she calls “the permanent political class”—the press, the talk-show experts, the campaign strategists, the political parties, even the candidates themselves—has rigged the game. Everyone knows that what you see in politics is fake or confected, but everyone’s O.K. with that, because it’s all been focus-grouped.","2225","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"One topic that Didion does like to talk about is writing. “I learned a lot of fictional technique” from script writing, she explained to Hilton Als, in an interview in 2006. And the novels are screenplay-like. She told Als that she became impatient with “the conventions of writing,” like description. Her scenes tend to be story-boarded—this character is here, that character is there. The main action is the dialogue.","2226","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"You can see from the deftness and precision of that dialogue why she and Dunne were in such demand as script doctors. Although Didion’s novels are lurid enough, much of the speech is comic, in a gimlet-eyed, dead-end sort of way. But the books are literary caterpillars, texts that seem to be seeking their ultimate realization in the form of a motion picture.","2227","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"The fiction has been influential: Bret Easton Ellis, who went to college with Quintana, is a sworn disciple. But Didion’s nonfiction is what sets her apart. Daugherty thinks that it was the Vogue years that made the prose Didionesque, and this seems right. Didion is the quintessential magazine writer. Her books are short. “I always aim for a reading in one sitting,” she told Als, and that is how people normally read magazine pieces. The job of the magazine writer is never to give readers a reason to stop before they reach the end.","2228","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"
"The No. 1 sin in print journalism is repetition. Pages are money; editorial space is finite. Writers who waste it don’t last. Conditions demand a willingness to compress and a talent for concision. The ellipses and the refrains that characterize much of Didion’s writing are methods of economizing the exposition and managing the reader’s experience, ways of getting the reader to participate in the job of making sense of whatever it is, hippies or someone who once wrote about hippies, that the writer is trying to think through. ♦","2229","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/out-of-bethlehem"

A missing mechanical device? Some combination of them all?—and an even more vibrant set of arguments about the failure of Americans to build any longer for the common good. Everyone agrees that our rail system is frail and accident-prone: one tragedy can end the service up and down the entire path from Boston to Washington, and beyond, for days on end. And everyone knows that American infrastructure—what used to be called our public works, or just our bridges and railways, once the envy of the world—has now been stripped bare, and is being stripped ever barer.","May 15, 2015","2235","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-plot-against-trains"
"What is less apparent, perhaps, is that the will to abandon the public way is not some failure of understanding, or some nearsighted omission by shortsighted politicians. It is part of a coherent ideological project. As I wrote a few years ago, in a piece on the literature of American declinism, “The reason we don’t have beautiful new airports and efficient bullet trains is not that we have inadvertently stumbled upon stumbling blocks; it’s that there are considerable numbers of Americans for whom these things are simply symbols of a feared central government, and who would, when they travel, rather sweat in squalor than surrender the money to build a better terminal.” The ideological rigor of this idea, as absolute in its way as the ancient Soviet conviction that any entering wedge of free enterprise would lead to the destruction of the Soviet state, is as instructive as it is astonishing. And it is part of the folly of American “centrism” not to recognize that the failure to run trains where we need them is made from conviction, not from ignorance.","2236","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-plot-against-trains"
"There is a popular notion at large, part of a sort of phantom “bi-partisan” centrist conviction, that the degradation of American infrastructure, exemplified by the backwardness of our trains and airports, too, is a failure of the American political system. We all should know that it is bad to have our trains crowded and wildly inefficient—as Michael Tomasky points out, fifty years ago, the train from New York to Washington was much faster than it is now—but we lack the political means or will to cure the problem. In fact, this is a triumph of our political system, for what is politics but a way of enforcing ideological values over merely rational ones? If we all agreed on common economic welfare and pursued it logically, we would not need politics at all: we could outsource our problems to a sort of Saint-Simonian managerial class, which would do the job for us.","2237","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-plot-against-trains"
"What an ideology does is give you reasons not to pursue your own apparent rational interest—and this cuts both ways, including both wealthy people in New York who, out of social conviction, vote for politicians who are more likely to raise their taxes, and poor people in the South who vote for those devoted to cutting taxes on incomes they can never hope to earn. There is no such thing as false consciousness. There are simply beliefs that make us sacrifice one piece of self-evident interest for some other, larger principle.","2238","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-plot-against-trains"
"What we have, uniquely in America, is a political class, and an entire political party, devoted to the idea that any money spent on public goods is money misplaced, not because the state goods might not be good but because they would distract us from the larger principle that no ultimate good can be found in the state. Ride a fast train to Washington today and you’ll start thinking about national health insurance tomorrow.","2239","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-plot-against-trains"
"The ideology of individual autonomy is, for good or ill, so powerful that it demands cars where trains would save lives, just as it places assault weapons in private hands, despite the toll they take in human lives. Trains have to be resisted, even if it means more pollution and massive inefficiency and falling ever further behind in the amenities of life—what Olmsted called our “commonplace civilization.”","2240","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-plot-against-trains"
"Part of this, of course, is the ancient—and yet, for most Americans, oddly beclouded—reality that the constitutional system is rigged for rural interests over urban ones. The Senate was designed to make this happen, even before we had big cities, and no matter how many people they contain or what efficient engines of prosperity they are. Mass transit goes begging while farm subsidies flourish.","2241","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-plot-against-trains"
"But the bias against the common good goes deeper, into the very cortex of the imagination. This was exemplified by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s decision, a few short years ago, to cancel the planned train tunnel under the Hudson. No good reason could be found for this—most of the money would have been supplied by the federal government, it was obviously in the long-term interests of the people of New Jersey, and it was exactly the kind of wise thing that, a hundred years ago, allowed the region to blossom. Christie was making what was purely a gesture toward the national Republican Party, in the same spirit as supporting a right-to-life amendment. We won’t build a tunnel for trains we obviously need because, if we did, people would use it and then think better of the people who built it. That is the logic in a nutshell, and logic it seems to be, until you get to its end, when it becomes an absurdity. As Paul Krugman wrote, correctly, about the rail-tunnel follies, “in general, the politicians who make the loudest noise about taking care of future generations, taking the long view, etc., are the ones who are in fact most irresponsible about public investments.”","2242","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-plot-against-trains"
"This week’s tragedy also, perhaps, put a stop for a moment to the license for mocking those who use the train—mocking Amtrak’s northeast “corridor” was a standard subject not just for satire, which everyone deserves, but also for sneering, which no one does. For the prejudice against trains is not a prejudice against an élite but against a commonality. The late Tony Judt, who was hardly anyone’s idea of a leftist softy, devoted much of his last, heroic work, written in conditions of near-impossible personal suffering, to the subject of … trains: trains as symbols of the public good, trains as a triumph of the liberal imagination, trains as the “symbol and symptom of modernity,” and modernity at its best. “The railways were the necessary and natural accompaniment to the emergence of civil society,” he wrote. “They are a collective project for individual benefit … something that the market cannot accomplish, except, on its own account of itself, by happy inadvertence. … If we lose the railways we shall not just have lost a valuable practical asset. We shall have acknowledged that we have forgotten how to live collectively.”","2243","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-plot-against-trains"
"Trains take us places together. (You can read good books on them, too.) Every time you ride one, you look outside, and you look inside, and you can’t help but think about the private and the public in a new way. As Judt wrote, the railroad represents neither the fearsome state nor the free individual. A train is a small society, headed somewhere more or less on time, more or less together, more or less sharing the same window, with a common view and a singular destination.","2244","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-plot-against-trains"
"In public, Donald Trump has three facial expressions—no more than three because life, for him, is quite simple.","August 12, 2015","2245","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"Implacable Resolution: The increasingly familiar chin-up, narrow-eyed Mussolini frown. When Trump listens to a hostile question, his lips are closed, his head squares up to a solid block of orange clay, his corn-silk hair surges resolutely forward and backward at the same time. Expressionless, he nods as the hostile sentence is delivered. By evoking Mussolini’s thrusting chin, I don’t mean to imply that Trump is eager to become a military dictator. He isn’t. Donald Trump is something classically American, an unwavering what’s-in-it-for-me capitalist who likes to crush other people. Yet Mussolini and Trump share something: They appeal to an appreciation, even love, of overwhelming ego strength and extreme machismo, however crass in expression—in fact, the crasser and more preposterous the better (shame doesn’t exist for some public men). Those who are drawn to such strength nestle under it. The hero releases his aggression on the world, the aggression that others would be punished for; his ability to get away with belligerence, insults, lies, and threats makes it easier for his audience to accept caution and silence for themselves. He has triumphed for them, and that’s more than enough.","2246","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"Trump’s emotional appeal is similar to that of gangsters everywhere, who act out our most violent and anarchic impulses. In a variant interpretation, Elspeth Reeve, at The New Republic, compared Trump not to a gangster but to the “heel” in pro-wrestling matches—the bad guy whose boasts and offensive behavior and barbarian facial hair are part of a ritual that audiences love. But that isn’t quite right. Professional wrestling is scripted, and Trump is spontaneous and improvisatory. In wrestling, the bad guy always loses, and Trump always wins. He is impervious and unremitting. If he says something stupid, he denies he said it—for instance, his suggestion that Megyn Kelly’s tough questions in the recent Fox-hosted Republican debate were produced by menstruation. Trump went to Wharton, he built a great business, he’s intelligent, so how could he have said it? He didn’t say it. His audience loves him not in spite of such “gaffes” as slamming John McCain’s war record; they love him because he says such things. The senselessness of the McCain attack was essential to its popularity. Trump’s speeches and press conferences are a free-association shambles, his “ideas” a series of boasts. When asked, on Tuesday, how he would bring jobs back from China, he talked about buying a hotel in Miami. For his audience, the only thing that matters is that he asserts himself. Reasoning and consistency are élitist weaknesses.","2247","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"Beneath Contempt. His mouth drops down and forms a slightly elongated oval, like a stretched Cheerio. The oval is a prelude to a taunt or a threat. When Kelly asked Trump about his derogatory comments on women, he responded, “What I say is what I say. And honestly, Megyn, if you don’t like it, I’m sorry. I’ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldn’t do that.” But he would do it, and continued to do it. Donald Trump has made a shrewd estimate of the distaste, in a part of the Republican base, for virtue or high-mindedness or public spiritedness of any sort—what he dismisses as “political correctness.” Such sentiments are for “losers” who don’t understand that winning is the only thing; they are “stupid.” Obama’s mild reasonableness is particularly enraging to members of the Republican base because they suspect the President is outclassing them. Trump releases them from that fear.","2248","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"You-gotta-be-kidding-me. A wide smile, eyes often closed, palms outstretched. In such moments, Trump presents himself as capitalist man, the spirit of rational calculation. Only an idiot could fail to see that he’s right. When asked by Bret Baier, in the debate, about his past support for Hillary Clinton, Trump responded, “I will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.” So his own behavior is part of a corrupt system. The important point for him is not the degradation of representative democracy, but only that Trump gets what he wants. Having won, he can laugh at his own cynicism.","2249","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"Trump’s manner is the product of business calculation. But many Americans may not realize how much Trump’s voice and gestures are also shaped by New York—the old, hard New York, before gay rights, smoothies, and Brooklyn, the New York that Trump and I grew up in. His temperament is the residue of a thousand wise-guy tabloid columns, the knowing talk of Seventh-Avenue machers and Irish taxi drivers and mobbed-up guys in the outer boroughs. The flavor of it was there, harmlessly, in the lather-and-hot-towels midtown barber shops of my youth, with their uniformed women attending to gents’ cuticles; benevolently, in the incomparable Broadway musical “Guys and Dolls”; and viciously, in the A.M.-radio rat-a-tat of Walter Winchell. Men like Trump always cut to the chase because, for them, there’s nothing but the chase; they cite the bottom line because it’s the only line that matters; they put down women because there’s no reason, most of the time, to take them seriously. If a woman somehow does attain power, they assume she will use it to destroy men. In Megyn Kelly, Trump sees some golden-haired modern variant of Medusa.","2250","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"People are constantly surprised and shocked by Trump because he doesn’t play by any known set of political rules. Even the three formidable Fox moderators (including Chris Wallace) were limited in their understanding of him by what they expected of political candidates—acknowledgment of some minimal level of consistency, plausibility, and accountability. They thought they could trip him up, even trap him, Tim Russert-style, in his contradictions and political changes. But he answered them with gibberish—silly jokes, non sequiturs, and irrelevant assertions. It’s impossible for Trump to contradict himself, since, as many have said, he has no beliefs, in the sense of ideological beliefs.","2251","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"He exploited the country’s bankruptcy laws when his hotel-casino investments in Atlantic City went sour, and anyway, he got out early and made a lot of money. Got it? He made money. A single-payer system, often known as socialized medicine, “works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you’re talking about here.” (i.e., fifteen years ago). Got it? It works. But the Affordable Care Act, which could be seen as a hesitant first step toward a single-payer system, “is a disaster.” You can’t argue with reasoning like this because it always circles back to Trump’s triumphs over the naïve. He’s gone past contradiction, beyond tautology, into infallibility. In advance of the debate, he stopped studying policy papers. He doesn’t need answers; his temperament is the answer. My guess is that he will persist as long as he’s having fun, not spending much of his own money, and enjoying high poll numbers. Which could be right into the primaries next winter. The Republican Party and the media can’t begin to understand him until they look at his face.","2252","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"

"Organizers of the rally were quick to defend the size of the turnout. “There is always a lot of competition for the racist audience in Alabama,” an aide to the speaker said. “There were other racists speaking at other venues in the state Friday night. Plus, a lot of racists now prefer to stay at home and stream racist content on the Internet.

"The relationship between Senator Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton, the Party’s most likely Presidential nominee, goes back to the second half of the Clinton Administration. Warren told me recently that the most dramatic policy fight of her life was one in which Bill and Hillary Clinton were intimately involved. She recalls it as the “ten-year war.” Between 1995 and 2005, Warren, a professor who had established herself as one of the country’s foremost experts on bankruptcy law, managed to turn an arcane issue of financial regulation into a major political issue.","2257","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In the late nineteen-nineties, Congress was trying to pass a bankruptcy bill that Warren felt was written, essentially, by the credit-card industry. For several years, through a growing network of allies in Washington, she helped liberals in Congress fight the bill, but at the end of the Clinton Administration the bill seemed on the verge of passage. Clinton’s economic team was divided, much as Democrats today are split over economic policy. His progressive aides opposed the bill; aides who were more sympathetic to the financial industry supported it. Warren targeted the one person in the White House who she believed could stop the legislation: the First Lady. They met alone for half an hour, and, according to Warren, Hillary stood up and declared, “Well, I’m convinced. It is our job to stop that awful bill. You help me and I’ll help you.” In the Administration’s closing weeks, Hillary persuaded Bill Clinton not to sign the legislation, effectively vetoing it.","2258","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"But just a few months later, in 2001, Hillary was a senator from New York, the home of the financial industry, and she voted in favor of a version of the same bill. It passed, and George W. Bush signed it into law, ending Warren’s ten-year war with a crushing defeat. “There were a lot of people who voted for that bill who thought that there was going to be no political price to pay,” Warren told me.","2259","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren is not running for President. But she is mounting a campaign to insure that Clinton and other prominent Democrats adhere to her agenda of reversing income inequality and beating back the influence of corporate power in politics. These are issues that Warren has pursued for three decades, as an academic, a policy adviser to Democrats, an Obama Administration regulator, and, since 2012, a U.S. senator and the anchor of a progressive wing of the Democratic Party.","2260","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Clinton has taken notice. Last December, she invited Warren to a private meeting at her Washington home, near Embassy Row, to hear Warren’s advice on issues such as income inequality. In recent months, members of Clinton’s policy team have consulted with Dan Geldon, one of Warren’s closest advisers, about economic policy. And a few days after Clinton’s official announcement, on April 12th, that she is running for President, she wrote a paean to Warren in Time, saying that Warren “never hesitates to hold powerful people’s feet to the fire: bankers, lobbyists, senior government officials and, yes, even presidential aspirants.”","2261","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Clinton even sounds like Warren these days, evidently hoping to fend off charges that she is a captive of Wall Street money and influence. In the video in which Clinton announced her candidacy, she says, “The deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top.” Two days later, during a stop in Iowa, she noted, “Hedge-fund managers pay lower taxes than nurses or the truckers I saw on I-80, when I was driving here over the last two days.” And in a fund-raising e-mail she wrote, “The average CEO makes 300 times what the average worker makes.”","2262","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Clinton’s people insist that any similarity to Warren is coincidental. “Hillary was talking about rising inequality and how the deck was stacked against people in 2007 and 2008,” Neera Tanden, the head of the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank, and a policy adviser to Hillary Clinton, said. “I see a lot of overlap. I do not see a causal link from one person to the other.” The Warren camp seems to have a different view. Last week, Warren’s advisers privately circulated a picture showing the two women sitting beside each other, a quote bubble emanating from Clinton: “What she said.” When I asked Warren last week if she believed that Clinton was co-opting her message, she hesitated and replied, “Eh.” She added, “She’s laying out her vision for the country and she deserves an opportunity to do that.” Warren may have decided not to run because she felt she couldn’t win. But Clinton’s populist turn signals another possibility: Warren feels that she can accomplish more from the sidelines.","2263","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“I think she’s doing exactly the right thing,” Barney Frank, the former congressman from Massachusetts, told me recently, referring to Warren. “Right now, she’s as powerful a spokesperson on public policy as you could be in the minority.” Frank worked closely with Warren in the House on financial-reform legislation to curb the power of banks. “She has an absolute veto over certain public-policy issues, because Democrats are not going to cross her. And if she were to even hint at being a candidate that would be over.” He added, “Democrats are afraid of Elizabeth Warren. No Democrat wants Elizabeth Warren being critical of him.”","2264","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren believes that, when it comes to economic policy, there is a Wall Street view and a Main Street view, and Democrats must choose sides. Her critics argue that this is simplistic and naïve, but she has buoyed many on the left who are critical of President Obama’s economic policies and advisers for being excessively influenced by Wall Street. Warren was especially unimpressed by the President’s first Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, who was appointed at the start of the financial crisis. “I was shocked that he picked the person who had just done the bailouts through the New York Fed,” she said. “I assumed that the President would want to carve a different path, and want to separate himself from the Republican-led bailout.” She added, “Tim Geithner came from the New York Fed, which, effectively, works for Wall Street.” (Geithner declined to respond on the record to Warren’s criticism of him.)","2265","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In the final year and a half of the Obama Administration, Warren will continue to take on the President over issues such as international trade and his choices for Treasury Department positions, but she will be focussing more intently on influencing Clinton. In the past two weeks, in the wake of Warren’s forceful opposition, Clinton has backed away from a major trade agreement with Asian countries that, as Secretary of State, she had helped to negotiate. But, as Warren knows, Clinton can be an inconsistent ally. Her challenge over the next year and a half is to make sure that Hillary Clinton’s embrace of Warrenism is a lasting one.","2266","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"On a shelf in her Boston office, Warren keeps a glass bowl of large rocks, a gift from her advisers during the 2012 Senate campaign, when she would often say to them, “I want to throw rocks.” When I visited her in Washington in late February, though, she was in a theatrical mood, reprising a scene from the early nineteen-seventies, when she was struggling to balance the strains of new motherhood, a failing marriage, and law school. Splayed out on a chair, she demonstrated how she drove her Volkswagen Beetle with one hand, reaching with the other into the back seat to keep the baby awake.","2267","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“No, no, no!” she yelled. “Wake up, baby, wake up, wake up! Just a little bit longer! Just a little bit longer! Do we remember the sunshine song?” She began to sing “You Are My Sunshine.” At the time, Warren said, she couldn’t get her homework finished unless her daughter napped at home; that meant keeping the baby awake on the drive back from the babysitter after class. “I learned to shift through the steering wheel, so as not to let go of that baby,” Warren said. Once, she crashed the car. “I rolled right into someone while doing that. Caved in the whole front end of that VW Beetle.”","2268","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren’s attempts at drama can feel forced. In her memoir, she frequently recalls times when she was “stunned” or “furious,” or when she “clenched” her teeth at the “vile” actions of the big banks. Her more compelling moments, captured on video, feature her passionately defending the role of government or pummelling committee witnesses—government regulators or bankers who have made the mistake of arguing a point with Warren, a former high-school debate champion. She has cultivated a public image as a fierce and uncompromising fighter, although her critics in business and politics sometimes use other words.","2269","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“I think that she would do better if she were less angry and demonized less,” Warren Buffett, the C.E.O. and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, recently complained on CNBC. Several commentators denounced Buffett, an ardent supporter of Hillary Clinton, as sexist, but one of Warren’s close advisers told me that her aides acknowledge the criticism. “I would modify her vitriol, because I think it gratuitously creates enemies,” the adviser said. “There is a grain of truth in what Buffett said.”","2270","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren is driven in part by an awareness of the obstacles that she had to overcome to achieve professional success. She grew up in Oklahoma City in the nineteen-fifties, the youngest of four and the only girl. “All I ever wanted to do was be a teacher,” she said. “It must have been miserable to be one of my dolls, because I used to line them up and teach school.” In her 2014 memoir, “A Fighting Chance,” she describes herself in high school as “tall,” “self-conscious,” and cursed with crooked teeth. Her mother told her to get married early, but she secretly sent away for college applications and, on the strength of her debate-team skills, won a full scholarship to George Washington University, in D.C. After two years, she dropped out of college and, at nineteen, married Jim Warren, whom she had dated in high school.","2271","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren soon realized that she had made a terrible mistake. “It was all over at that point, statistically,” she said. “You get married at nineteen and drop out of college, that’s pretty much it for most girls, especially back in the late sixties.” Still, she finished college and went to law school, at Rutgers, but her husband wanted her to stay home, while she insisted on going to work as a lawyer. “I tried,” she told me. “I tried so hard.” The couple, who had two children, divorced in 1980. (Jim Warren died in 2003, of lung cancer.)","2272","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In 1983, after finishing law school, and teaching law at the University of Houston, she took a position at the University of Texas Law School, in Austin, where she offered to lecture on bankruptcy law. She knew little about the subject, apart from her experiences of financial insecurity growing up. By the time Warren was born, the family’s finances were deteriorating. Her father, who served as a flight instructor in the Second World War, had sought a job flying but was passed over because of his age. He had lost all his money starting a car dealership, and then he was injured in a car crash.","2273","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“It was a life lived just at the edge of economic survival,” Warren said. “When I got sick, my mother would lean down, put her hand against my forehead, and then step back and do the calculation: how sick I seemed to be versus how big was the outstanding bill with Dr. Buffington.”","2274","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Eventually, her father found a job selling carpeting, and the family bought a station wagon and moved to a bigger house in Oklahoma City. Then her father suffered a heart attack. “It all just came undone in the blink of an eye,” Warren said. Her mother took a minimum-wage job at Sears to support the family.","2275","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"At the University of Texas, Warren joined with two other professors to study what kind of people declare bankruptcy. At the time, the common view of most legal scholars and many politicians was that the bankruptcy laws were being abused by people cheating the system. Warren initially thought the same. “I’d gone into this research to prove that those people who filed for bankruptcy were different from us,” she said. “We’d had hard times, but we’d never filed for bankruptcy.” Jay Westbrook, one of Warren’s collaborators, who still teaches at the University of Texas Law School, told me, “We had a picture in our mind of sort of shiftless people who weren’t very careful with their money.”","2276","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren and her colleagues travelled to courthouses around the country and gathered data on hundreds of bankruptcy cases. There were no electronic records, so they flew from city to city with a portable Xerox machine that they called R2-D2. In academic legal circles, theoretical work was a surer path to a tenured position than empirical field research, but Warren and her colleagues stayed with it for almost a decade. One of the first cases she reviewed involved a middle-class couple who committed suicide before they could appear at their court hearing. “I looked at that and I thought, Yeah, I know people who would make that choice,” she said.","2277","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The data revealed that, by the early nineteen-eighties, a growing number of middle-class Americans were resorting to bankruptcy, and that most debtors were homeowners. “I will never forget the day that we did that data run,” Westbrook said. “We couldn’t believe it. We checked the computer three times.” Debtors were not irresponsible slackers but families hit with the sudden loss of a job, a divorce, or a bad car accident, which depleted their savings and pushed them into financial ruin. Bankruptcies were going up because of mounting economic stress on the middle class.","2278","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In 1987, Warren moved on to a job at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, teaching contract law and bankruptcy; in 1995, she went to Harvard. “She broke the news about what the actual practices and effects of the bankruptcy law were,” Martha Minow, the dean of Harvard Law School, told me. “That put her on the map and made a lot of people interested.”","2279","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren said that her early research has informed everything she’s studied since. She noted that by 1975 productivity and median wages, which until then had risen together, had started to decouple: the former continued to rise while the latter remained flat. Meanwhile, bankruptcy filings soared, regardless of how the economy was doing. “A problem that looks real but small and at the margins in the nineteen-eighties has moved to the center by the nineties,” Warren said, “and by the two-thousands it’s starting to hollow out America’s middle class.”","2280","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren tells her life story as a series of confrontations. Early on, she fought to escape her bad marriage and pursue a professional career; later, she fought against an élitist legal academy that looked down on her credentials and her research interests. In the late eightes and early nineties, at the University of Pennsylvania, she mostly avoided the debates over faculty diversity that were then seizing the campus. She was a registered Republican, and “was not viewed as a champion of women or minorities,” the Boston Globe noted, in 2012. “Silent on the race and gender wars that divided campuses in the nineteen-eighties and nineteen-nineties, she was never a liberal crusader.” Warren told me that she was immersed in her scholarship and wary of political fights outside her areas of expertise.","2281","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In 1994, Congress created a commission to make policy recommendations on how to reform the bankruptcy laws. Mike Synar, Bill Clinton’s first appointee to run the commission, recruited Warren to serve as the top policy adviser. Conservative and pro-lender members of the panel argued that the laws were too easy on debtors and encouraged reckless behavior, a position shared by the banks. The pro-consumer side, arguing for more lenient terms for Americans who go broke, often had a one-vote majority on the panel. Many of the big issues were decided by a vote of five to four. “This was the first time that I’m aware of that Elizabeth was exposed to and part of the crucible of politics,” a member of the panel said. By the end of her work on the commission, in 1997, Warren was a Democrat.","2282","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Congress mostly ignored the group’s work and adopted the industry-friendly bill, which many Democratic legislators, along with some of Bill Clinton’s senior advisers, favored. Warren went to see Gene Sperling, Clinton’s top economic aide in the White House, who opposed the legislation. She showed him a stream of hard data and offered talking points about how the legislation would hurt families in economic distress, but the situation looked hopeless. By 1999, while Clinton was recovering from the Lewinsky scandal of his second term, the bill had gained support in a Republican Congress. In addition, the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, was from South Dakota, the heart of the credit-card industry, and he strongly supported the bill.","2283","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“It was tough to know what to do, as we were facing veto-proof majorities in both Houses,” Sperling told me. “Warren really did have an impact. She had amassed data to show that a lot of the rise in bankruptcies was due not to deadbeats but to medical debt and women hurt by divorce. Her facts helped buck up both Clintons to keep fighting for a better bill and gave those of us in the trenches good ammo and amendment strategies.” The White House slowed the legislation’s progress through Congress, and when it finally did pass, in 2000, Clinton, in one of his last acts as President, refused to sign it, effectively vetoing it. A White House aide later told Warren that, two days after her meeting with the First Lady, the White House economic team flipped its position “so fast that you could see skid marks in the hallways of the White House.”","2284","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The following year, Bill Clinton was replaced by George W. Bush. A new version of the bill was introduced. In Warren’s 2003 book, “The Two-Income Trap,” she describes what happened next:","2285","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In 2005, a decade after Warren began her crusade against the bill, the legislation was signed into law by Bush. “We held them off for ten years, and that’s about thirteen or fourteen million families that made it through the system,” Warren told me. The delay, she added, proved that Wall Street was not as powerful in Washington as it had imagined. “The big banks thought they’d just roll in and pick up a few percentage points’ increase in their bottom line, because they could squeeze families a little harder when they were right on the edge and they could get just a few more dollars. They thought they had it made.”","2286","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren’s book became a surprise hit among Democratic policymakers. During the 2004 Democratic Presidential primaries, John Edwards called Warren to discuss it, and John Kerry mentioned it in a speech, declaring it “one of the best books that actually describes the transformation that has taken place in America.” It also earned the admiration of Dr. Phil, the TV psychologist, who invited Warren to appear on his show to talk about how families could remain financially stable in a world of predatory lending. Warren offered some unremarkable advice about the dangers of taking out a second mortgage to pay off other debts, but it altered the course of her career. The show had reached six million viewers, and she later wrote, “I might have done more good than in an entire year as a professor.”","2287","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"When I called Dr. Phil, whose full name is Phillip McGraw, he said that he and Warren have remained friends over the years. “I was really intrigued by that book,” he said. “But I didn’t think it was particularly written for the general populace.” He told me that after the show he said to Warren that her book was “too technically intense and it’s not reader-friendly.” He encouraged her to write and speak to a much larger audience.","2288","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"One of Warren’s lesser-known skills is an ability to build unlikely alliances. For years, she has worked closely with Camden Fine, the head of the Independent Community Bankers of America, who is considered by some to be one of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington. In the financial world, community bankers see themselves as representatives of Main Street America, and they are often at odds with the financial behemoths on Wall Street. On a recent Friday, Fine, who is from Jefferson City, Missouri, greeted me in his office, on L Street, wearing pleated khakis and a striped button-down shirt. He radiates the image of the kind of small-town bank president who might have given your grandfather a loan on little more than a handshake. The walls and shelves of his office are filled with St. Louis Cardinals paraphernalia and Civil War artifacts, next to thank-you notes from Barney Frank and other politicians.","2289","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine represents some sixty-five hundred small banks across the country. Frank told me, “It’s the smaller businesses that have natural grassroots networks: Realtors, mortgage brokers, auto dealers, community banks. They’re in everybody’s district and they tend to have a very extroverted corporate culture: ‘Hi, how are ya, can I sell ya a car?’ Extremely good on TV.”","2290","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Community banks, which typically are local and often have less than a billion dollars in assets, are good at getting what they want out of Congress, but they are also considered more consumer-friendly than large financial conglomerates, such as Citigroup or Bank of America. In June of 2009, Elizabeth Warren went to visit Fine. For the four years since losing the bankruptcy fight, she had continued to teach and write at Harvard, but she remained politically active. In the months before the 2007-08 financial crisis, she became increasingly vocal about Wall Street’s mortgage-lending practices and wrote an article in a new policy journal, Democracy, that warned of the dangers of subprime-mortgage lending. The title of the article, “Unsafe at Any Rate,” echoed Ralph Nader’s 1965 book, “Unsafe at Any Speed,” about the dangers of the unregulated automobile industry. Warren called for the creation of a new government agency that would do for financial products what the Consumer Product Safety Commission, created in 1972 by Richard Nixon, had done for toys, appliances, and other items.","2291","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house,” she wrote. “But it is possible to refinance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same one-in-five chance of putting the family out on the street.”","2292","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren did not predict the subsequent financial meltdown in all its particulars, but her warning about the dangers of unregulated lending was prescient. “It was like watching a train wreck and standing on the side,” she told me. “You were screaming at people to stop doing this: ‘Wait, slow down, there’s gonna be a crash here.’ But nobody could make their voice heard on this.” She places much of the blame on the Federal Reserve, which had the regulatory tools to address the housing bubble: “Alan Greenspan”—the former Federal Reserve chairman—“inflated the bubble, and he did it either knowingly or with reckless abandon.”","2293","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In late 2008, after the crash, Harry Reid, the Democratic leader of the Senate, called Warren in Cambridge and asked her to serve on a new Congressional Oversight Panel, which was charged with monitoring how the federal government was spending the seven hundred billion dollars that was being used to bail out the financial sector. Jim Manley, Reid’s spokesman at the time, said, “Reid had heard her speak, and like everyone else was impressed by her ability to break complex issues down into sound bites that people can understand.” Reid told me, “She’d done a lot of writing on poor people. Nobody knew who she was, but she was great. Everybody liked her.” Warren temporarily gave up her teaching duties and moved to Washington.","2294","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Reid’s decision was not greeted warmly by the new Obama Administration. Treasury Secretary Geithner resented Warren’s use of the panel to question his policies in the middle of the crisis, and Warren complained that he denied many of her requests for information. “There was this feeling that Elizabeth Warren was pretty sophisticated,” a former Obama official said. “And when we’re getting hit everywhere she should be a little more sympathetic. She was somebody who was supposed to be on your side, and she carried more weight against you because she was a Democrat and was well regarded on these issues.”","2295","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren told me, “We were there to do oversight, and it made no difference to me whether there was a Democrat or a Republican in the White House. Our only consideration should be the American people, not whose feelings in government might get hurt or whose political careers might be advanced.” Warren said her work on the panel studying Treasury’s practices taught her that Obama’s economic advisers were even more beholden to the banks than she had understood. “The Treasury Department believed in saving those at the top, and didn’t worry much about the rest of America,” she said.","2296","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren was well known in liberal policy circles, but Geithner had never heard of her until she became his overseer and summoned him to testify. He felt that she was much better at complaining about what she was against than at articulating what she was for. In his recent memoir, “Stress Test,” Geithner calls Warren “one of our most ardent and eloquent liberal critics” but chastises her for not offering him more specific policy suggestions during the financial crisis.","2297","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren quickly realized that, although she could hold hearings and write reports, her panel had no more authority than her old blue-ribbon bankruptcy commission. Those writing the new rules for financial regulation had the real power. Warren thought she had a chance to get a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau into the emerging law, so she stopped excoriating Geithner, and met with Fine, the bank lobbyist. She knew that public opposition to the protection bureau on his part could kill it.","2298","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“The Wall Street crowd constantly tries to use my members almost like human shields to try to get their stuff through, because they know that Congress likes smaller banks,” Fine told me. Warren took the same approach. She doubted that she could persuade Fine to support the agency, but, if the community banks simply remained neutral, that would be a victory. “We had not totally developed our position yet,” Fine said. “But we were very, very skeptical and were making noise that we were going to oppose the creation of that agency.”","2299","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine viewed Warren as a left-wing activist, hostile to the interests of his member banks, most of which were run by Republicans. “In the financial industry, Professor Warren was regarded as a little loopy, way out there on the fringe, and was not taken all that seriously,” he said. “So I told my assistant, I’ll spend thirty minutes with this loopy woman and then come get me and just make an excuse that I’ve got a call or something.”","2300","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Instead, Fine and Warren spoke for two hours. Warren played on Fine’s fears of the Wall Street banks, explaining that under current law small community banks were subject to more intense regulatory scrutiny than the large financial institutions. She argued that even if Fine and his members hated the idea of any additional regulation, at least her agency would make the mega-banks face the same kinds of review. “You need to give this agency a chance,” Warren told him.","2301","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine got up from the table where we were sitting and retrieved a document from his desk drawer. “I debated about showing this to a reporter, but it’s historic,” he told me. It was an e-mail he’d sent to the members of his executive committee the day after his meeting with Warren. At the top of the memo, in bold caps, it said:","2302","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The e-mail recapped Fine’s meeting with Warren and laid out his group’s political strategy for the coming fight over Dodd-Frank, the bill that was to overhaul regulation of the financial industry. Warren “bluntly told us that she was meeting with I. C. B. A. instead of A. B. A.”—the American Bankers Association, which is dominated by the large Wall Street firms—“because she feels strongly that our understanding and support of her recommendation to create the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency is vital to its success,” Fine wrote. “She said that she wants community banks to get behind it. Her argument is that the big banks can afford to absorb continued and increasing regulatory burden, but that smaller banks cannot; and that if we don’t do something about the burden the big banks will crush us.”","2303","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine argued that Warren’s vision for the agency would not be so bad for community banks, but he did worry that her approach was too theoretical. “Dr. Warren is an academic, and thinks like an academic,” he wrote. “She has taught contract law,” and she “has never been out of academia. While I found her arguments compelling, they were terribly naïve. That said, if we are clever, I believe we can work with her and perhaps shape an agency that has little impact on community banks but a huge impact on the unregulated part of the financial-services industry.”","2304","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"He said that, even if his group decided to publicly oppose the agency, it needed to work with Warren to shape the legislation. “Over all, it was a very good and enlightening meeting,” he concluded. “We might be able to turn lemons into lemonade yet.” Fine persuaded his trade group to remain neutral about Warren’s agency.","2305","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren effectively co-opted Fine and his members as allies against Wall Street. As the Dodd-Frank bill made its way through Congress, in 2010, Fine’s willingness to tolerate it was crucial. With Warren’s blessing, Barney Frank, who sponsored the bill in the House, negotiated a deal with Fine that allowed community banks to be examined by their current regulators rather than by Warren’s new agency. “They were the ones with the clout, and that’s why I had to make a deal with Cam,” Frank told me. Warren signed off on it. “She was willing to do what she had to do as long as it didn’t give away substance,” Frank said. “Every time we came to one of those things where, to save the great bulk of the bill, we had to make some kind of concession, she understood it and was very helpful in selling it.”","2306","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Geithner, long pilloried as doing the bidding of bankers, couldn’t resist pointing out the irony of Warren and Frank’s accommodation with Fine. “The smaller community banks, with members in every congressional district, got themselves largely carved out of the new consumer agency’s direct supervision, despite our resistance,” he wrote in his memoir. But, in exchange for the concession, Fine promised Frank that he wouldn’t oppose the agency, a position that Frank told me secured the support of many wavering centrist Democrats and helped insure the bill’s passage.","2307","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"On July 21, 2010, Obama signed the new law in a ceremony in Washington. Valerie Jarrett, his longtime adviser, oversaw the seating chart for the event, and she instructed her staff to place Warren in the front row, between former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and the chairman, Ben Bernanke. Warren had accomplished something extraordinarily rare for an academic: she had turned a policy-journal idea for a new government agency into the real thing. Now she wanted to run it.","2308","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Many liberals were pressing Obama to nominate Warren to head the new agency, and fifty-seven representatives and eleven senators sent him a letter endorsing the idea. The White House did not appreciate the pressure. “I was pushing hard for her, and Obama got annoyed with me,” Frank said.","2309","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Soon after the bill signing, Warren and Jarrett met in Jarrett’s office, in the West Wing. At the meeting, Jarrett asked Warren, “Can you be confirmed?”","2310","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren had cultivated Jarrett as an ally, much as she had Camden Fine. The two women met soon after Warren first arrived in Washington, in early 2009, and they regularly dined together and talked about policy. In the early days, the Obama Administration was dominated by male economic advisers whom many critics on the left considered too sympathetic to the large banks. Warren helped Jarrett serve as a counterweight to Larry Summers, who was Obama’s top economic adviser and a White House rival for turf and power in the first two years of Obama’s Presidency. A former White House official said, “With the economic team, Valerie found it necessary to carry other voices into the White House herself. An added factor was that Elizabeth Warren is a strong woman and she and Valerie saw each other as kindred spirits.”","2311","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Jarrett helped persuade Obama to champion Warren’s new agency, but she was skeptical about Warren’s political usefulness. Warren suggested a compromise: let her spend the next year setting up the new agency, and then the President could decide whether he wanted to nominate her as its first official director. Jarrett agreed. Geithner opposed the idea, but Jarrett’s opinion prevailed with Obama, and Warren officially went to work under Geithner at Treasury to establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Geithner writes that he was in favor of having Warren set up the agency, but Warren insisted to me that he opposed her. “It was a big struggle to get me in there to set it up,” she said.","2312","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The Administration’s enthusiasm for Warren continued to diminish. The Democrats lost the House to the Republicans in the 2010 midterms, and the Administration was looking for areas of compromise, not confrontation. Warren “has an oversized personality and at Treasury she ruffled a few feathers when she came on board,” a former senior White House official said.","2313","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The former White House official said, “I think in Valerie’s mind it wasn’t about Elizabeth Warren. It was about the President—where he wanted to go and what he wanted to get done. She respects people who are on the team, and that’s part of being on the team: you respect the President’s choice and you don’t try to jam him into making a decision. The Warren-for-C.F.P.B. boomlet began to look a lot more like it was about Warren than about President Obama and the goals of the Administration. And once that happens you lose Valerie.”","2314","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine, who saw the drama unfold, said of Warren and Jarrett, “She and Valerie had a love-hate relationship. In Valerie Jarrett’s mind, she is and always will be the queen bee. And she doesn’t want anybody else to become another force within the Administration.” Warren was diplomatic. “Valerie was enormously helpful when we were trying to get the consumer agency passed into law,” she told me. “Valerie is a friend.” When I asked if the relationship soured, she said, “I don’t think so. Valerie’s always been supportive.” In June, 2011, Obama asked Warren to come to the White House, and he informed her that she wasn’t getting the job. Fine blamed Geithner and pressure from Wall Street for the Administration’s decision. “Geithner despised her, and he’s the one who torpedoed her nomination,” Fine said. “He knew that she was a thorn in the side of his buddies up on Wall Street.” That probably overstates Geithner’s opposition. His legislative aides, who were in charge of Treasury’s relations with Congress, told him that the Senate Democratic leadership believed that Warren couldn’t win a confirmation fight, but Geithner left the decision up to Obama.","2315","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“Of course I was disappointed,” Warren told me. “I loved that work and I loved that agency.” The Warren adviser said that Warren was devastated after the meeting with Obama. “She wanted that job. She begged for it. She told the President, she told Valerie, she told them fifty times over. It was her baby. It was like taking away her child. It’s a very powerful agency, and it was her dream.”","2316","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The former senior White House official, who was involved in the decision, defended it on political grounds. “If she could have been confirmed, the President would have gone forward,” he said. “It became apparent that there was just no way the Republicans were going to do this.” He added, “She didn’t totally agree with that. She wanted to make this a fight.” In July of 2013, the Senate approved Richard Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general and state treasurer, as the new bureau’s director.","2317","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Shortly before Warren left Washington and moved back to Massachusetts, she met again with the President. “You are the very best we have,” Obama told her. “I only wish I spoke as well as you.” On her last day at the agency, the Warren adviser said, “she walked out quietly, in tears, and that was it.”","2318","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In late March, Warren stood before a crowd of small-business owners and government bureaucrats in the ballroom of the Sheraton Hotel in the Boston suburb of Framingham. She was hosting the annual “matchmaker” meeting of a program that she created to help Massachusetts businesses win more government contracts. A few days earlier, in an editorial, the Boston Globe wrote, “Democrats would be making a big mistake if they let Hillary Clinton coast to the Presidential nomination without real opposition, and, as a national leader, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren can make sure that doesn’t happen.” But few people encountering Warren for the first time at that event would have left the room taken with the idea that she was a natural candidate for President. Warren told the crowd that, when she spent her year in Washington building the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, she was frustrated that the same big companies got all the contracts. “This is all about business matchmaking,” she declared, pumping her arm. “Get out there and make some matches!”","2319","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Five minutes later, she stepped off the stage and hurried to a waiting car in front of the hotel. A few Boston reporters, eager for a comment from her about the Globe editorial, chased her out the door. Warren, who is well known in Washington for dodging the press when convenient—“She’s been known to pull out the old cell phone and pretend to be talking,” Jim Manley, Harry Reid’s former spokesman, said—sped off as reporters shouted at her. One shook her head and sighed, “I can’t believe this woman. She never answers a single question.”","2320","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren learned to be a highly disciplined politician during her 2012 Senate campaign. When Obama refused to nominate her to head the new consumer agency, his longtime adviser Pete Rouse told her that she should run for the Senate. Harry Reid also encouraged her. “Republicans were afraid of her,” he told me. “So what did they do? They said they would block her nomination. And thank goodness they did. Because after that I worked with Elizabeth and others to see if she would run against Scott Brown, who I thought was one of the worst senators in the history of my being around here. I mean, what a phony. In 2011, we worked hard to get her to run.”","2321","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren was skeptical. She wasn’t from Massachusetts and had never run for office; in January of 2010, Brown had become a hero on the right when, in a surprise victory, he was elected to finish the term of Ted Kennedy, who died in 2009. But Rouse argued that in a Presidential election year Warren would benefit from a surge of pro-Obama Democrats who hadn’t voted in the 2010 special election. More important, her reputation as the liberal conscience of the Obama Administration had created a national fund-raising network for her. She raised forty-two million dollars, becoming one of the best-funded Senate candidates in history. More than half of the money came through her Web site and more than seventy per cent from outside Massachusetts.","2322","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"But for much of the campaign Warren was down in the polls, struggling to defend previous claims of Cherokee ancestry, and she was forced to run a TV spot about the controversy. “As a kid, I never asked my mom for documentation when she talked about our Native American heritage,” she said in the ad. “What kid would? But I knew my father’s family didn’t like that she was part Cherokee and part Delaware, so my parents had to elope.” Brown suggested that she had used the claim as an affirmative-action tool to advance through the academic ranks at Penn and Harvard. Conservatives spoke of “Fauxcahontas.”","2323","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The affirmative-action claim turned out to be meritless. “It never came up here in the appointments process,” Minow, the Harvard Law School dean, told me. “I was on the faculty when she was hired. They had no idea. Nobody did. It was a nonissue. Somebody checked a box at some point to report to the federal government or whatever. But it’s nothing that the faculty ever discussed—ever.”","2324","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren spoke at the Democratic Convention that September, before Bill Clinton, who delivered a memorable defense of Obama’s record. Although Warren’s address will not go down in the pantheon of great Convention speeches, she broke through in the polls soon afterward—aided by some debate performances against Brown—and she won by almost eight points. Throughout her campaign, she said that she wouldn’t go to Washington to be a polite senator who got along with her colleagues but accomplished nothing.","2325","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In the Senate, Warren has struggled to live up to the promises of her campaign. It’s not entirely her fault. The Senate was designed to foster long careers, and she is one of a hundred members in a body that operates under arcane rules and is hobbled by a super-majority requirement. In 2013 and 2014, she was a member of the majority, which gave her more leverage, but now—as one of the least senior members of the minority party—she has limited power and influence. I asked her how she can make a difference when she serves in a branch of government that has come to be defined by the fact that it does so little.","2326","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“Let me describe it differently,” she said. “I’m actually quite optimistic. There are a lot of tools in the toolbox.” She added that there is plenty of existing law governing how big financial institutions deal with America’s families but that government agencies don’t often use it. “One of the things that I work on as a senator is how to get the agencies to do that. And, if we can, the aircraft carrier moves one degree. Maybe two. But add that up over time, and pretty soon we’ll hit fifteen degrees.”","2327","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"She had just learned that the Department of Education would not renew a debt-collection contract for Navient, a student-loan company that she has frequently criticized. The company was alleged to have violated federal rules in the way it collected payments from young people. It often failed to disclose payment plans that were available to debtors, a practice that led to higher profits for Navient. “The world just shifted one degree,” Warren said. “It will affect, over time, millions of people if there’s better debt collection. That is, more people who can get into the right repayment program, who can continue to repay, more people who will get the debt forgiveness that’s available to them as a matter of law. This isn’t charity. This is what the law says.” She added, “The playing field just got one degree more level. And that is good.”","2328","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Sometimes Warren is compared to super-partisans like Ted Cruz, one of the most outspoken and conservative Republicans in the Senate. Her aides and some Democratic senators object to the analogy, seeing Cruz and his colleagues as undisciplined conservative activists who insert themselves into every public fight. “He’s a pain in the ass to his own Republicans,” Reid said. “She’s not.” Warren sees herself as more selective in her battles, which can be an asset. “The people who are the most effective senators are the people who, if I said their names, you could tell me two or three things they really care about,” former Senator Christopher Dodd said. I recently watched Warren speak at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Iran sanctions. During most hearing appearances, she launches into a soliloquy or berates a witness. She holds typed notes and can be seen nervously lip-synching as she prepares for her moment on camera.","2329","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"But at the sanctions hearings Warren made a short opening statement saying she believed that negotiations with Iran are the best option to prevent war, then explained that she wanted to hear the witnesses to understand if any new sanctions would help or hurt that process. (She later voted against the sanctions plan, which was being led by hawkish Republicans.)","2330","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren’s two biggest confrontations have been over Obama nominees whom she saw as too oriented toward Wall Street. While she was setting up the new consumer agency, Warren learned how the decision-making process works for high-profile nominees, and she knew from her own experience that, if Congress creates enough of a problem for a nominee, Obama will abandon him or her. Warren’s advisers believe that Obama has a low tolerance for political pain. Critics accuse Warren of grandstanding, but her aides insist that she is simply trying to influence decision-making.","2331","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The first Obama nominee she helped scuttle was Larry Summers, whom Obama considered nominating as Fed chairman. She collaborated with her old friend Camden Fine. “She and I worked pretty closely together to torpedo Larry Summers,” Fine said, recalling a secret campaign they undertook. In the spring of 2013, Fine told the Administration that his organization was going to publicly oppose Summers as chairman. It would have been the first time in the group’s nearly hundred-year history that it took a position on a Fed chairman. Fine couldn’t believe that Obama was going to pass up the opportunity to nominate Janet Yellen, who would be the first female chair of the Fed.

"Fine worked on moderate and conservative Senate Democrats, such as Jon Tester, of Montana, while Warren lobbied liberals. When enough of the senators came out publicly against Summers, Obama gave up. “Warren got a couple of the progressive senators to oppose Summers,” Fine said, “and then I got a couple of the conservative Democratic senators, including Tester, to come out.” Senator Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, who led the effort in support of Yellen, told me, “Senator Tester’s public statement seemed to be the straw that broke the camel’s back.”","2335","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Late last year, Warren seized on a Treasury Department nominee named Antonio Weiss, a former managing director at Lazard, where he had worked on so-called inversions, the practice by which a U.S. company moves its headquarters to an overseas location in order to lower its tax exposure. (In 2005, Lazard moved its headquarters to Bermuda.) Although the Administration has publicly opposed inversions, Obama picked Weiss to be Under-Secretary for Domestic Finance, a top position at Treasury. Warren orchestrated a campaign against him. Outside liberal groups that had championed her during her Senate race started a petition against Weiss, while she used outlets like the Huffington Post to criticize him. Inside the Senate, she quietly lobbied the liberals again, and one by one they started to come out against him.","2336","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The former senior White House official said that he was “disappointed and surprised” by the opposition, because Warren began her public campaign just weeks after Democrats lost the Senate to the Republicans in the midterm elections. “The President had just gotten killed in the election, and this is one of his first appointments,” he said. “I don’t object to her opposing Antonio Weiss, but I would have liked to see her at least wait a little bit, give the President a little bit of space, maybe meet with the guy before she came out and attacked him and said he’s unqualified because he worked on Wall Street. But that’s consistent with her brand, and it worked for her.”","2337","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"

"Clinton’s advisers are respectful of Warren, but they privately argue that Clinton has a more sophisticated understanding of the economy, and that Warren places too much blame on Wall Street as the root of America’s economic problems. “The challenge of wage stagnation is that it’s happening in large swaths of the economy, many parts of which are relatively untouched by the influence of the banks,” a longtime Clinton adviser said. “There is a legitimate line of economic thought that countries without as large a financial sector as the U.S. have less inequality, but Goldman Sachs doesn’t really have much to do with the rise of Uber and TaskRabbit.”","2341","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren took exception to the Clinton camp’s critique. “I think it’s important to hold Wall Street accountable,” she told me. “Some of the biggest financial institutions in this country developed a business model around cheating American families, and they put out the riskiest possible products. They sold mortgages that were like grenades with the pins pulled out, and then they packaged up those risks and sold them to pension plans and municipal governments, groups that did not intend to buy high-risk financial products.

When she got into politics, she said, “first, it was for my own family and my children, then a little bit bigger, for my brothers and to take care of my mom and dad, and then my students, and then my work about what’s happening to families just like mine all over this country.

"In April, 1927, after spring thaws and weeks of heavy rain, dozens of swollen tributaries poured into the Mississippi River, pushing it beyond its boundaries and initiating the twenty-seven-thousand-square-mile catastrophe that came to be known as the Great Flood. The river breached levees, funnelling as much as thirty feet of water into the surrounding areas; swept away homes; and wrought devastation unfathomable even in a region long accustomed to cyclical flooding. Bessie Smith etched the memory of the disaster into popular culture with “Backwater Blues,” a song written during the turbulent season that led up to the flood: “When it thunders and lightnin’ / and the wind begins to blow, There’s thousands of people / ain’t got no place to go.”","2365","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/race-and-the-storm"
"The waters wound through a South that was still defined by agricultural labor and debt peonage. Like the Mississippi itself, tumbling along a route constructed for it by a primitive levee system, the disaster followed a path that had been engineered beforehand, disproportionately affecting the poor, mostly black laborers who were anchored to the land by sharecropping contracts. In some instances, Red Cross supplies were disbursed to landlords, who sold them to tenant farmers. Tent encampments (then known as concentration camps) allowed entry to blacks fleeing the storm but required that they obtain special passes in order to leave. The black labor force was already diminished by the Great Migration, and the main concern was to insure that blacks would not use the flood as an opportunity to flee North. Herbert Hoover, the Secretary of Commerce, was appointed to head the recovery effort. In response to allegations of racism and mistreatment, he appointed a commission led by Robert Moton, a protégé of Booker T. Washington’s, and his successor at the Tuskegee Institute, to examine the charges. That report was not issued until 1929, safely after the 1928 election, in which Hoover had feared losing the traditionally Republican black vote, but the damage was inescapable. In 1932, African-Americans deserted the G.O.P. to support Franklin Roosevelt, beginning a major realignment in American politics, and Hoover’s handling of the catastrophe was part of the reason for the shift.","2366","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/race-and-the-storm"
"As Richard Mizelle writes, in his history of the flood (also titled “Backwater Blues”), what happened in 1927 is “part of a much longer narrative of how race, class, gender, and questions of social worth are framed through an environmental disaster.” That pattern has grown only more apparent. History, social science, and common sense have made it increasingly difficult not to consider the term “natural disaster” as a linguistic diversion, one that carries a hint of absolution. Hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods are natural phenomena; disasters, however, are often the work of humankind. The earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010 was two orders of magnitude weaker than the one that struck off the coast of Japan in 2011, yet it resulted in fifteen times more fatalities. The disparity was largely due to the relative geopolitical and economic standings of the two nations, and the corresponding standards of housing.","2367","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/race-and-the-storm"
"A decade after Hurricane Katrina, the images that it produced remain fresh in memory: bodies floating by major thoroughfares, the horrorscape of the Superdome, people stranded on rooftops like urban castaways. Official estimates hold that eighteen hundred and thirty-three people died as a result of the hurricane and the subsequent breaches of the levees. There is a temptation to say that the storm also swept away a particular kind of innocence about American poverty, but, in the days afterward, polls showed stark disparities in how blacks and whites viewed the federal government’s tardy response to the crisis and the role that race played in it. Sixty per cent of blacks said that the response was slow because of the race of the storm’s primary victims; only about twelve per cent of whites concurred. Sixty-three per cent of blacks felt that the response was slow because the victims were poor, a sentiment shared by just twenty-one per cent of whites.","2368","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/race-and-the-storm"
"Katrina didn’t usher in a new narrative about race in America as much as it confirmed an old one. In 2006, Lil Wayne, a New Orleans native, released “Georgia . . . Bush,” an indignant screed in which he claimed that the hurricane should have been named for the President who had presided over the mismanagement of the calamity. In the song, Wayne repeated a commonly held belief that the levees in the Lower Ninth Ward didn’t fail but were detonated, so that the more valuable white neighborhoods would be spared—a rumor that also spread about the flood that engulfed the city after Hurricane Betsy, in 1965. The past haunts at the peripheries. For one set of people, Katrina was a tragedy compounded by ineptitude; for another, it was a recasting of a drama that stretched back at least eight decades and suggested that, if the past is prologue, the disaster was not just predictable but possibly inevitable.","2369","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/race-and-the-storm"
"Residents of St. Bernard Parish, who blocked the roads in order to keep black residents leaving the city from coming through their community, were playing a part similar to that of those who, nearly eighty years ago, refused to allow blacks to leave the relief camps. In 2013, the Parish paid $2.5 million to settle lawsuits, one filed by the Department of Justice, alleging that it had contrived ordinances to prevent African-Americans from moving there after the storm. The population of New Orleans went from being sixty-seven per cent black, in 2005, to fifty-nine per cent, in 2013, which literally changed the color of the electoral politics in the city.","2370","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/race-and-the-storm"
"The ghosts of the past remain discernible in at least one other way. Media reports often referred to New Orleanians displaced by Katrina as “refugees,” a word that, in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, seventy-seven per cent of blacks, and just thirty-seven per cent of whites, took exception to. The term, with its connotations of foreigners crossing borders to seek asylum, cut closer to the bone in a population whose citizenship has so frequently been challenged. Katrina can be viewed as the first of a series of crises that seem to have become a referendum on black citizenship. The poll respondents were asked if they were “bothered” by the word “refugee.” The presumption was that many took issue with a loaded term being applied inaccurately. A decade later, it’s worth wondering whether they were “bothered” by a fear that “refugee,” not “citizen,” had been the most apt description all along. ♦","2371","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/race-and-the-storm"

Initially, Stewart seemed ill at ease with the trappings of his position. He wore a suit that first night, and, in the midst of an interview with the actor Michael J. Fox, he blurted, “Honestly, I feel like this is my bar mitzvah. I’ve never worn something like this, and I have a rash like you wouldn’t believe.” The evening was rounded out by a report on the Clinton impeachment hearings by Stewart’s “chief political correspondent,” a young improv comic named Stephen Colbert.","2376","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/exit-stage-left"
"Stewart soon found his footing, and what he became, with the help of his writers, his co-stars, and a tirelessly acute research team, was the best seriocomic reader of the press since A. J. Liebling laid waste to media barons like William Randolph Hearst and Colonel Robert R. McCormick. Stewart demonstrated that many of the tropes favored by the yellow press of Liebling’s day have only grown stronger. “There is no concept more generally cherished by publishers than that of the Undeserving Poor,” Liebling wrote. The contempt that he found in the plutocrat-owned, proletarian-read press, Stewart found on Fox News—particularly in ersatz journalists like Stuart Varney, a sneery character out of Dickens who regularly goes on about “these so-called poor people” who “have things” but “what they lack is the richness of spirit.” Stewart’s evisceration of Varney was typically swift and unforgiving. Perhaps his greatest single performance came in 2010, with a fifteen-minute-long bravura parody of the huckster and conspiracy theorist Glenn Beck.","2377","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/exit-stage-left"
"There was always something a little disingenuous about Stewart’s insistence that he is a centrist, free of ideological commitment to anything except truth and sanity. In fact, his politics tend to lean left of center. He’s been aggressive toward, and ruthlessly funny about, unsurprising targets from Donald Rumsfeld to Wall Street. His support for L.G.B.T. rights, civil rights, voting rights, and women’s rights has always been unambiguous. His critique of Obama is generally that of the somewhat disappointed liberal, particularly on issues like Guantánamo and drones. But Stewart is a centrist only in this sense: he is not so much pro-left as he is anti-bullshit.","2378","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/exit-stage-left"
"At the same time, he has occasionally dropped the nightly gagfest to reveal flashes of earnest anger and unironic heart. Just after 9/11, he began his program with a personal monologue: “The view from my apartment was the World Trade Center. And now it’s gone. And they attacked it, this symbol of American ingenuity and strength, and labor and imagination and commerce, and it is gone. But you know what the view is now? The Statue of Liberty. The view from the south of Manhattan is now the Statue of Liberty. You can’t beat that.” More recently, after a grand jury on Staten Island failed to bring any charges related to the death of Eric Garner, an African-American whose crime was the sale of loose cigarettes, Stewart declared himself dumbstruck. “I honestly don’t know what to say,” he told his audience. “If comedy is tragedy plus time, I need more [bleep]ing time. But I would really settle for less [bleep]ing tragedy.” Similarly, after this year’s mass murder in Charleston, Stewart said, “I honestly have nothing other than just sadness, once again, that we have to peer into the abyss of the depraved violence that we do to each other and the nexus of a just gaping racial wound that will not heal yet we pretend doesn’t exist.”","2379","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/exit-stage-left"

As Stewart put it wryly on one of his last nights on the air, “As I wind down my time here, I leave this show knowing that most of the world’s problems have been solved by us, ‘The Daily Show.’ But sadly there are still some dark corners that our broom of justice has not reached yet.” ♦","2380","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/exit-stage-left"
"We like our Presidents imperturbable, except when we don’t. We expect them to be dispassionate in times of difficulty, equable and unruffled in the face of setbacks, slights, and partisan attacks. Yet we also, from time to time, want to see a flash of indignation, a controlled burn. President Obama has shown so little of that kind of passion that his self-control has long been seen as a liability. In his performance at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner last month, Obama made light of that fact; he introduced “Luther,” the Presidential “anger translator,” who gave voice to Obama’s inner churn. The twist at the end of the skit was an outburst by Obama himself, making clear that, when provoked, he can express outrage perfectly well on his own.","May 14, 2015","2381","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/when-presidents-attack"
"This, it appears, was not a joke. Obama’s running argument with congressional Democrats over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pending trade accord, has flared up dramatically over recent days—eliciting, from the President, not indignation so much as raw irritation of a surprisingly personal nature. His potshots at Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has spoken out against the T.P.P., have been played and replayed by the White House press corps—and it would be churlish to deny them this pleasure; Obama gave good copy. He accused his sometime friend Warren of cynicism: “The truth of the matter,” he told the reporter Matt Bai last Friday, “is that Elizabeth is, you know, a politician like anybody else.” (This is the unkindest cut: when politicians call politicians “politicians.”) “And you know, she’s got a voice that she wants to get out there.” Warren’s arguments, the President added, are “hypothetical, speculative,” and unable to “stand the test of fact and scrutiny.”","2382","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/when-presidents-attack"
"The Presidential peeve was on further display in a speech that day in Oregon. Obama characterized his critics as panicked protectionists who want to “pull up the drawbridge and build a moat around ourselves,” and who are “making stuff up” in an attempt to obstruct the T.P.P. On Tuesday, Senate Democrats blocked the “fast-track” authority that the White House had sought for the trade pact, which would have given it the ability to speed its passage by keeping it free of amendments. It’s unlikely that the President’s huff cost him the vote, but it’s unlikely that it helped him, either. Representative Louise Slaughter, of New York, called his criticism of congressional Democrats “completely inaccurate”; Senator Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, complained that Obama “made this more personal than he needed to,” and wondered why Obama had referred to Warren by her first name, “when he might not have done that for a male senator, perhaps?” (Politico reported that the President has, on at least one occasion, referred to Brown publicly as “Sherrod.” The White House press secretary predicted on Wednesday that Brown will “find a way to apologize” to Obama for the allegation.)","2383","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/when-presidents-attack"
"Presidents, like parents, expect from their kin certain deference, if not outright obedience, and intra-party disputes do not tend to bring out the best in our commanders-in-chief. As Peter Baker, of the Times, has pointed out, George W. Bush, at a similar point in his Presidency, lost his patience with Republicans who were obstructing an immigration bill he had developed in collaboration with Democrats. In a speech in Glynco, Georgia, in May of 2007, Bush charged that conservative critics didn’t “want to do what’s right for America” and were “trying to frighten our fellow citizens” by using words like “amnesty.” In response, a Heritage Foundation analyst used words like “yelling” and “screaming” to describe what Bush was doing. The following month, Senate Republicans killed the bill. “A lot of us worked hard to see if we couldn’t find common ground. It didn’t work,” Bush said flatly.","2384","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/when-presidents-attack"
"Sometimes, though, Presidents pick a fight. In 1993, as a condition of their support of the North American Free Trade Association, Republican leaders on Capitol Hill told President Clinton privately that they would “release” their votes if he started a public battle with his base. “They wanted him to bleed some political capital,” recalled a senior Clinton aide who was involved in the negotiations. That November, Clinton attacked “labor forces” for applying “real roughshod, muscle-bound tactics” on undecided Democrats, “telling these members in private they’ll never give them any money again, they’ll get them opponents in the primary.” This had its intended effect: it infuriated a key Democratic constituency. (It also necessitated a Presidential apology to Lane Kirkland, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.) But Clinton had managed to keep Republicans on board without impugning Democrats who saw NAFTA as a threat to American jobs. “I understand those fears,” Clinton said in an interview. “I mean, I have never questioned the integrity of anybody’s anxiety.”","2385","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/when-presidents-attack"
"But these are mere spats, snits, and tiffs when compared to Franklin Roosevelt’s attempt, in 1938, to drive from the Democratic Party the “reactionaries” who had killed his plan to pack the Supreme Court. That August, F.D.R. stood on a stage in Barnesville, Georgia, in the presence of Senator Walter George, one of the recalcitrants, and endorsed his opponent in the primary election. “On most public questions,” Roosevelt declared, George “and I do not speak the same language.” Roosevelt defined his “test” for any Democratic candidate: whether he “really, deep down in his heart” shared the Party’s objectives—as determined by Roosevelt. F.D.R.’s “purge” was a disaster: not only did he fail to dislodge even a single senator who had opposed him on the Court plan, but he pried wider the divisions that existed in the party.","2386","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/when-presidents-attack"
"In May, 1966, after Lyndon Johnson delivered a public scolding to antiwar Democrats, Harry McPherson—the wisest of Johnson’s White House aides—warned L.B.J. that “those who disagree feel further estranged by high-powered shouting.” This is still good counsel. Petulance is rarely rewarded. Displays of pique are displays of weakness. In Obama’s case, they signal a slide in political standing and a slackening of personal discipline, neither of which will serve him well during his remaining time in office. Trade, after all, is not the only issue that puts him at odds with Democrats on Capitol Hill—tax reform and energy exploration are others—and Obama needs Congress at this point more than Congress needs him. He should, at the very least, contain his obvious contempt for those who see things differently than he does. They might indeed be wrong—even “absolutely wrong,” as Obama said of Elizabeth Warren—but not all of them are benighted; not all of them are cynics.

"On March 4, 1865, after days of heavy rain, President Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address in a soggy capital to tens of thousands of Americans gathered in the mud and the muck. The speech was brief but profound and elegant. The abolitionist and orator Frederick Douglass called it “a sacred effort.” Lincoln began humbly, noting that the address was hardly necessary compared to the lengthy message given at his first inaugural. That speech was given on March 4, 1861, on the eve of the Civil War, after seven Southern states had seceded and formed the Confederate States of America. Four years later, the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, the war was nearly over, and the Confederacy had been soundly defeated.","June 29, 2015","2388","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/barack-obamas-second-inaugural-in-charleston"
"Lincoln did not gloat over the South’s drubbing as some Radical Republicans wished he had. Instead, he cited the eighteenth chapter of the Book of Matthew to explain that the war was a God-given tragedy that required the atonement of both the North and the South: “All dreaded it—all sought to avert it.” As Lincoln explained, “Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other…. The prayers of both could not be answered; that of neither has been answered fully…. Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather than let it perish.” The war was no one’s fault, but, as Lincoln believed, “The Almighty has His own purposes.” Through a providential interpretation of the war, Lincoln hoped to reunite a divided country.","2389","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/barack-obamas-second-inaugural-in-charleston"

Only the war’s end would purge America of its national sin of holding human beings in bondage. Counselling “malice toward none; with charity for all,” Lincoln hoped that the nation would move forward together. Lincoln recognized the power of the second inaugural and, eleven days later, he wrote to Thurlow Weed, a Republican organizer in New York, that he expected it “to wear as well as—perhaps better than—any thing I have produced.”","2390","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/barack-obamas-second-inaugural-in-charleston"
"A hundred and fifty years later, President Barack Obama surely also feels a certain kind of achievement after the eulogy that he delivered at the Reverend Clementa Pinckney’s funeral on Friday. In a rousing remembrance, Obama invoked scripture and song to comfort and inspire the more than fifty-five hundred mourners in attendance and countless others who watched the ceremony. Obama envisioned the deaths of the nine people gunned down in the basement of the historic Emanuel A.M.E. Church during a Bible study as a conduit that might move the nation forward. Their heart-rending deaths might give birth to new life in the nation and move all Americans closer to justice, equality, and ever-elusive grace. There was much meaning to be found in the work that each victim did, and there was grace in the radical forgiveness that the families offered to the killer in the midst of their unspeakable grief.","2391","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/barack-obamas-second-inaugural-in-charleston"

A multiracial and bipartisan group of leaders and legislators, including the Republican Governor Nikki Haley, have called for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the capitol grounds in Columbia, South Carolina.

"Lincoln’s untimely death would not allow him to complete the work that he called for in his second inaugural. He was assassinated only a month after he delivered the speech. Historians and other scholars have long speculated on what kind of nation America might be if Lincoln had lived; if Andrew Johnson, the Southern-born Confederate sympathizer and former slave owner, had not become President; if the federal government had put its full weight and moral force behind creating a biracial democracy, enabling African-Americans to own land, and protecting the precious and fragile right to vote.","2393","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/barack-obamas-second-inaugural-in-charleston"
"For Obama, the question is what he can get done in the year and a half he still has in office. There is much to do, including unfinished work that still remains from as long ago as Lincoln’s day. Perhaps, as Obama suggested the day after the massacre, gun control will be at the top of the list. This also may be the moment when Obama turns the stirring prose of the eulogy into meaningful policies, and helps push the nation to face the structural problems that prevent African-Americans and people of color from living their best, fullest, and longest lives. These obstacles include, as the President said, biases in hiring practices, stark racial disparities in housing and education, restrictions on the right to vote, police violence, poverty, and, perhaps the most unconscionable factor, the rise of the carceral state. As Michelle Alexander explains in “The New Jim Crow,” there are now more African-American men behind bars or on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850.","2394","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/barack-obamas-second-inaugural-in-charleston"

The times were quite different: an entire nation devastated in the case of Lincoln, and a much smaller, if still deeply profound, tragedy today. But both Presidents grasped these moments to imagine with their audiences the path to a more perfect union. Lincoln called on Northerners and Southerners to “strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds,” while Obama sang “Amazing Grace” to remind Americans that that “out of this terrible tragedy, God has visited grace upon us, for He has allowed us to see where we’ve been blind….

"Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic senator from California, is making a late career of not quite pleasing anyone. After five decades in politics, Feinstein, at eighty-one, is the oldest sitting member of the Senate, where a late term is often less a valedictory than a chance for activism: think of Edward Kennedy or Mitch McConnell. With its elaborate rankings and deferential codes, the Senate rewards longevity; senior members have better committee seats, more loyal patrons, first choice of desk space in the chamber. As they near retirement age—whatever that means, in an institution where nearly a quarter of the members are over seventy—senators can hope to change a thing or two.","2398","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"When Barack Obama took office, on January 20, 2009, the Democrats held the Senate, and Feinstein had just become chairman of the powerful Intelligence Committee. At Obama’s inaugural ceremony, she delivered the welcoming remarks, standing before an eager crowd and declaring, “Future generations will mark this morning as the turning point for real and necessary change in our nation.” Skeptics on the National Mall might have noted that this was not a novel sentiment in such speeches, but for Feinstein it was an earnest indicator of political engagement. As the Bush Administration came to an end, the country was reconsidering the decisions of the previous eight years, particularly the ethics of the War on Terror.","2399","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein is sometimes described as a centrist, but it is because her views are varied, not because they are mild; she thinks of herself, more accurately, as a pragmatist. Especially in recent years, on issues she cares deeply about, she will take positions that other senators do not. Feinstein has pursued a deal to prevent Iran from building nuclear arms more intently than any of her colleagues. In March, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress, in the hope of averting a possible deal, Feinstein appeared on “Meet the Press” and said, “What Prime Minister Netanyahu did here was something no ally of the United States would have done.” When I saw her the next day, she told me, “For Netanyahu to come here with a clear view of preventing an agreement was really inappropriate. Particularly because this President’s Administration has provided more than twenty-five billion dollars to Israel, far more than to any other country.”","2400","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Although Feinstein mostly votes with the Democrats, she is less predictable than many of her colleagues. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, she voted to confirm several of President George W. Bush’s nominees. In 2007, she endorsed Michael Mukasey for attorney general—even as he dodged the question of whether waterboarding is torture, saying only, “If it amounts to torture, then it is not constitutional.” A Democrat from hyper-liberal San Francisco, she has persistently defended government surveillance programs and targeted killings by drones, and she has been one of the C.I.A.’s most faithful supporters. Last year, after President Obama called to move authority for drone strikes from the C.I.A. to the Defense Department, Feinstein placed a classified amendment in a spending bill that helped keep the program where it was. When the activist Edward Snowden revealed that the N.S.A. had amassed the phone records of vast numbers of American citizens, he was hailed on the left as a whistle-blower. Feinstein said, “I don’t look at this as being a whistle-blower. I think it’s an act of treason.” Advocates for human rights and civil liberties responded with angry editorials. The journalist Glenn Greenwald has said that her “disgusting rhetoric recalls the worst of Dick Cheney.”","2401","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The former Secretary of State George Shultz, who has raised money for Feinstein’s campaigns from Republican friends in California, told me, “Dianne is not really bipartisan so much as nonpartisan.” Slightly formal in style, she adheres faithfully to procedure and protocol; she believes in settling disputes privately, and by argument rather than by force. Even in less than momentous situations, she is a dogged negotiator. William Luers, a former ambassador and the head of the Iran Project, recalled, “I don’t think anyone has a meeting with her where she says, ‘I’m with you all the way.’ Rather, she says, ‘I’m with you, but you have to understand under what terms.’ ”","2402","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In her office recently, she described how she broke with the C.I.A. over the detention and interrogation program that began in the days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. From the first time Feinstein was briefed about the program, she opposed it. On September 6, 2006, Michael Hayden, the C.I.A. director, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee and described a network of “black sites”: secret facilities where C.I.A. interrogators subjected detainees to “enhanced interrogation techniques,” seeking information about possible terrorist attacks. Hayden, self-assured and pugnacious, insisted that the interrogations were carefully run and unassailably effective. Afterward, Feinstein wrote to him that his testimony was “extraordinarily problematic,” and that she was “unable to understand why the C.I.A. needs to maintain this program.” In November, when Hayden appeared before the committee again, Feinstein peppered him with questions. She wanted to know how the agency guarded against abuse, whether detainees were stripped of their clothes, whether they were fed during periods of sleep deprivation. Although she and several colleagues raised objections, Hayden, not long afterward, told a meeting of foreign diplomats, “This is not C.I.A.’s program. This is not the President’s program. This is America’s program.”","2403","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In December, 2007, the Times revealed that C.I.A. officers had secretly destroyed videotapes of interrogations, against the advice of White House officials. A few days later, Hayden, insisting to the Intelligence Committee that there had been no “destruction of evidence,” turned over cables related to those taped interrogations. For months, two committee staff members reviewed the cables, which described the interrogations of Abu Zubaydah, whom the C.I.A. suspected was a high-ranking Al Qaeda member, and of a detainee named Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.","2404","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In February, 2009, the staff members appeared before the committee and described what they had found. Nearly twenty-four hours a day for twenty days, Abu Zubaydah was stripped naked and subjected to multiple “enhanced” techniques: slammed into a wall, slapped, deprived of sleep, confined in a coffin-size box, forced into painful postures. He was also waterboarded at least eighty-three times. Two psychologists, contracted by the C.I.A. to develop and run the interrogation program, reported that Abu Zubaydah was “ready to talk” during the first exposure, but “we chose to expose him over and over until we had a high degree of confidence he wouldn’t hold back.” After the first waterboarding sessions, a C.I.A. official wrote, “Several on the team profoundly affected . . . some to the point of tears.” By the seventh day, the C.I.A. team had informed headquarters that it was unlikely Abu Zubaydah had the threat information the agency was seeking, but the team was instructed to continue. During one waterboarding session, investigators found later, Abu Zubaydah “became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.”","2405","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Nashiri was subjected to similar measures. Investigators determined that he was put in a “standing stress position,” with “his hands affixed over his head,” for at least two days. It was implied that his mother would be brought before him and sexually abused. He was waterboarded. After each session, his interrogators reported that he was coöperative, but officials told them to persist, because he had not provided information on imminent attacks. When the interrogators objected, they were replaced.","2406","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein described the interrogations as “ugly, visceral.” As the new chairman of the committee, she had the authority to try to effect change. “You set the table, so to speak,” she said recently. “You make the determinations, what will come up, what the committee will do.” She called for a full investigation of the C.I.A. program, and the committee voted in favor of it, 14–1. That was the genesis of what became known as the torture report, a sixty-seven-hundred-page tome, laden with footnotes. When the report was completed, in December, 2012, it included an appendix devoted to Hayden, detailing more than thirty misstatements in one session of his testimony. (Hayden argues that the Democrats misinterpreted the intent of his testimony, saying, “I described the norms—how things were supposed to work—and they found the exceptions.”)","2407","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Michael Schiffer, who was a member of Feinstein’s staff for a decade, told me that Feinstein retains a stubborn, perhaps naïve faith that the system is run by people who are trying to do the right thing for the country. “When that faith is shaken, she is really determined to do something about it,” he said. “It was that faith that caused her to be so enraged about torture.” A former intelligence officer, who knew Feinstein from her years on the Intelligence Committee, saw her determination a little differently: “The worst thing, from Dianne Feinstein’s perspective, is trying to keep her from doing her job of oversight. And if you lie to her that’s bad.”","2408","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"When Obama took office, Feinstein assumed that he would be a strong ally. During the campaign, he had excoriated the Bush Administration for the C.I.A.’s interrogation program, forthrightly calling the interrogation tactics “torture.” On his second day in the White House, he issued an executive order that banned C.I.A. detention and effectively prohibited the use of waterboarding and other coercive techniques. In the end, though, what Feinstein’s group released was not the full report but a five-hundred-page executive summary, with a fraction of the meticulous, excruciating details. The summary’s release, last December, came after an eleven-month battle, in which Feinstein and several other Democrats on the committee fought strenuously against the C.I.A.—and, unexpectedly, the Obama White House.","2409","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"While many of those who had condemned Feinstein for her position on the N.S.A. praised her work on the report, the intelligence community, led by her former allies at the C.I.A., vilified her. Jeff Duncan, a Republican congressman from South Carolina, said that she was “as much a traitor to this country at this point” as Snowden was. Feinstein told me in her office that the torture report was the most important work of her career. But the process of getting it released, with all of the attendant conflict and compromise, was surely not the decisive victory she hoped for. Amy Zegart, an intelligence scholar at Stanford, said, “I can’t think of anyone else who’s been beaten up by so many different factions, over so many different issues, in such a short period of time.”","2410","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein began negotiating the terms of the committee’s investigation in the spring of 2009, during an unusual period of openness. The C.I.A. had a new director, Leon Panetta, a former congressman, whom Obama had instructed to improve the agency’s relationship with the legislature. (Panetta told a colleague that the directive was to “make love to Congress.”) Panetta agreed to give the committee access to millions of pages of documents: unredacted operational cables, e-mails, memos.","2411","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"But many members of the C.I.A. distrusted the inquiry from the beginning. “Feinstein’s report started as an attempt to get to the bottom of whether these ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ were valuable,” the former intelligence officer told me. “For many at the agency, just asking the question is unpatriotic.” The agency arranged for the Senate staff to work on the report not in the committee’s secure space, in the Hart Senate Office Building, but in a secret C.I.A. facility in northern Virginia, using a computer system that the C.I.A. provided.","2412","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Six Republicans on the committee voted in favor of the investigation, but by the fall of 2009 they had recused themselves. Democratic staff members worked alone at the C.I.A. site for three and a half years. In December, 2012, the committee approved the final report (eight Democrats and one Republican voted yes) and sent it to President Obama. The report concluded that the enhanced techniques were far more brutal than the agency had disclosed, and were an ineffective means of obtaining accurate information. The C.I.A. had justified them by enumerating terrorist plots that had been “thwarted.” The report examined twenty of these examples and found them “wrong in fundamental respects.”","2413","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein asked the White House to gather comments from the executive branch and respond by mid-February. Instead, the response arrived in June, sent by the C.I.A. By then, the agency had a new, less congenial director: John Brennan, a C.I.A. veteran who had served as Obama’s counterterrorism adviser. Brennan was upset about the inquiry at the start, according to a former White House official: “Feinstein had gotten Panetta to give up code names, references to other countries, spycraft stuff. Brennan was very concerned about people’s lives.” The response, which Brennan delivered personally to Feinstein and to the committee’s Republican vice-chairman, Saxby Chambliss, acknowledged that there had been “lapses,” and that some employees were not held accountable. But it strongly disputed the report’s major findings. For several months, the Senate staff members met with their C.I.A. counterparts to review the complaints. Relations grew only more poisonous.","2414","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On January 15th, Brennan summoned Feinstein and Chambliss to Room 217, a secure office in the Capitol, for an urgent meeting. Chambliss, a conservative from Moultrie, Georgia, recalled that the meeting began cordially but that Brennan soon began to display “an edge.” He told the two senators that, for several days, C.I.A. officials had been searching hard drives in a computer system that the committee’s staff members maintained at the C.I.A. site in Virginia. They had found copies of sensitive documents—which, he charged, the staff had acquired by hacking into the agency’s computer system. The atmosphere grew tense. “John was very forthright in his opinion that the staff had gone into C.I.A. computers,” Chambliss said. “John didn’t handle that right.”","2415","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The files that Brennan was concerned with were known in the agency as the Panetta review. As the C.I.A. turned over records to the committee, Panetta had ordered a team of his own to vet them, in an attempt to predict the committee’s findings. It was, in effect, the agency’s best effort to critique itself as unsparingly as the Senate staff would, and, according to people who have read it, it largely accorded with the congressional report. (The C.I.A. has countered that the Panetta team examined only about half the documents that were given to the committee, and that the review was an unapproved draft.) Senator Mark Udall, one of the Democrats on the Intelligence Committee, later said that the Panetta review—like the Senate report—found that, in an effort to justify torture, the C.I.A. repeatedly provided inaccurate information to Congress and the President about the efficacy of the enhanced techniques.","2416","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"A week before Feinstein and Chambliss met with Brennan, a C.I.A. official had told him that the Senate investigators might have obtained the Panetta review. Brennan ordered an investigation, and the next day an agency official reported that five Senate investigators had accessed the documents “thousands of times.” According to a memo from that official, included in a report by the C.I.A. inspector general, Brennan told him to “pursue all available options to determine how the documents came to be on the [Senate] side of the system.” That Saturday, the official recalled, Brennan called him at home, to urge him to find answers by “whatever means necessary.” (Brennan later told the inspector general that he “would never use those words.”)","2417","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"As Brennan recounted the charges to Feinstein and Chambliss, he grew more agitated. Senator Jay Rockefeller, Feinstein’s predecessor as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said, “Brennan has such an explosive temper. His face turns really red. Dianne seems to bring that out in him—because she’s so West Coast, calm, cool, stately.” Brennan said that the Senate staffers had printed out copies of the documents, and demanded that Feinstein return every one to the C.I.A.","2418","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein, recalling the meeting, said, “That was terrible! It was something I never expected to see in my government.” Senator Martin Heinrich, another Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, described her as alarmed, but also galvanized: “I think she knew, after that meeting, that it was going to be a real battle to bring the report out.” It was all the more extraordinary, he continued, because “I can honestly say I don’t know a bigger booster of the C.I.A. than Senator Feinstein.”","2419","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"During the long process of producing the report, Feinstein had immersed herself in memos and drafts. “You remember that movie ‘The Constant Gardener’?” Rockefeller said. “Dianne is the constant student.” Throughout, she remained a staunch supporter of the C.I.A., stressing that a relatively small number of employees were involved in the interrogation program. Obama had ended the program in January, 2009; she was merely trying to make sure that it was never repeated. Even Chambliss—who cast the sole vote against assembling the torture report, arguing that it was time to move forward—emphasized that he and Feinstein have otherwise been united in support of the intelligence community. After he became vice-chairman of the committee, in 2010, he said, “Dianne and I shared the common interest of making sure we did everything we could to give tools to our intelligence community to be able to protect Americans.” He added, “She might not agree with me. But she was not automatically going to be on the Democratic side of whatever the issue was.” Indeed, several of Feinstein’s Democratic colleagues on the committee—Martin Heinrich, Ron Wyden, and Mark Udall—opposed her on surveillance, and had pushed her to get the entire torture report declassified. Feinstein, concerned that the information in the full report would be too inflammatory, decided that the executive summary sufficed for the time being.","2420","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Two days after the meeting with Brennan, Feinstein wrote to him, urging him to stop investigating her staff, and noting that the C.I.A.’s search could well have violated constitutional principles of separation of powers. She and Chambliss wrote several more letters, asking who had authorized the searches, under what legal authority, and who had carried them out. For weeks, Brennan did not respond.","2421","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein spoke with officials at the White House and at the Department of Justice, and with the Senate legal counsel. In late January, the C.I.A. inspector general, David Buckley, learned about the search, and told Brennan that he was going to investigate the C.I.A.’s actions. According to three Senate aides, Brennan immediately told Buckley that he wanted him to conduct the investigation. “Publicly, Brennan appeared to be grabbing the situation by the horns, but he was actually pushed into it,” one aide said. (The agency maintains that Brennan requested the inquiry unprompted.)","2422","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Heinrich, Wyden, and Udall wanted to confront Brennan publicly, but Feinstein refused. Then, on January 29th, they had an opportunity: the Senate Intelligence Committee held its annual hearing on threat assessments, and Brennan was one of the witnesses. Heinrich told Brennan that the agency’s recent actions were “meant to intimidate, deflect, and thwart legitimate oversight.” When he asked about the Panetta review, Brennan deflected the question, saying that he would address the matter with the committee “at the appropriate time, and not at a threat-assessment hearing.”","2423","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"“Thank you, Mr. Brennan,” Feinstein said. “I believe that’s appropriate.”","2424","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Udall asked Brennan if he was aware of the Panetta review when he provided the C.I.A.’s response to the committee, and Brennan said, “I had not gone through it.” Udall, noting that the answer “strikes me as a bit improbable,” pressed forward. “Are you saying that the C.I.A. officers who were asked to produce this internal review got it wrong, just like you said the committee got it wrong? We had sixty-three hundred pages, six million documents, thirty-five thousand five hundred footnotes.” Brennan again said that he would respond “at the appropriate time.”","2425","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein spoke to Udall, off-microphone.","2426","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"“Madam chair, I still have two minutes remaining,” Udall protested.","2427","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"

"At the hearing, Brennan was imperturbable. When Wyden, Feinstein’s strongest adversary on privacy issues, asked whether the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act applies to the C.I.A., Brennan said, “I would have to look into what that act actually calls for and its applicability to C.I.A.’s authorities. And I’ll be happy to get back to you, Senator, on that.”","2429","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The torture issue has dogged Brennan. Obama, at the beginning of his first term, had wanted to make him director of the C.I.A., but backed away after human-rights advocates pointed out that Brennan had been the agency’s deputy executive director from 2001 to 2003, when many of the worst abuses occurred. (Brennan has said that he had “some visibility into some of the activities” of the detention program but that he was “not in the chain of command.”) Instead, Obama brought Brennan into the White House, as his counterterrorism adviser. Brennan told Charlie Rose recently that in those early days Obama “did not have a good deal of experience” with intelligence-related subjects, but that in the intervening years he had “gone to school and understands the complexities.” Brennan met with Obama frequently, helping to orchestrate a vast expansion of the targeted-killing program, and shaping the various “kill lists.” In the White House, he was described by other officials as Obama’s “father confessor,” who allowed the President comfort as his decisions took the lives of thousands of suspected militants, along with an unknown number of civilians.","2430","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"“John had a Jesuit education, he is a practicing Catholic, and I’ve heard him in meetings at the agency, talking about the theories of just war,” a former C.I.A. officer who has known Brennan for many years said. “He weighs things carefully.” The former intelligence officer said that Brennan was “a Dudley-Do-Right character, a guy who is convinced he is wearing the white hat. He has always wanted to be close to power—because, I think, he is convinced he can do good by being there.”","2431","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Robert Grenier, the former director of the C.I.A. Counterterrorism Center, has been friendly with Brennan since they were junior officers, and he has described Brennan as “highly ambitious and a talented bureaucratic infighter.” He told me that the agency’s leaders had such confidence in Brennan that, in 1996, they promoted him from an analyst to Riyadh station chief. The political skills that made him a good choice for that position were evident in his White House job, Grenier continued. “I’ve never seen anyone from that perch exert the kind of influence and even, to a certain extent, direct control,” he said, citing the targeted-killing program. “Unlike most of his predecessors, he actually understands the whole system from the inside. So he was in a position, with the weight of the President behind him, to really push himself into the middle of the process, and to control it.”","2432","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"When Obama nominated Brennan as C.I.A. director, in January, 2013, Brennan made his way dexterously through the confirmation process. During a hearing before the Intelligence Committee, Chambliss mentioned a private conversation in which Brennan had disparaged the committee’s report as “a prosecutor’s brief, written with an eye toward finding problems.” Rockefeller recounted a quite different conversation. “You told me that you were shocked at some of what you read,” he told Brennan. “I would hope . . . that you will make parts of this . . . required reading for your senior personnel so they can go through the same experience you went through. Are you willing to do that?”","2433","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"“Yes, Senator,” Brennan replied. “I am looking forward to taking advantage of whatever lessons come out of this chapter in our history and this committee’s report.”","2434","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"At Langley, Brennan’s performance caused consternation. “Career people back at the C.I.A., watching this, were dismayed,” John Rizzo, the agency’s former acting general counsel, recalled. “He seemed overly in agreement with the Democrats, and he made preliminary comments about what he’d seen in the report—said it was shocking.” At the hearing, Brennan earnestly promised to be forthcoming with the committee, and to “speak truth about power.” Early in his testimony, he acknowledged that there was a “trust deficit” between the committee and the C.I.A. “If I am confirmed,” he said, “I would make it my goal on day one of my tenure and every day thereafter to strengthen the trust between us.”","2435","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"At the close of the hearing, Feinstein told Brennan, “I’ve sat through a number of these hearings; I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone more forthright or more honest or more direct.”","2436","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In late January, 2014, as the fight over the C.I.A.’s search of the Senate computers continued, Brennan presented a security briefing to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a strong supporter of the torture report, and Reid offered some unsolicited advice. “He told Brennan, ‘You’re wrong here,’ ” a senior Senate staffer recalled. “ ‘There is no justification for breaking into the staff computers. Just say you did it. Say you’re sorry. John, it’s Dianne Feinstein. You are questioning her credibility, and she is an unimpeachable person.’ But Brennan said no. He was defiant.”","2437","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Instead, Brennan intensified his attack. On February 7th, the C.I.A.’s acting general counsel, Robert Eatinger, filed a crimes report with the Department of Justice. He stated that information made available to him suggested that a Senate staff member had exploited a security vulnerability “to access, copy, and bring across the firewall C.I.A. documents to which he or she did not have authorized access,” and that at least four other staff members had “accessed and printed these C.I.A. documents on multiple occasions.”","2438","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"According to Feinstein, the staff had identified the Panetta documents sometime in 2010 by using a search tool that the C.I.A. had provided. She told me that her staff members were unnerved by the C.I.A.’s attempt to instigate criminal charges. Still, she resisted going public. “Feinstein worked every internal lever she possibly could,” the Senate aide said. “It was frustrating to some of us, because we thought the only way you could have accountability over the C.I.A. was to start informing the public.”","2439","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein’s staff wrote a speech about the C.I.A.-Senate fight for her to deliver on the Senate floor, but for several weeks she resisted. In early March, articles about the conflict appeared in the press, including two in which unnamed sources suggested that the committee staffers had “hacked” into the C.I.A. network to obtain the Panetta review and that the C.I.A. had spied on the Senate staff’s computers. Brennan said, “I am deeply dismayed that some members of the Senate have decided to make spurious allegations about C.I.A. actions that are wholly unsupported by the facts.” On the weekend of March 8th, Reid called Feinstein several times. “She was saying, ‘I want to be fair, I want to be in the middle—I’m chairman,’ ” the senior Senate staffer recalled. “And Senator Reid was saying, ‘Look, you can’t stand by anymore! The C.I.A. is leaking stuff. They’re making your staff out to be the bad guys!’ ”","2440","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein reserved time on the Senate floor for Tuesday, March 11th, but even that morning her staff was not certain that she would give the speech. Ultimately, she told me, in her efforts to reach a private resolution with Brennan, “there comes a point where the stonewalling is such that you have to break through.” At about 9 a.m., Feinstein, dressed in a purple suit, walked to the lectern. “Let me say up front that I come to the Senate floor reluctantly,” she began. As her anger gradually built, the room was still. She summarily rejected the notion that her staff had hacked into C.I.A. computers; the documents had appeared on the Senate side of the network, and her staff members had printed them out. In 2013, Feinstein said, when the C.I.A. delivered its response to the report, the staff members noted major disparities with the Panetta review. The terms that she had originally negotiated with Panetta suggested that the C.I.A. had to approve any documents that left the facility in Virginia. But the staff members, who knew that the agency had rescinded hundreds of files from the computer system, including the Panetta review, were afraid that it would confiscate the printouts. They redacted the names of non-supervisory C.I.A. personnel, along with information that might help locate detention sites, and then hauled the documents to the secure committee space in the Hart Building. Inside an inner office, they locked the documents in a safe.","2441","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein said that the C.I.A.’s search of the staff’s computers might well have violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers, as well as the Fourth Amendment, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and an executive order that prohibits the C.I.A. from conducting domestic searches or surveillance. The crimes report that the C.I.A. had filed with the Department of Justice, she said, was an effort “to intimidate this staff.” She noted that it had been filed by the C.I.A.’s acting general counsel, who had been a lawyer in the agency’s Counterterrorism Center, and was mentioned by name more than sixteen hundred times in the report. “How this is resolved,” she concluded, “will show . . . whether our work can be thwarted by those we oversee.”","2442","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"After Feinstein spoke, she went to the Senate Democratic Caucus weekly lunch. As she entered the room, her colleagues gave her a standing ovation. The Senate aide said, “I think it made her feel like, O.K., I’ve done the right thing. But then, within forty-eight or seventy-two hours, she was hearing from Chambliss and other Republican members of the committee: ‘Why did you have to go out there and do that? It was so partisan of you!’ And she started to feel, again, like, Maybe I shouldn’t have done that.”","2443","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Brennan, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations later that morning, said, “As far as the allegations of C.I.A. hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth. I mean, we wouldn’t do that. I mean, that’s—that’s just beyond the—you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do.” Although he stammered slightly, he spoke with his customary conviction, seeming disturbed only by the temerity of the accusation. Several weeks later, on Fox News, the former C.I.A. director Michael Hayden dismissed Feinstein as “emotional.”","2444","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On the morning of November 27, 1978, Dianne Feinstein, then forty-five years old, told reporters in the San Francisco City Hall press room that she was thinking about getting out of politics. She had been elected to the board of supervisors in 1969, and had become its first woman president. But she failed in a bid to become mayor in 1971 and again in 1975; the second time, she did not make the runoff. She had entered that race as the front-runner, so “it was a big shock to the town, and to her,” Jerry Roberts, who covered Feinstein’s career for the San Francisco Chronicle, said. “She really got squeezed between the left and the right.” Her opponents were George Moscone, a progressive aligned with the labor movement, and John Barbagelata, whom Roberts described as “sort of a Tea Party precursor.” The fight was strenuous. “In the middle was Dianne, basically a technocrat, saying, ‘Let’s have civility.’ ” Feinstein told me she concluded that she was not electable.","2445","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"An hour after the press conference, Feinstein, in her small office on the second floor of City Hall, saw her fellow-supervisor Dan White run past. White, a former police officer, had resigned from the board three weeks earlier, but he wanted his job back. She called out to him, but he ignored her. Minutes later, she heard gunshots and smelled cordite. She went to her door and saw White race out of the building. In an office down the hall, she found Supervisor Harvey Milk, the city’s first openly gay elected official, face down on the floor, surrounded by blood; she reached for his neck, hoping to find a pulse, and her finger went through a bullet hole. She soon learned what had happened: after Moscone refused to give White his job back, White had shot him and then gone on to Milk’s office.","2446","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein grew up in San Francisco, and her private life captured something of the city’s combination of propriety and license. Her father, a professor of medicine, was Jewish; her mother, a volatile, emotionally unstable woman from St. Petersburg, was Russian Orthodox. When Feinstein was entering ninth grade, her mother enrolled her in the exclusive Convent of the Sacred Heart, reasoning that she would benefit from exposure to the social élite. At the convent, situated in a mansion in the Pacific Heights neighborhood, the pupils wore white gloves and curtsied to their instructors. The nuns emphasized to the students that their purpose was to make a difference, and that they should not be limited by their gender. Although Feinstein was never a committed feminist, she resisted restrictions in her professional life. At Stanford, she was the vice-president of her class—the highest office a woman could hold. After graduating, in 1956, she eloped with a prosecutor named Jack Berman, and had a daughter, Katherine; when they divorced, three years later, Feinstein carried on for a time as a single mother. Then, in 1962, she married Bertram Feinstein, a neurosurgeon twenty years her senior.","2447","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Soon after finding Milk’s body, Feinstein appeared near the doors of City Hall, where a large crowd had gathered. “It is my duty to make this announcement,” she said. “Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed.” People shouted in horror, and Feinstein struggled to keep her composure. Her lips moved silently, and then she said, “The suspect is Supervisor Dan White.”","2448","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein, as president of the board of supervisors, became mayor, and served out Moscone’s term, presiding over a city that was torn apart—as she later said, “some of it sorrow, some of it hate.” Just days before the murders, nine hundred followers of the minister Jim Jones, many of them from San Francisco, had committed suicide at Jonestown, in Guyana. In the previous few years, a terrorist group called the New World Liberation Front had carried out scores of bombings, some of which targeted Feinstein and other supervisors. “The lesson Dianne took from this craziness was that she had been right—that all this polarization and bitterness that was extant in the town had now led to these murders,” Roberts said. “That’s when she started talking about how the center is so important.”","2449","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"While Feinstein was the acting mayor, Milk’s killer was convicted of manslaughter, rather than murder, and the city erupted in a riot. “Twelve squad cars were blown up, the stores were looted, and the gay community just went nuts,” Feinstein recalled. “The hatred was so big, we really had to bring the bricks of the city together again, and it was difficult.” She was elected mayor in 1979 and again in 1983. When the AIDS crisis began, she said, “I had to close down the bathhouses. You learn how to do the tough stuff and bring people together at the same time.” She worked closely with the city’s downtown business establishment and with law enforcement; having served on a citywide crime commission, she describes herself as “very police-oriented, and very public-safety-oriented.” Jerry Roberts recalled, “We used to say, Dianne’s never met a uniform she didn’t like. She carried a fire-department turnout coat in the trunk of her car, so if there was a fire she heard about on her scanner she could get out and take a look.”","2450","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In 1990, Feinstein ran for governor of California. Nine tumultuous years as mayor had honed her instinct for the political center. At the state Democratic Party convention, packed with activists from the left, Feinstein stated that she unequivocally supported the death penalty. The crowd booed her—to the delight of her political consultants. That mass denunciation became a thirty-second TV spot, designed to reach the majority of California voters, who agreed with her.","2451","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In the weeks before the primary, Feinstein was far behind, but she was able to make a concerted push. Her second husband had died in 1978, and two years later she married Richard Blum, a wealthy investor. Now she and Blum loaned her campaign three million dollars, some of which paid for statewide television ads showing a clip of Feinstein announcing that Moscone and Milk had been assassinated. Feinstein won the primary, then narrowly lost to the Republican candidate, Pete Wilson.","2452","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Despite her loss, Feinstein was now sure that she was electable—perhaps, even, to the highest office. In 1992, she ran for the Senate against an incumbent Republican, John Seymour. In their biggest debate, her political consultant Bill Carrick recalled, Seymour charged that Feinstein, a strong advocate of gun control, had owned a handgun. “Dianne explained that at one point the New World Liberation Front had planted a bomb in a flower box outside her daughter Katherine’s bedroom window,” Carrick said. “And, yes, she had gotten a gun. But, she said, after a while she realized it would do no good. She launched a citywide campaign, urging San Franciscans to turn in their guns. And she concluded, ‘The Pope was coming to town. So we melted down all these guns we’d collected and gave them to him, in the form of a cross.’ ” Feinstein won easily.","2453","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"As a mayor, Feinstein had relished executive decision-making, but in the Senate she had to generate support among ninety-nine colleagues. Shortly after arriving, she secured a seat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and told its chairman, Senator Joe Biden, that she wanted to sponsor legislation to ban assault weapons. Michael Schiffer, her former staff member, told me, “The leadership basically said, If you want to do this, terrific—you’re on your own. She went out, senator to senator, buttonholed people, found out what was necessary to cobble together enough votes.” She sent a draft of her legislation to the N.R.A. for suggestions; instead, it fought tenaciously against the bill. “I was amazed to see the degree to which the National Rifle Association controls this body,” Feinstein said at the time, betraying her inexperience. The legislation passed, in what was both a surprising achievement and a lesson in compromise. The law stopped the manufacture, sale, and transfer of assault weapons. But it did not remove existing weapons from the streets, and it exempted six hundred and fifty kinds of firearms, including high-powered rifles and shotguns.","2454","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein’s greatest political vulnerability has come from her home life. In December, 1978, the United States and the People’s Republic of China announced the start of diplomatic relations, and Feinstein, who had just become mayor, decided to try to establish a sister-city relationship with Shanghai, China’s leading port and industrial center. Six months later, she led a mayoral delegation to China. Blum, who had been fascinated with Asia since visiting Nepal, in 1968, accompanied her. Feinstein recalled that, after spending time in Shanghai, “we went to Beijing, and we were on the Wall, walking along, and I ran into Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles. I said, ‘Tom, what are you doing here?’ And he said, ‘We’re going to Shanghai,’ to get a sister-city relationship. I said, ‘Been there, done that!’ ”","2455","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein became friends with Shanghai’s mayor, Jiang Zemin, and the two visited each other regularly; Jiang once spent Thanksgiving in San Francisco with Feinstein and Blum. In 1986, Feinstein and Jiang agreed to foster trade and business through corporate partnerships. Soon afterward, Shanghai Pacific Partners, in which Blum was an investor, signed a deal with a state-owned investment entity to create a seventeen-million-dollar apartment-and-retail complex, Golden Bridge Mansion, in a Shanghai suburb. As Feinstein told me, “In my day, China made friends first, and then they did business with their friends.”","2456","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In 1993, Jiang became the President of China. Feinstein served as an intermediary for him with the White House, and argued in Congress that Beijing should be granted permanent most-favored-nation trading status. Meanwhile, Blum and a partner raised more than a hundred million dollars to invest, primarily in China. For years, Feinstein was dogged by news stories about the apparent conflict of interest. In 1997, Blum pledged to donate to charity all profits he made from his China investments and, two years later, said that he had ended his personal investments there; however, he continued to manage a partnership that invested in China.","2457","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Finally, in 2000, he declared that he would not invest in China or Hong Kong, and that any money he received from managing others’ investments there would also go to charity. But the issue persisted, because his holdings and managed funds were so sprawling and complex that they fell outside the scope of mandatory disclosure forms. In Feinstein’s 2000 race, her Republican challenger, a congressman named Tom Campbell, charged that Blum continued to maintain an interest in at least one company doing business in China. Feinstein dismissed the allegation. She also insisted that there was a “firewall” between her and Blum, and that she made every effort to consult with the Senate Ethics Committee on possible conflicts of interest. “I don’t know what more I can do,” she said. “I mean, get divorced and live in sin, I suppose.”","2458","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"It was a flippant response, which ignored the obvious: Blum should have resisted the money. But Feinstein was not accustomed to having her integrity called into question. For the most part, her constituents didn’t seem to care. In 1994, Feinstein—tough on gun control, illegal immigration, and crime—was voted California’s most popular politician, and she has held on to that ranking; in 2012, she set a record for the greatest number of popular votes in any Senate election in history.","2459","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"For months after the torture report was sent to Obama, in December, 2012, the White House issued no clear statement supporting its release. The following April, at the Sedona Forum, in Arizona, Senator John McCain was seated onstage with Vice-President Biden. McCain, a vocal opponent of torture, spoke about how important it was for the report to come out. Biden agreed, but said that there was “an internal debate” in the White House: “Do we go back and do we expose it? Do we lay out who was responsible?” The issue, he said, was “not resolved yet.”","2460","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"By early 2014, it had become clear that the White House was reluctant to take sides against the C.I.A. According to the official’s memo included in the inspector general’s report, Brennan had notified Denis McDonough, Obama’s chief of staff, while his agents were searching the Senate computers; he also informed the White House counsel before the crimes report was filed with the Department of Justice. Obama halted neither action. “I was astonished that the White House let it go that far,” a former White House official told me. “It was such a loss of control.”","2461","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"After Feinstein’s floor speech in mid-March, 2014, the Intelligence Committee voted to send the report’s executive summary to the White House for a declassification review, anticipating public release. The White House instead said that the C.I.A. would take the lead in redacting information. Feinstein argued that the agency had a conflict of interest—redacting the charges of its own violations—and she appealed to Obama to reconsider. She got no response.","2462","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"In the six million documents that the C.I.A. had turned over, undercover agents were referred to by their official aliases, and the agency suggested pseudonyms for them that Senate staffers could use. In drafting the report, the staffers used several hundred of those pseudonyms, along with the real names of publicly identified senior C.I.A. officials. Their goal was to create a narrative in which major characters appeared repeatedly, many in various contexts, lending coherence to a complex chain of events and revealing the multifaceted roles that some individuals played. This was not without precedent: previous reports of intelligence failures, including the Church committee report, in 1975, had used pseudonyms for central characters.","2463","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"But on August 1st, when the C.I.A. delivered the redacted report—a few days before its expected release—Feinstein saw that the agency had redacted all the pseudonyms, arguing that readers might be able to combine them with other details and identify the agency personnel. The report, shot through with black lines, resembled a play where the pivotal actors were unrecognizable from scene to scene, making the action almost impossible to follow. The C.I.A. made one concession. The report had used the real names of the two contract psychologists—already identified in the press—who were paid eighty million dollars to develop the interrogation program. The C.I.A. said that the psychologists could be identified by pseudonyms that the agency had provided.","2464","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein rejected the redacted version, and began negotiating, mainly with Denis McDonough. Since the issue of pseudonyms was the most difficult one, they agreed to leave it for last, and discussed other redactions through the fall. Over Columbus Day weekend, McDonough flew to San Francisco to meet with Feinstein. “This has been a very difficult process,” Feinstein told me, not long afterward. She said that she and McDonough had “settled a lot of problems,” but that some remained, and she was determined not to have the report “decimated.”","2465","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Feinstein offered to reduce the number of pseudonyms from several hundred to forty or fifty, but McDonough refused. By mid-November, she was fighting for just fourteen. Many of these people had played major roles in the program and currently occupy high-level positions at the C.I.A. One was Alfreda Bikowsky, an agent who had been named in journalistic accounts as early as 2011. As deputy chief of the unit dedicated to finding Osama bin Laden, Bikowsky had participated in brutal interrogations. She was convinced of the program’s virtues. Its strength, she once wrote, was that potential terrorists expected nothing worse than a “show trial” in America. They “never counted on being detained by us outside the U.S., and being subjected to methods they never dreamed of.”","2466","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The former intelligence officer told me, “There was this group of four or five women, at the core of hunting Al Qaeda.” Bikowsky was at the center of it. “They all had this burden of guilt, that they were there and didn’t stop 9/11. They saw their jobs as making America safer—and were willing to go to great lengths.” In statements to the committee in 2006, Porter Goss, the C.I.A. director who preceded Michael Hayden, described the interrogations as “not a brutality. It’s more of an art or a science.” The key, he said, was “knowing what makes someone tick.” He added, “Just the simplest thing will work, a family photograph or something.” In fact, as the report describes, C.I.A. officers threatened at least three detainees with harm to their family members. Other techniques included menacing a subject with a pistol and a cordless drill, and employing “rectal hydration,” which the chief of interrogations later characterized as a marker of “total control over a detainee.” Before one session with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the lead planner of the 9/11 attacks, who was subjected to waterboarding a hundred and eighty-three times, Bikowsky sent an e-mail that referred to him by a nickname: “Mukie is gonna be hatin’ life on this one.”","2467","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"According to the report, Bikowsky was the chief architect of the C.I.A.’s effort to justify its use of enhanced techniques. In February, 2007, she accompanied Hayden to testify before the Intelligence Committee. The former intelligence officer said that Bikowsky had come because “Hayden was new and didn’t know all the details. She had all the facts stuffed into her head. Unless you knew what questions to ask, she’d run circles around you.” Citing information that she said was obtained from the interrogation program, Bikowsky testified, “There’s no question, in my mind, that having that detainee information has saved hundreds, conservatively speaking, of American lives.” The report lists four major claims she made in the hearing, and provides evidence that all are inaccurate. It also asserts that Bikowsky misled the C.I.A. inspector general and other senior officials about the efficacy of the enhanced techniques. (The C.I.A. stands by all but one of Bikowsky’s claims, and says that her assertions about the techniques reflected a widespread understanding. A spokesman said, “The representations as to the value of the information derived from detainees subject to E.I.T.s”—enhanced interrogation techniques—“were representations made by the agency, not one individual. Suggestions to the contrary only serve to distort the record.”)","2468","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The argument over how Bikowsky should be identified in the report was particularly freighted. The main character in the movie “Zero Dark Thirty” was based partly on her, and she was the subject of a Wikipedia page. Still, the C.I.A. and the White House refused to allow a pseudonym for her. She has been promoted to a senior position in the global-jihad unit. “The C.I.A. does not hold people accountable the way I think it should,” Feinstein told me. “You want to support them if the wrong thing happens.” But, she added, that is different from supporting them “for doing wrong.”","2469","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On November 20th, McDonough went to a Senate Democratic Caucus meeting, in the Mansfield Room of the Capitol. He was there to brief senators on the President’s immigration policy, but he knew that Feinstein and her colleagues on the Intelligence Committee would want to discuss the torture report. Feinstein delivered a prepared speech, about ten minutes long. “She flat-out called out the White House and the C.I.A.,” the senior Senate staffer recalled. “Then Rockefeller, Wyden, Heinrich, and Udall spoke, and they really went after McDonough.” McDonough, according to the staffer, argued that the report would risk lives, pointing out that, while he had Secret Service protection, C.I.A. families did not. The Senate aide recalled that McDonough defended his impartiality. “He said, ‘Every time I go over to the C.I.A., they tell me I’m doing the Senate’s bidding, and I come over here and you guys tell me I’m doing the C.I.A.’s bidding,’ and neither is true. I’m trying to be an arbitrator.” For many, his protest rang hollow. “Denis and Brennan are very tight, and Denis thinks very highly of Brennan,” someone who knows McDonough well said. “I think whatever Brennan told him, Denis had reason, based on the personal relationship, to trust.” At the close of the meeting, McDonough made it clear that the White House would not allow the remaining, contested pseudonyms to be used, and, if the committee did not agree, the report would not come out.","2470","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The pseudonyms for the fourteen key people were deleted. Although Bikowsky was referred to in some places as the “deputy chief of Alec station,” in dozens of other spots any title for her was redacted. Robert Eatinger, the acting general counsel Feinstein mentioned in her floor speech, had all sixteen hundred mentions of his name redacted. It was a bitter defeat, but Feinstein feared that if the report was not released before the Republicans took control of the Senate, in January, 2015, it never would be. Some of her colleagues believed that the White House was deliberately running out the clock. “Obama participated in the slowdown process, and that’s a hard thing to forgive,” Rockefeller said.","2471","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On Friday, December 5th, Feinstein had the report sent to the printer, to be released after the weekend. Later that day, she got a call from Secretary of State John Kerry, a good friend. “He talked about the dangers this would cause around the world, which I saw as right out of the White House playbook—or the C.I.A. playbook,” Rockefeller said. Feinstein had heard this argument from McDonough and Brennan many times. But, Rockefeller said, “when it came from Kerry it had a more human sense to it. It got to her.” Rockefeller talked with her over the weekend. “The Kerry call actually turned out to be good, because it made her take her deepest values and square them one against the other—and she came out with the right answer. On Monday, she walked into her office and said, ‘I want the report out.’ ”","2472","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"During the weekend, the National Counterterrorism Center and other intelligence agencies issued a threat assessment, predicting that the report would inspire violence throughout the world and cause significant damage to U.S. relationships. But when the report was issued nothing happened. I asked Feinstein whether she found the threat assessment suspect at the time. “Well, what I thought was that it was a little bit of intimidation.” She paused. “Not a little bit. I thought it was just intimidation.”","2473","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On Tuesday, December 9, 2014, the day the report was released, the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security issued an unusual joint warning. That evening, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Feinstein, “Was it worth it to release this report today if, in fact, American lives, whether diplomats, military personnel, civilians, are going to be in danger?” Feinstein responded that there is “no perfect time to release this report,” and added, “I think you’ve done a good job, certainly, of hyping the warnings.” But Blitzer persevered, wondering if she would feel guilty if Americans were killed. “I couldn’t believe that,” Feinstein told me. “He asked me three times!”","2474","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Newspaper stories picked out startling details from the report, and the Times editorial board called for the prosecution of the “torturers and their bosses,” starting with former Vice-President Dick Cheney. But on the Sunday-morning television shows the C.I.A.’s defenders outnumbered its critics. “Several of us made a concerted decision that, if and when this came out, we weren’t going to take it,” John Rizzo, the agency’s former general counsel, who is named many times in the report, said. Planning for the counter-offensive had begun in the spring of 2014. McDonough insisted that former C.I.A. officials be allowed to read the report; Feinstein acquiesced. Thus, they had time to prepare their rebuttal and create a Web site, C.I.A. Saved Lives, before the release of the report. When Hayden read the report, he was furious about how he had been treated. Feinstein also singled him out in a floor speech the day the report was released, saying, of his initial briefing, in September, 2006, “He referred specifically to a ‘tummy slap,’ among other techniques, and presented the entire set of techniques as minimally harmful and applied in a highly clinical and professional manner. They were not.” Hayden and Rizzo became the point men on TV.","2475","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The former C.I.A. officials attacked the report as partisan. Feinstein had repeatedly tried to persuade the Republicans on the committee to rejoin the investigation, but they refused, and wrote a response to the report that was strikingly similar to the C.I.A.’s. (They also attacked the Senate staff for having taken the Panetta documents from the C.I.A. facility.) The former officials disputed the report’s evidence that the enhanced techniques had been ineffective. And they denounced the committee for conducting no interviews, relying instead on contemporaneous C.I.A. e-mails, documents, and internal interviews and investigations. The Justice Department had started an investigation of the detention program in August, 2009, and Panetta said that he would therefore not require C.I.A. personnel to speak to the committee. But Rizzo, who retired in 2009, said now that he would have been happy to talk. “I pounded that drum about the interviews every chance I got,” he told me.","2476","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"The day after the report was released, McCain spoke at a Human Rights First dinner that honored him and Feinstein. “It’s been a tough day for Dianne—they rolled out the big guns,” he said. “I’m proud of her resilience.” General David Petraeus, the C.I.A. director who resigned in 2012, after an F.B.I. investigation discovered he was having an extramarital affair with his biographer, said in a video presentation that when he was military commander, in both Iraq and Afghanistan, “my view was that, if you want to get information from a detainee, the best way to do it is become his or her best friend.” He went on to say that Feinstein’s “leadership on this issue has been very important. She has of course spearheaded the entire effort to go back and look at what the practices were, to get these out into the open, to insure that we have learned everything that we can.”","2477","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Brennan responded to the report in a press conference at C.I.A. headquarters, in Langley—the first such conference to be televised live. Like Hayden and Rizzo, he criticized the report as “partisan” and “flawed.” He denied that the C.I.A. had misled the White House and Congress, arguing that detainees subjected to the enhanced techniques had provided valuable information, and that it was “unknowable” whether they would have done so under other circumstances. Most important, he refused to characterize the procedures as torture, or to say that they should not be used again. “I defer to the policymakers in future times,” he said. President Obama gave no speech of his own about the report, letting Brennan speak for the Administration.","2478","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On July 31st, the C.I.A. inspector general, David Buckley, released a summary of findings in the internal investigation he had started in January. He concluded that agency employees had acted improperly in accessing the computers and the e-mail of the committee staff, and that the crimes report that the C.I.A. had filed with the Justice Department was based on erroneous information.","2479","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Brennan, four months after his firm denials at the Council on Foreign Relations, apologized to Feinstein and Chambliss. He also said that he was appointing an accountability board, headed by the retired Democratic senator Evan Bayh, to review the situation. Feinstein pointed out that the report “confirmed what I said on the Senate floor in March,” but she also spoke of “positive first steps.”","2480","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Some of her colleagues weren’t ready to abandon the fight. Senator Carl Levin demanded that Brennan explain his earlier denial, and Udall and Heinrich called for his resignation. Even Chambliss found the situation “very, very serious.” During a White House news conference the next day, Obama made his most forthright acknowledgment yet of the substance of the report: “When we engaged in some of these enhanced interrogation techniques, techniques that I believe and I think any fair-minded person would believe were torture, we crossed a line.” But he emphasized his “full confidence” in Brennan: “Keep in mind—John Brennan called for that I.G. report.”","2481","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"When Obama came into office, he wanted to heal the breach between Congress and the C.I.A. that had developed during the Bush Administration. Yet the agency’s relationship with Congress had grown only more fraught. Senator Harry Reid had stopped taking his intelligence briefings from Brennan. As Majority Leader, Reid regularly got calls from the White House asking him to assume onerous legislative tasks; now he made a preëmptive move. “He called Denis McDonough and said, ‘I told Brennan back in January what he should do!’ ” the senior Senate staffer recalled. “ ‘Don’t call me on this—I’m not defending him. I’m not going to undermine Dianne Feinstein. You have done nothing but obstruct this report.’ ” When Reid had a similar conversation with the President, the staffer said, “the President tried to justify what the C.I.A. had done, saying the staff had gotten the Panetta review, and the C.I.A. had no choice.”","2482","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Brennan’s predicament was resolved six months later. In mid-January, 2015, the accountability board dismissed Buckley’s conclusion that the officers who searched the Senate computers had acted improperly. On the contrary, the board said, there was no “common understanding” between the committee and the agency about access to the Senate staff’s computers—only an “informal” one. And the board concluded that concerns about the Panetta review justified the search. It confirmed that Brennan had conveyed “explicit instructions” on three occasions to find out whether Senate staff members had accessed the Panetta review. But, it continued, “a misunderstanding between the D/CIA and [redacted] arose because the former did not appreciate what forensic techniques were necessary to answer his questions and the latter did not understand the D/CIA’s expectations that no intrusive methods be employed.”","2483","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"John Rizzo told me that this accountability board was different from any he had seen during three decades at the agency. Boards were often formed to follow up on an inspector general’s report and recommend disciplinary action for those who had acted improperly. Here the board discredited the inspector general. “I was surprised they came out as hard as they did on Buckley,” Rizzo said. (In January, Buckley left the agency.) “It was a surprise to me, too, that they didn’t mete out discipline. I thought it was a given, especially considering that Brennan went and apologized to Feinstein.” Why did he think no one was disciplined? Rizzo laughed. “From reading the board’s report, it appears that John Brennan himself was the one. He said, basically, pull out all the stops. So how do you hold subordinates liable for something like that?”","2484","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"On the day the board issued its findings, shortly after the Republicans took control of the Senate, the new chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Richard Burr, wrote to Obama, asking that all copies of the complete torture report that Feinstein had sent to the White House and other parts of the executive branch, including the Departments of State, Justice, and Defense, be returned. (Burr was apparently concerned that the report would become publicly available under the Freedom of Information Act.) Feinstein, now the vice-chair, wrote to Obama, strongly opposing the request. Several weeks later, the Administration pledged that it would not destroy or return copies without permission from the courts. Regarding Burr’s letter, the former C.I.A. officer said, “That is thinking like the agency does! If there is a report that was mistaken or flawed, you pull it out from the computers completely.” Burr said that he also intended to give the Panetta-review documents, still in the committee safe, back to the C.I.A. When I asked Feinstein about Burr’s attempt to claw back the report, she said, “I was surprised, and somewhat suspicious about who put him up to it.”","2485","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Brennan had prevailed, in a way that had seemed highly unlikely six months earlier. “John was able to wend his way through a minefield,” his old friend Grenier said. Brennan’s relations with Democrats on the Intelligence Committee remain hostile. In May, Wyden, Heinrich, and Senator Mazie Hirono sent Brennan a letter, demanding he acknowledge that the computer search was improper and affirm that it would not happen again. His statements after the report’s release continue to resonate. “It surprised me that he wouldn’t use the word ‘torture,’ ” the former intelligence officer said. “I know he needs to defend the agency to have credibility there—but he has exceeded that.” In the years since 9/11, the former officer continued, “the C.I.A. has done remarkable things and reprehensible things. I think the way the agency went on the offensive after 9/11 surprised Al Qaeda, and ninety per cent of what it did was right on track. But what was done with those two psychologists and the interrogations—the agency lost its sense of where the edge was, and went over it. The report really is important. In the future, if the C.I.A. faces a situation where it comes to the edge, hopefully it will know to go back—and understand that it cannot do anything.”","2486","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"As for Feinstein, the officer continued, “She was a serious overseer, knowledgeable, interested in the work. She was really hard-nosed on targeted killings—and someone who was a quasi liberal from California. She was such an important asset, for the C.I.A.” Listening to Feinstein’s speech last March, he said, “I thought, for the agency to lose that is horrifying.”","2487","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"One day in early March, I met with Feinstein and several staff members in her office in the Hart Building. A large, vividly detailed painting of landscapes in Nepal, which she and Blum had visited on one of their early trips, hung behind her desk. When I told Feinstein what the former intelligence officer had said about her, she smiled and said, “That’s nice to know. See, you don’t hear this. That’s for sure.” She continued, “It’s a lonely place. And it’s a lonely place for my staff, because they get beaten up.” It appears that Burr and other Republicans may still try to punish the staff for taking the Panetta documents back to the Hart Building, even as Feinstein has said that removing the documents was justified by the committee’s oversight responsibility. Alissa Starzak, who worked on the report before leaving the committee, in 2011, was nominated last July to be general counsel of the U.S. Army. Her confirmation was slowed by Republicans angry about her role in the report; Burr has said that he is striving to keep her from getting confirmed. Feinstein and Chambliss, who has retired, worked well together. No one would say that about Feinstein and Burr. “Some people around here look at oversight as being the best buddy, and always supporting them, no matter what,” Feinstein said. “That isn’t oversight. Oversight can’t just be going to a hearing and listening to what somebody says, when you don’t know whether they’re telling you the truth or not.” After all, she noted, “part of the C.I.A. tradecraft is deception.”","2488","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"It was almost a year since Feinstein had given her speech on the Senate floor. I asked why Brennan chose the course he did. “It’s the protection of the brotherhood, at the C.I.A.—you protect me and I protect you,” Feinstein said. “And Brennan wanted to destroy the report. In my view, the beauty and the strength of this country—what makes it so different—is that we admit our mistakes and we go on. And it’s tough.”","2489","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"Some have hoped that Feinstein’s experience with the torture report might lead her to view intelligence agencies more skeptically. There is little sign of that. In a recent speech, she reflected on her tenure as chairman of the Intelligence Committee and said that she would change only one thing: “I would hold more open hearings.” She is as confident as ever about the ethics of the targeted-killings program. “This is good oversight,” she told me. “The staff team has made fifty-nine visits to see the real-time operations of the Predator, the intelligence, the training. We stay on top of it. And the collateral damage—it’s classified, believe it or not, but the numbers are very good.” (After the recent announcement that two hostages were killed in a drone strike in Pakistan, Feinstein renewed her call for a public annual report on the number of combatant and civilian deaths from these strikes.) And she remains a champion of the N.S.A. and its call-records program, still objecting even to the term “surveillance.” Two independent panels concluded that the program has never been crucial in any terrorism-related investigation. But Feinstein continues to justify it, referring to the case of Najibullah Zazi, who pleaded guilty to plotting suicide-bombing attacks in the New York City subways in 2009. “What is that worth, saving subway cars stuffed to the gunwales with people?” she demanded.","2490","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"With the torture report, Feinstein abandoned her long-standing allies in the intelligence community. She defended her work by emphasizing its thoroughness; she has noted, with pride, that the Senate historian told her it was the longest report a committee had ever produced. When she was attacked, she said, repeatedly, “Read the report!” That was her hashtag as she took to Twitter to fact-check Brennan, during his televised press conference. Now she told me, “We sent out this big report to those departments that should care. But I am disappointed, because I suspect that not very many people have looked at it.” The public seemed uninterested, too. A poll conducted by the Washington Post and ABC News after the report’s release found that fifty-nine per cent of Americans supported the C.I.A.’s use of the coercive methods—slightly more than before. Elisa Massimino, the chief executive of Human Rights First, faulted the President for the fact: “Obama hasn’t provided the leadership we would expect from somebody who set this out as a priority issue. I think his job is to lead the country to a stronger consensus that we don’t want to do this again, and he failed at that.”","2491","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"
"After the report was released, Feinstein sent Obama a letter with her recommendations. Probably the most important was passing legislation to close the loopholes that had made torture possible, and to build on the executive order that Obama issued in January, 2009. (Without legislation, another President could reverse that order.) In this year’s State of the Union address, Obama said, “There’s one last pillar of our leadership, and that’s the example of our values. As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we’re threatened, which is why I have prohibited torture.” But the President has given no sign that he has any interest in Feinstein’s recommendations, even as she and McCain recently introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would permanently ban the enhanced techniques. I asked her whether she was disappointed in Obama’s lack of support for the torture report. She paused, and replied, “Well, let me say that there are people who don’t want to look at the whole truth. And I don’t know whether the President read our report or not. I certainly haven’t heard from him since.” ♦","2492","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war"

So in January of 1998, when she was twenty-one, Flores arranged to come to the United States illegally.

They told us to lie down in the back, head to feet, feet to head, so there would be room for everyone.” They drove for about three hours, stopped at a mobile home in the desert, then continued on to Phoenix. A friend had set up another ride, which would take them across the country, to Ohio. “It was so cold, and I didn’t have a jacket,” Flores said. “We slept in the car and ate at McDonald’s. It was the first burger I ever had. It was very tasty.” When she reached Columbus, she paid her brother a thousand dollars, which he turned over to the guides, or coyotes, who had made the trip possible.","2494","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"

They got married and had twin boys, David and Luis, in 2000, and a third son, Iker, four years ago. “David has always been a really good person and a really good father,” Flores said. “In Mexico, we are used to men not washing dishes and not doing anything around the house, and he is the opposite.” Today, David operates a taco truck, which he stations in a parking lot near the small duplex apartment where the family lives, just outside Columbus.

"Like many people who have arrived illegally from Mexico, Flores has built a productive life here. She is a longtime resident, has no criminal record, and is the parent of American citizens. Through much of Barack Obama’s Presidency, there was a political near-consensus regarding the need to address the status of immigrants like Flores. Under the immigration-reform law passed by the Senate in 2013, she would have had a path to become a citizen; under the executive actions announced by President Obama in 2014, she could have obtained work papers and a driver’s license. But the House failed to vote on the Senate’s immigration bill, and a federal court in Texas has placed Obama’s initiative on hold.","2496","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The result is a comprehensive breakdown in public policy. During the Obama Administration, which purports to be dedicated to easing the plight of residents like her, Flores and her peers have faced greater threats of deportation than at any time in decades. Republicans, for their part, have ended their brief experiment, reflected in the Senate bill, in bipartisanship on immigration. The Party is now close to united in opposition to any initiative that might offer Flores and others the chance to become American citizens. Flores, and the roughly eleven million people in similar situations, have no choice but to wait and worry.","2497","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Donald Trump, in his speech announcing his candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination, in June, addressed the issue of illegal immigration from Mexico. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” (The crime rate among first-generation immigrants is significantly lower than that of the general population, according to Bianca Bersani, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.) Trump’s remarks prompted several of his business partners, including Univision and Macy’s, to sever their ties with him, but the comments have led to relatively little examination of the lives of the immigrants themselves.","2498","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"For many years, Flores’s legal status existed for her as a kind of background anxiety, affecting her life in modest ways. Because traffic stops by the police could lead to deportation, she drove the family car as little as possible, and never out of state. “Here, at least, we know the city, we know the streets, we know which are one-way or two-way,” she said. “If we go somewhere else, we are scared that we don’t know the area.” Now her situation has taken on a new urgency. Early this year, her son Iker had a series of infections that proved resistant to treatment. “The first two times that I took him to the doctor, they said it was an ear infection and then a throat infection, and they did not draw blood. On the fourteenth of February, we noticed that he had some red dots on his ears. That’s when they drew blood. Four days later, they told me he had cancer of the blood”—acute lymphocytic leukemia. Iker has begun a course of chemotherapy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, in Columbus, which is likely to take three or four years.","2499","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"“Before I had children, I thought about what if the police would pick me up—I would just leave, go back to Mexico, even though I haven’t been there in a long time,” Flores told me. “Now that my child is sick, I really do worry. Medicine back home is very different. When you go to the doctor, you have to take money before things happen. He has a higher probability of surviving in the United States. Now we have to stay.”","2500","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"When I visited the Floreses’ apartment, Olga demonstrated a trick with sour cream that she had learned during a stint working at Chipotle. She emptied a five-pound jar into a metal bowl, then whipped it with a wooden spoon. “If you whip it first, it comes out of the squirt bottles easier,” she said. The family’s duplex is in a town-house development. There are two refrigerators squeezed into the kitchen, to accommodate the restaurant-size quantities of food that the family must buy and prepare every week for the taco truck. Iker sat on the sofa watching cartoons on a big-screen television. He’s an outgoing kid, who moves seamlessly between English and Spanish, but he has been having a tough time with the chemotherapy. He’s weak and very thin, and has trouble keeping food down. Lately, he has been struggling to walk up the stairs to his bedroom, so Olga is carrying him around more than she once did. His brothers help out, but at this moment they were at the truck, helping their father.","2501","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Shortly after Iker’s cancer was diagnosed, Flores went to see Julie Nemecek, an immigration lawyer in Columbus, to ask about her options for establishing a more secure basis for remaining in the United States. Nemecek had handled many similar cases before. “Most of the people I hear from have been in Ohio for a long time, and the vast majority are undocumented, because they snuck across the border,” she said. “They have made lives here. They have been in hiding, hoping that when they drive to work or take their kids to school they won’t get stopped.” Nemecek offers clients like Flores little reassurance. “Everything is in limbo, so people are uncertain, and they feel hopeless,” she said.","2502","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"When Barack Obama ran for the Presidency, he pledged to enact comprehensive immigration reform, but he didn’t push the issue in his first two years in office, when Democrats had strong majorities in both houses of Congress. Instead, he made what became known as a “down payment” for a bipartisan immigration bill later in his Presidency.","2503","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"“There was definitely in the Obama Administration an intention to do tough enforcement as a down payment for comprehensive immigration reform later,” Marc Rosenblum, of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, said. Rosenblum is the deputy director of the institute’s U.S.-immigration-policy program. “The idea was to prove to Republicans that he could be trusted on enforcement, so that he could get a path to citizenship in return.”","2504","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The first part of the down payment was to toughen enforcement at the Mexican border. Under Obama, a record number of agents are patrolling the border: nearly twenty thousand, roughly five times as many as there were two decades ago. In the light of this change, the Obama Administration has claimed that the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border has reached a forty-year low. (The faltering economy during Obama’s first term, which made the United States a less promising destination, was certainly another important factor in the decline.)","2505","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The more controversial part of Obama’s down payment involved immigrants who had already arrived and settled in the United States. The Administration greatly expanded a program known as Secure Communities, in which information was shared between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the F.B.I. Whenever anyone was arrested and booked, his or her fingerprints would be sent to the F.B.I., as before, but now the information would also go to the immigration authorities. “It was a huge force multiplier,” Rosenblum said. “The program was pitched as a tool to find serious criminals, but, at least initially, the vast majority of people were picked up for traffic violations and very minor offenses. A lot of these people ended up being deported.” Julie Nemecek recalled, “Around 2010, the number of my Mexican clients increased, with enforcement getting really, really heavy because of Secure Communities. People were getting picked up left and right when their only offense was driving without a license or drunk driving.” As a result of tougher enforcement, deportations soared under Obama. Since 2009, removals of illegal immigrants have averaged more than four hundred thousand per year, compared with an average of two hundred and fifty thousand per year under George W. Bush.","2506","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Secure Communities had an enormous impact on the day-to-day lives of Latinos in the United States. “There are people who are not a safety threat who are snared into the deportation apparatus,” Clarissa Martínez, the deputy vice-president of the National Council of La Raza, a leading Hispanic-rights organization, told me. “Also, when you start deputizing local law enforcement to help apply immigration law, you are going to have abuses, and that’s what happened. People feel that regardless of whether you are first-, second-, third-generation American, the folks who are going to be stopped are going to be Latinos.” Rosenblum said, “Until the last decade or so, the chances were, if you made it past the border, you were not going to get deported, unless you were committing serious crimes. But, with the crackdown, the broader immigrant community felt under attack. They lived here, and suddenly they were unable to work, unable to drive.”","2507","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Still, the underlying theory was that Secure Communities would be the stick, and comprehensive immigration reform would be the carrot—and the goal appeared within reach after Obama was reëlected, in 2012. The defeat of Mitt Romney brought Republicans to the realization that they had to broaden their appeal to Hispanics, the fastest-growing group of potential voters in the nation. In March of 2013, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, released a report that said the Party “must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.” In short order, many Republicans in the Senate, including such prominent figures as John McCain and Marco Rubio, did just that, and a bill that included a path to citizenship for people like Olga Flores passed by a vote of sixty-eight to thirty-two.","2508","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The battle over immigration reform presents a clash of fundamentally different visions of the role of the federal government. The President and his allies assert that their position is based on a combination of realism and compassion. They argue that it’s impossible to deport all of the country’s illegal immigrants. In addition, they say, it’s heartless to break up families who are long settled in the United States.","2509","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Opponents of reform, who are led by Jeff Sessions, a Republican senator from Alabama, believe that national security, along with the rule of law, compels a different approach. “If everyone who enters the country illegally can stay and become a citizen, that just encourages more people to come illegally,” Sessions told me. “If people see that they have nothing to fear after they cross the border and settle here, then that creates an incentive for more people to come, and that’s wrong. If they are here illegally, they should be deported.” What’s more, he argues, a porous border invites criminals, including terrorists, to settle in the promised land of the United States.","2510","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Yet John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House, and Eric Cantor, the Majority Leader, described themselves as supporters of immigration reform, and it was clear after the 2012 election that the votes were there to pass it. “Boehner promised the President that he was going to bring a bill to the floor,” a former White House aide told me. “There’s always a significant House-versus-Senate rivalry, so the Senate bill itself was going to be a nonstarter in the House. But some sort of reform bill was sure to pass if it came to a vote.” Virtually all of the Democrats in the House, as well as some Republicans, supported comprehensive reform along the lines of the Senate bill, but immigration reform was anathema to the Tea Party. Boehner asked staff from the House leadership to come up with a proposal that modified the Senate bill without gutting it. The result was an outline of recommendations, but conservatives in the House persuaded Boehner to back away from them.","2511","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"After the passage of the Senate bill, chances for any sort of reform bill in the House began to recede. The government shutdown, for two weeks in October of 2013, poisoned relations between the President and congressional Republicans. Then, on June 10, 2014, Cantor lost a primary to a poorly funded and largely unknown challenger, who focussed his campaign on Cantor’s alleged softness on illegal immigration. The victor, David Brat, went on to win the seat. Republican support for reform suddenly vanished. As the former White House aide told me, “There was always this germ of hope, but then Eric Cantor lost his primary. There was probably a five-per-cent chance before that, and it went to zero.”","2512","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Olga Flores speaks English imperfectly, so some of our conversations were interpreted by Jessica Pantaleon Camacho, who works as an assistant in Julie Nemecek’s law office. Pantaleon Camacho was born in Mexico twenty years ago and brought to the U.S. illegally as a three-year-old. “When I started going to high school, I convinced myself that school was the only way I could get my family out of the situation,” she told me. “I took all Advanced Placement classes starting in my sophomore year. I graduated near the top of my class.” Her teachers wrote enthusiastic recommendations to colleges, and Pantaleon Camacho was accepted at several schools, with scholarship offers. “When I was about to graduate, we had to decide what school,” she said. “That’s when they told me that I needed a Social Security number. I wasn’t able to provide it.”","2513","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Pantaleon Camacho is among the “Dreamers,” the term that has come to define the group of people who were brought illegally to the United States when they were children. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, known as the DREAM Act, was presented several years ago as a modest alternative to the round of comprehensive immigration reform that was stalled in Congress at the time. The law would provide a path to citizenship for people like Pantaleon Camacho, who had essentially lived their entire lives as Americans. It failed, and the President began taking a series of unilateral executive actions designed to ease the plight of the Dreamers. On June 15, 2012, the Obama Administration announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The program would give as many as 1.7 million people work authorization and a two-year reprieve from deportation, which was renewable for another two years. In most cases, this meant that the Dreamers were also eligible for driver’s licenses and, in some states, for in-state tuition at state universities. Almost eight hundred thousand individuals applied for DACA coverage, and about eighty-four per cent of them were approved.","2514","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Pantaleon Camacho was one of them. “It has changed my life,” she told me. “I have a Social Security number and a driver’s license. I am able to drive without fear of being pulled over and being sent back to Mexico.” Her job in the lawyer’s office is on the books. She was admitted to Bowling Green, a state university in Ohio, but she is ineligible for any scholarship assistance, so she takes classes at a local community college. “It all comes out of my own pocket,” Pantaleon Camacho told me. Her situation is much improved but still tenuous: her DACA status expires roughly at the end of the Obama Administration, and no one knows what the next President will do with the program.","2515","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"DACA did nothing to help families like the Floreses, in which the parents came to the U.S. as adults and the children were born here. By 2014, immigration activists began putting greater pressure on Obama to take executive action to help more families. “When Boehner pulled out of the process, that’s when there was a total focus on the President, because the legislative door had been shut,” Clarissa Martínez, of La Raza, said. The White House felt the heat. “There was a period in 2014 when the immigration activists gave up on Congress and said it’s now on the President,” the former White House aide said. “They started calling him Deporter-in-Chief. The President brought them all in. He said by criticizing him they were letting the Republicans off the hook. He said he needed more time. He said, ‘I will do everything I can at the end of the summer.’ ” But Democratic Senate candidates in competitive races, like Kay Hagan, in North Carolina, implored the White House not to take any controversial steps on immigration before the midterm elections. Obama agreed; activists seethed; virtually all the Democratic candidates, including Hagan, lost anyway.","2516","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Finally, on November 20, 2014, just a few weeks after the elections, Obama launched his long-awaited series of executive actions on immigration. As the President explained in a rare prime-time address from the White House, the centerpiece was an initiative called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, known as DAPA. This program, which would be run by the Department of Homeland Security, was aimed at the parents of American citizens who were themselves illegally in the country but had been law-abiding residents of the United States since 2010. Following a case-by-case review, they would receive an immigration status known as “deferred action,” enabling them to apply for work permits and driver’s licenses. DAPA was intended to cover about 3.6 million people, more than thirty per cent of the illegal immigrants in the United States. The D.H.S. made plans to hire as many as three thousand new employees, some of whom would work in Arlington, Virginia, in an eleven-story building that the government leased for $7.8 million a year. (Also on November 20th, Obama expanded eligibility for the DACA program, and replaced Secure Communities with a program that targets serious criminals.) According to Obama’s plan, the government would begin accepting applications for deferred action under DAPA in February, 2015.","2517","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"“DAPA is of tremendous magnitude,” Clarissa Martínez said. “It’s what Americans want of the undocumented community—that they come forward, go through criminal-background checks, and those who are working do so legally. For the American public, it sounds practical and pragmatic to give people who have deep roots in the community and have good moral character a chance to get right with the law. The announcement of these programs was an incredible step forward and the biggest progress we’ve seen on the issue in two decades.”","2518","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The Floreses pride themselves on using fresh, authentic ingredients for their food truck. Olga showed off a large maguey leaf, from a variety of agave, which David was about to cut up, toast, and use as a seasoning for the meat before he grilled it. “The best things,” Olga said.","2519","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Olga Flores has not closely followed the twists and turns in immigration policy, but, like most immigrants, she was aware of DAPA and planned to take advantage of it. There is a cruel asymmetry to immigration law: the people with the most at stake have the most trouble understanding it. This is because, even for lawyers, immigration law is notoriously complicated. It’s related to, but ultimately very different from, other criminal or civil litigation; immigration law has its own traditions and doctrines—and the rules often change. For civilians, the morass is difficult to navigate, and for non-English-speaking immigrants the law can be nearly impenetrable. Still, everyone knew that Obama’s November 20th directives were hugely significant. On the night of Obama’s speech, many immigration-rights groups around the country held viewing parties to celebrate the news. Flores was hopeful, too. “We were very excited,” she told me.","2520","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"But two weeks after Obama’s announcement Texas and sixteen other states sued the federal government to stop the DAPA program. Eight states joined later. The heart of the case against the Administration is the contention that Obama overstepped his authority in establishing the program. “The case isn’t about any particular immigration policy; it’s about the rule of law,” Scott Keller, the Texas solicitor general, told me. “DAPA rewrites the immigration statutes, and the executive does not have unilateral authority to do that. Congress has not granted the executive the power to deem people who are unlawfully in the country to be eligible for work permits, Medicare, unemployment benefits, and access to international travel. Congress has done quite the opposite. The executive can’t do it alone.”","2521","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Obama Administration lawyers fired back from several directions. First, they argued that Texas and the other states lacked standing—that is, that they had no right to file the case in the first place, because DAPA imposed no obligations on the states. “The core of Texas’s argument is that they will have to pay for driver’s licenses for the beneficiaries of DAPA,” an Administration official told me. “But that’s not enough to get them standing. It’s a very incidental expense, and they could raise their prices to cover it, anyway. States don’t get to sue just because they don’t like the policies of the federal government, and that’s what this case is really about.” The plaintiffs have argued that they have standing because DAPA will encourage illegal immigration, which would be an imposition on states. Yet fourteen states and the District of Columbia filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of DAPA, asserting that the program would actually help, not burden, individual states. “When immigrants are able to work legally—even for a limited time—their wages increase, they seek work compatible with their skill level, and they enhance their skills to obtain higher wages, all of which benefits State economies by increasing income and growing the tax base,” the brief explains.","2522","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"On the merits, too, Administration lawyers argued that the President was within his rights to extend these benefits to undocumented people. “This whole case is a matter of enforcement priorities,” the official said. “We can deport four hundred thousand people a year, but we can’t deport all eleven million undocumented people here, so the President has a right to establish his priorities for the limited time he is in office. And he’s saying that he is not going to deport people with children and ties to the community who are willing to undergo a background check.” George H. W. Bush had a similar program for a select group of immigrants, and it proceeded with little fanfare and no legal challenge.","2523","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Like the plaintiffs in many civil cases, the Texas solicitor general had wide latitude in choosing the court where he wanted to file the suit. Lawyers often do some judge-shopping if they think it will help them win their cases, and it was quickly evident that the Texas lawyers shopped wisely. Keller’s predecessor brought the lawsuit in Brownsville, close to the Mexican border. The local federal judge assigned to the case, Andrew Hanen, had already shown a marked hostility toward President Obama’s immigration policies. Hanen had been appointed to the district court in 2002 by George W. Bush, and, in earlier rulings, he had called the President’s deportation policy “misguided” and asserted that it “endangers America.”","2524","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"According to the President’s plan, the government was going to begin accepting applications for deferred action under DAPA on February 18th. Less than forty-eight hours before the program went into effect, Judge Hanen filed a hundred-and-twenty-three-page opinion issuing a preliminary injunction that put DAPA on hold. In the case known as Texas v. United States, he ruled that Texas and the other states did have standing to challenge the law, and then he ruled against the Administration on an esoteric but important matter. Hanen held that the Administration had failed to follow the correct procedures in putting DAPA into effect; he said that the Department of Homeland Security should have given the public the chance to be heard in what’s known as notice-and-comment rule-making before implementing the new policy. The opinion did not directly address the underlying legality of DAPA, but the judge offered clear hints that he was dubious about the program. DAPA “does not represent mere inadequacy; it is complete abdication,” Hanen wrote. “The D.H.S. does have discretion in the manner in which it chooses to fulfill the expressed will of Congress. It cannot, however, enact a program whereby it not only ignores the dictates of Congress, but actively acts to thwart them.”","2525","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"In a further rebuff to the Administration, Judge Hanen issued a stay on DAPA covering the entire country, even though his jurisdiction covered only part of Texas. Administration lawyers rushed an appeal of Hanen’s stay to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit—one of the most conservative circuits in the country. On May 26th, a panel of the appeals court ruled, two judges to one, that Hanen was correct to enjoin DAPA. Earlier this month, during a hearing before another three-judge panel, the same two judges maintained their skepticism about Obama’s immigration initiative. Regardless of what the Fifth Circuit ultimately rules, the losing party will still have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. As Jeff Sessions, Obama’s chief adversary in Congress, put it, “The courts may take longer than the President will be in office.” The Department of Homeland Security has put the plan to hire three thousand people to administer DAPA on indefinite hold.","2526","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"It’s always been a key part of the Administration’s plan to establish DAPA before the end of Obama’s term, making it difficult for any successor to withdraw a benefit that has already been granted. But by delaying his actions until after the 2014 midterms the President may have given his opponents, in Congress and in the courts, the time and the tools to unravel his most important work on immigration.","2527","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"

His prognosis is good; his cancer has a very high survival rate. Iker has become used to the chemo port affixed to his chest. But the treatment sessions, which last as long as twelve hours at a time, are gruelling. This visit was to check his blood to see if he was ready for a chemo session the next day.

"At one point, immigration represented a kind of exception to the polarization that dominates contemporary politics in Washington. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama pushed Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform. And the Senate passed its bipartisan immigration bill only two years ago. But, as the Presidential campaign has heated up, the issue has come to split the parties in stark ways. “The experience under Obama and Bush has upped the ante on what we want to hear from candidates that are vying for the Presidency in 2016,” Clarissa Martínez said. “Both Obama and Bush said they wanted to get it done, and their hearts may have been in the right place, but they both ran into trouble with Congress. That’s why hearing that somebody believes in immigration reform is not good enough. We want to know what they will do on their own as President.”","2530","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Trump’s comments about immigrants from Mexico drew condemnation from many Republicans for his impolitic tone, but, in their substance, his views are widely shared within the Party. At various times, Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, Marco Rubio, the Florida senator, and Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor, all supported versions of immigration reform that would allow people like Olga Flores to become citizens. All have tacked right. Bush has talked recently of a path to “legalized status” for undocumented aliens rather than a path to citizenship; he also said recently that he would repeal DACA and DAPA. Rubio has said that he now favors a piecemeal approach to immigration, rather than a comprehensive bill; and Walker recently said, “I don’t believe in amnesty” for those who have entered the country illegally. Rubio and Walker have also denounced DACA and DAPA. The other Republican candidates have talked about immigration almost exclusively in terms of border enforcement. Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, recently asked a group of supporters to “imagine a President that finally, finally, finally secures the borders,” and he criticized Obama’s “lawlessness and the President’s unconstitutional executive amnesty.”","2531","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Hillary Clinton, in contrast, has staked out a position to the left of President Obama. In an appearance in Las Vegas, in May, Clinton said, “We can’t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship.” She said it was “beyond absurd” to think that all eleven million illegal immigrants in the country could be deported. And she said that she would expand DACA and DAPA. “If Congress continues to refuse to act, as President I would do everything possible under the law to go even further,” she said, suggesting, for example, that she would extend protection to the parents of Dreamers.","2532","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"For now, though, the only certainty for Olga Flores and others in similar situations is more uncertainty. If Clinton wins, and Congress remains in Republican hands, the new President will be reduced to attempting the same kind of piecemeal executive actions as Obama—if the courts even allow those to proceed. If a Republican wins, Flores’s chances of deportation will rise. Either way, the issue will remain on the national agenda, even as the opportunity to come to any solution continues to recede. ♦","2533","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"It hasn’t been quite as dramatic as Justice Owen Roberts’s legendary 1937 “switch in time that saved nine,” which flipped the Supreme Court from overturning New Deal legislation to ruling its initiatives constitutional. But Chief Justice John Roberts’s successive opinions in defense of the Affordable Care Act—National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, in 2012, and then, last week, King v. Burwell—have definitively ended the debate about the legality of Obamacare. And just as the earlier Roberts’s decision paved the way for the New Deal safety net to become permanent and widely accepted, King may well go down in history as the moment when Obamacare’s long-term survival was guaranteed.","July 2, 2015","2534","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-obamacares-future-is-secure"
"In part, that’s because Roberts’s defense of the law was broad rather than narrow. Many observers had assumed that if the A.C.A. was upheld, it would be under the so-called Chevron doctrine, which says that when a statute’s meaning is ambiguous, courts should defer to the administrative agency’s interpretation of it, as long as that interpretation is reasonable. In the case of King, Chevron would have had the Court defer to the I.R.S., which had read a disputed sentence of the law to mean that people in states that had not established insurance exchanges, and who instead signed up on the federal one, were still eligible for subsidies. Instead, Roberts chose a different tack, ruling that when it comes to matters of deep “economic and political significance,” it is the Court’s responsibility to decide what a statute means. And that cleared the path for Roberts’s sensible judgment that, regardless of the careless way the law was drafted, when you looked as the A.C.A. as a whole, it was plain that the intent of Congress was that any citizen of the United States, assuming they met the income criteria, should be eligible for health-insurance subsidies.","2535","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-obamacares-future-is-secure"
"Now, the long-term implications of Roberts’s refusal to use Chevron are complex, because it suggests that whenever the Court decides a matter is economically and politically significant, it can override an administrative agency’s interpretation of the law. (Even under Chevron, there’s nothing really keeping the Court from asserting its authority whenever it wants—that’s what happened Monday, when the Court threw out the E.P.A.’s mercury regulations because, in Justice Antonin Scalia’s mind, they were not “reasonable.”) In the case of King, the effect of Roberts’s assertion of the Court’s authority was to protect the Affordable Care Act from future legalistic shenanigans. If the case had been decided under Chevron, the election of a Republican President could have led to a different interpretation of the statute, and the scrapping of subsidies. Instead, if real battles are still going to be fought over Obamacare they’re going to be fought in Congress—which is precisely where they belong.","2536","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-obamacares-future-is-secure"
"One might think that means we’re in years for open legislative warfare, given how much Republicans hate the law. But the truth is that while Republicans will undoubtedly continue to lambaste Obamacare and campaign on the need to repeal it, it will be surprising if, in the end, they do much more than talk. That’s why, after the King decision was handed down, the stocks of insurance companies jumped sharply: investors recognized that the decision meant Obamacare was now going to be very hard to dislodge. One obvious, and much-cited, reason for this is that once an entitlement has been granted (particularly when middle-class people have access to that entitlement), it becomes politically difficult to take it away.","2537","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-obamacares-future-is-secure"
"There is, though, another, more subtle reason why Obamacare seems likely to survive: it actually embodies the principles that most Americans think a health-insurance system should have. That may seem hard to believe, given how much flak the law has taken; even today, in most polls a plurality of those surveyed oppose it. But the data also show that Americans overwhelmingly think it’s important to have health insurance. They believe that insurance plans should have “guaranteed access,” meaning that insurance companies should not be able to deny coverage to people because of preëxisting conditions. In a 2013 New York Times poll, for instance, a remarkable eighty-six per cent of those surveyed opposed discrimination against preëxisting conditions. They also believe in community rating, meaning that women and men should pay the same premiums and that insurance companies should not be able to charge higher premiums just because someone has a preëxisting condition. A sizable majority of Americans also think that low- and middle-income people who don’t have health-care coverage through their employer should get subsidies to help them pay for insurance.","2538","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-obamacares-future-is-secure"
"Americans still don’t like the individual mandate requiring them, in most circumstances, to get coverage. But if you want the aspects that are popular, you’re most likely going to need some form of a mandate, which gets younger and healthier people into the system—driving down over-all costs by helping pool risks—and prevents them from gaming it by waiting until they’re sick to buy insurance. You also need subsidies, since there’s no point in mandating that people buy insurance if they can’t afford it. The result may seem kludgy and inelegant. But if you want—and, again, most Americans do—a system that has guaranteed access, community rating, and that keeps insurance relatively affordable for the average American, you’re likely going to get something like Obamacare. (I’m assuming here that moving to a single-payer system is not a politically realistic option.) That’s why Republican proposals to replace the Affordable Care Act tend either to be just less generous versions of Obamacare, or to back away from those basic principles, typically by allowing insurance companies to discriminate against preëxisting conditions.","2539","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-obamacares-future-is-secure"
"That doesn’t mean it’s impossible that the A.C.A. will end up being repealed. After all, most working-age Americans still get health insurance through their employer, so the benefits of Obamacare are still notional to them. But as our economy moves away from the old model of full-time employment, it’s only going to become more important for people to be able to get affordable individual insurance, regardless of whatever preëxisting conditions they have. So with every day that passes, repealing Obamacare gets tougher. Indeed, that’s why the plaintiffs in King mounted a lawsuit that was, as Jeffrey Toobin recently put it, so blatantly cynical—they knew that their best chance of scrapping the law was to have the Court do it for them. And that’s why Roberts’s refusal to do this was so momentous. It would not be surprising to learn that John Roberts thinks Obamacare is a terrible idea. But he’s done his best to insure that it’s going to be around for a long time to come.","2540","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-obamacares-future-is-secure"
"Bernie Sanders formally announced that he was running for President on May 26, 2015, in a stern thirty-five-minute speech he delivered in Burlington, Vermont, on the green-gray shores of Lake Champlain. But, really, his campaign began nearly five years earlier, on the floor of the Senate, on December 10, 2010, when Sanders spoke—without eating, or sitting down, or taking a bathroom break—for eight and a half hours. The “filiBernie,” people called it—“the most Twittered event in the world on that day,” Sanders wrote later–though it wasn’t, technically, a filibuster, since it wasn’t holding up any vote. “You can call it a very long speech,” the Senator suggested. Or: you could call it a manifesto.","July 9, 2015","2541","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"
"“When I walked on to the floor, I had no idea how long I would stay there,” Sanders explained. At the time, he was sixty-nine. The longest speech he’d ever given, he said, was an hour. He wondered, “Would I last three hours, five hours, twenty hours?” He didn’t have a speech written out, though he had pages, scraps, and notes, and he knew what he wanted to say. He had only one rule: No “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” (“I wasn’t going to read from the phone book or sing songs.”) He figured he’d just riff off bits and pieces of old speeches until he dropped. The idea seems to have been to talk for as long as it would take for people to hear what he had to say. And that, more or less, is his plan for this election, too.","2542","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"
"How long will he last? Sanders, who used to be a long-distance runner, has always said that he intends to run a very long campaign. Up until now, the press hasn’t taken that, or him, seriously. “Who Is Bernie Sanders?” CNN asked, in a video posted to its site in April. Who cares? Was the answer of a lot of pundits in May, and into June. Sanders, though, has been drawing huge crowds. And in polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, he’s steadily gaining ground against Hillary Clinton. It’s all very Aesop’s Fables. (You can easily kill two or three torpid summer afternoons trying to pick animals for a parable about Clinton and Sanders.

"Sanders was born in Brooklyn in 1941. In the nineteen-sixties, at the University of Chicago, he became a civil-rights and antiwar activist. He led sit-ins against segregated housing on campus; he worked for S.N.C.C.; he went to the March on Washington. He graduated with a degree in political science in 1964, the year that Ronald Reagan gave a speech on behalf of Barry Goldwater, called “A Time for Choosing,” that was aired on television the week before Election Day. The choice, Reagan said, was between the Johnson Administration, which Reagan called “socialist” (because of the War on Poverty), and Goldwater, representing the Founding Fathers, who, as Reagan imagined it, knew that “outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy.” Among Reagan’s speechwriters, “A Time for Choosing” became known as “The Speech,” since every speech Reagan gave was essentially a version of it. (For more on The Speech, see Robert Schlesinger’s “White House Ghosts: Presidents and Their Speechwriters.”) In 2011, when Bernie Sanders had the transcript of his quasi-filibuster published as a book, he titled that book “The Speech.”","2544","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"
"In 1968, Sanders moved to Vermont, where he worked as a writer, documentary maker, and carpenter, and, beginning in 1971, ran for office. In 1979, he produced a twenty-eight-minute audio documentary on Folkways Records: “Eugene V. Debs: Trade Unionist, Socialist, Revolutionary, 1855-1926.” The liner notes describe the record as “An historical narrative written and produced by Bernard Sanders, Director: The American People’s Historical Society, Burlington, Vermont.” It begins:","2545","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"

"In 1918, Debs was sentenced to ten years in prison, on charges of sedition, for speeches like that. In 1920, he ran for President from prison, and got nearly a million votes. Sanders adores him; he has a plaque honoring Debs on the wall of his Senate office.","2547","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"
"Sanders ran for office four times—twice each for governor of Vermont and the U.S. Senate—before running for mayor of Burlington and winning by ten votes. In 1981, he took office in Burlington; Reagan took office in Washington. Sanders isn’t a Debsian socialist; he’s a socialist in the sense that Reagan used that word to describe L.B.J. “He campaigned on the promise of a better life for the working man,” Alan Richman wrote in the Boston Globe. “Nobody seemed to mind that the dream Sanders believes in is called socialism.” He drew the attention of the national press when he ran for reëlection, in 1983. In the Wall Street Journal, for instance, Jane Mayer (who is now at The New Yorker) reported that Sanders began a speech at a fundraiser for the United Way by saying, “I don’t believe in charities.” (He later explained by pointing at the donors: “Most of them were conservative Republicans busy cutting services to low-income people. Then they go collect nickels and dimes, mostly from working people, and congratulate each other on their generosity. I find that hypocritical.”) The head of the Burlington United Way told Mayer, “His speech was, uh, a little longer than we expected.”","2548","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"
"He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, as Vermont’s only congressman. He told Elizabeth Kolbert, then a political reporter for the Times, that there were perks to being the only socialist in Congress. “I can’t get punished,” Sanders said. “What are they going to do? Kick me out of the party?” At the time, the most notable way in which he had bucked the Democratic Party had to do with gun control: Sanders opposed the Brady Bill, which placed regulations on the purchase of handguns, a position that’s come up, lately, now that the press is taking him a bit more seriously. (Sanders said then that he did not believe gun control was a federal matter; more lately, he has said that, as a man who holds a middle ground on the issue, he can broker a compromise. Many critics are unpersuaded.) After serving eight terms in the House, he was elected to the Senate in 2006.

"A father’s pride shines through, even in a federal criminal complaint. According to the F.B.I., on November 27, 2012, Adam Skelos, the son of Dean Skelos, the majority leader of the New York Senate, sent his father a copy of his plush new consulting contract: more than two hundred thousand dollars to help AbTech Industries, an environmental firm, obtain state contracts for treating storm water. Adam’s scientific expertise was limited; he told an associate that he “literally knew nothing about water or, you know, any of that stuff.” The elder Skelos, a Long Island Republican, had helped arrange the job—the political equivalent of buying jerseys for the team to insure his son a spot on the roster—but the father replied to his son’s news as if he were the star player: “Mazel Tov,” he wrote.","May 7, 2015","2558","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/dean-skelos-corruption-new-york-and-shanghai"

"In charges unsealed on Monday, Dean and Adam Skelos face six counts of fraud and extortion for what prosecutors describe as a five-year tag-team enterprise that extracted commissions, contracts, and other payments from the New York State government and the businesses that dealt with it. (Senator Skelos and his son have denied any wrongdoing.) Among other misdeeds, the father is accused of pressuring a real-estate executive to funnel commissions to Adam, who also worked as a title insurance salesman, and of pushing natural-gas-drilling rules that would have boosted Adam’s commissions.","2560","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/dean-skelos-corruption-new-york-and-shanghai"
"But, in paging through the complaint, one is struck, most of all, by the audacity of Adam’s alleged efforts to capitalize on his family name. In December, 2011, Adam “sought and obtained from his father’s Senate Office records of top donors” so that he could “attempt to sell products to these donors.” At times, one almost feels sorry for the father who is receiving spectacularly obtuse requests from his thirty-two-year-old son. Suspecting that the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, was monitoring them, Adam complained over the phone that “you can’t talk normally because it’s like fucking Preet Bharara is listening to every fucking phone call.” At one point, Dean warned, “Right now we are in dangerous times Adam.” Sympathy should be finite, however; when Long Island was flooding last December, Adam cheered the profits produced by “major water problems here with all the flooding going on.… I love it! Keep it coming Mother Nature!” Dean replied, “It will,” as both father and son laughed.","2561","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/dean-skelos-corruption-new-york-and-shanghai"
"New York, Illinois, Louisiana, and Kentucky have claims to the title of “most corrupt state,” depending on how you measure them. On a per-capita basis, Louisiana is the champ, but recently New York has surged: three of the past four Senate leaders have been indicted, a governor was forced to resign for hiring prostitutes, and the comptroller was found to be taking kickbacks. Skelos is the twenty-third New York State lawmaker to be indicted or charged with a crime since 2010. And the Skelos case is likely to draw in others because a man named Charles Dorego, a well-connected real estate executive, is cooperating with prosecutors. “If Dorego is involved…then you can bet more trees are going to fall,” a lobbyist told Capital New York. If Albany Republicans lose faith in Skelos, they may have trouble turning the leadership over to Thomas Libous, their number two in the Senate, because he is scheduled to go on trial this summer on charges of lying to the F.B.I. Later this month, his son will be sentenced on similar charges.","2562","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/dean-skelos-corruption-new-york-and-shanghai"
"It may be most helpful to compare New York to a more distant local government, one that, beset by corruption cases and embarrassed by the flamboyant abuse of family ties, has finally been shamed into action: Shanghai’s. In a national pilot program announced this week, China’s largest city introduced rules that bar the families of senior officials from running private businesses. “You can’t have your cake and eat it too,” Han Zheng, party chief of Shanghai, was quoted as saying, according to Reuters. “If you choose to be an official, you can’t go into business and strike it rich.” The city government Web site explained that spouses and children of its high-ranking officials can no longer “register businesses or partnerships, invest in non-listed enterprises or register a business overseas and do business back in China.”","2563","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/dean-skelos-corruption-new-york-and-shanghai"
"It’s not clear how, when, or even if the Shanghai rule will be enforced, and it’s not likely to mark a sea change. Though China’s President, Xi Jinping, has overseen a vast anti-corruption campaign, including the arrest of several high-profile “tigers,” corruption in high-ranking families is such a hallmark of modern Chinese politics that observers speculate that Wang Qishan, the head of the anti-corruption drive, was given the job of cleaning it up in part because he has no children, so he was less vulnerable to embarrassing discoveries in his own house.","2564","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/dean-skelos-corruption-new-york-and-shanghai"
"The awkward fact is that cases of “princeling” corruption in the Communist Party, the Democratic Party, and the Republican Party have more in common with each other than any of them would care to admit. Americans enjoy the notion that our commitment to transparency and accountability is a self-correcting constraint against the sort of clannish looting that infects authoritarian systems; Chinese officials prefer to imagine that the Party’s devotion to sacrifice and fairness checks the culture of greed and self-dealing that infects capitalist political culture. But both beliefs run thin today. In an unusual acknowledgment of the similarities, certain Wall Street banks are in a dispute with the U.S. government over its effort to use foreign-bribery laws to punish them for giving jobs to the princeling relatives of Chinese officials and state-owned company managers, in the hope of getting deals. (J.P. had to close down a program called “sons and daughters.”) Certain banks, according to the Wall Street Journal, object to the investigation not because they deny such things happen but because they believe it is “threatening to criminalize standard business practices in some countries.”","2565","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/dean-skelos-corruption-new-york-and-shanghai"

"Before the term “mass incarceration” started appearing on the front pages of newspapers, before Obama became the first sitting President to visit a federal prison, before Democrats and Republicans began working together on criminal-justice reform, Randy Credico was screaming about the injustices of America’s incarceration policies. He wasn’t writing angry op-eds for newspapers; he was, literally, screaming. One day in 2001, I found him in front of Kings County State Supreme Court, hollering at passersby: “They’re taking black children out of your neighborhood and putting them in Attica!

But, as I learned, his animosity toward the prison system was well founded: his father spent almost a decade behind bars before he was born, and he grew up hearing horrific tales about life in prison. Born in 1954, in Monterey Park, California, Credico got an early start as a comedian and appeared on the “Tonight Show” at age thirty. On air, he compared U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick to Eva Braun; he never got invited back. He later believed that his radical politics—combined with a love of cocaine—had derailed his comedy career. At forty-three, he was searching for a second act when he saw a C-SPAN debate about New York’s Rockefeller drug laws, which were then the most punitive in the country.

"He began visiting prisons in upstate New York, and befriended inmates and their families. In the spring of 1998, he held his first protest, with a few dozen inmates’ relatives, holding up posters in the rain in front of Rockefeller Center. The protests continued for years—at Rockefeller Center, at courthouses around the city, at politicians’ fund-raisers, at the State Capitol in Albany. When then Governor George Pataki held a fund-raiser at the Yale Club, Credico was across the street with inmates’ family members, waving signs and chanting. I was a reporter for the Village Voice then, and I interviewed him many times. He seemed to spend most of his days on his cell phone: planning events, badgering reporters, fielding calls from prisoners and their relatives. He had a knack for drawing attention, and for converting an argument that had largely been made with numbers into a manifestly human drama. At one point, I calculated that he had generated more than a hundred news stories, largely by inviting reporters to his events and introducing them to the families of inmates. At the end of 2004, New York’s legislators rewrote the Rockefeller drug laws.

Cocaine and alcohol became harder to resist, and when he got drunk he had a bad habit of shooting off nasty mass e-mails to friends, acquaintances, politicians, journalists, and activists. He called various targets “shameless,” a “clown,” and a “pile of lard.” He told the leaders of one progressive group that they were all a “bunch of non working, trust funded white people.” Every morning, he would wake up unable to remember what he had written, and open his computer to discover who was no longer talking to him.","2570","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-man-who-screamed-so-loud-the-drug-laws-changed"

I hated going to sleep because I knew I had to wake up.” He started working on a book, which he titled “Suicide Note.” On January 16th, the twenty-third anniversary of his father’s death, he posted pictures on his Facebook page of Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, and other writers who had taken their lives.","2571","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-man-who-screamed-so-loud-the-drug-laws-changed"

He decided to find a way back into this fight, and came up with a new cause.

New York State’s retirement fund and New York City’s pensions funds own millions of dollars of shares in both companies. Soon Credico was talking about these investments constantly. “There’s nothing worse than the exploitation of human beings for private profit,” he says. “You can’t invest in something that feeds into human misery.”","2575","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-man-who-screamed-so-loud-the-drug-laws-changed"
"Credico has chosen a name for his campaign, EPIC (short for End Prison-Industrial Complex), and set up a Facebook page and a Web site for it. Many activists might focus on researching the companies they are targeting, but one of Credico’s first moves was to order black-and-white-striped prisoner costumes, which he plans to use when he holds protests outside the offices of the state and city comptrollers. “Whatever I have left in my bag of tricks is going to be used on this,” Credico says. “If New York rolls, I think other states would roll, too.” He may succeed again, or maybe his efforts will fizzle out.

"On days that the Justices hear oral arguments, the sessions often begin with the swearing-in of new members of the Bar of the Supreme Court. Membership is largely symbolic. Few lawyers who become members will ever argue before the Court. But it is a serious ritual and, presiding over it, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., is invariably impressive. In addition to coming across as witty and gracious when he welcomes lawyers from Arkansas, Indiana, or Maine, he manages to be both commanding and solicitous. He projects qualities that fit his formal role as Chief Justice of the United States. His manner conveys the sense that, while his work is primarily at the Court, the job calls for him to go about it with a sense of duty to the nation outside the cloistered courtroom, made tangible in the far-flung states the lawyers represent.","June 29, 2015","2577","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"Roberts’s opinion last week for the 6-3 majority in King v. Burwell, about the Affordable Care Act, is written in that spirit. It’s the opinion of a Chief Justice fulfilling his commitment to being an impartial umpire, speaking to the country about the workings of the American constitutional system and why the law compelled the Court to uphold President Obama’s signature legislation. “In a democracy, the power to make the law rests with those chosen by the people. Our role is more confined—‘to say what the law is,’ ” Roberts wrote. (He was quoting from Marbury v. Madison, the 1803 case that enunciated that role for the Supreme Court.) “That is easier in some cases than in others. But in every case we must respect the role of the Legislature, and take care not to undo what it has done. A fair reading of legislation demands a fair understanding of the legislative plan.”","2578","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"The opinion may well be Roberts’s best for the Court since he was sworn in, ten years ago. It showcases his strengths not only as a legal thinker and writer but also as a leader. He chose to write the majority opinion emphasizing the Court’s responsibility to interpret the Affordable Care Act as a whole—and not to fixate on the few isolated words that challengers said undid the tax subsidies enabling millions of Americans to buy health insurance. As Yale Law School’s Abbe Gluck observed, “King turns out to be a case about understanding Congress, not finding it inscrutable. And it is the first major statutory case in which, rather than shying away from the difficult questions raised by the mounting complexity of the modern statutory era, the Court rises to meet it.”","2579","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"Roberts used traditional legal reasoning to reach a result abhorrent to many Republicans. He and five other Justices rejected the challenge before the Court on its merits, but some Court-watchers believe that he also voted as he did for the same reason that he cast the decisive vote in upholding the Affordable Care Act in 2012. As the influential federal appeals-court judge Richard Posner put it then, the judgment to allow the statute to stand was “based to a significant extent on the hammering the court would have taken had it struck the law down.” The Court was in the national spotlight, and its legitimacy as a national institution was at stake.","2580","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"Of course, the Court’s legitimacy in the eyes of the American people is up for grabs in many cases besides those dealing with the Affordable Care Act. Last week’s 5-4 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, making same-sex marriage legal across the nation, was one of them, which Roberts underscored by reading his dissent from the bench.","2581","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"As a piece of argument and rhetoric, the dissent is as skillful as his majority opinion in the King case, though not persuasive. His basic points are that the definition of marriage should have been left to the democratic process, and that the Court’s ruling and the majority’s opinion that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry is “indefensible as a matter of constitutional law.”","2582","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"To find a right to same-sex marriage in the Constitution, he argued, the Court’s precedents require that it be “objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.” Same-sex marriage is not rooted in those ways, so the Constitution cannot be read to compel it: “The people of a State are free to expand marriage to include same-sex couples, or to retain the historic definition.”","2583","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"Roberts makes a forceful case for judicial self-restraint – for unelected federal judges not reading meaning into the Constitution based on their personal preferences – quoting Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Learned Hand, and other great practitioners of that philosophy in the twentieth century. One of the greats he quotes is Judge Henry Friendly, who was among the country’s most distinguished federal appeals-court judges when he was on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, from 1959 to 1986. Roberts was one of his law clerks. As the branch of the federal government with command of neither troops nor treasury yet with the final authority to “say what the law is,” the judiciary must always exercise its power with care, which is why judges picked by Presidents of both parties have extolled the philosophy of restraint.","2584","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"The Chief Justice is wrong in the marriage case, however, because, despite the acceptance that same-sex couples have gained in much of the United States, reflected in state laws allowing them to marry, there are parts of the country where they are victims of prejudice. As members of a minority, these couples, by extension of well-established law, are due the full protection of their equality and liberty under the Constitution, including the protection of their right to marry. The obligation of the Supreme Court is not to pour new meaning into that law’s old words, but to apply its enduring principles to an evolving country.","2585","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"Justice Anthony Kennedy said as much and more in his majority opinion. He wrote that the “dynamic of our constitutional system is that individuals need not await legislative action before asserting a fundamental right.” But his opinion is not always as lucid as one about a ruling of this magnitude should be—and it is so grandiose that he left himself open to a snide crack in Justice Antonin Scalia’s dissent: “The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.”","2586","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"Explicitly in the same-sex marriage case and implicitly in the Affordable Care Act case, Roberts recognized that the Court’s credibility as a national institution is seriously at risk. The five conservatives appointed by Republican Presidents have repeatedly flouted restraint to reach results favored by the Republican Party, over dissents by the four moderate liberals appointed by Democratic Presidents. Roberts has often led this activism. For the first time in history, the Court is regularly polarized along political lines, which makes the party of the President who appointed a Justice the most salient fact about him or her. As a result of this political turmoil, even with the Court’s modest shift to the left this term and general moderation, its standing in public-opinion polls is remarkably low.","2587","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"The death-penalty case decided today by 5-4, with the usual right-left split, provides a graphic example of why this is so. The conservative majority rejected a challenge from three Oklahoma death-row inmates to the use of the drug midazolam as a sedative in the state’s three-drug lethal-injection procedure. The majority opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, Jr., said that the inmates had “failed to identify a known and available alternative method of execution that entails a lesser risk of pain” and that when the federal trial court handling the case “found that the prisoners failed to establish that Oklahoma’s use of a massive dose of midazolam in its execution protocol entails a substantial risk of severe pain,” the court wasn’t clearly wrong.","2588","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"In dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor explained that the requirement that the plaintiffs identify an alternate method was supported by less than a majority of the Court in a previous case, and that the testimony of the one witness the trial court relied on with regard to the risk of severe pain was “entirely unsupported by any study or third-party source, contradicted by the extrinsic evidence proffered by petitioners, inconsistent with the scientific understanding of midazolam’s properties, and apparently premised on basic logical errors.”","2589","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"Alito responded to each of Sotomayor’s points, but primarily made a different argument: that the Constitution’s cruel-and-unusual-punishment clause “does not require the avoidance of all risk of pain.” Sotomayor explained that the risk of pain was not what the petitioners had challenged. They provided evidence that midazolam is “incapable of keeping someone ‘insensate and immobile in the face of [more] noxious stimuli,’ including the extreme pain and discomfort associated with administration of the second and third drugs in Oklahoma’s lethal injection protocol”—“burning, searing pain” that “may well be the chemical equivalent of being burned at the stake.” For a century and a quarter, the Supreme Court has considered that “manifestly cruel and unusual.”","2590","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"The Justices were making legal arguments, but because of the profound right-left, Republican-appointee-Democrat-appointee chasm, the disagreement comes across as political and irreconcilable. That impression is strongly reinforced by the even greater gulf between a dissent by Justice Stephen Breyer, calling for “full briefing on a more basic question: whether the death penalty violates the Constitution,” and a scornful concurrence by Justice Antonin Scalia. Breyer explained that safeguards the Court adopted nearly forty years ago “to ensure that the penalty would be applied reliably and not arbitrarily” have not worked. Scalia, as if on the hustings and not the Supreme Court bench, responded as if Breyer had made a moral case against the death penalty, which he had not.","2591","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"Scalia barely engaged the argument Breyer did make. Breyer summarized more than a generation of evidence indicating that states can swiftly impose the death penalty, as the ultimate form of vengeance on behalf of the community. Or they can attempt to apply it reliably, consistently, and fairly—which does not satisfy the urge for vengeance and is much crueler to death-row inmates, who are usually kept for long stretches in solitary confinement. But they cannot do both. To Breyer, this evidence “strongly supports the claim that the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment.” Scalia lampooned, “Welcome to Groundhog Day” and then derided, “A vocal minority of the Court, waving over their heads a ream of the most recent abolitionist studies (a superabundant genre) as though they have discovered the lost folios of Shakespeare, insist that now, at long last, the death penalty must be abolished for good.”","2592","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"It is tempting to say that, to reclaim its legitimacy as a national institution, the Court should leave politics to Congress and the President. But, as the political scientist Robert Dahl once wrote, “To consider the Supreme Court of the United States strictly as a legal institution is to underestimate its significance in the American political system. For it is also a political institution, an institution, that is to say, for arriving at decisions on controversial questions of national policy.”","2593","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"What is supposed to distinguish the Court from the other branches of the government is how it reaches those decisions. In his Obergefell dissent, the Chief Justice wrote that legitimacy “flows from the perception—and reality—that we exercise humility and restraint in deciding cases according to the Constitution and law.” That opinion and his majority opinion in the King case, the major cases of the memorable term that has just ended, are models of how he and the other Justices can contribute to the rebuilding of the Supreme Court’s reputation.","2594","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-chief-justice"
"When will the Fed start to raise interest rates? Who will win the 2016 Presidential election? Obviously, these are two very different questions, but they are also connected. Without wanting to sound too much like the great historical materialist James Carville, I’ve always believed that politics is the flip side of economics, and vice versa, because they share a common framework.","June 9, 2015","2595","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"In this case, the framework describes a country still feeling the after-effects of the deepest economic slump since the Great Depression. How can that be? Didn’t the recession officially end six years ago, in the summer of 2009? Yes, it did. That’s when the gross domestic product stopped declining and turned upward. The National Bureau of Economic Research, which adjudicates these things, decided that uptick in G.D.P. was sufficient to mark the recession’s trough. But the downturn was so drastic, and the recovery has been so moderately paced, that some of its consequences are still lingering.","2596","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"You can see these consequences in the figures for wages and income, which show, for example, that the median U.S. household income in 2014 was still sitting about six per cent below the level it reached in 2007, the year the slump began. You can also see the consequences in polling data suggesting that many Americans believe the economy is still in recession. (More precisely, they thought this at the start of the year, which is when the most recent poll I could find on the subject was taken.) And you can see the consequences in the public hostility toward Wall Street, which remains largely undiminished.","2597","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"As it happens, the economists who work on Wall Street also follow this issue closely, and in the past few days they’ve produced two pieces of research that both suggest that the economy won’t be fully recovered until 2017 or thereabouts, by which point we might well be justified in calling the previous ten years a “lost decade”—the phrase popularized by the economists Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff in their famous studies of past financial crises and their aftermath.","2598","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"The first analysis that caught my eye, thanks to a story on Bloomberg Business, came from the economics team at Deutsche Bank. It looked at G.D.P. per person, which is perhaps the broadest measure of how an economy is doing. G.D.P. per person recovered to its 2007 level in the fall of 2013, which some analysts took as an indicator that things had returned to normal. The bank’s analysts beg to differ. They define a recovery “as being complete when all of the real output per capita that was lost as a result of the crisis (relative to the pre-crisis peak) has been recovered.” For instance, if the economy suffered a cumulative loss during the recession of ten per cent of G.D.P. (per person), relative to the 2007 level, it would have to make up that entire ten per cent before the rebound could be considered complete.","2599","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"From this perspective, the recovery, attenuated as it has been, still has some ways to go. “If real GDP per capita continues to grow at its post-crisis rate of 1.4%, the output lost due to the crisis will only be fully recovered in Q4 2017, exactly ten years after the recession began,” the analysts write.","2600","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"The other interesting update, from David Mericle, an economist at Goldman Sachs, looks at the labor market. After last week’s employment report, which showed that the economy created two hundred and eighty thousand jobs in May, it is tempting to assume that things are back to normal here, too. After all, in the past two years, the economy has created 5.6 million jobs—a fact highlighted in a recent blog post by Jason Furman, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers—and the official unemployment rate is now 5.5 per cent, down from a peak of ten per cent in October, 2009.","2601","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"Mericle doesn’t deny that things have improved: no reasonable person could. He simply asks, “When will the labor market return to full employment?” Clearly, the answer to that question depends on how “full employment” is defined, but there is no universally agreed-upon definition of the term, except that it is meant to indicate the level at which inflation could be expected to start accelerating. Mericle’s interpretation employs a couple of reasonable-looking metrics: an official unemployment rate of five per cent, which is where the jobless rate sat in December, 2007, when the recession began, and an “underemployment rate” of nine per cent. The underemployment rate, as measured by the Labor Department, includes the unemployed, plus people working part-time for economic reasons and those “marginally attached to the labor force.” It provides a broader take on how the labor market is doing than the official unemployment rate, and it is watched closely by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues.","2602","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"Based on what’s been happening recently to G.D.P. growth, job creation, and labor-force participation rates, Mericle concludes that the official jobless rate will reach full-employment level in the first quarter of next year. But the underemployment rate won’t hit nine per cent until the end of 2016. And it won’t dip below the full-employment level, which is the point at which inflation could be expected to start accelerating, until the first quarter of 2017.","2603","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"So what does all this mean for the two questions I started with, regarding when the Fed will raise interest rates and who will win the Presidential election?","2604","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"As far as the Fed’s deliberations go, the new research provides more backing for Yellen’s “go easy” approach. Ever since she took office, she has made clear that she wants to give the economy plenty of time to recuperate, and that she is concerned about the danger of aborting the recovery by rapidly raising interest rates. That doesn’t mean the Fed won’t take any action at its September meeting: if job growth remains strong throughout the summer, it will probably go ahead and increase the federal funds rate by a quarter of a point. But the rate-hike process will be gradual and data-dependent. The threat of rising inflation is still pretty distant: it doesn’t provide a justification to rush things.","2605","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"The 2016 election will, of course, turn on more than economics. But, because many Americans have yet to see the recovery reflected in their paychecks, the Republicans will seek to play up and exploit a general feeling of malaise. However, they also sought to employ this strategy in 2012, when the unemployment rate remained above 7.5 per cent. It didn’t work then, and it’s far from guaranteed to work next year. In order to persuade the American public that the G.O.P. has the wherewithal to raise living standards and move the country beyond the “lost decade,” the party will need to come up with some specific and fully costed proposals, of which there are currently few signs.","2606","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"
"The Democrats, for their part, will be making the same argument that the Conservative Party in Britain made during the recent U.K. elections: “Steady as she goes. Things are getting better. Don’t let the other crowd return to power and wreck it.” As the Tories’ victory showed, this can be a powerful political message, especially if the opposition, and its candidate for leader, are widely perceived as incompetent or extremist.","2607","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-will-the-lost-decade-play-out-in-2016"

When I stand up on a stage like this in front of all of you, there is one thing you will know for sure: I mean what I say and I say what I mean.

Although he finished ten points behind “uncommitted,” Carter won the state.

Her visit lasted three days, taking her to “small” events, including a fast-food meal, and she brought along dozens of campaign workers, who will stay behind and keep working there. In an op-ed published in the Des Moines Register, she talked about the “great ideas” she got from her trip: “I will carry the stories and wisdom of the Iowans I met with me throughout the campaign and hopefully onto the White House.” According to the Washington Post, Clinton’s op-ed mentioned five Iowans, all of whom happened to be among the thirteen selected for one of her carefully organized roundtables. Not much was being left to chance.","2624","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"Clinton is some forty points ahead of other Democrats in Iowa, so it’s easy to write off her potential competitors, among them the former Maryland governor (and, ahem, former Baltimore mayor) Martin O’Malley and the former Virginia senator Jim Webb, both of whom are “exploring” possible runs; and the independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who calls himself a Democratic Socialist, and who has skipped the exploration step. Sanders’s appeal is close to that of the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who seems to mean it when she says she’s not running, although, as Ryan Lizza reported, she intends to make her influence felt.","2625","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"But for all that, perhaps it’s too early to declare the race over. Webb is a particularly interesting case. Like Jimmy Carter, he’s a Southerner, a veteran (in Webb’s case, a decorated combat veteran), and out of step with the Party on some issues (he strongly supports gun ownership). Yet, like Warren and Sanders, he has little sympathy for Wall Street (for years, he’s made an issue of income inequality), and he showed an early willingness to take on such issues as mass incarceration—“courageously stepping into the void, calling for a national commission to re-assess criminal justice policy,” as a Times editorial put it in 2008. (Clinton, in the wake of the rioting in Baltimore, just made it one of her issues, too.)","2626","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"The candidacies of O’Malley, Sanders, and Webb, and probably others, might be seen as an updated version of the Carter experiment—to discover, as Webb recently told George Stephanopoulos, whether it’s “possible to conduct a viable campaign” in conditions that, in 2016, seem to make the venture preposterously out of reach. The former Florida governor Jeb Bush, one of the Republican front-runners, referred to those conditions the other day when he said that a candidate shouldn’t need a billion dollars to run (this is the obscene amount that Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, give or take a few million, each spent in 2012) while announcing that he’d already set a record for fund-raising in the first hundred days. (Bush didn’t reveal figures, but the Wall Street Journal noted that the previous record was held by Hillary Clinton, who raised thirty-six million dollars in her first hundred days, in 2008.)","2627","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"Unlike the Republicans, who have already scheduled at least six debates before the Iowa caucuses, the Democratic schedule is T.B.D., and it’s possible that voters won’t even get a chance to see the Democratic candidates side by side. Clinton was often formidable in debates in 2008, when she competed with Barack Obama, as was Webb in 2007, when Democrats picked him to respond to George W. Bush’s State of the Union message. He addressed income disparity (“When one looks at the health of our economy, it’s almost as if we are living in two different countries”) and, with devastating accuracy, Iraq: “The President took us into this war recklessly. He disregarded warnings from the National Security Advisor during the first Gulf War, the chief of staff of the Army, two former commanding generals of the Central Command … and many, many others with great integrity and long experience in national-security affairs. We are now, as a nation, held hostage to the predictable ­ and predicted ­ disarray that has followed.” Webb, though, didn’t seek reëlection in 2012, in large part because he deeply disliked the business, and the politicking, of politics, a real drawback if he is serious about running for President. And if he is serious, he will no doubt have to revisit some earlier statements, such as in a 1979 magazine article in which he argued against a combat role for women in the military, and his complicated view of affirmative action. Yet he appears able to change his mind; like many others, he has been “evolving” on the question of same-sex marriage, and on “Meet the Press” said, “I think this has been a good thing for the country.”","2628","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has weaknesses that won’t simply vanish—most recently, the bad publicity surrounding the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, a charitable enterprise vulnerable to charges of mismanagement and conflicts of interest, which, as the New York columnist Jonathan Chait wrote, was “a kind of quasi-government run by themselves, which was staffed by their own loyalists and made up the rules as it went along.” All that is only increasing the appetite of the Republican contenders. There are many on that side, some of them unnervingly weird, all of them ravenous for the Presidency, and all wanting nothing more than to face a candidate who, like Jeb Bush, will have a hard time exciting voters looking for nondynastic faces and fresh ideas.","2629","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"

He would never have been allowed out of the box. No one would have paid attention to him.” That was in a time before techno-consultants and bottomless wells of money, when it still seemed possible for a Jim or Martin or Bernie “Who?” to alter a race whose outcome appeared predetermined.

He is, in private meetings, a congenial stoic, even as he chews Nicorette gum to stay ahead of an old vice. But his frustration—that the bigger message of his foreign policy is being lost in the political furies over Iran—was conspicuous. He made clear that the proposed deal—the most ambitious foreign-policy initiative of his Presidency—is less about Iran than about getting America off its war track; Obama believes that Washington, almost by default, too often unwisely deploys the military as the quickest solution to international crises.","August 6, 2015","2631","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-on-war-and-peace"

A portrait of Franklin Roosevelt is on one wall; a picture of Teddy Roosevelt, as a Rough Rider on horseback, hangs over the fireplace. The most striking piece in the room is the smallest: The 1906 Nobel Prize, the first won by an American and the first by a U.S. President, is encased behind glass. It went to Teddy Roosevelt for mediating an end to the Russo-Japanese war. Only two other Presidents–Woodrow Wilson, for the League of Nations, and Jimmy Carter, after leaving office, for promoting human rights—had won it before Obama was named, just months after his election, more for his spirit than any specific achievement.

We shortchange our influence and our ability to shape events when that’s the only tool we think we have in the toolbox.”","2634","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-on-war-and-peace"
"After six and a half years in office, Obama said that the tough calls—to redeploy American troops to Iraq or to mobilize NATO to launch airstrikes against Libya—have convinced him more than ever of the need to make force a last resort. “In terms of decisions I make, I do think that I have a better sense of how military action can result in unintended consequences,” he said. “And I am confirmed in my belief that much of the time we are making judgments based on percentages, and no decision we make in foreign policy—or, for that matter, any policy—is completely without hair, which is how we kind of describe it. … There’s always going to be some complications.”","2635","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-on-war-and-peace"

I also think that there is a particular mind-set that was on display in the run-up to the Iraq War that continues to this day.

In that sense, there was greater risk.

"“There is nothing in this deal that is dependent on a transformation of the character of the Iranian regime,” Obama said. “This does not represent a strategic rapprochement between the United States and Iran.

Even so, he went on, “It is possible for leaders or regimes to be cruel, bigoted, twisted in their world views and still make rational calculations with respect to their limits and their self-preservation. And what we’ve seen, at least since 1979, is Iran making constant, calculated decisions that allow it to preserve the regime, to expand their influence where they can, to be opportunistic, to create what they view as hedges against potential Israeli attack, in the form of Hezbollah and other proxies in the region.”","2641","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-on-war-and-peace"

It wasn’t easy to negotiate arms agreements with a near military peer”—the Soviet Union—“that could blow up every American city,” he said. “But, when it comes to arms-control agreements, or nonproliferation agreements of any magnitude, by definition you’re generally dealing with those folks. I don’t have to negotiate an arms agreement with Great Britain or with France.”","2643","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-on-war-and-peace"

"Obama compared Iran’s rhetoric to schoolyard taunts. “Part of the underlying premise of why people don’t feel we should have to put up with that stuff is we’re bigger; if we launch a military strike, we can wipe them out. There is a little bit of that schoolyard attitude of, it’s one thing for a guy your own size to mouth off to you. But if there’s a little guy, you should just smack him around.

If Republicans pass a Resolution of Disapproval, the President would then have to veto it, and it would go back to the Hill for a second vote. To prevent an override, the White House would need to win support from more than a third of either the House or the Senate.* The timing is tight. Obama is also scheduled to speak at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly on September 28th, the same day as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. It would be highly embarrassing for a President to go before the United Nations while still struggling to win approval. Obama said that he expects to win the vote: “Eventually.

Neither of those patrons are particularly sentimental. They don’t seem concerned about the humanitarian disaster that’s been wrought by Assad and this conflict over the last several years. But they are concerned about the potential collapse of the Syrian state.

"He added, “How to execute an actual transition is very difficult. The strongest opposition forces on the ground are vicious terrorist organizations that are constantly merging and blending with people who just want to get the yoke of an oppressive regime off their backs. And being able to sort through what a representative government would look like—one that would give Sunnis inside of Syria a sense of their rightful place at the table, while preserving protections for Alawite and Druze and Christians after so much bloodshed—is going to be tough. And just because Iran and Syria may recognize Assad’s weaknesses doesn’t necessarily mean that Assad recognizes his weaknesses.” Obama warned against expecting a breakthrough anytime soon. “But I think the conversations are more serious now than they might have been earlier,” he said.","2649","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-on-war-and-peace"

Graciousness in victory is, perhaps, its own reward. But it may also be appropriate, on the occasion of the 6–3 decision in King v. Burwell, to observe that this lawsuit was from its inception a shameful and cynical exercise, which illustrated the debasement of the contemporary conservative legal movement.","June 25, 2015","2656","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doom-for-a-cynical-assault-on-obamacare"
"The facts of the case are by now well known. The core goal of the Affordable Care Act was to provide health insurance to as many Americans as possible. States were encouraged to set up exchanges, or marketplaces, where individuals could buy insurance, and there would be subsidies from the federal government for people who needed them. Before it passed, in 2010, the A.C.A. was subject to one of the longest and most contentious congressional debates in recent history. The law was attacked and analyzed from every conceivable perspective. The law may have been wise, or it may have been foolish, but it was universally understood.","2657","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doom-for-a-cynical-assault-on-obamacare"
"Months after the law went into effect, a group of conservative lawyers discovered what was, at most, a drafting error in the law. A section of the law suggested that the subsidies should only go to individuals who bought insurance on exchanges “established by the State.” This discovery prompted the lawyers to argue that the subsidies would not be available to people who bought insurance on the federal exchange, which is the only exchange in thirty-four states. Notably—crucially—not one member of Congress who debated the law suggested that subsidies were to be denied to purchasers on the federal exchange. Still, these lawyers recruited plaintiffs and argued that more than six million people who bought insurance on the federal exchange should be denied their subsidies.","2658","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doom-for-a-cynical-assault-on-obamacare"
"What principle was at stake in this lawsuit? The correct answer is none. This is a contrast to National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, which was the first challenge to the A.C.A. In that case, the plaintiffs argued that Congress lacked the constitutional authority to pass the law in the first place. The case made a respectable (if ultimately unsuccessful) argument for a narrow conception of the government’s ability to regulate health care under the Constitution. King v. Burwell did not implicate the Constitution at all. It was, rather, based on a claim that the Obama Administration violated the A.C.A. itself by offering subsidies to purchasers on the federal exchange. The case was, in other words, a sophisticated game of gotcha, based on what was, again, essentially a typographical error. The case was only about trying to destroy the law by denying insurance to millions and setting in motion a death spiral of raised premiums, cancelled policies, and more rate hikes until the system collapsed. (The sheer callousness of the plaintiffs’ lawyers in King was something to behold. Millions tossed off health insurance? Hey, deal with it.)","2659","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doom-for-a-cynical-assault-on-obamacare"
"For writing the opinion upholding the law, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., is being hailed (and denounced) as a latter-day Earl Warren—a Republican appointee who turns out to be a secret liberal. This is hardly accurate. Roberts is still the author of the Shelby County case, which gutted the Voting Rights Act, and an eager member of the court majority in Citizens United and all the other cases that undermined our system of regulating political campaigns. But as his restrained and cogent opinion in King demonstrated, he is not a partisan ideologue. Quoting liberally from opinions by Justice Antonin Scalia, Roberts made the commonsensical observation that a law must be interpreted as a whole, not by the analysis of a few stray words here and there. And the context of the full A.C.A. compelled the obvious conclusion that the subsidies were intended to go to individuals on both the federal as well as state exchanges. The law would otherwise make no sense. As Roberts wrote, “The statutory scheme compels us to reject [the plaintiffs’] interpretation because it would destabilize the individual insurance market in any State with a Federal Exchange, and likely create the very ‘death spirals’ that Congress designed the Act to avoid.” Recognition of this obvious fact does not make Roberts a liberal; it makes him a judge.","2660","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doom-for-a-cynical-assault-on-obamacare"
"In dissent, Scalia cranked up his increasingly tired act as the Court’s sound-bite generator. According to Scalia, the Court engaged in “interpretive jiggery-pokery,” spouted “pure applesauce,” and should prompt Obamacare to be renamed “SCOTUScare.” The problem with Scalia’s dissent is the problem with the lawsuit as a whole. It’s a transparent attempt to undermine the law by whatever means happen to be available rather than by any consistent jurisprudential principle. Back in the nineteen-sixties and seventies, judicial conservatives believed in restraint—in deference to the elected branches of government. That led them to oppose such decisions as Roe v. Wade, which overturned state laws banning abortion, and to support broad exercises of executive power. The King case shows that some conservatives have abandoned their old idea of deference to the executive branch and are simply filing lawsuits against the laws they don’t like—and coming up with whatever reasons they can to support them.","2661","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doom-for-a-cynical-assault-on-obamacare"

In an interview with Politico’s Glenn Thrush that month, he laid out the sort of campaign he could conduct, focussing on rising inequality and the wage squeeze. “It’s either going to be me or someone else who is going to make this argument in the Democratic Party.” As I wrote at the time, “He’s still full of energy, he’s served President Obama loyally, he loves the game, and he thinks—pundits and pollsters be damned—that this might be the moment for an old-school, shit-kicking, hand-grasping, mouth-running, stick-up-for-the-working-stiff pol like himself.”","August 3, 2015","2663","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"

That was premature. In January of this year, he told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos that he still hadn’t made up his mind, noting, “There’s plenty of time.” Now, however, the clock is ticking. In recent weeks, as Amy Chozick, of the Times, reported on Saturday, some of Biden’s aides have been meeting with potential donors and campaign staffers who have not yet committed to Clinton. The report said that confidants of Biden expect him to make a final decision one way or the other by early September.","2664","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Two things appear to have prompted Biden to get serious. The first was the death, in May, of his forty-six-year-old son Beau, who had urged his father to take a third and final tilt at the Presidency. (Biden’s previous campaigns were in 1988 and 2008.) The other factor was the growing perception among political professionals that Clinton could be vulnerable in a general election, which is partly based on polling data showing that many voters distrust her. “The No. 1 thing voters want is a candidate who is honest and trustworthy, and the veep is leading in those polls,” William Pierce, the executive director of the Draft Biden 2016 super PAC, told Chozick.","2665","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"

It found that just thirty-seven per cent of likely voters find Clinton “honest and trustworthy,” and that fifty-seven per cent don’t. For Biden, the figures were reversed. Fifty-eight per cent of the respondents said that they found him honest and trustworthy; thirty-four per cent said they didn’t. The Vice-President also led the former Secretary of State on the issue of empathy. Asked whether he “cares about the needs and problems of people like you or not,” fifty-seven per cent said yes, and thirty-five per cent said no.

Fifty-eight per cent of respondents said that Clinton had “strong leadership qualities,” compared to fifty-two per cent for Biden. Still, the survey found that in head-to-head contests with the Republican candidates, Biden did at least as well as Clinton.

The Clinton campaign has already raised well over fifty million dollars, and it is aiming to raise a hundred million by the end of the year. (That doesn’t count all the money that will be raised by super PACs and other organizations allied with Hillary.) Clinton already has big political operations in the early voting states.

But he would still be a long-shot candidate. Positioning himself to the left of Clinton, he would be competing with Bernie Sanders for the votes of progressive Democrats, some of whom wouldn’t welcome his late entry.

Despite his long history as a senator and Vice-President, many members of the political and media establishment have long seen him as lacking the necessary gravitas and depth for the highest office. Doubts about Biden’s seriousness date back to his 1988 Presidential bid, which was derailed by allegations that he had exaggerated his college record and plagiarized part of a speech.","2670","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Nineteen eighty-eight is a long time ago, and Biden has achieved a lot since then, including serving as Vice-President for the past six and a half years. An eminently decent and likable man, he has never had the stench of corruption that attaches itself to many people who stay in Washington for a long time. About the worst that you hear said about him is that he is a blowhard who occasionally blurts out embarrassing things.","2671","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"In an era of scripted politicians and carefully orchestrated campaigns, some Democrats may see Biden’s spontaneity as a plus. And the issues of the moment play to his strengths. As long ago as 1988, he was talking about increasing social mobility, defending the middle class, and challenging the notion that you can’t buck the market. “For too long in this society, we have celebrated unrestrained individualism over common community,” he said in his first announcement speech. “For too long as a nation, we have been lulled by the anthem of self-interest. . . . We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference.”","2672","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Back then, Biden was a youngish Roman Catholic pol on the up, and, doubtless, the echoes of John F. Kennedy in his speech were deliberate. Today, he is older and more grizzled (as are many of the rest of us). Taking on the Clintons and the Republicans is a task that would give anyone pause, let alone a seventy-two-year-old who has just lost his son. Even after the latest round of speculation, it is perfectly possible, indeed likely, that he will stay out of the race. But if he decides to give it a go, he might surprise a few people.","2673","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Anyone who has followed Hillary Clinton’s career knows that she regards encounters with political reporters with about the same level of enthusiasm that most people regard dental appointments. “Look, she hates you. Period,” one Clinton campaign veteran told Politico’s Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman (who has since moved to the Times) last year. “That’s never going to change.”","July 8, 2015","2674","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Fair enough. After all the horrible things that have been written and said over the years about the former First Lady and Secretary of State, and about her family, it would be surprising if she didn’t dislike the media. But, as Ronald Reagan’s handlers discovered many years ago, the problem with giving journalists the slip, which Clinton has been doing with evident enthusiasm in the early weeks of her Democratic primary campaign, is that eventually this avoidance strategy becomes the story. So, just as Michael Deaver, Larry Speakes, et al. prevailed on the Gipper to do the occasional press conference in an effort to keep the jackals at bay, Clinton’s communications advisers evidently persuaded her to sit down with CNN’s Brianna Keilar for an interview that was advertised as the first of many media interactions to come.","2675","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"If the Clinton campaign thought that she would be treated more softly by Keilar than by one of the network’s more well-known names—Wolf Blitzer or Jake Tapper, say—it was disappointed. Keilar peppered Clinton with questions about the private e-mail server she used as Secretary of State, polls showing that many American distrust her, and the big crowds that her opponent Bernie Sanders is attracting. Then, when Tapper asked Keilar about the interview, Keilar criticized the answers Clinton gave her, saying, “I did not hear a more open or transparent Hillary Clinton.”","2676","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Keilar’s raspberry wasn’t the only one blown in Clinton’s direction. She “looked and sounded cagey and defensive, when her apparent goal is to inspire,” Lloyd Grove, an editor-at-large for the Daily Beast, wrote, adding, “The candidate was, by turns, self-justifying and pugnacious, and occasionally just plain inauthentic.”","2677","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Clinton certainly didn’t sound very convincing at times, especially when she sought to blame Republicans for whipping up concerns about her deleted e-mails and other matters. Given that she didn’t have anything new to announce, it was perhaps surprising that the campaign chose to put her out there now. Why not wait until next week, when she is due to give a speech laying out some economic proposals? As Clinton showed when she steered a question from Keilar about Donald Trump toward the Republican Party’s position on immigration, she’s much more comfortable and persuasive when talking about policy issues.","2678","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"On the positive side, Clinton avoided making any major gaffes, which was probably her primary goal. In today’s always-on media climate, attacks and mistakes dominate the news cycle, and all campaigns know this. If a campaign can supply the former and avoid the latter, it is doing fine. Failure to abide by this maxim leads into Trump territory, where his obnoxious remarks about Mexicans are currently doing serious damage to his business empire. (David Remnick has more on Trump’s campaign.)","2679","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"In any case, forging a working relationship with the national media is just one of two immediate challenges facing Clinton. The other—what to do about the rise of Bernie Sanders—is far more important. Earlier this week, in a front-page piece in the Times, the Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, who ran Howard Dean’s 2004 Presidential campaign, was quoted as saying about Clinton, “Certainly she could lose Iowa.”","2680","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Even if this happened, Trippi added, Clinton would probably go on to win the nomination. That’s true. But just a few weeks ago, the very idea of Sanders winning the Iowa primary would have seemed far-fetched. Now, perceptions are changing. In an interview with Politico (for a piece headlined “The socialist surge”), Robert Reich, the former Secretary of Labor, compared Sanders to Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern, two liberals who, in 1968 and 1972, picked up a lot of support in the early primary states and derailed establishment favorites.","2681","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"It’s far too early to mention Hillary Clinton in the same breath as Lyndon B. Johnson or Ed Muskie, but how she chooses to deal with the Sanders phenomenon will have a greater impact on public opinion than whether she gives regular media interviews. So far, she has largely adopted a watching brief. A Clinton adviser admitted to the Times that the campaign had underestimated Sanders’ appeal in Iowa, but added, “It’s too early to change strategy because no one knows if Sanders will be able to hold on to these voters in the months ahead.”","2682","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Most likely, he will hold on to a good number of them.","2683","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"There are two reasons Sanders is doing so well. Firstly, he’s perceived as an outsider, and he’s tapping into a progressive movement that has little faith in the Democratic Party establishment. Secondly, the primary timetable favors him. On a national basis, according to a recent CNN/O.R.C. poll of likely Democratic voters, Clinton still has a huge lead over Sanders: fifty-seven per cent to fourteen per cent. (In fact, the poll found that Sanders was in third place, behind Vice President Biden, who got sixteen per cent despite not having entered the race.) It so happens, though, that Iowa and New Hampshire both contain many white, college-educated liberals who are sympathetic to the Vermont senator’s views. Sanders is polling less well among other elements of the Democratic coalition, particularly African-Americans and Hispanics, who won’t come out in force until the primary contest moves to states like South Carolina.","2684","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Clearly, Clinton can’t do anything about the electoral calendar. Can she successfully counter Sanders’s political message in the early primary states? Over the next few weeks, as she starts rolling out her campaign proposals, we should get some indication. After that, she is planning on taking a vacation. The schedule for televised Democratic debates, of which there will be half a dozen, has yet to be set, and voting day in Iowa is still almost seven months away. But the race is now on.","2685","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Over the past few days, as family members of the nine people killed by a gunman at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, prepared to bury their loved ones, many of the G.O.P. candidates for President have been offering their thoughts on what to do—or, rather, what not to do—about gun violence.","October 7, 2015","2686","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Let’s start with Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who is currently running second, behind Donald Trump, in the G.O.P. polls. Participating in an exchange on Facebook on Monday night, Carson recalled removing bullets from gunshot victims, and added, “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” On Tuesday morning, Carson went on Fox News and said, “It’s the person behind the gun. Guns don’t kill people.” He didn’t stop there. Asked what he would do if a gunman walked up to him, put a gun to his head, and asked him what his religion was, Carson replied, “I’m glad you asked that question. Because not only would I probably not coöperate with them, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’ ”","2687","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"It’s hard to believe that anybody, let alone a politician running for national office, would insult the victims of a massacre by suggesting that their response had been inadequate. About the most that can be said for Carson is that he isn’t a professional politician: he’s a novice. So is Trump, who, on Tuesday, described himself as a “very big Second Amendment person,” and suggested that the problem in Umpqua was that no one on the scene, apart from the twenty-six-year-old shooter, was armed. (At least one student, an Army veteran, was carrying a gun, a few buildings away.) Trump also said that he opposed a ban on assault weapons—a proposal that he expressed support for in 2000.","2688","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"But, surely, the serious candidates—the Jeb Bushes and Marco Rubios—must have said something more consequential. Not exactly.","2689","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Bush’s “stuff happens” line, which he uttered in South Carolina on Friday, has already entered the political lexicon and provided a gift to the Democrats. Rather than rehashing the debate about whether the remark was taken out of context (it wasn’t), let’s examine what Bush has said since then. After all, he’s had five more days to clarify how he would tackle gun violence. On Monday, he released a new campaign video, which said nothing about what happened in Oregon. On Tuesday, he published an op-ed in the Des Moines Register, which also didn’t bring up the massacre or its aftermath. Then, on Tuesday night, Bush delivered a long speech at a Republican dinner in Iowa. Once again, he made no mention of Umpqua or guns.","2690","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Perhaps that is not surprising. The recipient of an “A+” rating from the National Rifle Association, Bush, during his time as governor of Florida, vigorously opposed efforts to expand gun control, and signed into law the notorious “Stand Your Ground” law. Marco Rubio, who is now leading Bush in most polls, is perhaps a more interesting case. Back in 2000, when he was running for a seat in Florida’s House of Representatives, Rubio said that he supported “reasonable restrictions” on gun sales. And after the Sandy Hook massacre, in December, 2012, Rubio’s spokesman said that Rubio would support measures to keep guns out of the hands of felons and the mentally ill.","2691","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Since then, though, Rubio has backtracked and cozied up to the N.R.A. While campaigning in Iowa on Friday, he said, “Criminals don’t follow gun laws. Only law-abiding people follow gun laws.” On Tuesday, appearing on NBC’s “Today” show, he said, “The laws that many are proposing would have done nothing to prevent these attacks.” Rather than focussing on measures like expanding background checks for gun purchases, “the country should examine mental illness.”","2692","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Many of the other G.O.P. candidates took a similar line. “The problem is mental illness and not necessarily gun registration or gun ownership,” Rand Paul said in a radio interview. Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” Chris Christie told George Stephanopoulos, “I’m very concerned about the mental-health side of this.” On CNN’s “At This Hour,” Mike Huckabee said, “Do we need to do a better job in mental health? You bet we do.”","2693","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"What about Carly Fiorina, who promotes herself as a can-do, problem-solving leader? Couldn’t she say something different and less predictable? No. Fiorina, too, is a loyal supporter of the N.R.A., whose annual meeting she addressed earlier this year in a campaign-style video, boasting about her husband’s concealed-carry permits and saying, “When government takes away our guns, we are headed down a dangerous path.” On Friday, Fiorina criticized President Obama’s impassioned call for action, describing it as “premature, at best,” and “at worst, a really unfortunate politicization of this tragedy.”","2694","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"That was the pretty much the same thing Fiorina said in June, after Obama reacted to the mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. In fact, this is now the standard Republican/N.R.A. line. Each one of these massacres is regrettable and demands further study. But anybody who states the blatantly obvious—that countries with strict guns laws don’t have this problem—is politicizing the issue; they should either zip it, or confine themselves to expressing concern over mental illness.","2695","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Of course, as HBO’s John Oliver pointed out over the weekend, talking about mental illness is largely a diversion, which distorts the facts about gun violence and serves to preserve the status quo. In 2013, during the Obama Administration’s effort to get some relatively minor gun-control laws through Congress, the White House proposed increasing the funding for mental-health programs and other initiatives designed to identify and help people who are potentially dangerous. Republicans in the Senate blocked the gun-control measures anyway, and no doubt they’d do the same this year if Obama were to send over a similar bill. On this issue, elected G.O.P. officials aren’t interested in reason or compromise. They are interested, primarily, in avoiding a challenge in the next election from an N.R.A.-backed candidate.","2696","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"In a sense, there’s nothing new here. For decades now, the N.R.A. and the rest of the gun lobby have had a grip on the Republican Party. But as the number of gun massacres has increased the consequences of this political capture have become harder to ignore. Now, in the full glare of a Presidential election, they cannot be avoided. Rather than engaging in an honest effort to address gun violence and prevent more senseless carnage, practically every G.O.P. candidate has been reduced to repeating a mantra that many of them, surely, cannot fully believe.","2697","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"

"In June of this year, the Democratic Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island, and Brian Schatz, of Hawaii, went to the conservative American Enterprise Institute to introduce the American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act, their proposal for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. “The basic idea is simple,” Whitehouse said, in introductory remarks. “You levy a price on a thing you don’t want—carbon pollution—and you use the revenue to help with things you do want.” According to Whitehouse, a U.S. carbon fee of forty-five dollars per metric ton in 2016 would reduce American CO2 emissions by more than forty per cent by 2025. It would also generate more than two trillion dollars in revenue over ten years, which, according to the plan, would be returned to the American public as a reduction in the marginal corporate-income-tax rate—totalling six hundred billion dollars over the first decade—among other uses designed expressly to appeal to conservatives.","November 9, 2015","2699","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-cant-republicans-support-a-carbon-tax"
"Because Whitehouse and Schatz’s bill is, in essence, a tax proposal, it falls under the purview of the Senate Finance Committee, chaired by Orrin Hatch, a Republican. It has yet to be given a hearing. Meanwhile, since the third Republican debate, much ink has been spilled over the candidates’ proposals to aggressively cut taxes—Jordan Weissmann, an economics correspondent for Slate, went so far as to call them “delusional”—and slash debt. On both counts, the Whitehouse-Schatz carbon-fee plan could be part of a pragmatic approach (the two trillion dollars of revenue could also, in theory, be used to reduce the national debt by more than ten per cent). Environmental, business, and international groups have long complained that, particularly given Republicans’ concerns about the health of the economy, their lack of any position on climate change is fiscally irresponsible.

"“It’s fascinating to me to look at the partisan evolution of this issue over the past decade,” Joseph Aldy, a professor at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, who previously worked on carbon pricing for the Obama Administration, told me. “In 2003, the leader in the Senate on climate change was John McCain. And, if you fast-forward to 2008, there wasn’t much debate on climate change, because then-Senator McCain and then-Senator Obama had almost identical, ambitious cap-and-trade proposals to tackle the problem.” Ryan Lizza has written in the magazine about what happened next. In short, a confluence of the Great Recession, garden-variety partisanship, and, finally, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill served to kill whatever momentum had built on the issue.","2701","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-cant-republicans-support-a-carbon-tax"
"In 2009, Bob Inglis, then a Republican representative from South Carolina, introduced H.R. 2380, or the “Raise Wages, Cut Carbon Act,” an upstream carbon tax that would have used all revenue to reduce payroll taxes. In the 2010 primary, he was challenged by a Tea Party candidate and defeated. (McCain was also challenged from the right that year, and subsequently backed away from climate policy.) Inglis now heads up RepublicEn, a group that “supports an online community of energy optimists and climate realists” who are working on “free-enterprise solutions to climate change,” including revenue-neutral carbon pricing. “The science is clear, and the economics are even clearer, that a price on carbon dioxide would drive innovation faster than anything else we could envision,” he told me. “It will become very clear to conservatives that this is what we deeply believe once the vocabulary fits with the conservative language.”","2702","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-cant-republicans-support-a-carbon-tax"
"In recent Republican debates, the “I’m not a scientist” talking point—implying that there is a scientific debate about the existence of climate change—has evolved into “One nation, acting alone, can make no difference at all,” as Carly Fiorina put it recently. But as other countries institute carbon-pricing mechanisms, the U.S. risks isolating itself from the rest of the global economy. According to the World Bank, forty countries and twenty-three municipalities and regions that account for twelve per cent of global emissions already price carbon. The E.U., New Zealand, Quebec, Tokyo, and parts of China (which plans to nationalize its carbon-pricing markets, in 2017), along with others, use a cap-and-trade system. British Columbia, Costa Rica, France, Japan, and the U.K., among other countries and regions, charge a fee or tax based on a unit of use, like that in the Whitehouse-Schatz pricing proposal. And a number of high-profile coalitions, including investment banks, oil companies, and heads of state, have formally requested that the international community price carbon. “In the context of international negotiations, there will be more and more pressure on the U.S. not to lead but just to catch up,” Aldy told me.","2703","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-cant-republicans-support-a-carbon-tax"
"In the U.S.—perhaps surprisingly, given G.O.P. resistance even to talking about climate change—California and a coalition of nine Eastern states (under the umbrella of the United States Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative) already run regional cap-and-trade markets. When Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which compels states to reduce their carbon-dioxide emissions, in aggregate, by thirty-two per cent by 2030, takes effect, economists expect some states to institute carbon markets to meet their targets. In other words, a significant percentage of carbon emitted here (as well as in Canada, which exports some of its power to us) is already priced, or will be in the future. But the markets are not harmonized, and the cost of doing business can be difficult to predict. Add to this the regulatory burden of the state-by-state approach to carbon pricing, along with concerns that polluters will simply export their emissions across borders (what economists call “leakage”), and you have a recipe for exactly the kind of regulatory and trade morass that free-market adherents abhor.","2704","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-cant-republicans-support-a-carbon-tax"
"Why hasn’t the G.O.P. proposed its own market-based alternative? “The solutions appear to be anathema,” Inglis told me. “It’s sort of like me telling you, ‘Here’s a plan for the surgery for that back problem you’re having—first, we’re gonna remove your head and work on your ears, spine, and then we’ll put your head back on, and you’ll be all better.’ ‘Thanks, Doc, I don’t think I have a back problem anymore.’ ”","2705","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-cant-republicans-support-a-carbon-tax"
"The depth of Republican resistance was clear from the questions fielded by Senators Whitehouse and Schatz after their American Enterprise Institute presentation. In a prepared response, Benjamin Zycher, a resident scholar at the A.E.I. who works on energy and the environment, questioned the efficacy of any carbon tax or fee on future average temperatures. He poked holes in the historical temperature data, and wondered aloud whether it was “really an accident that the dominant effect of climate policy is an increase in energy costs in red states relative to blue ones.” (“Do not underestimate the power of wealth redistribution as a force driving policymaking in the Beltway,” he has written elsewhere, about the Obama Administration’s approach to climate-change policy.) Back in 2014, Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, told the Times that any Republican Presidential candidate who supported a carbon tax or regulations “would be at a severe disadvantage in the Republican nomination process.” Based on their current positions (or lack thereof), the candidates seem to have received the message. One is left with the feeling that, by the time the Republicans are willing to price carbon, the cost of what we’ve lost will be beyond accounting.","2706","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-cant-republicans-support-a-carbon-tax"
"One recent morning at the Jefferson Hotel, in Washington, D.C., Peter Wehner, a conservative writer who served as an adviser for the past three Republican Presidents, described his party’s problems over a bowl of oatmeal. He said, “We got clobbered in 2012”—the fifth Presidential election out of the past six in which the Republican candidate lost the popular vote. “There’s a demographic problem. White votes are going down two points every year. We’re out of touch with the middle class.” Mitt Romney—whose very hair embodies wealthy privilege—was nominated at a national convention, in Tampa, that became an Ayn Rand-style celebration of business executives, the heroic “makers.” During the campaign, Romney wrote off forty-seven per cent of the country—the “takers”—as government parasites. He went on to lose badly to President Barack Obama, whom Republicans had regarded as an obvious failure, a target as vulnerable as Jimmy Carter. In the shock of that defeat, Wehner said, some conservatives realized that “there was a need for a policy agenda that reaches the middle class.” He added, “This was not a blinding insight.”","2707","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"A generation ago, Democrats lost five of six Presidential elections; in 1992, Bill Clinton, calling himself a New Democrat, ended the streak. Clinton didn’t repudiate the whole Democratic platform—government activism on behalf of ordinary Americans remained the Party’s core idea—but he adopted positions on issues like crime and welfare that were more closely aligned with the views of the majority, including some rank-and-file Democrats. The message, Wehner said, was as much symbolic as substantive: “ ‘We’re not a radical party; we’ve sanded off our rougher edges, and you can trust me.’ ” He went on, “The hope for some of us was that our candidate in 2016 would be the Republican version of Clinton”—a conservative reformer who, having learned from past defeats, championed economic policies that placed Republicans on the side of the hard-pressed, including non-white Americans, the soon-to-be majority.","2708","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"For fresh ideas, such a candidate had only to turn to a group of Republican thinkers who call themselves “reformocons,” of whom Wehner is a leader. Last year, the reformocons published a pamphlet of policy proposals called “Room to Grow,” on health care, education, taxes, entitlements, and other topics. In an introduction, Wehner writes, “Americans do not have a sense that conservatives offer them a better shot at success and security than liberals. For that to change, conservatives in American politics need to understand constituents’ concerns, speak to those aspirations and worries, and help people see how applying conservative principles and deploying conservative policies could help make their lives better.”","2709","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"The essays don’t upend Republican orthodoxy. They argue that government should intervene on behalf of poor and middle-income Americans, but in ways that apply market principles to public policy, taking power away from Washington and giving individuals more options. Some proposals are familiar: school choice, health-care savings accounts. Others are more daring—for example, having college education underwritten by private investors, then repaid over the next decade as a predetermined percentage of graduates’ earnings. A few ideas, such as a wage subsidy that would increase the pay of workers making less than forty thousand dollars a year, building on the Earned Income Tax Credit, could easily garner bipartisan support.","2710","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Room to Grow” contains a striking description of the American economic landscape: children born into poverty with little chance of escaping it, and middle-class families overwhelmed by the rising costs of health care and education while their incomes stay flat. It’s not that different from the story that Elizabeth Warren, the liberal Massachusetts senator, tells. After years of ignoring these stark realities—or of blaming big government, in the spirit of Ronald Reagan—some Republicans have begun to sound more like Abraham Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt.","2711","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"The reformocon project shows how extreme mainstream conservatism has become in its opposition to anything involving the state. The reformocons court right-wing censure simply by acknowledging that the middle class is under pressure, and that government has a role to play beyond cutting taxes. The reckless, and ultimately doomed, shutdown of the federal government by congressional Republicans, in October, 2013, precipitated the first conference of reformocons, in Middleburg, Virginia, and that led to “Room to Grow.”","2712","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

Governor John Kasich, of Ohio, read an essay by Wehner and Michael Gerson, a speechwriter in the Bush White House, titled “A Conservative Vision of Government,” and expressed approval to an aide. Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, sought policy advice from several reformocons, including Yuval Levin, who, as editor of the quarterly National Affairs, is the group’s foremost intellectual. Earlier this year, Rubio published a book, “American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone,” interwoven with the personal stories of struggling Floridians.

"Donald Trump’s campaign first attracted attention, in the press and among Republican voters, when he disparaged Mexican immigrants. Since he entered the race, in June, slurs and feuds have been the mainstay of his media image. Less widely discussed are his positions on working- and middle-class concerns like trade, taxes, and entitlements. In his scattershot, get-out-of-my-way fashion, Trump has vowed to rewrite trade deals involving China, impose tariffs on the products of American companies that send manufacturing overseas, leave Social Security and Medicare alone, and raise taxes on hedge-fund managers. (“I want to save the middle class. The hedge-fund guys didn’t build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.”) To the reformocons’ dismay, Trump has commandeered their target audience and tainted their high-minded proposals.","2715","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Trump’s popularity isn’t based on ideology. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, he draws about evenly from Republicans who consider themselves “moderate to liberal,” “somewhat conservative,” and “very conservative.” More than anything, Trump supporters are defined by class: non-college-educated whites favor him at twice the rate of those with college degrees. Trump is attracting the very blue-collar Americans whom the reformocons were aiming to bind to the Republican Party. So far, at least, these voters, many of them angry and alienated, aren’t listening to the “Room to Grow” crowd. They’re thrilling to madder music.","2716","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Working-class whites remain the most coveted demographic in American politics, even as they shrink as a percentage of the electorate. Ever since Ronald Reagan became President, Democrats have worried about their declining share of this vote. In 2012, Obama captured just thirty-six per cent of white voters without college degrees, down three per cent from 2008—partly owing to the unpopularity of the Affordable Care Act, and skewed by Obama’s abysmal numbers among white Southerners. The emergence of the reformocons shows that more thoughtful Republicans have also grown concerned about the allegiance of the Party’s presumed base.","2717","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Last year, a Gallup poll found that forty-five per cent of Republicans think that the rich should pay more in taxes. Another poll, by the Pew Research Center, showed that more Republicans favor increased spending on Social Security, Medicare, education, and infrastructure than favor cutting those programs. Although government activism is anathema to conservative donors and Grover Norquist, it’s fine with a lot of Republicans making less than fifty thousand dollars a year. April Ponnuru’s husband, Ramesh, a contributor to “Room to Grow” and a senior editor at National Review, said, “Trump shows that Republican voters are not especially dogmatic conservatives—not as much as I’d like them to be.”","2718","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Reihan Salam, the executive editor of National Review, told me, “Trump is not someone I consider an ideal candidate—he does not represent my line of thinking. But he is proving that certain beliefs the professional political class had about who Republican primary voters are—what they respond to, what they care about—were just incorrect.” In 2008, Salam, along with Ross Douthat, the Times columnist, published a manifesto that presaged the reformocon movement: “Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream.” Salam grew up in lower-middle-class, multi-ethnic Brooklyn. At Harvard, where he met Douthat, he became interested in wage subsidies “as a way to enhance the legitimacy of market economies,” he said. “There’s a natural marriage between a belief in a dynamic economy and a belief in solidarity and mutual trust, because the one tempers the other. Most human beings seek stability. A society where you allow this idea of a dynamic economy to pervade every aspect of life is very frightening to people, and certainly you’re not going to be able to build a political coalition around it.”","2719","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

He points to evidence that second-generation Hispanic Americans have less faith in the country’s promise than their parents did—that the vaunted American talent for absorbing people from other places is waning under economic pressure. Salam’s idea of a national community, united by a sense of mutual obligations and a belief in legitimate institutions, evokes the type of conservatism found in Europe. Trump, meanwhile, calls to mind Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi: a strongman, a nationalist, and a nativist, who appeals to voters of limited means by tapping into their gauzy aspirations, echoing their anxieties about decline, and assuring them a secure place in a country restored to greatness.

His sustained popularity shows how contradictory and irrational the Party has become. It’s as if, in 1992, Democrats had thrown their support to Ross Perot, not Bill Clinton, because Perot—while departing from much of the Party’s basic ideology and offering only crude policy simplifications—voiced the submerged feelings of many Democrats whose presence hadn’t registered with national leaders and pundits.","2722","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

The Wall Street Journal has denounced him for supporting protectionist trade policies and higher taxes on the wealthy, especially hedge-fund managers and other beneficiaries of the “carried-interest” loophole, which allows them to pay taxes at lower rates than middle-income Americans.

"“This is like a lunar eclipse,” Wehner told me in August, when many Republicans still believed that Trump would fade by September. “The damage he’s doing—while he’s leading in the polls, that’s the face and voice of the Party, and it’s toxic.” Wehner insisted that Trump is the antithesis of real conservatism: his confidence in his ability to fix America’s problems single-handedly shows no understanding of the restraints embedded in the Constitution and the separation of powers. “In no traditional sense could you call him a conservative,” Wehner said. “Conservatism in the spirit of Madison is the idea of taking popular passions and channelling them in a constructive way. Trump is doing the opposite—he’s taking popular passions and stoking them, by demonizing the Other.” Since then, Trump’s front-runner status has been challenged by another outsider, Ben Carson, who presents even more extreme ideas, but with a whisper instead of a shout. In late September, Wehner posted an essay on the Commentary Web site called “The G.O.P. Is Killing Itself.”","2725","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Conservatism in the spirit of Madison” has almost ceased to exist. The outlook of the Republican grass roots, and of many Party leaders, is what Richard Hofstadter, writing toward the end of the McCarthy era, called “pseudo-conservative,” because “its exponents, although they believe themselves to be conservatives and usually employ the rhetoric of conservatism, show signs of a serious and restless dissatisfaction with American life, traditions, and institutions.” Republicans today have given the country conservatism in the spirit of Sarah Palin, whose ignorance about the world, contempt for expertise, and raw appeals to white identity politics presaged Trump’s incendiary campaign. So did the spectacle, in 2009, of a Republican congressman calling the President a liar during a speech Obama gave to a joint session of Congress, and Party leaders comparing Obamacare to Nazism and slavery. Earlier this year, forty-seven Republican senators wrote the Supreme Leader of Iran and declared that the President didn’t speak for the country. There have been regular threats to close the federal government in order to accomplish limited political goals. (In September, another shutdown, over the defunding of Planned Parenthood, was narrowly avoided, despite the support of nearly all the Republican Presidential candidates.) On right-wing radio, Obama is constantly accused of tyranny and treason. Once the restraints are lifted, they’re hard to restore.

"In mid-September, I travelled to a small town in southeastern New Hampshire called Raymond, where John Kasich was holding a town-hall meeting in a middle-school auditorium. Eighty chairs were arranged around a stool. One of the early arrivals was a twenty-six-year-old named Mark Lynch, who had come with his grandmother. Lynch, the son of a firefighter and a factory worker, had a crewcut and stubble, and wore a Red Sox T-shirt that exposed the tattoos on his biceps. He had just finished four years of service in the Navy and was training to be a policeman. Lynch wanted to hear what Kasich had to say, but he was more interested in the billionaire with the copper comb-over.","2727","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Trump is tapping into this belief that politicians are self-serving,” Lynch told me. “He’s telling these donors, ‘I don’t need your money, I’ll finance my own campaign.’ If you look at what’s controlling government these days, it’s lobbyists and all these big corporations.” Lynch liked Trump’s positions on trade, taxes, and Wall Street. “People don’t want to see billionaires getting richer,” he said. “If Donald Trump, a billionaire in his own right, is saying billionaires in Washington and New York should be paying more—that says something.”","2728","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Lynch sounded a bit like a Sanders guy. When I pointed this out, his grandmother made a face. Lynch said that he couldn’t possibly vote for Sanders—“a self-proclaimed socialist from Vermont.” Lynch was a conservative, not so much on specific policies but in his values and in his ideas about America’s character. He didn’t want an overweening government creating costly programs and interfering in people’s lives. He just wanted a system that wasn’t rigged in favor of the rich and well-connected.","2729","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In Lynch’s eyes, his antipathy toward this privileged class didn’t make him an unwitting Democrat. “I don’t think Republicans are the party of big corporations and billionaires,” he said. “They’re for ordinary middle-class people.” The problem wasn’t conservatism but the dirty role of money in politics. Change would have to come at the hands of someone who wasn’t beholden to the system—a rich outsider like Trump.","2730","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich entered the room, dressed casually, all in black. At sixty-three, he’s lean and combative, with a slump in his posture and a jutting neck. He served nine terms in Congress, and, as chairman of the House Budget Committee, in the nineties, he was a key lieutenant of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and a crusader for balanced budgets. As he never fails to tell audiences, he helped craft the 1997 deal that brought surpluses to the federal government for the first time in three decades, though most of the credit belonged to a booming economy. Elected governor of Ohio in 2010, and reëlected overwhelmingly last year, Kasich turned the state’s deficits into surpluses, while cutting taxes.

"“I’m running for President ’cause I know how to land the plane,” he said, without mentioning the name of the candidate who could well crash it. “I understand that people are frustrated. My dad carried mail on his back. My mother was a blue-collar housewife. I understand anxieties about losing jobs and ringing up college debt. I know all this. But we can beat these things.” The way to beat them was to cut the deficit and say no to special interests in Washington. He offered no policy proposals to help the middle class, besides balancing the federal budget and deregulating business.","2732","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich added a dose of spiritual uplift to this starchy message. “We need to live a life bigger than ourselves,” he said. “Life is not just about me, me, me, me, me. Do you agree with that? It’s about living a life that’s bigger than yourself. . . . I am the most flawed in this room, but at least I know I give grace and every day I can start over and try to do something positive.” There’s a strain of George W. Bush’s compassionate conservatism in Kasich. (During a run for the Presidency in 2000, Kasich admitted to wishing that he’d thought up the term.) He often mentions the working poor in the same breath as the addicted and the mentally ill, as if all three groups needed charitable help. He has supported the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio, to the abhorrence of many conservatives; he likes to say that he’ll have this accomplishment in hand when St. Peter asks him what he did for the poor. “Be a center of justice and healing,” Kasich told the audience in Raymond.","2733","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

The best alternative, he felt, was Rubio. When I pointed out that Rubio was a Washington insider, Lynch sighed. “That’s the pickle I’m in, and a lot of people are in,” he said. “No matter who gets elected, it’s just going to be more of the same.

"Over the past few years, the key phrase for Democrats has been “income inequality.” The relentlessly widening gap between wealthy Americans and the rest—accelerated by the Great Recession and the not-so-great recovery—is at the heart of Sanders’s campaign, animates many of Hillary Clinton’s policies, and would make Warren an instant contender were she to enter the race. But “inequality” is a word that Republicans don’t like to use. Romney, during his Presidential campaign, characterized “inequality” as a code word: “I think it’s about envy. I think it’s about class warfare.”","2742","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In 2012, Wehner co-authored an essay in National Affairs, titled “How to Think About Inequality.” He concludes:","2743","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In other words, the way to think about inequality is by looking down, not up. It’s not the wealth amassed at the top but, rather, the lack of “skills, values, and habits” at the bottom that accounts for the widening income gap. Oddly, Wehner’s essay barely mentions the economic struggles of the middle class. A close look at the three middle quintiles of income, where Americans with an education, a job, and a spouse can be found treading water or sinking, would have forced him to reconsider the notion that a lack of “social capital”—as opposed to just capital—explains the entire problem.","2744","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Even though the reformocons recognize the difficulties of the middle class, they prefer to focus not on income disparities but on “mobility,” which describes how individuals fare across their own life span and in comparison with past generations. Levin told me that the word “growth”—the unconvincing mantra of supply-siders—was losing its hold on conservatives. When Jeb Bush predicted that his economic policies would lead to four-per-cent economic growth, a level not seen since the late nineties, the claim was either ignored or derided. “ ‘Mobility’ is much healthier,” Levin said. “It’s the right lens to talk about the economy.”","2745","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"But there’s a reason to look up as well as down the economic ladder, and it has nothing to do with envy or with punishing the rich. Economic stratification, and the rise of a super-wealthy class, threatens our democracy. Americans are growing increasingly separated from one another along lines of class, in every aspect of life: where they’re born and grow up, where they go to school, what they eat, how they travel, whom they marry, what their children do, how long they live, how they die. What kind of “national community” built on “mutual obligation” is possible when Americans have so little shared experience? The Princeton economist Alan Krueger has demonstrated that societies with higher levels of income inequality are societies with lower levels of social mobility. As America has grown less economically equal, a citizen’s ability to move upward has fallen behind that of citizens in other Western democracies. We are no longer the country where anyone can become anything.","2746","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Inequality saps the economy by draining the buying power of Americans whose incomes have stagnated, forcing them to rely on debt to fund education, housing, and health care. At the top, it creates deep pools of wealth that have nowhere productive to go, leading to asset bubbles in capital markets bearing little or no relation to the health of the over-all economy. (Critics call this the “financialization” of the economy.) These fallouts from inequality were among the causes of the Great Recession.","2747","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Inequality is also warping America’s political system. Greatly concentrated wealth leads to outsized political power in the hands of the few—even in a democracy with free and fair elections—which pushes government to create rules that favor the rich. It’s no accident that we’re in the era of Citizens United. Such rulings give ordinary Americans the strong suspicion that the game is rigged. Democratic institutions no longer feel legitimate when they continue to produce blatantly unfair outcomes; it’s one of those insights that only an élite could miss. And it’s backed up by evidence as well as by common sense. Last year, two political scientists found that, in recent times, policy ideas have rarely been adopted by the U.S. government unless they’re favored by corporations and the wealthy—even when those ideas are supported by most Americans. The persistence of the highly unpopular carried-interest loophole for hedge-fund managers is simply the most unseemly example.","2748","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"Thus far in the campaign, the ideas of the reformocons have scarcely made an appearance among the Republican candidates. In Washington in June, Rubio—the favorite of the reformers—gave a speech to a group of them summarizing the arguments of his book. And he became the first Republican candidate to support paid family leave when, in September, he proposed a tax credit for businesses that offer their employees between four and twelve weeks off to care for newborns or sick family members. (Critics say that the tax credit wouldn’t offset enough of the costs in wages to induce companies to permit such leaves.) For the most part, though, Rubio has left the proposals in “American Dreams” on the shelf. “Rubio has the most interesting platform, but he’s not using it,” Ramesh Ponnuru said. Rubio, the son of a bartender and a maid who both emigrated from Cuba, “has established himself as the articulate, different Republican in a biographical sense,” Ponnuru added. “He’s not working to establish himself as a problem-solver. His campaign guys must be saying, ‘You have a good story, and voters aren’t interested in policy ideas.’ ”","2750","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In April, Rubio announced a tax proposal that hardly diverges from the Republican Party line. It offers families a twenty-five-hundred-dollar tax credit per child. But the proposal also reduces income taxes beyond the levels of George W. Bush’s cuts, making them even more regressive; cuts corporate taxes by ten per cent; and eliminates taxes on most investment income and inheritance. It gives a huge windfall to the rich, amounting to trillions of dollars in tax revenue. At the same time, Rubio promises to increase defense spending and pass a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Ponnuru offered an explanation for Rubio’s lapse into conventional conservative thinking: “The problem with the campaign-finance system is that it forces the candidates to spend too much time with rich people.”","2751","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Even though Rubio’s tax plan included the usual deep cuts for the wealthy, it was unacceptable to the Wall Street Journal, which criticized the child tax credit as a giveaway. Stephen Moore, the former president of the Club for Growth, explained his opposition to the columnist Albert R. Hunt: “The more you increase things like the child tax credit, the more you will move back to the 1960s and 70s tax system with higher tax rates.”","2752","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Jeb Bush, another hope of the reformocons, issued his tax plan in September. He framed it as an attempt to support social mobility and the “right to rise”—the name of his Super PAC, which, in the first half of the year, raised more than a hundred million dollars. Such rhetoric fooled some political reporters into characterizing the plan as “populist.” Though it does eliminate the carried-interest loophole, it offers the rich more than ample compensation, in the form of a large cut in income and capital-gains taxes. According to the Times, people making ten million dollars or more a year would see their effective tax rates reduced from twenty-six to twenty-one per cent, saving them an average of a million and a half dollars a year. Bush’s plan would drain up to $3.4 trillion dollars from the Treasury.","2753","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In the end, the reformocon candidates haven’t sounded that much different from Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, and Rand Paul. All of them have had more to say about defunding Planned Parenthood, shutting down the federal government, repealing Obamacare, balancing the budget, and building a wall along the border with Mexico than about the problems of the middle class.

"At a press conference at Trump Tower on September 28th, Trump unveiled his own tax plan. “Too few Americans are working, too many jobs are being shipped overseas, and too many middle-income families cannot make ends meet,” he proclaimed. “This plan directly meets these challenges, and the challenges also of business.” What followed was a tax cut for just about everybody. Seventy-five million Americans—single people making less than twenty-five thousand dollars a year and married couples making less than fifty—would be dropped from the tax rolls altogether. But the biggest winners would be the rich: Trump would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four, and would cut the rates of the top earners by fourteen per cent, below the level proposed by Bush. Even Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform blessed Trump’s plan.

The Presidential campaign felt far away—Ohio’s primary isn’t until next March—but the state remains key to the general election. “Part of it is that Trump’s an emblem of success, and the other part of it is he taps people’s anger,” Green said. “It’s not the same anger as a few years ago, when it was ‘Where are the jobs?’ Now it’s ‘Where’s our share of the American dream?’ ” Green, who does polling research on Ohio and American politics, went on, “A lot of white working-class votes are up for grabs in this election. In recent years, they’ve gone Republican, but this year the Democrats could get a slice of them.” The Republican coalition of business interests and the white working class, he said, “is under more stress this year than it’s been for a while.”","2756","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

Canton is one of those American towns where industrial decline and population loss give a sense of uninhabited space. The Hoover vacuum company, once headquartered in North Canton, was acquired in 2007 by a Hong Kong firm that moved production to Mexico and China. An abandoned brick factory is being redeveloped for white-collar service companies and apartments.

"After a winter of continuous below-zero temperatures, many of Canton’s streets crumbled, and nearly a year later they remain impassable. The Democratic mayor, William Healy, laid the blame for the city’s infrastructure woes on climate change and John Kasich. In balancing Ohio’s budget, the Governor dramatically reduced state contributions to local governments while cutting certain business taxes and eliminating the estate tax. The result, Healy said, was a loss of seventeen million dollars to Canton—twenty per cent of its revenue—bringing spending below the level of 2007. The Mayor had to choose between keeping policemen and firemen employed or repairing broken streets. “That tells you the impact of John Kasich,” he said. “But on the national front, where you’ve got Trump, Kasich comes across as a moderate! Damaging as Kasich has been to my city, as mayor, if I had to vote for a Republican for President I would vote for Kasich over the entire field. That tells you where the Republican Party has gone.”","2758","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Around Ohio, local governments are being forced to choose between raising taxes and neglecting services, even though the state now has a two-billion-dollar “rainy-day fund.” In his stump speech in New Hampshire, Kasich claimed that his fiscal policies helped create three hundred thousand jobs. In fact, Ohio remains below its pre-recession employment rate, meaning that the state has lagged behind most of the country during the recovery. Zach Schiller, the head of research at the nonpartisan group Policy Matters Ohio, in Cleveland, told me, “Kasich’s claims to good economic performance? I don’t know if I want to say ‘deceptive,’ but they’re certainly misleading.”","2759","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"According to Policy Matters Ohio, since 2013 Kasich’s policies, including a higher sales tax and cigarette tax, have raised average annual taxes on the state’s poorest fifth by seventeen dollars, given middle-income people a ninety-four-dollar cut, and returned seventeen thousand dollars to members of the one per cent. “We’ve engineered a tax shift to lower- and middle-income Ohioans,” Schiller said. “And we’ve reduced over-all tax revenue.”","2760","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich’s tax policies have earned him the approval of Arthur Laffer, a native of nearby Youngstown, whose famous curve—supposedly demonstrating that lower income taxes generate higher revenue by stimulating economic growth—started the revolution in supply-side economics, forty years ago. Schiller pointed out that nothing in Ohio’s recent economic experience supports supply-side theory. The same is true nationally: growth has accelerated in periods when tax rates have been higher on top earners and stalled when rates came down. Kasich, who has positioned himself as the capable, reasonable, experienced “grownup” on the G.O.P. stage, is a supply-sider at his core. As long as Republicans cling to the warped logic of trickle-down economics, their efforts to help middle-class Americans will be largely rhetorical.","2761","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"East of Canton, there’s a small steel mill owned by a Pittsburgh company called Allegheny Technologies, Inc. On a strip of grass outside the mill, around a dozen locked-out steelworkers were picketing under a white tent, with American flags, water bottles, and defiant signs: “Unfairly Locked Out for 32 Days”; “Greed, Power & Control Rule A.T.I.—Lockout Proves It!” The Canton area has a history of racial prejudice, but the picket line was one place where it was possible to find black and white men hanging out together.","2762","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"A.T.I. had been requiring some of the hundred and thirty workers at the mill to put in twelve-hour shifts or seven-day work weeks. Families were showing the strain. In June, A.T.I. offered the union representing the employees, the United Steelworkers, a new contract, asking for a hundred and forty-five concessions. The company claimed that it was under pressure from foreign and nonunion U.S. competitors. However, executive pay had risen more than fifty per cent during 2014, and the total compensation of the chief executive, Richard J. Harshman, had risen seventy per cent, to nearly eight million dollars, in spite of the company’s poor performance. (Nearly half of A.T.I.’s shareholders had voted against the compensation packages.)","2763","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"In August, A.T.I. made its final offer. Before the United Steelworkers could bring it to a vote, plant managers escorted employees from the mill and brought in replacement workers. The lockout began. Union workers were girding themselves for a long battle. “It ain’t nothing but corporate greed,” Rick Jones, who has worked at the mill for twenty-two years, said.","2765","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"The subject of Presidential politics came up. Reynolds said, “Right now, the only one I’m seeing is Bernie Sanders. He has a history of supporting unions.” He noted that Kasich had tried to take away collective-bargaining rights from public-sector workers; the idea had been soundly defeated in a statewide referendum. A worker named Mike Yeater said that he liked Trump’s positions on “immigration stuff and issues like that—he’s got patriotic beliefs.” But after Trump told the Detroit News that union autoworkers needed to accept lower wages Yeater stopped paying attention to him. Another worker said that he’d been reading Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-first Century,” and that he liked Sanders but was also interested in Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard professor who is running for President on a platform of radical campaign-finance reform. No one mentioned Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush.","2766","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"A steelworker named Jack Baum was sitting in a folding beach chair on Main Street, his eyes shielded from the sun by a wide-brimmed camouflage hat, his dark hair tied back in a ponytail by a red-white-and-blue bandanna. He had a thick neck and a bushy mustache, and he held a sign that said “Fighting for Good Jobs in Our Community.” Every now and then a passing car honked, and Baum waved.","2767","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Baum calls himself an independent libertarian. “I believe in the company’s right to make money,” he said. “It helps all of us. And I also believe in the worker’s right to bargain for a fair wage.” In 2004, as president of the local, Baum led difficult negotiations; managers and workers eventually came to terms by making concessions—they needed one another to keep the steel industry alive. “This time is different,” he said. “They brought new people in to break the union. They do not respect us. They look at us as a number.”","2768","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Baum believes that “The Jungle,” Upton Sinclair’s classic novel about the Chicago stockyards, should be required reading for American corporations. “At the turn of the century, the boss would go home and sleep with your wife in order for you to keep your job,” he said. Unions, he explained, were “a necessary evil. We need them, ’cause without them—I don’t know if you’d see a return to the turn of the century, where children are working, but corporations still have that deep-rooted sense of ‘I’ll just work you. Family doesn’t matter, outside life doesn’t matter.’ ”","2769","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Baum is fifty-five, with a grown daughter who’s a nurse at Cleveland Clinic. His marriage fell apart under the strain of long shifts, and he lives alone, in a trailer. He has voted Republican all his life, except for two times, when he voted for Ross Perot. This year, Baum was supporting Trump. He didn’t agree with everything Trump said, but he liked his position on trade and his tax plan—the way that it cut working-class people’s taxes to zero but also gave businesses a financial break, “because it’s killing our industries’ competitiveness.” He thought that Trump was strong enough to bring jobs back to America, and he appreciated his willingness to tell both parties, “You can’t buy me.” Baum found Trump’s insulting manner refreshing, calling it “a mirror of the way they treat us.”","2770","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Baum wanted to see a forty-year mandatory minimum sentence for anyone who took money from lobbyists. “The rich élitists are not just Republicans,” he said. “They’re Democrats, too.” He continued, “Our Founding Fathers told us we should be able to go from modest means to riches with our own efforts. This is a country of capitalists—everybody should be rich. The problem is, the rich don’t want anybody rubbing shoulders with them. The middle class hits that wall and can’t get over it.

"In an essay in “Room to Grow,” Yuval Levin describes what makes conservatives different from liberals. Conservatives don’t emphasize the individual and the state; they focus on the space between—where families, communities, religious groups, associations, and private enterprises create a web of interrelationships. “What happens in that space generally happens face to face—between parents and children, neighbors and friends, buyers and sellers,” he writes. “It therefore answers to immediately felt needs, and is tailored to the characters, sentiments, priorities, and preferences of the people involved. This kind of bottom-up common life, rather than massive, distant systems of material provision, is what makes society tick.”","2772","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Levin’s description of American life sounds appealing, but it does not reflect the reality of the steelworkers’ lives. The “massive, distant system of material provision” is their company, which is far more top-down than any federal bureaucracy. Nothing happens face to face; immediately felt needs go ignored; families don’t matter. There is no “common life” except for the workers’ desperate effort to stick together as they look ahead to weeks or months without pay—or, perhaps, a future without a job. Global competition is making these workers disposable, and so they are turning for insight and inspiration to Sanders, or Piketty, or Trump. The reformocons, for all their creativity and eloquence, don’t grasp the nature of the world in which their cherished middle-class Americans actually live. They can’t face its heartlessness. ♦","2773","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Some years ago, well before Paul Ryan ran for Vice-President alongside Mitt Romney, I asked Grover Norquist, the veteran anti-tax campaigner and conservative organizer, what role the Wisconsin congressman played in the Republican Party. “Paul Ryan is the prophet,” Norquist replied, not missing a beat. “He points the way to the Promised Land.”","October 9, 2015","2774","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-paul-ryan-save-the-republican-party"
"Now the prophet has been called down from the mountain to deal with a more prosaic matter: the inability of his colleagues in the House of Representatives to agree on a leader who can unite its warring factions and speak the Queen’s English, or at least speak a reasonable approximation thereof. Kevin McCarthy, the House Majority Leader, who until Thursday had been expected to replace the departing Speaker, John Boehner, may have met the first of these standards, but when presented with a microphone he had an alarming tendency to mangle his words. Rather than providing more fodder for Stephen Colbert and Rachel Maddow, who this week have been feasting on him like hungry dogs gnawing at a T-bone steak, McCarthy did the wise thing and dropped out.","2775","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-paul-ryan-save-the-republican-party"
"By Thursday night, Republicans were practically begging Ryan, who had repeatedly said that he wasn’t interested in taking Boehner’s job, to reconsider. Evidently, he is reconsidering. On Friday morning, the Washington Post’s Robert Costa reported that Ryan’s colleagues are saying he will go home to Wisconsin this weekend and think things over.","2776","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-paul-ryan-save-the-republican-party"
"Somewhere in his mind, surely, will be the old adage that no good deed goes unpunished. If he takes over as Speaker, rather than thinking big thoughts about taxation and Milton Friedman, he will have to deal, on a daily basis, with the likes of Jim Jordan, the Ohio congressman who leads the House’s Freedom Caucus, the party within a party that gave Boehner fits; Louie Gohmert, the Texas congressman who warned earlier this year about a possible military takeover of the Lone Star State; and Jody Hice, the Georgian pastor (and representative) who has described legal abortion as worse than the Holocaust.","2777","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-paul-ryan-save-the-republican-party"
"In the days of Sam Rayburn, and even as recently as Tip O’Neill’s time, things were very different. The Speaker of the House was one of the most powerful and feared men in Washington. Ambitious young members of Congress crossed the leadership at their peril. But with the rise of populist movements outside of Washington, the development of online media, and the gutting of campaign-finance laws, party leaders—particularly Republican Party leaders—have seen their leverage greatly reduced. In needing to corral representatives at the ideological extremes, such as the thirty-odd members of the Freedom Caucus, which was founded at the start of this year, they often seem virtually powerless.","2778","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-paul-ryan-save-the-republican-party"
"Rather than seeking out a prestigious committee assignment or hoping that Party grandees will direct some campaign funds toward their district, today’s G.O.P. members of Congress are often more interested in appearing on conservative shows, building up a social-media following, appealing to wealthy donors on an individual basis, and placating angry hordes back home. Unlike in European parliamentary parties, American congressional delegations have seldom, if ever, acted as unified and disciplined fighting forces. Usually, though, they did hang together. Now Capitol Hill often seems like a free for all.

"What could a Speaker Ryan do about this?","2780","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-paul-ryan-save-the-republican-party"
"In the big picture, not very much. The forces that have brought the Republicans to this juncture are bigger than any individual. But if anyone can cobble together enough support to get the Party through the next fourteen months without further ruptures, it may well be Ryan. As a personable and articulate former candidate for Vice-President, he has star power. As a longtime purveyor of ambitious (if wholly unrealistic) efforts to eliminate the deficit and downsize the federal government, he has conservative credentials to placate the right. And as a prophet, rather than a party manager and disciplinarian, he hasn’t made very many enemies.","2781","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-paul-ryan-save-the-republican-party"
"He also has another potential advantage. If the Republican Party were even barely functional, the actual demands on the next Speaker wouldn’t be onerous. With a general election in the offing, nobody expects Congress to do much legislating and reforming in the coming fourteen months. The Speaker’s primary task will be to keep the government operating. If the Republican ultras were to force another federal shutdown, they could do immense damage to the G.O.P. and its 2016 Presidential candidate.","2782","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-paul-ryan-save-the-republican-party"
"Preventing such an outcome means striking a deal with the White House to extend the government’s funding authority, which expires on December 11th, and to raise the debt limit. Ryan, who chaired the House Budget Committee for four years, certainly knows his way around the issues. Two years ago, he and Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, put together a bipartisan bill that relaxed some of the spending limits that had been imposed in the 2011 sequester, thereby avoiding a government shutdown.","2783","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-paul-ryan-save-the-republican-party"
"As Ryan travels back to Janesville, Wisconsin, where he lives with his wife and three children, he won’t have forgotten that some conservatives who are now members of the Freedom Caucus opposed the 2013 agreement, describing it as a sellout that didn’t include big enough spending cuts. Ryan will also be aware that some conservative activists are opposed to the idea of him becoming Speaker, accusing him of that most grievous of crimes: being a Washington insider. “Paul Ryan has voted for every bailout, TARP, No Child Left Behind, etc.,” Erick Erickson, the columnist and radio host, wrote on Friday. “He is a team player and conservatives in Washington cannot afford to be on Team DC-GOP when the American people are mad as hell at Washington.”","2784","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-paul-ryan-save-the-republican-party"

Thus, on the eve of last night’s debate, Ted Cruz, channelling Herman Cain from four years ago, unveiled a plan for a flat tax of ten per cent on personal income. Perhaps recognizing the fact that there is a limit to what anybody, even a diehard Tea Party supporter, will believe, Cruz didn’t claim that this proposal would balance the budget. Instead, he cited a study from the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based research organization, and claimed that it would cost less than a trillion dollars.","2809","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"The second problem the Republicans have—and this will become even more acute as the election approaches—is that, by many measures, the U.S. economy is doing pretty well. In the past five years, the unemployment rate has been cut in half, and about twelve million new jobs have been created. G.D.P. has been growing at a steady, if unspectacular, rate for more than six years.

"The big drawback with the Obama recovery is that it has been very lopsided, with the folks at the top receiving most of the gains, and those in the middle and at the bottom seeing little or no income growth. During the debate, some Republicans seized on this. Jeb Bush claimed that the incomes of middle-class families have fallen by twenty-three hundred dollars since President Obama took office. Cruz said that the share of income going to the top one per cent has never been higher.","2811","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Such data make good talking points for the G.O.P. candidates, but they also raise an awkward problem for the Party and its 2016 nominee-to-be. Tackling rising inequality isn’t exactly a Republican strength. Almost all of the candidates’ tax plans are extremely regressive: they would benefit the well-off more than everybody else. That’s partly because all of the plans would cut the top income-tax rate, which is currently 39.6 per cent. And it’s partly because most of the proposals would also sharply reduce the tax rates on dividends and capital gains, the forms of payment in which the super-rich receive most of their income.","2812","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Take Cruz’s tax plan, which might be the most regressive and irresponsible one yet.

(I’m citing the “static” estimates, which don’t incorporate an overly rosy growth scenario for tax revenues. But the “dynamic” figures also show a big difference in how the ultra-wealthy would make out relative to everybody else.)","2813","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"These aren’t the sorts of figures that any candidate, except perhaps one running for the Presidency of his local Rotary Club, wants to advertise. And it also turns out that Cruz’s claim about his plan costing less than a trillion dollars was highly suspect. According to the Tax Foundation, the actual figure is $3.6 trillion. It was only by invoking some very optimistic assumptions about G.D.P. growth that the Foundation’s analysts got the number below a trillion dollars.","2814","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Relative to the other candidates’ plans, Cruz’s proposal is at the edge of the curve, but in its basic features it’s not atypical. Given the way these plans work, about the only way to have them avoid looking like reverse-Robin Hood schemes is to exempt some of the households at the bottom of the income distribution from any federal income tax. That’s what Marco Rubio’s plan would do, for example, and another analysis from the Tax Foundation suggests that he was right when he claimed, in response to a challenge from CNBC’s John Harwood, that the biggest gains (in percentage terms) under his proposal would go to the poor. But the exemptions in his plan wouldn’t apply to payroll taxes paid by poor families, and they wouldn’t apply to any of the taxes paid by middle-income households. So Harwood, who had said that very rich households would make out a lot better than average households under Rubio’s plan, was also right.","2815","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"That assessment is also true of Bush’s plan, and of Trump’s plan, and of Carson’s plan, and of Huckabee’s plan, and of Paul’s plan. Indeed, when you delve into the details of the Republicans’ economic proposals, it’s easy to see why most of them would rather not get into the details. G.O.P. primary voters tend to be tax averse. But most of them are also averse to tilting things even more in the direction of the donor class.","2816","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Before ending, I should note that one or two of the Republican candidates have put out more credible proposals. In what they describe as efforts to shore up Social Security, for example, Bush and Chris Christie have suggested raising the retirement age and cutting the benefits that rich retirees receive. Since benefit cuts are hugely unpopular, about the only people who have cheered these proposals are budget hawks at Washington think tanks.","2817","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"At this stage, anyway, neither Bush nor Christie appears to have much chance of getting the nomination. And that’s another illustration of the underlying incentive problem. In a Republican primary, making tough policy choices and trying to be substantive doesn’t necessarily pay off. Small wonder that the debates tend to be food fights, instead.","2818","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Three years ago, after the reëlection of Barack Obama, a rueful Republican National Committee launched an inquiry into where the Party had gone wrong. Researchers for the Growth & Opportunity Project contacted more than twenty-six hundred people—voters, officeholders, Party operatives—conducted focus groups, and took polls around the country. The resulting report is a bracingly forthright piece of self-criticism that took the G.O.P. to task for turning off young voters, minorities, and women. A key finding was that candidates needed to curb the harsh talk about immigration. Mitt Romney’s call for “self-deportation” was loser rhetoric. Making people feel that “a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States” was poor politics. The report offered one specific policy recommendation: “We must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party’s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies.”","2819","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"
"None of the current Republican Presidential hopefuls seem to have taken that counsel to heart. Donald Trump, the front-runner, wouldn’t, of course. “The Hispanics love me,” he claims, despite the fact that he proposes building a wall on the Mexican border to keep out people he equates with “criminals, drug dealers, rapists.” Ben Carson takes issue with Trump’s stance, sort of. “It sounds really cool, you know, ‘Let’s just round them all up and send them back,’ ” he said. But it would cost too much, so he advocates deploying armed drones at the border.","2820","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"
"Some Republicans are hoping that Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who rose to third and fourth place following last month’s debate in Boulder—or even Jeb Bush, in fifth—can help this situation. Rubio’s parents were born in Cuba, as was Cruz’s father. But Cruz, a Tea Party conservative and a Southern Baptist, isn’t exactly an avatar of Latino cultural identity. When he does embrace that identity, it tends to be awkward, as when he told a meeting of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce last spring, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Hispanic panhandler. And the reason is in our community it would be shameful to be begging on the street.” Rubio is at ease invoking the experience of his immigrant parents—his father was a bartender, his mother a maid—and sometimes gives interviews in Spanish, though he has had to defend the practice against attacks from Trump. Bush has a bicultural family. But all three have moved to the unwelcoming right on immigration.","2821","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"
"In 2013, Rubio sponsored a bipartisan bill to create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living here, but he renounced it and now says that we “can’t even have a conversation” about the fate of the undocumented until the borders are secured. Cruz has endorsed eliminating automatic birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to undocumented parents. Bush is still willing to grant citizenship to some undocumented immigrants, if they meet a long list of conditions. But this summer he released a six-point plan that stresses the need for a military-style fortification of the border.","2822","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"
"All three also differ with majorities of Latino voters on other issues. Most Latino voters support stricter gun control and a higher minimum wage, and most say that climate change matters to them personally and that the federal government needs to act on it. Moreover, any assumption that Latino voters—a very diverse group—can be relied upon to choose Latino candidates regardless of their positions is not supported by evidence. In Texas in 2012, when Cruz ran for the Senate, about sixty per cent of the Latino vote went to his opponent, a white Democrat.","2823","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"
"In the primary season candidates often say things that make trouble for their party in the general election. We’re likely to see an extreme version of that phenomenon this time, above all in battleground states like Colorado, Nevada, and North Carolina, where the winner will need to carry the minority vote. Trump’s anti-immigrant sloganeering and his rivals’ scramble to keep up with it won’t be easy to forget. In 2012, Romney got just twenty-three per cent of the Latino vote. In 2016, the Republican candidate will need to get twice that, according to a recent analysis made by the political scientists David Damore and Matt Barreto. That’s because the Latino share of the electorate has been growing. By 2050, the Latino population in the U.S. is projected to be twenty-nine per cent, up from seventeen per cent today. Republican candidates have often told themselves they have more of a chance of winning Hispanic voters than black voters, finding common ground on social issues. “Republicans often seem to think if they could just get beyond immigration issues there’d be all kinds of opportunities for them with Latino voters,” John Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron, says. “That’s a little like saying if we could just get beyond civil rights we’d be good with black voters.”","2824","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"
"Last month, at a candidates’ forum in Plano, Texas, the conservative activist Ralph Reed proposed a strategy that ignores the issue altogether: Republicans should just focus on the evangelical vote, which, he claimed, is “larger than the African-American vote, the Latino vote, the feminist vote, the gay vote, and the union vote combined.” He was resurrecting a popular G.O.P. theory that President Obama was reëlected only because millions of conservative, and especially evangelical, voters went “missing” in 2012. All the 2016 Republican nominee has to do is get those voters to return to the polls. Green finds the “missing” theory unlikely—evangelicals tend to be motivated, reliable voters—and Karl Rove himself dismissed it in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece titled “The Myth of the Stay-at-Home Republicans.” But the strategy seems particularly problematic in its willingness to dismiss whole segments of the population—precisely what the 2012 postmortem advised against.","2825","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"
"Before the start of last month’s debate, representatives from conservative Latino groups gathered in Boulder to issue some warnings about what would happen if the Party didn’t distance itself from extreme immigration politics. Their message was of a piece with the 2012 report, but even more blunt. Rosario Marin, who served as the U.S. Treasurer under President George W. Bush, said, “Don’t expect us to come to your side during the general election. You are not with us now, we will not be with you then. You don’t have our vote now, you won’t have it then. You insult us now, we will be deaf to you then.” In the meantime—and no doubt especially at next month’s debate in Nevada, a state that is nearly thirty per cent Latino—they will be listening carefully. ♦","2826","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"

They get in bed with big government.” The differences between Rubio and Cruz are mostly tactical and temperamental: Rubio, careful and a bit callow, is trying to split the difference between the angry base and the party establishment.

"In August, Norm Ornstein, a longtime and well-regarded political observer, made the most comprehensive argument that Trump could prevail. Ornstein pointed to several factors: a conservative media that has fostered a deeper anti-establishment sentiment among G.O.P. voters, who are less likely to get news from outside an ideological bubble; a more extreme G.O.P. electorate, especially on the issue of immigration; the absence of a consensus establishment alternative to Trump; the emergence of Super PACs, which might encourage the traditional candidates to stay in the race longer and divide up the non-Trump vote; and the fact that Trump is “a far more savvy candidate” than Cain and the like.","2859","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"

Then Jake Tapper, the moderator, asked Ben Carson about vaccines—or, more specifically, what he, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, thought of Donald Trump’s statements linking childhood vaccines to autism, “which, as you know, the medical community adamantly disputes.” Perhaps Tapper thought that he was setting up a confrontation between rationality and Trumpism, a moment when the doctor would calmly dismantle the Donald. If so, he was disappointed. Carson, after allowing that studies “have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism,” and that some inoculations saved lives, added that “a multitude” of them probably weren’t important—“and there should be some discretion in those cases.

"Trump proceeded to demonstrate his decision-making qualities with a digressive rant about how he knew “a beautiful child” who “went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.” He’d had his own regimen for his children, he said, spreading things out; if people followed his advice, “I think you’re going to see a big impact on autism.”","2871","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"You’re not: the science is very clear that vaccines do not cause autism, and that all the deniers have accomplished is to provoke outbreaks of diseases, like measles, that were once almost forgotten in America. (My colleague Michael Specter has written about this extensively.) A lot of what Trump says—diplomacy by yelling, for example—would be dangerous if put into practice. But most of it, assuming he doesn’t actually get elected, won’t be put into practice. The refusal to inoculate children, though, is something that his admirers can try at home. No other candidate was willing to anger the ideologues by standing up for something as suspicious as science. Given a final chance by Tapper, Carson smiled and said that Trump was “an O.K. doctor”—a reference to Trump’s dismissal of Carson’s surgical skills. Rand Paul, who is also a doctor, added that though he was for vaccines, “I’m also for freedom”—namely the freedom to reschedule shots, “even if science doesn’t say” that there’s a problem.","2872","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"The exchange was of a piece with the rest of the debate and with the state of the Republican Party: fervid, claustrophobic, recklessly insinuating, and, at the same time, utterly timid when it comes to extremism in its own ranks. The discussion about vaccines was immediately preceded by one about climate change: Tapper—citing George Shultz, Reagan’s Secretary of State, who said that his boss had urged industry leaders to come up with a plan to move away from chemicals destroying the ozone layer “as an insurance policy in case the scientists are right”—asked Marco Rubio why we shouldn’t now do the same, just in case there was something to the overwhelming evidence of climate change, rising sea levels, and retreating glaciers all around us.","2873","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"“Because we’re not going to destroy our economy the way the left-wing government that we are under now wants to do,” Rubio said. “Single parents already struggling,” he added, couldn’t afford to do things that, in his view, wouldn’t affect the climate. And anyway, “America is not a planet.”","2874","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Tapper turned to Chris Christie, apparently on the theory that he had previously been more willing than other Republicans to recognize the reality of climate change. He didn’t have much better luck than he did with Carson. “I agree with Marco. We shouldn’t be destroying our economy in order to chase some wild left-wing idea that somehow us by ourselves is going to fix the climate,” Christie said. Not that he was interested in working with others: he bragged that, while making the air cleaner in New Jersey, he’d pulled the state out of regional cap-and-trade agreements. America may not be a planet, but New Jersey is. Scott Walker then jumped in to say that he wouldn’t listen to the E.P.A. Tapper managed to move on, despite Paul’s clamoring to be heard “if you want a skeptic” about climate change. No one tried to break in on behalf of the planet—the one that America is on.","2875","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"The flaw in the debate, evident in both of these exchanges, may have been a structural one. In the interests of mixing it up, CNN’s moderators—Tapper was joined by Dana Bash, the network’s political correspondent, and Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio host—repeatedly quoted criticisms that one candidate had made of the others. The most blunt example may have been when Carly Fiorina was asked what she thought of Trump’s comments, to Rolling Stone, about the unelectability of her face. In lieu of an apology last night, Trump said, “she’s a beautiful woman.” (He also said that he’d heard that Jeb Bush’s wife was “lovely.”) Fiorina declined to simper; throughout, she played her designated role of Trump teller-offer, mixing in references to “my good friend Bibi Netanyahu” and lurid (and inaccurate) descriptions of secretly taped videos of Planned Parenthood employees. Later, she and Trump sniped about their respective business records, prompting Christie, of all people, to tell them to “stop playing” and being so “childish.” “And Carly—Carly, listen,” he said. “You can interrupt everybody else on this stage, you’re not going to interrupt me, O.K.?” He sounded like a first grader striking a pose for the kindergartners.","2876","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"But rather than really pushing the candidates on their positions, CNN’s did-you-hear-what-he-called-you approach served to keep the debate within the tinny echo chamber of the G.O.P. For example, Bash asked Jeb Bush, “After Chief Justice John Roberts voted to uphold Obamacare twice, Senator Cruz criticized your brother for appointing John Roberts to the Supreme Court. Looking back on it, did your brother make a mistake?” What followed was a somewhat bizarre exchange in which Bush offered a tepid defense of Roberts while saying that Cruz had supported him, too. Cruz replied by comparing Roberts—who, Obamacare aside, has led the court to achingly conservative decisions in Citizens United and Hobby Lobby, has helped to roll back voting rights, and has written bitter dissents on marriage equality—to the far more liberal David Souter. Mike Huckabee, who had earlier said that Kim Davis, the county clerk in Kentucky who is violating the Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision by refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, had been afforded less respect for her religious beliefs than “the detainees at Gitmo,” jumped in to expostulate about litmus tests. Only in the Republican primaries would any of this make sense.","2877","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"The Roberts exchange was one of several in which Jeb Bush couldn’t shake a certain air of petulance. “That’s—that’s my brother,” he said at one point, wiggling his arms a little. He had been trying to finish an evocative line about George W. Bush embracing a firefighter in the rubble of Ground Zero, but, since he’d been interrupted with interjections from, in sequence, Trump, Paul, and Walker, it was hard to figure out just what he was saying, or even parse it grammatically. He certainly didn’t command the foreign-policy discussion, amid a general clamor about renouncing the Iran agreement and Trump dismissing the need to learn “name after name, Arab name, Arab name.” Both Rubio and Carson had stronger moments in explaining why they might, if only occasionally, think before bombing, but both still came across as flagrantly hawkish. Paul, meanwhile, communicated the anti-interventionism that has set him apart. (His most effective moment, though, came when he talked about decriminalizing drug offenses, prompting Bush to talk about smoking marijuana as a teen-ager and Fiorina to speak, movingly, about her step-daughter who lost her life to addiction.) Bush said that he had chosen the same foreign-policy advisers that his brother and father had because, if you wanted a Republican, those were the only people available, “just by definition.” Near the end of the debate, Tapper asked each candidate to pick his or her Secret Service code name. (Paul: “Justice Never Sleeps”; Cruz: “Cohiba”; Walker: “Harley. I love riding Harley’s.”) Bush went with “Eveready—it’s very high energy, Donald.” Suddenly, it became hard to shake the image of Jeb as a giant Energizer Bunny. It also made him sound like a sulker, fixated on Trump’s description of him as “low-energy.” Trump, for his part, offered Eveready a hand-slap and then proposed his own name: “Humble.”","2878","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Tapper had another “light question”: What woman should, in accordance with a Treasury Department plan, replace Alexander Hamilton on the ten-dollar bill? Fiorina wouldn’t give a name, saying that she wasn’t in favor of that kind of “gesture.” Others nominated four American historical figures: Clara Barton, Susan B. Anthony, Rosa Parks, and Abigail Adams. The rest of the answers were divided between family members (Huckabee’s wife, Carson’s mother) and foreigners (Bush: Margaret Thatcher; Kasich: Mother Teresa). Really, Miss Oklahoma did a better job with this one than the Presidential contenders. (The correct answer, by the way, is to keep Hamilton on the ten, and put Harriet Tubman on the twenty.)","2879","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Trump went with both Parks and his daughter Ivanka—“because she’s been sitting for three hours.” Do we all get a bill, then? The debate was crowded, bloated, sour, and long. Far from adding order to the race, it is likely to have made it even more unpredictable. As was the case last time, each candidate probably did enough to satisfy his or her narrow faction, or at least to convince a couple of big donors to keep paying. Some (Carson, Fiorina, Rubio) likely did more than that. The question is who will lose the support they gain. Trump’s core supporters may not mind his performance, even though, at times, he seemed to be insulting people just to stay awake, like a truck driver lighting another cigarette. He was missing what he would call his usual “braggadocious” verve. It’s going to be a strange and pot-holed road on the way to 2016. But all we watched, on Wednesday night, were a bunch of bumper cars colliding in front of an old Air Force One.","2880","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"In early 2013, the R.N.C., under its current chairman, Reince Priebus, produced a searching report that tried to make sense of Mitt Romney’s 2012 defeat. When the report was released, the biggest news was its frank dissection of the G.O.P.’s weakness among groups that voted overwhelmingly for Obama. “Public perception of the Party is at record lows,” the document noted. “Young voters are increasingly rolling their eyes at what the Party represents, and many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country.”","November 2, 2015","2881","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"But, beyond the demographic warnings contained in the report, Priebus’s team also cautioned that the Republican Party was living in a cocoon. The report said that the G.O.P. was “increasingly marginalizing itself” at the federal level. “The Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself,” the report said. “We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people, but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue.”","2882","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"One of the report’s less-well-known recommendations had to do with primary debates. The number of G.O.P. Presidential primary debates had grown from six in 1980 to twenty in 2012. Republicans wanted to gain some control over the process in 2016. “The number of debates has become ridiculous, and they’re taking candidates away from other important campaign activities,” the report noted. The report recommended that the G.O.P. sanction no more than ten to twelve debates, a recommendation that Priebus later implemented.","2883","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"But there was another recommendation that wasn’t adopted. Buried in the report was this idea:","2884","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Ultimately, the R.N.C. decided against setting up its own organization to run its debates. Instead, it stuck with the model of partnering with media organizations to conduct them, partly because of the high costs of running its own debates and partly because the R.N.C. worried that setting up its own debates might make the events less credible.","2885","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"All of this was decided long before any of the candidates announced their campaigns for President. (The Republican debate schedule was released in January, 2014.) The candidates were essentially stuck with the agreements that the R.N.C. had already negotiated with the various media outlets.","2886","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Last week, after the CNBC debate that most of the candidates complained was unfair and featured hostile moderators, the campaigns finally revolted against the Priebus-negotiated debates. Representatives from most of the Republican Presidential campaigns met near Washington on Sunday night to wrest control from Priebus and the R.N.C. Today, they released a draft letter with their demands—which essentially consist of having their cake and eating it, too. The campaigns that sign the letter want the media to host and televise the events, but they want a level of control that they would get from running them and paying for them themselves. (Donald Trump is reportedly going to negotiate on his own.) The section of the letter that immediately caught the attention of many in the media was the following:","2887","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Most people would agree that the Republican (and Democratic) Parties should have some say in how the debates are run and organized. These are, after all, not just news events or typical media interviews. They are partnerships between the media and a political party. It’s fair that the mechanics of the debate, such as the format, length of time, rules, and the moderators, should all be up for negotiation. For instance, the R.N.C. asked its mainstream-media partners to add a conservative media outlet to the events, to insure that the questioning would reflect some of the issues important to Republican primary voters.","2888","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"But surely the red line for any media organization has to be editorial content. After all, the R.N.C. rejected the option of running these debates on its own. It is the media that is paying for the events, and it is over the media’s airwaves that the events are broadcast.","2889","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Of course, if the candidates don’t get their way, they don’t have to attend the debates. They could, as they have threatened to do, boycott future R.N.C.-sanctioned events, just as Donald Trump threatened to boycott the CNBC debate. (There’s a precedent for this. In 2007, the Democrats cancelled a Fox News debate, though in that case Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton did not demand to control any elements of Fox News’s editorial content as a precondition for participating in the event.)","2890","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"What the candidates shouldn’t be allowed to do is tell reporters what questions to ask or what graphics to show on the screen, or have any role whatsoever in the editorial judgments of a news organization. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan’s famous quip, if the G.O.P. wants that much control, then it needs to pay for the microphone.","2891","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"This is getting interesting. On Tuesday, the day before the second televised G.O.P. debate, a new poll, carried out for the New York Times and CBS News, showed Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, gaining strongly on Donald Trump among Republican voters. This is the latest in a series of surveys that has shown Carson moving up, but the previous surveys still had Trump ahead by double digits. In this one, Trump’s lead was down to just four points, which isn’t even statistically significant. Twenty-seven per cent of likely G.O.P. voters said that they would support Trump, and twenty-three per cent said that they would support Carson.","September 15, 2015","2892","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"Yes, it is just one poll, and the usual caveats about sampling error and outliers apply. But this was the first national survey carried out since Trump made his offensive remarks about Carly Fiorina’s appearance, and it suggests that they may have damaged him and helped Carson. In stark contrast to Trump, Carson is unfailingly courteous, and he is very popular among Christian evangelicals.","2893","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"The poll raises the stakes for tomorrow night’s Republican debate, which will be shown on CNN. Assuming that Carson emerges from the debate without making any big mistakes, he could well enjoy another lift, which would raise an intriguing possibility: Will establishment Republicans, in the interests of defeating Trump, whom they regard as a dangerous interloper, start to rally behind Carson—another political neophyte, but one who seems less eager to challenge traditional G.O.P. nostrums than Trump is?","2894","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"At this stage, anyway, the polling data suggests that Carson is the only electorally viable alternative to Trump in the G.O.P. primary. In the new survey, as in a number of previous ones, all of the candidates except Trump and Carson scored in the single figures. Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, and Marco Rubio each got six per cent. Ted Cruz got five per cent. Fiorina got four per cent. The rest of the pack got three per cent or less.","2895","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"Backers of more orthodox Republican politicians will no doubt be hoping that these candidates do well in Wednesday’s debate and subsequently pick themselves up off the floor. But how long can the party hierarchy and its financial backers afford to wait? With Trump parading around the country, saying C.E.O. pay levels are disgraceful and promising to abolish some tax breaks enjoyed by the rich, some of his fellow plutocrats are already eager to take him down. On Tuesday, the Club for Growth, a right-wing pressure group that has received funding from a number of conservative billionaires, announced that it was launching an anti-Trump advertising campaign in Iowa and other states. “We’ll continue doing it until people realize that Donald Trump is not an economic conservative,” the organization’s president, David M. McIntosh, said at a press conference in Washington.","2896","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"As the old saying goes, though, you can’t beat something with nothing, and, right now, Carson looks like he might be the something that worried Republicans need. A world-renowned surgeon who was brought up in Detroit by his mother, after his parents divorced, Carson has an inspirational life story to relate. A supporter of a balanced-budget amendment, a skeptic about most government programs, and a harsh critic of Obamacare (last year, he said it has done more damage to the United States than the 9/11 attacks), he is singing a tune that conservatives want to hear. On the basis of what we’ve seen so far, he may well have the calmness and self-confidence to stand up to Trump’s jibes without being rattled. Last week, after Trump questioned Carson’s energy level and called him just an “O.K. doctor” —a laughably inaccurate description—Carson responded gracefully.","2897","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"For Carson, a lot depends on Wednesday night’s debate. CNN has been promoting the event as “Round two of a heavyweight bout,” and much of the attention will be focussed on how Trump and Fiorina interact, following Trump’s offensive remarks about Fiorina’s appearance. But Carson, who was largely overlooked at last month’s Fox News debate, will also be a big part of the story. If he holds his own, or does better than that, it would confirm his position as the main rival to Trump.","2898","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"Until now, the Republican establishment, for want of a better strategy, has been largely waiting for the Trump phenomenon to blow over. Recently, some of the candidates, Jeb Bush included, have started to criticize Trump, but that hasn’t done them much good, either. In a year when much of the Republican electorate appears to have soured on all politicians, only Carson has made much of a dent on Trump’s lead. If you were a mega-rich Republican, or a Karl Rove type, why wouldn’t you take that as a cue to throw some serious money and organizational might in the direction of Carson’s campaign, which, until now, has largely relied on small donations? If nothing else, it could serve as an insurance policy.","2899","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"It has been widely reported that many Republican bigwigs and strategists have serious doubts about Carson’s political skills, and his ability to withstand all of the attention and craziness that comes with being a serious contender. That’s understandable. He’s a doctor, not a politician, and he has made some gaffes in the past, such as suggesting that the prevalence of homosexuality in prisons shows that being gay is a choice. (He subsequently apologized for this remark.)","2900","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"Most of the Republican super-donors and super PACs have to date directed their favors elsewhere. However, on Sunday, the Times reported that Carson was starting to attract some larger donations. He has also added a number of fund-raisers to his schedule. That could be just the beginning. If Carson keeps doing what he has been doing, Trump does the same, and the establishment candidates continue to founder, it might not be long before Carson receives a call from Washington saying that some fellows in expensive-looking suits would like to meet with him.","2901","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"“The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don’t trust the media,” Senator Ted Cruz said last night, drawing himself up in a way that made him appear to slightly inflate. Sweeping his arm across the stage, at the University of Colorado, in Boulder, he said, “This is not a cage match. And, you look at the questions: ‘Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?’ ‘Ben Carson, can you do math?’ ‘John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?’ ‘Marco Rubio, why don’t you resign?’ ‘Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?’ How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?” He got a big round of applause, which Carlos Quintanilla, one of the moderators for CNBC, tried to interrupt, asking, “Do we get credit…,” before Cruz interrupted him again.","October 29, 2015","2902","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"“The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was ‘Which of you is more handsome and why?’ ” Cruz said. That wasn’t quite how anyone who saw that debate would remember it, but the Senator just shook his head, compared the Democrats to “the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks,” and wondered at the implausibility of a debate moderator voting in a Republican primary. Quintanilla tried again to be heard over the laughter of the crowd before he managed to say, somewhat forlornly, “I asked you about the debt limit and I got no answer.”","2903","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"For the record, this was the question that inspired Cruz’s rant about insubstantiality: “Congressional Republicans, Democrats, and the White House are about to strike a compromise that would raise the debt limit, prevent a government shutdown and calm financial markets that fear of—another Washington-created crisis is on the way. Does your opposition to it show that you’re not the kind of problem-solver American voters want?” Given that Cruz’s previous responses to such crises have included filibustering the Senate with a reading of “Green Eggs and Ham,” and that he has, in just the past month, been involved in a squabble with his fellow-Republicans over his efforts to make the debt ceiling a hostage in the fight against Planned Parenthood, it was a pretty good question, which Cruz blithely ignored. And yet, in the brief tussle that followed, Cruz managed to make it sound as if he were being unjustly denied a chance to turn to the debt ceiling as the questioning moved on to the next candidate.","2904","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"Even before the debate ended, CNBC was being roundly criticized—Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, tweeted that CNBC “should be ashamed of how this debate was handled”—and, to be clear, the moderators did fail. But not for the reasons that the Republican candidates gave: Rubio said that “the Democrats have the ultimate Super PAC. It’s called the mainstream media”; Carson called a question “propaganda”; Chris Christie complained that he wasn’t being asked about ISIS, even though this was a debate about business and the economy. Nor was it because their questions were especially marked by infotainment froth. It is because the moderators utterly failed to control a group of candidates whose level of detachment from facts and vitriol seemed to surprise them when it shouldn’t have.","2905","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"It’s unclear what anyone’s best-case scenario for this debate would have been, in terms of real engagement with the issues. The shallowness of much of the rhetoric in the campaign can lead to simple questions that, to some ears, sound simplistic, but have to be asked, such as why the math in Carson’s very vague budget proposals doesn’t add up, or why, as another moderator, John Harwood, asked Donald Trump, his talk about forcing Mexico to build a wall “and make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others” (Trump: “That’s right”) didn’t amount to “a comic-book version of a Presidential campaign.” The moderators just didn’t account for the pits of deep ugliness in those shallows and didn’t know how to navigate them. They weren’t prepared for candidates who called them liars, and who, by the end, were simply ignoring both questions and time limits. Carly Fiorina, notably, just started talking when she wanted; at the very end, she had a brief blinking contest with Harwood, who surrendered with a weary “All right, go ahead.” Again, by this point in the campaign, the moderators really should have known better.","2906","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"For example, when Becky Quick asked Trump why he’d been critical of Mark Zuckerberg’s call for more H1B visas for tech workers, and Trump denied that he had been, she seemed surprised, saying, “Where did I read this and come up with this that you were?”—as if he would tell her. “I don’t know—you people write the stuff,” Trump said. A minute later, when Quick tried to follow up by noting that Trump had called Marco Rubio “Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Senator because he was in favor of the H1B,” Trump replied, “I never said that. I never said that.”","2907","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"“So this was an erroneous article the whole way around?” Quick said. “My apologies. I’m sorry.” It took until after a commercial break for her to discover that the quotes had come from Trump’s own Web site. He didn’t apologize, and it didn’t matter. Cruz had set a model for his colleagues that night: people hate reporters. Just insult them and you’ll be fine, regardless of the question you’ve been asked. It was similar to a moment Newt Gingrich had, during a debate in 2012, when he gained momentum by telling off John King, of CNN. But that was a rejection of questions about Gingrich’s personal life (“despicable” questions, Gingrich said) and not of fact-based queries altogether.","2908","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"There were some bad and petty questions. Quick pressed too much and with too much alarm about Rubio, the father of four school-age children, taking money out of his retirement savings, at a cost to him and his family of thousands of dollars. It’s more Suze Orman’s job to berate people about things like that, and what Rubio did is neither unethical nor disqualifying. Then again, it allowed him to play to his strengths, saying, “Here’s the truth. I didn’t inherit any money. My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.” He said that after getting married he had to explain to his wife “why someone named Sallie Mae was taking a thousand dollars out of our bank account every month.” Rubio did well all around (my colleague John Cassidy writes about why he was the big winner), including when Jeb Bush tried, with an ill-conceived feint, to cut him down.","2909","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"The issue was Rubio’s frequent absence from the Senate—the occasion for another of the questions Cruz objected to, based on a call in an editorial in Florida’s Sun-Sentinel for Rubio to resign. Rubio had already dealt with the question, inevitably, by attacking the press: “It’s actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today,” he said of the editorial. Bush asked if he could jump in, “because I’m a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.” Whoever told Bush, who so often in his life has been given well-paid opportunities through family or political connections, that he should put Rubio in his place by calling him an employee who had failed to provide good “service” is not advising him very well. When Rubio asked why Bush didn’t mind that Senator John McCain, whom he’d cited as a model, had missed a lot of votes, Bush underscored the patron play by saying, “He wasn’t my senator.”","2910","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"“Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,” Rubio said. And maybe it would have, if Bush had any aptitude for this sort of thing. But he lost the stage, having demonstrated only the sort of petulance that he showed last weekend, when he complained that there were a lot of “really cool things” that he could be doing besides running for President. His only memorable moment came when he bragged about how well his fantasy-football team was doing—“Gronkowski is still going strong!”—better, it seems, than his fantasy Presidential campaign.","2911","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"

"The mainstream reaction to the forced resignation of John Boehner as the Speaker of the House has been a kind of weary admiration. He fought the good fight against the extremists in his Republican caucus, the narrative goes, but his solid Midwestern virtues (he’s from Ohio) were ultimately no contest for the extremism of the Tea Party. This interpretation is far too generous to Boehner, whose failures, political and substantive, were due mostly to cowardice. The tragedy of Boehner is that he could have been a great Speaker, even on his own terms, but instead his legacy is one of almost complete failure.","September 29, 2015","2913","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"Boehner long made it clear that he was a dedicated party man, who believed that what was good for the G.O.P. was good for the country as well. This is how the issue of comprehensive immigration reform came to be the true crucible of his speakership. Following President Obama’s reëlection, in 2012, it was clear that Republicans had to try to appeal to Hispanic voters. In March of 2013, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, released a report saying that the Party “must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.” In short order, many Republicans in the Senate, including such prominent figures as John McCain and Marco Rubio, did just that, and a bill which included a path to citizenship for a majority of undocumented immigrants passed by a vote of sixty-eight to thirty-two.","2914","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"Boehner also supported immigration reform, at least in its broad outlines—because he correctly saw that it was good for both his party and his country. And there was no doubt that the reform bill could pass the House, with the support of most Democrats and a substantial number of Republicans as well. But Boehner’s Tea Party colleagues in the House opposed immigration reform. So the choice for Boehner, who controlled the House floor, was clear: pass a historic bill that would be good for the Republicans and for the republic, or appease the extremist elements in his party in hopes of hanging on to his position as Speaker.","2915","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"Boehner caved, refusing to bring the bill to the floor for a vote, and he suffered the fate of all those who give in to bullies; he was bullied some more. This year, the fight was over the highway bill, another piece of popular legislation that Boehner himself and a majority of the House (as well as the Senate and the President) supported—as well they might, given that maintenance of roads and bridges represents some of the basic work of government. But again the Tea Party intimidated Boehner into keeping the bill off the floor, depriving the Speaker of another major accomplishment.","2916","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"Boehner adopted an extreme version of the so-called Hastert rule, named for his predecessor as Speaker, Dennis Hastert, who is now under indictment for alleged financial crimes connected to blackmail payments (he has pleaded not guilty). The Hastert rule holds that the Speaker should never allow a vote on a bill unless it’s supported by a majority of the Republican caucus. But Boehner’s approach was to keep bills off the floor that were opposed by a minority of Republicans—the Tea Party caucus, which only numbers about fifty—effectively giving them a veto over the work of the House. Nothing came to the floor without their say-so, so that meant that nothing much came to the floor except for symbolic exercises like votes to repeal Obamacare or to defund Planned Parenthood.","2917","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"When Boehner announced his impending departure, he expressed pride that he had kept the government open (after a sixteen-day shutdown in 2013) and raised the debt limit. This, to paraphrase a famous Republican, reflects the soft bigotry of low expectations. Keeping the government open and paying its debts are the minimal undertakings of an elected body, not legislative triumphs. But Boehner could point to almost nothing else that happened on his watch, because the Tea Party would tolerate nothing else.","2918","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"And what did Boehner’s cowardice in the face of the Tea Party stalwarts get him? They forced him out anyway. Boehner built his career around keeping his job, and he still failed. If Boehner had allowed the passage of immigration reform, it’s entirely possible that the Tea Party would have rebelled and evicted him—but at least he would have had a substantial accomplishment to his credit. Instead, Boehner tried nothing, accomplished nothing, and lost his job anyway. It’s the legacy he deserves.","2919","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pointless-cowardice-of-john-boehner"
"Coming after the drubbing Democrats received in last year’s midterms, Tuesday was another bad Election Day for the Party. In Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, Matt Bevin, a Tea Party Republican who made rolling back the state’s participation in the Affordable Care Act a central part of his platform, defied the opinion polls to win handily, bringing the number of G.O.P. governors across the country to thirty-two. In Virginia, a well-funded Democratic bid to take control of the State Senate failed. In Mississippi, voters rejected an effort to change the state’s constitution to guarantee more funding for public schools. And in Houston, the fourth-largest city in the country, a ballot measure that would have banned discrimination on the basis of age, race, disability, sexual orientation, gender, and a number of other categories was defeated by a wide margin.","November 5, 2015","2920","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"Republicans didn’t take long to place the blame for the Democrats’ woes on President Obama, and to crow about their chances in 2016. “There were 29 democrat governors in 2008,” Ben Walters, a fund-raiser for the Presidential candidate Ben Carson, commented on Twitter. “When Bevin is sworn in there will be 17.” Referring to the election in Virginia, which was closely watched in Washington, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, tweeted, “.@GOP heads into the 2016 election with positive momentum and with the right vision to put our country back on track.”","2921","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"There is no arguing that the Democrats have suffered a series of big setbacks at the local level. In a report issued earlier this year, a Party task force that included Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, and Steve Beshear, the outgoing Democratic governor of Kentucky, noted, “We have suffered devastating losses at all levels of government since 2008 including: 69 House Seats; 13 Senate Seats; 910 State Legislative Seats; 30 State Legislative Chambers; 11 Governorships.”","2922","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"With Bevin’s victory, that last figure is now a round dozen. Even before Tuesday, there were no Democratic governors in states south of the thirty-ninth parallel. Now there aren’t any along a line stretching from the Florida Panhandle to the Great Lakes, either. It’s a similar story in state legislatures. In 2008, the Republicans controlled both chambers in fourteen states; today, they control both chambers in thirty states. Some of these states are sparsely populated, but some aren’t. In five of the ten most-populous states in the country—Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas—Republicans run the governor’s mansion and both houses in the State Legislature. If you look at a map of who controls American politics at the local level, it is a sea of red.","2923","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"How much of this can be put down to dissatisfaction with Obama? In some places, such as Kentucky, where Mitt Romney won more than sixty per cent of the vote in 2012, disapproval of the President clearly played a role. Bevin, and groups supporting him, ran ad after ad seeking to tie the Democratic candidate, Jack Conway, to the President. (Conway, in turn, ran ads trying to distance himself from Obama.) The Republicans also harped on and on about the supposed evils of Obamacare. Since Kentucky is one of the Southern states where the Affordable Care Act has had a lot of success in bringing down the rate of uninsured (Arkansas is another), Bevin’s effectiveness in demonizing health-care reform was depressing, if not entirely surprising. Rather than acknowledging Obamacare’s successes, he played on voter concerns about rising premiums, large deductibles, and restricted doctor choice. In a state with a lot of evangelical Christians, Republican opposition to gay marriage also played a role.","2924","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"The Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza wrote, on Tuesday, that Bevin has Obama to thank for his victory, at least in part. This is true. But before buying the line that Obama has been a disaster for the Democratic Party in general, two other factors should be noted. First, it isn’t anything new for the Party of a two-term President to suffer electoral losses on Capitol Hill and at the local level. It’s the norm, as Philip A. Klinkner, a political scientist at Hamilton College, pointed out in an article on Vox, last month. When Bill Clinton was elected, there were thirty Democratic governors across the country. When he left office, there were seventeen. When George W. Bush entered the White House, there were twenty-nine Republican governors. When he left, there were twenty-two. Judging by the number of governor’s mansions it now controls, the Democratic Party isn’t in worse shape now than it was in 2000.","2925","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"The other factor that needs to be taken into account is a historical one. Support for the Democratic Party and some of its policies was ebbing in Southern states like Kentucky and Mississippi long before Obama came along. The Party’s problems below the Mason-Dixon line date back to the Civil Rights Act and Richard Nixon’s Southern strategy, which was based on attracting disgruntled white Southerners to the G.O.P. Obama’s Presidency may well have sped up the electoral secession of the Confederate states from the Democratic Party, but it didn’t start the process.","2926","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"The big question now, of course, is whether this development is permanent. In mining the demographic trends that are affecting states like Texas and Florida just as much as the rest of the country, particularly the rise of the Hispanic vote, can the Democrats start to recapture some of the ground they’ve lost in the South, and also in states surrounding the Great Lakes, such as Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin?","2927","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"The short answer is that if they do, it is likely to take a while. Next year, there will be another eleven races for state governorships, and the Republicans will be hoping for wins in Missouri and West Virginia, where the Democratic incumbents—Jay Nixon and Earl Ray Tomblin— can’t run again because of term limits. The Democrats’ best shot of a gain might be in North Carolina, where the Democratic attorney general, Roy Cooper, is challenging Pat McCrory, the Republican governor.","2928","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"Since voters will also be picking a President next November, turnout should be considerably higher than it was on Tuesday and in last year’s midterms, which should help Democrats, on balance. Despite Republican inroads into the white working class, most Americans who are poor or living on modest incomes still tend to go Democratic. But getting them to vote in local elections is a big challenge in years when there isn’t a Presidential election. On the other hand, the electoral map favors the Republicans. To the extent that local races continue to be seen as referendums on eight years of Obama in the Oval Office, it is tough to see Democrats doing well in places like Missouri and West Virginia, where the President’s approval ratings are below forty per cent. And even if the Democrats hold steady in 2016, they will face another big challenge in 2018, when thirty-six governor’s mansions will be up for grabs.","2929","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"In addition to exposing Democratic constituencies to Republican efforts to cut social programs, dismantle environmental protections, and weaken labor unions, the Party’s losses at the local level are also handicapping it nationally. More Republican state legislatures means more congressional districts gerrymandered to benefit the G.O.P. And the dearth of Democratic governors is depriving the Party of potential future leaders. When it was at a low ebb during the Reagan years, Southern Democrats like Clinton and Al Gore helped revive it. Today, it is hard to identify their successors.","2930","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"After consoling themselves with their success at the Presidential level, some senior Democrats are finally facing up to the dangers facing the Party and the extent to which it has fallen behind the Republicans in organizing at the local level. The report by the D.N.C. task force acknowledged that the G.O.P.’s “stranglehold on state houses, governorships and congressional seats is a by-product of more than 30 years of organizing, fostering talent and significant financial investments at the state and local level.”","2931","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"Efforts are under way to match the Republicans. Earlier this year, the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democratic donors that includes George Soros, agreed to spend tens of millions of dollars at the local level, on such initiatives as building up progressive networks, launching ballot initiatives, and countering Republican groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council. “People have gotten a wake-up call,” Gara LaMarche, the president of the Democracy Alliance, told the Washington Post. “The right is focused on the state level, and even down-ballot, and has made enormous gains. We can’t have the kind of long-term progressive future we want if we don’t take power in the states.”","2932","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"Smart Democrats recognize that reviving their Party is a long-term project. Ironically, however, they could get a short-term boost at the local level if they lose the White House next year and the G.O.P. retains its majorities in the House and the Senate. With the Republicans exerting complete control in Washington—no screaming, please—there would be the potential for a backlash come the 2018 midterms. Democrats, however, need to do more than pin their hopes on the emergence of another unpopular Republican President.","2933","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"Fifteen years ago, as Philip Roth was reading the galleys of a memoir by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., he came to a passage about the political fevers of 1939-40, when reactionaries like Father Charles Coughlin, Henry Ford, and Charles Lindbergh brandished the twin banners of nativism and isolation. Moderate Republicans, including Wendell Willkie, a corporate lawyer who eventually won the Party’s Presidential nomination, were never likely to topple F.D.R., and some Party grandees wanted Lindbergh to run. Lindbergh was known by then not only as the daring aviator who crossed the Atlantic in the Spirit of St. Louis but also as a bigot so vile that F.D.R., upon reading one of his speeches, remarked that “it could not have been better put if it had been written by Goebbels himself.”","2934","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Next to a passage where Schlesinger raised the question of whether Republicans would put Lindbergh forward at the head of a new Know-Nothing Party, Roth wrote, “What if they had?” That marginal note became the germ for “The Plot Against America,” a counter-factual novel in which Lindbergh is elected President. “Fear presides over these memories,” Roth’s novel begins, “perpetual fear.” Anyone who dares to look past the comedy of Donald Trump’s surreal tweets and Ben Carson’s end-times ruminations will notice that the politics of perpetual fear is, in our times, the stuff of nonfiction.","2935","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Last week, the Democrats held their first debate, a five-candidate affair in Las Vegas—an unlikely place to hear denunciations of “the casino-capitalist process.” Still, it was a relatively civil and sober discussion compared with the Republican rodeos. After a year of floundering, Hillary Clinton, cool, well-schooled, forensically skilled, had her best hours as a candidate. Her performance provided relief for her supporters and a potential lure for the undecided. She was, contrary to previous reports, conspicuously human-seeming—funny, passionate, even, at times, rueful of past mistakes—a development that might have robbed her potential rival, Vice-President Joe Biden, of the rationale he needed to make a run. Bernie Sanders, the seventy-four-year-old junior senator from Vermont and unapologetic democratic socialist, spoke in a voice that suggested Larry David, on “Seinfeld,” imitating George Steinbrenner. And yet although Clinton handily won the debate, Sanders largely set the terms, pushing her toward a more full-throated progressive view of income inequality and other issues. (From offstage, the Black Lives Matter movement had an equally serious influence on the discussion of race.)","2936","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Sanders also paused for an act of clever generosity, declaring, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails!” Beaming and extending her hand, Clinton thanked him but did not reciprocate the kindness, swatting him on his weak record on gun control, citing his multiple votes against the Brady bill. And while Clinton totted up her own list of Scandinavian-style domestic goals, such as paid parental leave, she raised a brow at Sanders when he talked of “revolution” and the systemic rot of late capitalism. In case we hadn’t figured it out, Hillary Clinton wants to win.","2937","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"History may look back on the Las Vegas debate as the event that elevated Clinton the way that Barack Obama’s eloquent victory speech after the Iowa caucuses elevated him, nearly eight years ago. It might even be regarded as the moment when she boxed out Biden, raked away the underbrush of Mssrs. Chafee, Webb, and O’Malley, and made Sanders look less like a plausible contender than like a protest candidate who forced his opponent to grapple with a political system poisoned by the outsized influence of an American oligarchy comprising, as the Times has reported, a hundred and fifty-eight families.","2938","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"One debate will not erase all of what many voters see as Clinton’s complications: the lingering perception of her sense of moneyed entitlement, her lawyerly slipperiness under questioning, the walled garden of her political circle, her interventionist reflexes, her belatedness on gay marriage, comprehensive immigration, and Wall Street reforms. But if Clinton was not flawless she and her debating partners managed one distinct achievement: they accentuated the chaos, the intellectual barrenness, and the general collapse of their rivals in the Republican Party.","2939","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"

Members of the caucus stepped forward to admit that the hearings on Benghazi were aimed less at uncovering the truth than at burying Hillary Clinton. An ambitious Party loyalist, Paul Ryan, is reluctant to run for Boehner’s chair because the House Republicans are the new Wild Bunch and, as a friend of Ryan’s put it to Politico, “he’s not a f—ing moron.”","2940","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"

Donald Trump and Ben Carson, the only Republicans polling in double digits, daily clear their throats with that ritual preface of modern self-satisfaction—“I am not politically correct”—and then unleash statements, positions, and postures so willfully detached from fact that they embarrass the political culture that harbors them. Trump is willing to say anything—anything racist, anything false, anything “funny”—to terrify voters, or rile them, or amuse them, depending on the moment. The worst of his demagogic arousals are reminiscent of Lindbergh’s speeches at America First rallies and his fear, as he wrote in Reader’s Digest, of a “pressing sea of Yellow, Black and Brown.” Carson, who seems as historically confused as he is surgically skilled, has said that Obamacare is worse than 9/11, “because 9/11 is an isolated incident.” What’s more, the two men’s rivals either fall into line or lack the persuasive powers and the courage to marginalize candidates they know to be dangerous.","2941","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"

"Let’s start, as we must, at Trump Tower, where, last Thursday, Reince Priebus, the boyish-looking forty-three-year-old who has the unenviable task of heading up the Republican National Committee, presented a piece of paper to the fellow whose name is on the building. “I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,” the words on the paper said. “I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.” Donald Trump filled in his name in a blank space at the start of the text and signed at the bottom. He or someone else got the date wrong, writing August 3rd instead of September 3rd, but that didn’t matter: the deed had been done.","2945","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"A few weeks ago, when the loyalty pledge was first mooted, it looked like a clever insurance policy for the Republicans. After all, if Trump were to run as an independent and win even four or five per cent of the vote, he could easily hand the Presidential election to the Democrats. But as Trump extended and enlarged his position as the G.O.P. frontrunner, Priebus’s ploy came to take on a rather different aspect. From the vantage of Trump and his advisers, it must have seemed as if the Republican establishment, which they hold in utter disdain, were repeating the mistake of the Trojans and pulling the Greek horse into its midst.","2946","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"If Trump’s candidacy fails, as Priebus and his colleagues are dearly hoping that it will, whoever wins the Republican nomination won’t have to worry about Trump running as a third-party candidate: that’s the theory, anyway. But for the author of “The Art of the Deal,” this was a concession well worth making. For one thing, it assured him that his name will be on the G.O.P. primary ballot in every state, including those, like South Carolina, that had made (or threatened to make) a loyalty pledge a pre-condition for participating. Secondly, the signed pledge goes at least some way toward immunizing Trump against the charge that Jeb Bush had levelled at him on the very morning he signed it: that he isn’t a real conservative, or even a genuine Republican.","2947","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Finally, and most importantly from Trump’s standpoint, if all the other G.O.P. hopefuls go down—or rather, if they fail to get up from the prostrate position Trump’s summer stampede through the polls has left most of them in—the pledge insures that Trump will be guaranteed the support of the party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. As Jim Newell remarked at Slate, “Trump has not pledged to incorporate into his candidacy any of the cheerier tones or traditional Republican policies that the GOP establishment would like to see from him. The Republican Party, though, has agreed to incorporate Trump.” No wonder that, once Preibus had left, Trump called in the press and said he “will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands.” He added: “We will go out and fight hard, and we will win. We will win.”","2948","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"That remains an unlikely outcome, but not nearly as unlikely as it seemed a couple of months ago. Monmouth University’s poll data for June showed Trump’s favorable rating among likely Republican voters to be twenty per cent and his unfavorable rating to be fifty-five per cent. In Monmouth’s latest poll, which was released last week, Trump’s favorable rating among Republicans had jumped to fifty-nine per cent, and his unfavorable rating had fallen to twenty-nine per cent. Even in an era of declining party loyalty and footloose voters, these numbers represent an astonishing turnaround—and one that has sent pollsters searching, largely in vain, for a historical analogy. It isn’t unheard of for a previously unknown candidate to take off like a rocket before exploding at high altitude. But Trump wasn’t an unknown. He was a familiar television personality and blowhard, about whom the majority of Republicans harbored critical opinions. In just a couple of months, he has reversed many of those opinions, raising his positive rating by nearly forty percentage points and lowering his negative rating by almost thirty points.","2949","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"

Clearly, his critical comments about Mexicans, and his pledge to deport as many as eleven million undocumented immigrants, struck a chord, as did his promise to renegotiate trade agreements that have cost jobs. But what really seems to have enthused the Republican electorate is Trump’s renegade attitude toward the Party establishment and the press. Every time he describes Washington as a hopeless cesspit, paints Jeb Bush as an ineffectual ninny, and jumps on anybody in the media who tries to question him, his numbers go up. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Real Clear Politics poll average showed him leading Ben Carson, another political outsider, by 27.8 per cent to 13.5 per cent at the national level, with all the other candidates stuck in single figures.","2950","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"

At the start of the year, practically nobody in Washington took seriously the prospect of a Bernie Sanders Presidential candidacy. Indeed, some Hillary Clinton supporters were hoping that he would run, on the grounds that he would fill a potentially dangerous void to the left of Clinton with an unelectable presence. Now Sanders is running well ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire, the second primary state, and he’s gaining ground in Iowa, the first primary state.","2951","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The level of concern in the Clinton camp is perhaps best conveyed by two reports that appeared in the Times in the past few days, which were based on briefings from Clinton staffers and supporters. One of the stories said that, going forward, the candidate would seek to present a more likable side, demonstrating that she possesses a sense of humor and a beating heart. The other Times article said that the Clinton campaign is hoping to build a “political firewall across the South” starting on Super Tuesday, March 1st, when a dozen states, nine of them below the Mason-Dixon line, will vote in the Democratic primary. A firewall to contain Sanders? He was supposed to be incapable of lighting a gas stove, let alone sparking a raging brush fire.","2952","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"How did the Democratic primary come to this? Sanders deserves credit for recognizing that there is a resurgent progressive movement in the United States, one based on the proposition—shared by many Tea Party members, and even Trump—that American politics is now hopelessly corrupt. Once Elizabeth Warren made it clear that she wasn’t interested in acting as the movement’s standard-bearer in 2016, Sanders seized the opportunity. As the lone Socialist in Congress, he was never going to be accused of being an opportunist or a Johnny-come-lately to the progressive cause. But, at the age of seventy-three, he needed to show that he had the fire and the durability to be a Presidential candidate. This he has certainly done. Rather than engaging Clinton directly, he has stuck to the issues, calling for the public financing of elections, free enrollment at state universities, a breakup of the big banks, and a minimum wage of fifteen dollars an hour. All of these policies are popular, particularly with college-educated liberals, who have been flocking to Sanders in huge numbers.","2953","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The Vermont senator has earned his current position in the race. But he has also received a good deal of help from Clinton, who, despite the endorsement of many senior figures in the Party, is still struggling to recover from some self-inflicted wounds. Earlier in the year, when the stories about her private e-mail system and the tangled finances of the Clinton Global Foundation started to come out, it seemed like the money story would prove the most serious, but it is the e-mail saga that has plagued Clinton’s every step. It continues to damage her reputation. Recently, pollsters from Quinnipiac University asked a random sample of voters which word they most associated with various candidates. When Clinton’s name was mentioned, the three most popular answers were “liar,” “dishonest,” and “untrustworthy.”","2954","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"After this poll received a lot of publicity, some Hillary supporters argued that Quinnipiac had hyped the findings, and they raised some sound points. Out of a sample of fifteen hundred and sixty-three voters, a hundred and eighty-seven people answered “liar,” and it’s probably fair to assume that the vast majority were Republicans. (The sample contained six hundred and sixty-six self-identified Republicans.) Undoubtedly, much of the venom directed at Clinton is coming from ardent G.O.P. supporters, and this shouldn’t be overlooked. But it’s also true that her approval rating among independent and moderate voters has fallen sharply. In a P.P.P. poll released in April, fifty per cent of self-identified moderates had a favorable opinion of Clinton, and forty-one per cent had an unfavorable opinion. Now these numbers have flipped. A P.P.P. poll released last week showed that thirty-nine per cent of moderates view Clinton favorably, and forty-nine per cent view her unfavorably.*","2955","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The e-mail saga has surely helped to drive this turnaround. While Clinton’s insistence that she didn’t break any laws or violate any rules appears to be true, her explanation for why she did it—for the sake of convenience—beggars belief. The more she repeats this line, the harder it seems to be for voters to avoid the conclusion that she has something to hide. Last week, Clinton told NBC News’s Andrea Mitchell that she wasn’t thinking much about the server when she set it up. “We had so many problems around the world,” Clinton said. “I didn’t really stop and think, What kind of e-mail system will there be?” The day after the interview, the Washington Post reported that Clinton had personally paid a State Department staffer to set up the private e-mail server, maintain it, and keep it going. And in case you missed it, the staffer, Bryan Pagliano, has reportedly indicated that he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence rather than testify before Congress.","2956","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"To state the obvious, it’s a worrying situation for Clinton. In the past few months, she has laid out a series of liberal-leaning policies on everything from student loans to day care to short-termism on Wall Street. (On Tuesday, she outlined her plans for campaign-finance reform.) Once the televised Democratic debates get started, in October, this extensive and detailed platform, together with Clinton’s ability to master complex policy issues, should place her in a strong position. But for all the political good it’s done her so far, she could have spent her time quoting from the Book of Deuteronomy (or Thompson’s favorite, the Book of Revelation). In media coverage of the Clinton campaign, and particularly in broadcast coverage, the e-mail story has overshadowed everything else, and it isn’t going away.","2957","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"On Monday, the Times reported that an intelligence review has concluded that some of the information Clinton received at her personal account was “top secret,” although it wasn’t marked classified at the time. In all probability, there will be more such stories. Indeed, as Labor Day approached, Clinton appeared to be trapped in the same kind of three-sided vice that, over the decades, has crushed many Washington figures. Simultaneously, she had to contend with an F.B.I. investigation into whether classified information was mishandled; a hostile Congressional committee under the control of the opposition party; and a media eager to report any damaging leaks from the authorities. Small wonder that Vice-President Joe Biden was seriously considering a late entry into the Democratic race.","2958","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"All this, and there are still five months until the first primary voter casts a ballot. Before crowning Trump or burying Clinton, it is worth keeping this reality in mind—and a few others, too, such as the fact that early leads in primary races often prove ephemeral. It is certainly possible that Trump will go ahead and win the Republican nomination, but as Larry Sabato and his colleagues at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics said of Trump, in a post at Politico on Monday, “It’s far more likely he will fade long before the primary season does.” Only now is he being subjected to sustained attacks from other Republicans, and, as yet, the media scrutiny of his record has been cursory. For instance, we are still awaiting the first major investigative report into how many undocumented immigrants are employed at the hotels and golf courses that bear Trump’s name. While his bombast has served him well so far, he could yet overreact to criticism and self-destruct.","2959","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"On the Democratic side, Clinton remains highly popular inside her own party, and she has the support of important interest groups that help to mobilize Democratic voters. In the latest national poll of Democrats and voters who lean Democrat, which was released by Monmouth on Tuesday, she was leading Biden by twenty percentage points and Sanders by twenty-two percentage points. Among the electorate at large, Clinton’s favorable rating has fallen well below fifty per cent. But among the Democratic electorate, seventy-one per cent of voters have a favorable view of the former Secretary of State, and just seventeen per cent have an unfavorable view.","2960","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Seeking to solidify her position and change the post-Labor Day media narrative, Clinton on Tuesday apologized for setting up her own e-mail server, telling ABC News’s David Muir, “That was a mistake. I’m sorry about that. I take responsibility.” It remains to be seen what impact, if any, this statement will have on the polls, but many of Clinton’s supporters will welcome the interview as a step in the right direction. “As long as the email mess doesn’t sink her, Clinton could lose both heavily white Iowa and New Hampshire, and still have a fairly unobstructed path to the nomination because of her mighty position with women and minorities,” Sabato and his colleagues wrote on Politico. “This is true even if Vice President Joe Biden enters the race.”","2961","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"I’m not sure whether that final assertion takes account of the possibility of Biden jumping into the race with Elizabeth Warren as his running mate. Last week, a Boston Globe reporter asked Warren whether she and Biden had discussed this possibility during a recent meeting at the Vice-President’s residence. Rather than giving a straight answer, Warren smiled and said merely that the conversation had been a long one.","2962","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"

"Yesterday, Jim Webb, who was running for the Democratic Presidential nomination, dropped out of the race, and suggested that he may run as a third-party candidate. In his announcement, he blasted the two parties and suggested that the real political force in America is independents. “Our political candidates are being pulled to the extremes,” he said, at the National Press Club in Washington. “They are increasingly out of step with the people they are supposed to serve. Poll after poll shows that a strong plurality of Americans is neither Republican nor Democrat. Overwhelmingly they’re independents. Americans don’t like the extremes to which both parties have moved in recent years, and I don’t blame them.”","October 21, 2015","2965","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"Today, Joe Biden announced that he would forgo a Presidential run, and he made a similar case that America is being damaged by excessive partisanship. “I believe that we have to end the divisive partisan politics that is ripping this country apart,” Biden said, in remarks in the Rose Garden. “And I think we can. It’s mean-spirited, it’s petty, and it’s gone on for much too long. I don’t believe, like some do, that it’s naïve to talk to Republicans. I don’t think we should look at Republicans as our enemies. They are our opposition. They’re not our enemies. And for the sake of the country, we have to work together. As the President has said many times, compromise is not a dirty word. But look at it this way, folks: How does this country function without consensus? How can we move forward without being able to arrive at consensus? Four more years of this kind of pitched battle may be more than this country can take. We have to change it. We have to change it.”","2966","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"Finally, over in the House, as the majority party struggles to find a new Speaker, Congressman Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, floated the intriguing idea of putting together a “bipartisan coalition” to elect the next leader. He called it “basic math”: if Republicans don’t have two hundred and eighteen votes for a Speaker, they will need to nominate a candidate that can win some votes from Democrats. If Paul Ryan, who laid out several conditions in order for him to formally enter the race for Speaker, decides against running—or if he is defeated—then perhaps Dent’s idea will gain currency. For now, it seems as dead as Biden and Webb’s candidacies.","2967","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"The dilemmas faced by Webb, Biden, and Dent were different in many ways, but common to all three is a familiar structural fact of American politics that is making centrist politics seem increasingly out of reach and anachronistic. In 1950, the American Political Science Association published a major report on the state of America’s two-party system. The authors worried that the public had little idea what to expect when they voted for a Democrat or a Republican, because each party was a mish-mash of interests with little ideological consistency. What was needed in American politics were parties with more “internal cohesion,” so that when one party was in control the average voter would understand generally where it stood on the major issues. In addition, the party out of power needed to present sharp differences. The report said, “The fundamental requirement of accountability is a two-party system in which the opposition party acts as the critic of the party in power, developing, defining, and presenting the policy alternatives which are necessary for a true choice in reaching public decisions.”","2968","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"The report had many recommendations about improving politics in America, but the basic headline was one that seems amusing today: America wasn’t polarized enough. Starting in the seventies, that all began to change. This graph from the Pew Research Center documents how the two parties, which were once both coalitions of liberals and conservatives, gradually began to pull apart until they were perfectly sorted: all liberals are now in the Democratic Party and all conservatives are now in the Republican Party. There is no longer any middle.","2969","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"This great hollowing out of the political center helps to explain the week’s events. Webb’s analysis about independents being the greatest bloc of votes in America is wrong. Most self-described independents act like partisan Democrats or Republicans, but they simply don’t like to use the party labels. Webb will have no more success running as a third-party candidate than he did running as a Democrat.","2970","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"Biden’s dilemma is that he seemed to want to be the nominee of his party without having to do the necessary work of wooing the partisans that dominate the process. In his speech, he indirectly criticized Hillary Clinton, who recently joked that Republicans are her enemy. It’s a fair criticism, but Clinton will likely be the nominee of her party because she has been doing the gruelling work of putting together the coalition of partisans who will decide the Democratic primary.","2971","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"Over in the House, Dent’s proposal for a bipartisan Speaker has little chance of success, for similar reasons.

"Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, is an unusual politician. When he speaks, he often sounds as though he has just graduated from college with double honors in clichés and platitudes. “I share a sense of optimism for America’s future,” he said in his first answer during Wednesday night’s G.O.P. debate, in Boulder, Colorado. He continued, “Our greatest days lie ahead.” Later, in his closing statement, Rubio said, “We can’t just save the American dream—we can expand it.” I waited for him to talk about “a shining city upon a hill,” but he didn’t get around to it. At the next debate, he probably will.","October 29, 2015","2974","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"But Rubio isn’t just a youthful purveyor of upbeat bromides and echoes of Ronald Reagan. If he were, Jeb Bush would have less to worry about, and so would Hillary Clinton. Beneath his bland exterior lurks a shrewd and feline political operator, with an instinctive sense of balance and a set of claws capable of drawing blood.","2975","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Early on in the debate, Jeb Bush, the benighted ex-front-runner, sought to score some points off of Rubio by criticizing him for his poor attendance record in the U.S. Senate. “Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work,” Bush said, busting in on an interchange between Rubio and Carl Quintanilla, one of the CNBC moderators, about an editorial in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that accused Rubio of ripping off the voters who elected him in 2010. “I mean, literally, the Senate—what is it, like a French work week?” Bush went on. “You get, like, three days where you have to show up? You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.”","2976","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Rubio was prepared. He’d already demonstrated that fact by seeking to turn Quintanilla’s question into an attack on the media, a tactic that many Republicans adopt when they’re under fire, because it often works for them. First, Rubio pointed out that one of his Democratic predecessors, Bob Graham, missed more than thirty per cent of his votes in the Senate, in 2004, when he ran for President. Then he said that John Kerry and Barack Obama—two more senators who ran for the White House—missed even more votes than Graham did. “So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement,” Rubio said.","2977","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"That response earned him loud cheers from the crowd. Bush waded in with his admonishments anyway. When the former Florida governor had finished, Rubio said, “I get to respond, right?” Becky Quick, another of the moderators, told him he had thirty seconds. “Well, it’s interesting,” Rubio began. “Over the last few weeks, I’ve listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you’re modelling your campaign after John McCain, that you’re going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport. You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you’re now modelling after?”","2978","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Rather than answering the question, or doing something else to knock Rubio off balance, Bush said that McCain wasn’t his senator. “Well, let me tell you,” Rubio said. “I don’t remember you ever complaining about John McCain’s vote record. The only reason why you’re doing it now is because we’re running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.” Bush mumbled something, but the applause for Rubio virtually drowned him out. “Here’s the bottom line,” Rubio went on. “My campaign is going to be about the future of America; it’s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage. I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush. I’m not running against Governor Bush. I’m not running against anyone on this stage. I’m running for President because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.”","2979","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"I wrote all of this down at length because it was what the political pros call “a moment”—something that lasts for more than one news cycle and helps define the event in the public consciousness—which is what all of the debaters are seeking. In attacking his fellow-Floridian, Bush was clearly looking for a moment to change the narrative of his sagging campaign. But because Rubio was sharper and better prepared—he had clearly come with the McCain answer in his pocket, in case Bush attacked him—the moment turned out to be his.","2980","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"In fact, it may have been more than “a” moment. If you believe some of the commentators who were waxing lyrical about Rubio’s performance after the debate, it was “the” moment in which he publicly confirmed that he has displaced Bush as the regular politician most likely to be the Republican nominee. The Fix, one of the Washington Post’s political blogs, ran a piece headlined “How Marco Rubio owned Jeb Bush in Wednesday’s GOP debate.” At The New Republic, Brian Beutler suggested that Bush should do himself and the G.O.P. a favor by dropping out of the race.","2981","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"That’s laying it on thick. Bush kept his cool, and his campaign is right when it says that this contest is a marathon. But when your best-received line is “I’m seven-and-oh in my fantasy-football league,” in response to a question about whether fantasy sports is gambling, the night can only be classified as another disappointment. Rubio, on the other hand, went on to deliver several more zingers. In a debate in which most of the candidates seemed at least as intent on attacking the media as the Democrats, he also managed to link together the G.O.P.’s two main demons.","2982","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Picking up on a comment from Donald Trump about super PACs, Rubio said, “The Democrats have the ultimate super PAC. It is called the mainstream media.” With that, he went into a little spiel about the favorable coverage that Hillary Clinton’s appearance before the Benghazi committee received, claiming, “It was the week she got exposed as a liar”—a reference to public statements Clinton made linking the attack on U.S. installations in Libya with an anti-Muslim video. “But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.” Given the well-known antagonism between the Clinton campaign and parts of the mainstream media, including the New York Times, this was an outrageous charge, but it was one that will play well on conservative talk shows.","2983","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Another candidate who got in some radio-ready sound bites was Ted Cruz. The forty-four-year-old Texas senator received the biggest cheer of the night for a rant about the (mostly perfectly reasonable and often commendably specific) questions that the CNBC moderators were asking. “The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate. That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks,” he said. Right now, Cruz is not a major threat to Rubio, but on the basis of this debate he could eventually become one.","2984","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"The two men who are currently leading in the polls—Donald Trump and Ben Carson—both had relatively quiet nights. In the case of Carson, who has dismissed the debates as boxing matches, that may not have been a bad thing. As always, he kept calm. He parried a couple of policy questions, denied that he is a homophobe, criticized political correctness, and delivered a couple of uplifting passages about American values. Luckily for him, nobody asked him to explain his statements connecting gun control with the Holocaust. Even if someone had, it might not have made much difference. Whatever is driving Carson’s rise, it isn’t dynamism on the debating stage.","2985","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Trump disappeared for long stretches, as he did in the second debate. At one point, after he was asked how he would cut taxes by ten trillion dollars without raising the deficit, he looked lost. But he has looked lost before, and it hasn’t done him much harm. Having apparently made a strategic decision not to criticize Carson, who has passed him in one national poll, he saved his venom for John Kasich, who had the temerity to question the practicality of Trump’s desire to deport eleven million undocumented immigrants. “This was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes,” Trump told the audience. (Actually, as Kasich pointed out, although he did work for Lehman, he wasn’t a partner.)","2986","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"

"Senator Ted Cruz and two dozen Republican congressmen, led by Representative Louie Gohmert, have a problem with Margaret Sanger’s head. Sanger, who helped found the American Birth Control League, the organization that became Planned Parenthood, is represented in the National Portrait Gallery, one of the Smithsonian museums, by a bronze bust. It is currently part of an exhibition called “The Struggle for Justice,” which records, through the faces of those involved, this country’s slow movement toward civil rights. Earlier this month, the legislators sent a letter to the museum which describes Sanger as a racist who was bent on carrying out a genocide, the “extermination” of black Americans—a charge for which, as at least some of them surely know, there is no sound historical basis—and said that her bust should “not be displayed in or on any Smithsonian operated property.” Gohmert, in a press release that accompanied the letter, went further, saying that the bust should be “removed” from the collection. Apparently, Sanger’s face is too much to tolerate within federally funded walls, even in a back room.","October 28, 2015","2989","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-vs-margaret-sangers-portrait"
"“It happens during election cycles,” Kim Sajet, the director of the National Portrait Gallery, told me by phone, referring to complaints about Sanger, though she said it does not usually come in the form of a letter from congressional leaders. Last week, Sajet wrote back to the Republicans, stating that the museum would keep Sanger, on the ground that excluding her “would deny the public and future generations insight on an important chapter in American history.” Sajet is waiting to see what comes next from Cruz and Gohmert. The museum has private funders but gets a good part of its budget from Congress, and so it has certain vulnerabilities. But Sajet said that she saw no way for the museum to be what it was meant to be and accede to such requests. “There’s no moral test to be in the National Portrait Gallery,” she said. “If we did that, there’d be nobody on the walls.”","2990","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-vs-margaret-sangers-portrait"
"Indeed, although the bust of Sanger may look like something in a Hall of Fame, that’s not the idea of the National Portrait Gallery. It’s not a pantheon or shrine. It’s a place to take a look at the faces of the defining characters in the nation’s history. For example, there are portraits not only of Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth but of Laura Keene, the actress who starred in “Our American Cousin,” the play that Lincoln was watching when Booth shot him; Keene was a highly regarded performer, and a good reason for Lincoln to get out of the White House that night. (Some of his blood ended up on her costume.) The Founding Fathers are there, but so is Samuel Seabury, the clergyman who admonished New Yorkers just to listen to the King. Benedict Arnold, the traitor, and Roger Taney, who wrote the Dred Scott decision, are in the collection. Sanger has been accused of being a eugenicist in the mode of Josef Mengele, but the presence of Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh, who were actually deeply compromised by their anti-Semitism and ties to Nazism, has not attracted the same complaints. Nor should it: this is not a beauty pageant but a dramatis personae—at times very dramatic. There’s Josephine Baker and Michael Jackson, Nikola Tesla and Bill Gates, Generals Patton and Schwarzkopf, the boxer Jack Johnson (known as the Galveston Giant) and George Steinbrenner. There are dozens of slaveholders. Presidents get in automatically.","2991","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-vs-margaret-sangers-portrait"
"That’s the easy explanation, anyway—to not exactly defend Sanger but to note that, if Al Capone (also in the collection) is O.K., then she should be, too. It’s also an answer that Kim Sajet finds unsatisfying and even frustrating. “There are bad guys; we know what they’ve done,” Sajet said. “Margaret Sanger is being demonized for a lot of things she didn’t do.” She was “not perfect,” Sajet pointed out, but nor was she a “eugenicist leader.” (As Jill Lepore, writing in The New Yorker, explained, “At one point, the American Birth Control League discussed a merger with the American Eugenics Society. But Sanger was a socialist, which often put her at odds with the eugenicists, and with her own organization.” Lepore also quotes Martin Luther King, Jr.,’s assessment that “there is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger’s early efforts.”) Sanger solicited money for her cause from eugenicists. She also worried about overpopulation, and some of what she had to say about that is unattractive, such as when she suggested that it would be better if poor families had fewer children, and “imbeciles” none at all. But she did not, despite frequent Republican charges to the contrary—from Ben Carson, among others—found the fore-runner of Planned Parenthood in order to prevent black children from being born. An earlier era’s complaint about Planned Parenthood was that it didn’t put enough clinics in black neighborhoods or work hard enough to provide service to those communities. In 1939, Sanger wrote a letter to a colleague stressing the importance of working with black ministers in the South to counter what she makes clear would be false theories about what the group was doing: “We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.” The first part of this sentence, without the phrases that make her meaning clear, is what is Cruz, Gohmert, and their cohort quoted as proof that Sanger’s mission was one of “extermination,” in a way that can only be called false. (There have been objections from the left, too, to words like “rebellious”; at the same time, Sanger fought with her own organization over her belief that it should hire more black public-health professionals, rather than relying on white experts.) Sajet said that she is regularly sent fabricated quotes that purport to prove that Sanger was a genocidaire or a Nazi, and even pictures in which Sanger’s image is crudely Photoshopped into Ku Klux Klan scenes. But real history has nuances and ambiguities enough—Sanger’s certainly does—without resorting to fakes.","2992","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-vs-margaret-sangers-portrait"
"Sanger’s views have been represented, and misrepresented, by Republicans as evidence that minorities should be wary of not only Planned Parenthood but of the Democratic Party. But, in the mid-twentieth century, Republicans, and members of what might be called the G.O.P. establishment, were often aligned with Planned Parenthood and its predecessor. (And Sanger was occasionally at odds with the organization, which had aspired toward gentility: Lepore writes that, in 1928, “Sanger was forced to resign as the league’s president; its members objected to her feminism.”) In 1972, when the National Portrait Gallery was seeking an image of Sanger, and someone to pay for it, her son, Grant, wrote to the institution about “a great admirer of my mother’s”: Cordelia Scaife May, who made the donation. May’s brother, Richard Mellon Scaife, has been a prominent funder of conservative causes, and May herself gave money to anti-immigration groups. (Also, to birds.) May was also wrapped up in a political-corruption scandal involving her second husband, Robert Duggan, an Allegheny County district attorney, who was found dead of a shotgun wound, in 1974, shortly before he was expected to be indicted. “Although his death was ruled a suicide, questions surrounded the circumstances, and his family, including Mrs. May, maintained he had been murdered,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette noted in an obituary after May’s death, in 2005. American stories can get complicated, which is precisely the National Portrait Gallery’s point.","2993","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-vs-margaret-sangers-portrait"
"At the moment, there is yet another a political fight going on over abortion rights, and that is really what the Sanger controversy is about. A certain tentativeness has crept in even among Planned Parenthood’s supporters in the face of the recent onslaught against the group, which has included the production of an undercover sting video that accuses it (with no basis) of illegal organ trafficking. At the Republican Presidential debates, there seems to be a competition among candidates as to who can do more to defund and prosecute the group; one can expect more of that at Wednesday night’s debate, in Boulder. People who incline to be pro-choice seem, at times, to be searching for what might be called a rhetorical Al Capone option—defending while also distancing—a way to say that Planned Parenthood, and the clinics that serve poor women, should remain open, without sounding too happy about the enterprise. Protecting the group’s work may take more than that. Last week, Texas state health investigators ordered Planned Parenthood affiliates to turn over patient records for women who’d had abortions and chosen to donate the fetal tissue for medical research. Both of those things are legal, but the investigators, the Times reported, were asking for “a complete copy of certain patients’ records, including doctors’ orders, nursing notes and lab tests, as well as the center’s appointment books, patient sign-in sheets and contracts.” These are records that women would expect to be confidential; if they are handed over, the women might have to worry about investigators showing up at their doors. The point seems to be less about imposing health standards than imposing ideas about shame. Apparently, there are some places where a woman isn’t supposed to show her face.","2994","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-vs-margaret-sangers-portrait"
"It’s hard not to feel some sympathy for John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, who on Friday announced his resignation from Congress, effective at the end of October. Some. You wouldn’t wish the job of leading hundreds of G.O.P. congressmen and congresswomen, many of them hailing from the Tea Party/foaming-at-the-mouth wing of the Republican movement, on your worst enemy.","September 25, 2015","2995","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"Moreover, unlike, say, Donald Trump, Boehner didn’t have a rich daddy who set him up on easy street. His parents didn’t attend college. The second of twelve children, he grew up in a modest two-bedroom house in Cincinnati. (He and his siblings took the bedrooms; his parents slept on a sofa bed.) From a young age, he helped out in the family’s bar, Andy’s Café, which his grandfather founded, in 1938, and his father ran for forty-five years. After being discharged from the United States Navy with a bad back, Boehner took seven years to work his way through Xavier University, getting a bachelor’s degree in business administration. With his cigarettes, his perma-tan, his French cuffs, and his Midwestern good manners (on Friday, President Obama called him a “good man” who had always treated him courteously), Boehner often seemed like a politician from another time.","2996","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"To be sure, Boehner milked his modest background for political purposes. In 2010, shortly after being voted Speaker-elect, he invited “60 Minutes” to film a family reunion at Andy’s, which remained in the family until 2006. And why not? In a country that seldom lives up to its reputation as a place of equal opportunity, Boehner was that rare thing: a self-made man who rose to the top.","2997","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"And, boy, did he pay for it. From the moment he took over as Speaker, in January, 2011, many members of the Republican Party made his life difficult. Despite his rightist credentials—he first attracted attention as a supporter of Newt Gingrich during the early nineteen-nineties—Boehner wasn’t considered part of “the conservative movement,” which claimed responsibility for overturning the Democrats’ majority in the House in 2010. He had been around Capitol Hill too long, and, worse, he had a record of occasionally coöperating with Democrats, such as Ted Kennedy, with whom he cosponsored the No Child Left Behind Act, of 2001.","2998","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"Not that he was a liberal, or even a liberal Republican. A staunchly pro-life Roman Catholic, he had a zero per cent rating from NARAL, the abortion-rights group; an A rating from the N.R.A. on gun issues; a rating of zero per cent on energy issues from the Campaign for America’s Future, a progressive group; a rating of seven per cent from the A.C.L.U. on civil-rights issues; and a rating of a hundred per cent from the United States Chamber of Commerce. He wanted to cut taxes, reduce the size of government, and repeal Obamacare. But, in today’s Republican Party, none of this was enough to prevent accusations that he was a RINO—Republican In Name Only.","2999","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"Following the rise of Tea Party-backed candidates in the 2010 midterms, many Republicans wanted all-out war with the Obama Administration. Boehner found himself playing the role of Count Mirabeau, or, perhaps, Alexander Kerensky, a reformer rapidly outflanked by genuine revolutionaries. On a range of issues, from public spending to the debt limit to Obamacare, the ultras wanted to shut down the federal government. Boehner, well aware that Congress was already highly unpopular, resisted.","3000","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"In April, 2011, he reached a budget deal with the White House that averted a shutdown. In 2013, however, he was unable, or unwilling, to stymy an effort to defund the Affordable Care Act, which a coalition of conservative activists was pushing. The partial shutdown, which began in October, lasted sixteen days, and, sure enough, Congress’s approval ratings fell into single digits. A couple of months later, when conservative groups started causing more trouble, once again over the budget, Boehner finally lashed out publicly, calling them “ridiculous” and saying, “They pushed us into this fight to defund Obamacare and to shut down the government. Most of you know, my members know, that wasn’t exactly the strategy that I had in mind.”","3001","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"Boehner soldiered on, easily winning reëlection as Speaker in January of this year. But, as his sixty-sixth birthday approached, he was facing yet another conservative push for a shutdown, this time over the funding of Planned Parenthood. Some Republican representatives were also agitating for another effort to overthrow him. This time, evidently, Boehner didn’t have the stomach for another fight.","3002","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"He waited to oversee the Pope’s address to a joint session of Congress, which had taken place at his invitation, and during which he wiped tears from his eyes. (That wasn’t the first time he had cried in public. Following his tearful “60 Minutes” appearance, he earned the nickname “Weeper of the House.”) On Friday morning, he told his colleagues that, on October 30th, he would resign as both Speaker and as congressman. According to the Times, he blamed the ultra-conservative members of his caucus, whom he accused of being unwilling to govern.","3003","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"Boehner’s resignation makes a shutdown less likely: freed of the obligation to pander to the right, he and his colleagues in the G.O.P. leadership will probably push through a funding bill with Democratic support next week. But the larger question of where the party is headed remains open. The early favorite to succeed Boehner is Kevin McCarthy, a Californian Republican who is currently the House majority leader. Although some conservatives regard McCarthy with suspicion, they also see him as someone who is more willing than Boehner to take account of their views.","3004","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"Whoever becomes the next Speaker will have no choice but to deal with the zealots, a task that often drove Boehner to seek assistance from a higher authority. “I pray from the moment I wake up. I may pray all day long,” he told NBC’s Brian Williams in 2011. At a press conference on Friday afternoon, he told reporters that he had said his prayers in the morning, as usual, “And I said, ‘Today I’m going to do this,’ and that was that.” Who could blame him?","3005","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"
"Just before Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, took the stage at last week’s Conservative Clean Energy Summit, the event’s three hundred or so attendees were on their feet, pressing their hands to their hearts. They had sung along to a medley of anthems—“The Star-Spangled Banner,” “God Bless America,” “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” the country-music chart-topper “Proud to Be an American”—as the conference room at the Capitol Hill Hyatt Regency was bathed in a splashy light show of stars and stripes. “It’s a privilege for me to be with people who believe that Jesus Christ is their personal savior and who are politically conservative,” Grassley said, “And it’s a privilege to get to speak to you about the virtues of a strong energy policy.” That rhetorical jump might have sounded abrupt to a passerby, but to the crowd it made perfect sense.","October 29, 2015","3006","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"The summit was organized and hosted by Michele Combs, who heads up the group Young Conservatives for Energy Reform (Y.C.E.R.), and her mother, Roberta Combs, the president and C.E.O. of the Christian Coalition of America. Whereas Roberta has been a major player in the anti-abortion movement and has lobbied for the appointment of conservative Supreme Court justices, Michele is staking her career on a notably different cause. “Clean energy is not a Democrat issue. It’s a family issue,” she told me. “It’s about freedom and health and jobs and conserving our environment. It brings everybody together. Al Gore and I go way back—he’s a good friend—but he’s polarizing. He can’t get this message to our constituency.” The summit was part of an ongoing effort to move the issues of climate change and clean energy from the margins of the Republican Party to its mainstream. Although the Combses scarcely spoke at the event, they chose others to make their case—the executive of a solar-power company, a three-star and a four-star general, two congressman, and six U.S. senators.","3007","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"Most of the summit’s audience appeared to range in age from eighteen to forty-five. Students and professionals had been flown and bussed in from around the country; there were representatives of the Christian Coalition, the Young Republican National Federation, and the thirty-one state chapters of Y.C.E.R. The stated goal of the event was simply to educate, but given how much collective political heat the speakers were packing it seemed clear that bigger questions were at play—questions about the future of a fractured G.O.P. “It is now time for the conservative cause to embrace energy reform and a clean environment,” Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said via video link from the Presidential campaign trail. “Let’s not turn this over to the most liberal people in the country.” Clean energy, he added, is “the cause of a lifetime.”","3008","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"There was an impressive amount of Republican self-critique among some of the speakers. Grassley, for instance, called out his colleagues for favoring fossil fuels over alternative energy. “You are going to find people in this town who say they are for ‘all of the above’ energy, but they’re really for none of the above and all of the below,” he said, underscoring his support for aboveground wind and solar resources. He and other speakers acknowledged that, from a consumer standpoint, belowground energy sources—oil and natural gas, in particular—are cheaper and more accessible now than they have been in years. Even more notable, however, are the trends in the renewable-energy marketplace: fossil-fuel prices fluctuate, but the costs associated with solar and wind power have been declining and will likely continue to fall. Indeed, nearly every speech was crammed with feel-good economic statistics: solar has become eighty per cent cheaper in the past five years; the U.S. clean-energy sector grew fourteen per cent in 2014, about five times as much as the rest of the economy. Senator Richard Burr, of North Carolina, cut to the chase. “Let me sum it up in one word: jobs,” he said.","3009","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"Many of the speakers dodged both the issue of climate change and the pervasive conservative argument that fighting it will destroy, not create, jobs. Some of the most visible Republicans on the national stage, including the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and several Presidential contenders—Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Marco Rubio—have made this argument before. (Trump, in a tweet, deemed climate science “bullshit.”) Rather than uttering the dreaded phrase, Senator John McCain, a former champion of climate legislation, spoke to the summit crowd about national security. Jeremy Symons, the director of climate and political affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund, advocated a big-tent approach. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re motivated by American energy independence, or by the promise of a clean-energy economy, or by breaking the power of monopolies over our home-energy choices, or by cleaner air, or by climate change,” he said. “What’s important is that you’re here.”","3010","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"The long-term goal of Y.C.E.R., Michele Combs told me, is to help get “a comprehensive energy-reform bill” passed in the Senate soon after the next administration takes office—a bill that could also, in effect, break the congressional climate-legislation stalemate. No major Republican-backed climate or energy legislation has been proposed in the Senate since a cap-and-trade bill that Graham supported failed, back in 2010. (The Combses helped persuade Graham to take a leadership role on that bill, and they threw the support of the Christian Coalition behind it.) “We’re building grassroots to provide cover—to keep senators politically safe when they support energy reform,” Combs said. “First, we’re establishing common ground and a new terminology. Terms like ‘energy reform’ will bring a lot more conservatives to the table than ‘climate change.’ ”","3011","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"If national polls are any indication, this is the time. A recent study from the University of Texas at Austin showed that fifty-nine per cent of Republican voters now accept climate science, up from forty-seven per cent just six months ago. A separate study from the University of Michigan showed similar results: fifty-six per cent of Republican respondents said that they believe global warming is a real and immediate concern, up from forty-seven per cent a year ago. The shift may have been driven, at least in part, by growing concerns about extreme weather phenomena—the withering drought in California, for example. “It’s getting harder to ignore nature,” Keith den Hollander, the thirty-eight-year-old chairman of the Christian Coalition of Michigan, told me. “Do I think that our climate’s changing? Yeah, I do. I mean, I’ve seen more severe winters than in the past, definitely some strange weather patterns.”","3012","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"It’s too early to know what measures a comprehensive, Republican-backed energy-reform bill might contain—and whether they would satisfy Democrats. Partisan conflict on this issue continues to smolder. Right now, twenty-six states are suing President Obama for his recent effort to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions under the Clean Air Act. But a growing number of conservative congressional leaders are trying to stake a claim on the climate issue. Yesterday, Graham and a group of his colleagues—Kelly Ayotte, of New Hampshire; Mark Kirk, of Illinois; and Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee—announced the formation of a Senate Energy and Environmental Working Group. Last month, eleven Republicans in the House introduced a resolution to address “the causes and effects of climate change.” It’s progress, albeit slow.","3013","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"But is there time to wait for Republican leaders to inch their way toward climate legislation? A critical environmentalist might argue that an event like the Conservative Clean Energy Summit can’t establish a framework for carbon-emission reductions that are big enough and fast enough to keep warming below two degrees Celsius and stave off the worst impacts of climate change. Roberta Combs counters that such impatience inevitably backfires. “The liberals want to do it all at once—they want to solve this issue in one fell swoop,” she said. “That’s why they can’t get anything done. In reality, it has to be bit by bit. You have to bite the elephant one piece at a time, because it’s too big to swallow whole.”","3014","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-conservatives-finally-embrace-clean-energy"
"There was a moment early on during Thursday’s long-awaited Benghazi hearing when Hillary Clinton looked a bit uncomfortable. It came when the Republican congressman Peter Roskam, of Illinois, was asking the former Secretary of State about the debates that took place inside the Obama Administration in early 2011 about intervening in Libya, where Muammar Qaddafi was struggling to fight off an uprising.","October 22, 2015","3015","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Referring to internal memos and communications that have emerged from the countless inquiries into the September, 2012, deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans at U.S. installations in Benghazi, Roskam pointed out that a number of senior officials in the State Department were skeptical about the U.S. getting involved in Libya, as were Vice-President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. “You persuaded President Obama to intervene militarily,” Roskam said to Clinton. “Isn’t that right?”","3016","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"In her response, Clinton conceded that “there were concerns,” and that the decision had sparked vigorous internal discussion. But, she said, “at the end of the day, this was the President’s decision.” Ultimately, she explained, she’d recommended, based largely on “unprecedented requests” from America’s European allies and the Arab League, that the U.S. assist the Libyan rebels, and President Obama had made the call to carry this out, in a limited way.","3017","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Politely but firmly, Roskam said, “I think you are underselling yourself.” In the course of another exchange, he twice repeated his claim that the Libyan intervention was very much Clinton’s creation, ultimately arguing that she was the one who had overcome opposition within the State Department, won over the President, helped get the support of the Arab League, and led the fight to obtain the backing of the United Nations. “You saw it, you drove it, you articulated it, and you persuaded people,” Roskam said. “Did I get that wrong?”","3018","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Clinton couldn’t easily tell the congressman that he was mistaken, given that members of her own staff have portrayed her as an architect of the Libyan policy. Instead, she sought, as she often has in the past, to defend the intervention, pointing to the savagery of Qaddafi’s regime and the limited but decisive role played by the U.S. military.","3019","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Roskam interrupted her, affecting the look of a man who had just been asked to recall a recent root canal. With his time for questioning winding down, he described the current situation in Libya as “a disaster.” Clinton, doing her best to maintain a smile, said, “That’s not a view I will ascribe to.”","3020","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"As the hearing went on (and on, and on), this exchange was lost amid the endless back and forth about security arrangements in Benghazi, the conduct of the committee’s investigation, and, most ludicrously of all, some e-mails sent to Clinton by Sidney Blumenthal, a former political journalist who once worked at this magazine. By the time the hearing broke for lunch, with the Republicans and Democrats on the committee squabbling about whether to release transcripts of a closed-door interview that the panel conducted with Blumenthal in June, it was clear that Clinton was going to emerge largely unscathed. Trey Gowdy and his colleagues on the Select Committee had turned up nothing new—nada—that linked the former Secretary of State to the lax consular-security arrangements identified in previous reports, including one issued in 2012 by the State Department’s own Accountability Review Board.","3021","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"That was confirmed during the afternoon session, as the Republican questioners went over the same ground repeatedly. At one of the many low points, Roskam undermined his earlier points with a blatantly political attack, accusing Clinton of trying to spin Qaddafi’s overthrow to her own advantage and accusing her—shock, horror—of taking a “victory lap” on the Sunday talk shows.","3022","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Of course, none of this had anything to do with what happened in Benghazi. But, in the earlier jousting between Roskam and Clinton about the wisdom of intervening in Libya in the first place, it was possible to glimpse an alternative path that congressional Republicans could have taken over the past three years—a path that might have saved them from being accused (including by members of their own party) of conducting a witch hunt, and might even have served a public purpose. For while the former Secretary of State was perfectly right in saying that the U.S. goal of overthrowing a cruel dictatorship and promoting democracy was a noble one, and that the Obama Administration, in sending U.S. warplanes, was answering international calls for help, the current reality in Libya calls into question U.S. policy decisions. The country is a divided, chaotic, and war-torn place, where rival militias are competing for power and jihadist groups, including the Islamic State, control substantial pieces of territory.","3023","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Did Clinton and those of her colleagues who supported the 2011 intervention foresee any of this happening? What steps did they take to try and insure that Libya wouldn’t disintegrate after Qaddafi was gone? (Just this week, former Secretary of Defense Gates, who was opposed to the intervention, told the Daily Beast, “We were playing it by ear.”) How seriously did U.S. policymakers take the precedent of Iraq, where the United States and its allies overthrew another secular dictator with disastrous results? What lessons should we take from what has happened in Libya?","3024","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"These are all legitimate questions, and an old-school Republican authority on foreign policy—someone like Richard Lugar—would surely have been keen to gather answers to them. Even an old-school G.O.P. isolationist like Jesse Helms would probably have held hearings and inveighed against U.S. interventionism. In this case, though, pursuing such a strategy would have involved concentrating on the larger issues, and conceding that some Republicans, including senators John McCain and Mitch McConnell, supported U.S. action to help the Libyan rebels. It would also have meant dropping the Benghazi investigation once it became clear that there wasn’t any evidence tying Clinton directly to security failures.","3025","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"

I want to send a message to moderators of upcoming debates that any bias won’t be tolerated.” Rand Paul, who was once the darling of the mainstream media and celebrated as a top-tier Republican candidate, but who has been a non-entity in the Presidential campaign, used the anti-CNBC backlash to raise money. He changed his Twitter avatar to a picture of the senator with a black rectangle over his mouth and the word CENSORED across it. “Fight back against the media bias” was superimposed on the new photo.","October 29, 2015","3048","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/yes-marco-rubios-finances-are-a-big-deal"
"Whining about tough questions and media bias is an old campaign tactic. On both the right and the left, there are now well-funded institutions that do nothing but scour the Internet, TV, and radio for perceived slights from the press.

The Times also reported that “Rubio billed the party for more than $100,000 during the two years he served as the state’s House speaker,” and that “charges included repairs to the family minivan, grocery bills, plane tickets for his wife, and purchases from retailers ranging from a wine store near his home to Apple’s online store.” (Rubio said that the expenses were all related to party business.)","3057","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/yes-marco-rubios-finances-are-a-big-deal"

"The contrast couldn’t have been more stark. On Friday, as Hillary Clinton was basking in the reaction to her marathon appearance before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, her communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, told reporters that the hour between nine and ten o’clock on Thursday night, after the hearing finally finished, was the campaign’s best fund-raising hour yet. And also on Friday, A.F.S.C.M.E., the largest public-sector union in the country, announced that it was endorsing Clinton for the Presidency—an important win in her tussle with Senator Bernie Sanders for the backing of organized labor.","October 25, 2015","3059","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Meanwhile, the campaign of the supposed Republican front-runner, Jeb Bush, was letting it be known that it was laying off people and slashing its payroll by forty per cent. It’s well known that the Bush campaign has been spending heavily, and there have been persistent rumors that, with the candidate trailing badly in the polls, its fund-raising efforts had stalled. Evidently, these rumors were accurate. Seeking to put a positive spin on things, the Bush campaign portrayed the cost-cutting as an effort to play the long game and direct resources toward the early primary states—Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. “This is about winning the race,” a Bush adviser told Bloomberg Politics. “We’re doing it now and making the shifts with confidence. We expect to win.”","3060","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Campaign advisers have to make such statements. But many people in the G.O.P. are losing confidence in Bush. A new poll from Iowa, which was released on Thursday, showed the former Florida governor garnering just five per cent of the votes among likely Republican voters. Perhaps the poll, from Quinnipiac University, was an outlier? No, it wasn’t. On Friday, another Iowa survey, this one carried out by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics, also showed Bush at just five per cent. “By any honest analysis, the first ten months of this year have been a political disaster,” a senior Republican told the Times, adding that it was “an unbelievable position to be twisted into, from ‘shock and awe’ to ‘aw, shucks.’ ”","3061","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Why is the Republican pre-race favorite doing so much worse than the Democratic favorite?","3062","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The obvious answer is that Bush has had Donald Trump to deal with, and Clinton hasn’t. In virtually monopolizing media coverage and subjecting Bush to months of public criticism, the New York billionaire has transformed the dynamics of the G.O.P. race in a way that almost nobody anticipated—a point the managers of the Bush campaign acknowledged in an internal memo announcing the cost cuts. “We would be less than forthcoming if we said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer health care and partial-birth abortion would be leading the G.O.P. primary,” the memo said.","3063","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"With Bush’s campaign having been outpaced in such outrageous fashion, it is hard not to feel a little sympathy for him. However, his problems can’t be entirely attributed to the Donald. According to the Real Clear Politics poll average, he’s also running behind Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz, and nationwide he has the support of just 7.2 per cent of likely Republican voters. For a candidate whose main selling point was supposed to be his electability, these are terrible numbers. On the Democratic side, Clinton, even at the height of concerns about her e-mail server, maintained a healthy lead in the national polls.","3064","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"In part, Bush’s weak numbers reflect the fact he has run a weak campaign—one dogged by his tendency to mangle the English language, or, at least, to use it carelessly. In his first big speech, back in February, he confused Iran with Iraq and got mixed up about how many fighters the Islamic State has. Since then, the list of phrases he has been forced to clarify or disavow is long and embarrassing: “People need to work longer hours”; “I’m not sure we need half a billion dollars on women’s health-care issues”; “anchor babies”; “stuff happens.” On the basis of what we’ve seen so far, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Bush simply isn’t a good communicator. Indeed, he often appears to be a terrible one. Asked on Saturday whether his campaign’s cost-cutting showed it was in crisis, he said, “Blah, blah, blah. That’s my answer: blah, blah, blah.”","3065","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"If Bush were wowing the world with innovative and substantive policy proposals, his verbal shortcomings could perhaps be overlooked. But he isn’t. His tax-cutting economic plan, which he claims will increase G.D.P. growth to four per cent a year, is largely based on wishful thinking. His foreign-policy speeches are so vague that they’re hard to evaluate. On social issues, such as guns and abortion, he has said little to distinguish himself from the G.O.P. pack. In 2000, his brother George ran on the platform of “compassionate Conservatism,” which was his way of distinguishing himself from Newt Gingrich and other Republican bomb throwers. Jeb’s only memorable slogan is “Jeb!”","3066","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Clinton, on the other hand, has made it clear that she is running as a progressive candidate; in the first Democratic debate, she defined herself as “a progressive who believes in getting things done.” To back up this talk, she has rolled out a series of proposals, including paid sick leave, expanded child care for preschoolers, a higher minimum wage, tax breaks for firms that promote employee share ownership, and a series of measures designed to make college more affordable. None of the things she has proposed is particularly radical, but taken together they amount to a concerted effort to tackle wage stagnation and boost the middle class.","3067","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Bush has nothing comparable to offer. And, even if he improved as a communicator and Trump dropped out of the race, there would be no assurance that he would win the nomination. Indeed, it now appears possible that his entire campaign is based on two false premises.","3068","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The first is that Republican voters want a shift to the center. The one area where Bush has issued a proposal that separates him from other Republican candidates is immigration. To his credit, he has stuck to the position that law-abiding undocumented immigrants should be given the opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship. About all that has done is win him the enmity of conservative pundits and talk-show hosts, who accuse him of promoting an “amnesty.” On this issue, most Republican voters agree with Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Polls consistently show that a majority favor the mass deportation of undocumented aliens—an issue Trump has built his candidacy on.","3069","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The second shaky premise is the notion that Republicans are keen on restoring the Bush dynasty. From the beginning, this seemed like a dubious proposition: never in its history has America had three Presidents from the same family. When Jeb entered the race, G.O.P. supporters were being asked to embrace the possibility of three Bush Presidents in thirty years.","3070","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"In its eagerness to promote someone it considered electable, the G.O.P. establishment sought to play down the dynastic aspect of Bush’s candidacy, portraying Jeb as very different from his elder brother: more thoughtful, more conservative, more articulate. Despite these efforts, no groundswell of support emerged for a Bush restoration. Indeed, it now appears that Barbara Bush, Jeb’s mother, spoke for many Republicans when she said, in April, 2013, “There are other people out there that are very qualified, and we’ve had enough Bushes.”","3071","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The Clinton campaign raises dynastic issues of its own, but there are important differences. As evidenced by the Adams, the Harrisons, and the Roosevelts, the idea of having two Presidents from the same family isn’t alien to the American tradition (even though the Roosevelts were only fifth cousins). And, in serving as a U.S. senator and as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has established credentials independent of her husband’s time in office. At the same time, it’s also important to note that Bill Clinton’s Presidency is far more popular among Democrats than George W. Bush’s Presidency is among Republicans. Some left-leaning Democrats may regard Bill Clinton’s Administration as a neo-liberal sellout, but most associate it with peace, prosperity, and the ability to outlast Republican attacks.","3072","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Even among Republicans, the last Bush Presidency inspires few fond feelings. It ended with the economy in recession, and with the U.S. military trapped in two costly and unwinnable-seeming wars. For a time, Jeb and his establishment backers pretended they could sustain a 2016 campaign that ignored this toxic legacy, but, once Trump entered the race, the strategy proved unsustainable. In portraying the Iraq war as a disaster and repeatedly tying Jeb to his elder brother, Trump forced Republicans to confront the question of why anybody would think that putting another Bush in the White House was a good idea.","3073","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"There are still more than three months to go before the G.O.P. Iowa caucus, but, if Bush is going to reëmerge as the front-runner, he’ll have to do a much better job of answering Trump’s charges. He’ll get his first opportunity this week, at the Republican debate in Boulder, Colorado. When the pressure was on these past two weeks, at the first Democratic debate and then at the Benghazi hearing, Clinton rose to the occasion and gave her campaign a huge boost. Now it’s Bush’s turn. “Jeb really needs a knockout performance—it needs to be all him, with nobody even close,” a New Hampshire Republican told Politico. “Otherwise those fumes he’s on are going to evaporate even quicker.”","3074","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Since Tuesday night’s Democratic debate was held in a Las Vegas hotel, let’s start with the money question: Who won and who lost?","October 14, 2015","3075","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Undoubtedly, Hillary Clinton was the biggest winner, partly because she was playing for the highest stakes. She flew into Nevada as a wounded favorite, whose stumbling performance during the past six months, much of it provoked by the issue of her personal e-mail server, had left many Democrats wondering whether she could get it together in time to win a nomination that was supposed to have been hers for the taking, let alone to win the general election. If she had come across as tetchy and defensive, as she has so often this year, or if she had committed an embarrassing verbal gaffe, the pressure on her would have increased still further, and the chances of Vice-President Joe Biden entering the race would have gone up.","3076","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Instead, Clinton delivered a performance that no doubt reminded establishment Democrats why they had rallied behind her in the first place, and reminded Republicans why she could prove to be a most formidable opponent come November, 2016. Sharp, personable, and assured, she batted off an early question from the moderator, Anderson Cooper, about her flip-flops on various issues, breezed through most of the subsequent exchanges, and received a big assist from her closest rival, Bernie Sanders, who, in perhaps the most memorable moment of the evening, declared, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails…. Enough of the e-mails. Let’s talk about the real issues facing America.”","3077","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Those comments earned the Vermont senator a warm handshake from Clinton and the biggest cheer of the night from a Democratic audience that was all too willing to believe her claim that the Republicans’ pursuit of the e-mail matter is a political vendetta. Even Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who in August said that the Republicans had raised legitimate issues about the e-mails, backed off, saying that he, too, was delighted to be discussing other issues.","3078","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Clinton, of course, would have been more than happy to talk about issues all night. As it became clear that none of the other candidates was going to take her down, she turned her fire on the Republicans, portraying them as dangerous extremists and saying, “They don’t mind having big government to interfere with a woman’s right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood. They’re fine with big government when it comes to that. I’m sick of it.” That line earned Clinton her biggest cheers of the night.","3079","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"The horse race apart, it was a substantive debate, with the candidates going into a level of detail that was rarely broached in the first two Republican debates. (Of course, there were many more candidates on stage at those events.) The matters raised ran the gamut, covering gun control, Syria, climate change, Black Lives Matter, Wall Street regulation, college funding, and paid leave for workers. On many of these issues, Clinton, Sanders, and O’Malley showed themselves to be in general agreement about what was needed, but also, in some cases, divided on how to achieve their shared goals.","3080","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"That much we knew going in. Still, it was instructive to watch Sanders say, in response to a question from Cooper about whether he considers himself a capitalist, “Do I consider myself part of the casino-capitalist process, by which so few have so much and so many have so little, by which Wall Street’s greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don’t.” And it was equally instructive, moments later, when Clinton said, “Well, let me just follow up on that, Anderson, because, when I think about capitalism, I think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families.”","3081","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"On foreign policy, too, the differences between the two front-runners came through clearly, despite the respectful attitude they adopted toward each other. Defending the Obama Administration’s decision to provide military assistance to the Libyan rebels seeking to overthrow Muammar Qaddafi, Clinton described it as “smart power at its best.” Unlike Jim Webb, the former senator from Virginia, Sanders didn’t criticize the Libya decision, but he did express skepticism about U.S. military interventions generally, describing the Iraq invasion, which Clinton voted for, as “the worst foreign-policy blunder in the history of this country.” He also said that he opposed the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria, an idea that Clinton has supported.","3082","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"All in all, the seventy-four-year-old senator from Vermont gave a good account of himself. In one sense, indeed, he made history. Not since Eugene Debs has a self-avowed socialist made such an impression in a Presidential race, in terms of the language he has invoked, the support he has garnered, and the impact his rise has had on the other candidates. Sanders’s Brooklyn accent became more pronounced as the night went on, as he railed against the “oligawky” and denied having left anyone at the “altuh.” (The latter statement was in reference to his refusal to support a 2007 immigration bill.) Afterward, he said that he wished he’d had more time to talk about rising inequality and the challenges it presents to democracy. In reality, though, he got his message through. “Here is the truth that very few candidates will say,” he said in his closing statement. “Nobody up here—certainly no Republican—can address the major crises facing our country unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class that has so much power over our economy and our political life.”","3083","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Of the second-string contenders, O’Malley fared by far the best. An articulate policy wonk, he held his own while debating the issues, and delivered the strongest closing statement, saying to those Americans who have become disillusioned about politics, “Talk to our young people under thirty, because you’ll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples. That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country.”","3084","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"By contrast, Webb and Lincoln Chafee, the former senator from Rhode Island, both looked and sounded terribly out of place. Webb started out by becoming possibly the first Democratic candidate in recent memory to boast of his service in the Reagan Administration (he worked in the Pentagon). Thereafter, he spent a lot of time grouching about how little time he was being allotted. Chafee stumbled badly in trying to explain why he voted, in 1999, to repeal the Glass–Steagall Act, which separated commercial banking from investment banking. Neither man looked like he would be around for long, though Webb did get off one good line: “Bernie, I don’t think the revolution’s going to come. And I don’t think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff.”","3085","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Clinton didn’t have the passion of Sanders or the poetry of O’Malley’s sign-off, but she had something else: the self-confidence and killer instinct of a politician who has been down this route before. Early on, before Sanders helped her out with his comment about her e-mails, she stuck it to him in his most vulnerable area: his record on gun control. She pointed out that he voted five times against the Brady Bill, which required a federal background check and a five-day waiting period for gun purchases. She also ridiculed his answer to a question from Cooper about why he had supported an immunity provision for the manufacturers of guns used to commit violent crimes. “It wasn’t that complicated to me,” Clinton said, after Sanders called the bill a complicated one. “It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity.”","3086","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"The Democratic front-runner also demonstrated the hawkish streak that infuriates some progressives and sometimes earns her grudging respect from Republicans. Asked about Edward Snowden, she repeated the discredited argument that he could have invoked whistle-blower status, and said that he had stolen a lot of information that had fallen into enemy hands. “So I don’t think he should be brought home without facing the music,” she concluded. (Ari Fleischer, a former spokesman for President George W. Bush, tweeted, “Good for Hillary on Snowden.”)","3087","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"In her closing statement, Clinton said that she wanted to get back to “the basic bargain I was raised with: if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead.” That, of course, is an entirely familiar Democratic trope. When Bill Clinton was running for President, it was dubbed the “New Covenant.” President Obama often expressed it in terms of rewarding “hardworking folks” who “play by the rules.” In this case, though, familiarity is unlikely to breed contempt—at least among the moderate and loyal Democrats whom Clinton needs to support her. Bill Clinton and President Obama won four elections between them. For one night, at least, Hillary Clinton gave Democrats reason to believe that she might be ready to follow their example.","3088","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"

"In 2013, Ben Carson gave a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast that launched his political career. According to the rapturous response on the Internet, Carson’s remarks were a rebuke of President Obama—people saw Carson as an authentic black counterpoint to the President—but they were just as clearly a rejection of what he called the culture of “political correctness.” “The P.C. police are out in force,” he warned from the podium. “We’ve reached a point where people are afraid to say what they think because someone might be offended. People are afraid to say ‘Merry Christmas’ at Christmastime.”","September 22, 2015","3098","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"The concern among the burgeoning numbers of political-correctness critics—on both the left and right—is that the parameters of polite (or at least non-bigoted) discussion get in the way of truth-telling, leaving us with good feelings and palliative falsehoods. There is, however, a logical fallacy at play among many of these opponents, in their presumption that the validity of a statement exists in direct proportion to its capacity to offend.","3099","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"There are few anodyne truths in Ben Carson’s worldview. The decibel of the objections is evidence that he’s struck upon truth. A hit dog hollers, as Southerners say. When, this past Sunday, on “Meet the Press,” Carson voiced his opposition to the idea of a Muslim being elected President, he did so in the same calm, measured tones that attend almost all of his pronouncements. He spoke with the quiet confidence of a man convinced of the rectitude of his own position. Here is Carson responding to a question about whether voters should consider a candidate’s faith:","3100","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"

"Carson’s position within the paranormal wing of the G.O.P. is perplexing for a number of reasons. Unlike Donald Trump, who is capable of making equally inflammatory and nativist comments, Carson’s intellectual accomplishments are indisputable.* He is a product of the most respected educational institutions in the United States and was once a foremost practitioner in a highly complex field of medicine. Yet his virtuoso abilities coexist with a loosely tethered relationship to other types of rational thought. Carson is a scientist who disavows evolution, a citizen who professes to be deeply concerned about democracy yet supports a religious litmus test for public office, and a physician who devoted himself to saving the lives of children but indulges the hypertensive claims of the anti-vaccine element. His bifurcated thinking calls to mind James Watson, the Nobel winning co-discoverer of DNA, who spent years mouthing racist and sexist theories of human intelligence. On the stump, Carson seems like an object lesson in what happens when STEM majors don’t take enough courses in the humanities and social sciences.","3102","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"For reasons connected to his race, his education, and his exceptional talent, Carson at first carried an imprimatur of Serious Thought that the others in the crowded G.O.P. field did not. (Building a real-estate empire, winning a Senate seat, and serving as a corporate C.E.O. are impressive accomplishments, but they are literally not brain surgery.) But Carson’s duelling intellect and paranoia have led him to support untenable positions with minor qualifications. He panders by faint dissent. By stating that he believes that Islam is inconsistent with American democracy and that President Obama is a Christian born in the United States, he validates the substance of birtherism, just not this specific instance of it. When Carson was confronted, during the last Republican debate, with the question of whether vaccines cause autism, he stated that they did not but offered paranoiacs the nebulous chaser that we are giving children too many immunizations. The suggestion that vaccines have some nebulous danger essentially nullified the statement that preceded it.","3103","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"That the party responsible for the Southern strategy, the racist populism of the Reagan era, and the current age of voter suppression can count a black neurosurgeon among its most popular Presidential candidate is in itself a form of vaccination against charges of racism. It means one thing when a white billionaire taps into whites’ anxieties about cultural and economic displacement, and something else entirely when a black man from Detroit validates their conspiratorial fears about the Affordable Care Act. Or when, in an oblivious echo of the Dred Scott decision, an African-American states that entire segments of the population are irreconcilable with the Constitution. Carson’s is not a novel act. Five years ago, Juan Williams, a black journalist who covered civil rights and wrote a biography of Thurgood Marshall, stated that he felt fearful when boarding a plane with Muslims. The ensuing outcry was, predictably, denounced as political correctness.","3104","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"The enduring legacy of Carson’s candidacy, however it ends, is likely to be the recognition that, under certain circumstances, cynicism is less of a problem than sincerity. Would that such detached thinking, from so talented a figure, came with a wink and a nod—that it were simply a matter of demagogic competition in a crowded political field. But Carson appears to mean what he says, and there is a consistent market for his brand of exonerating racism, for bigotries so valid that even a brilliant black man endorses them. His certainty that the din of outrage is merely the yelping dog of political correctness prohibits him from fulfilling one of the primary responsibilities of a scientist: the honest evaluation of contrary data. It also blinds him to the widely apparent truth that his politics are not simply incorrect—they’re also wrong.","3105","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"

"On Friday, October 2nd, Jeb Bush was onstage at a college auditorium in Greenville, South Carolina, for a public interview with Alan Wilson, the state’s attorney general and a prominent figure in the right-wing firmament. Bush is sixty-two, but, thanks to a low-carb Paleo diet, he looks younger than he did when he left the Florida governor’s office eight years ago for a life in the business world. A trim physique, however, hasn’t boosted his appeal to potential voters. A new national poll showed that Bush’s support had sunk to four per cent; South Carolina, which has one of the most conservative Republican electorates in the country, and will hold its primary early next year, just after Iowa and New Hampshire, is crucial to winning the nomination. Once considered the front-runner, Bush is trailing a clutch of candidates, among them Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who have never held public office and encourage comparison to buffoons.","3107","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Jeb has presented himself as the most electable Republican candidate: willing to break with Republican orthodoxy on domestic issues such as immigration and education, and committed to breaking, if vaguely, with his brother’s legacy on foreign policy and to being, as he has said, his “own man.” Before Bush officially entered the 2016 campaign, he remarked to a group of C.E.O.s at a conference in Washington, D.C., that a successful candidate had to be willing to “lose the primary to win the general,” and should campaign “without violating your principles.” He meant that one must avoid the perennial trap of party primaries, in which “base voters,” the hard-core conservatives, force politicians to take extreme positions that will prove unpopular in a general election and, when later disavowed, expose the candidate as a phony. “It’s not an easy task, to be honest with you,” he noted. (Hillary Clinton faces a similar problem in her race for the Democratic nomination.)","3108","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But in his conversation with Wilson, and in a subsequent interview with me and other reporters, Bush veered toward the right. On domestic affairs, his view was neatly summarized by his answer to a question about gun control. It was the day after the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, and yet Bush rejected any calls for new legislation. He noted that he had confronted similar pressure for government action after tragedies while he was governor: “Look, stuff happens. There’s always a crisis, and the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.”","3109","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush was pilloried by Democrats for his “stuff happens” remark, but he defended it, telling me that the government doesn’t have a solution to every problem, and that sometimes government action makes matters worse. Some variety of a laissez-faire philosophy is standard for modern Republicans, at least on most domestic issues. But, increasingly in recent months, Bush, like a number of his colleagues, has been making the case for aggressive intervention abroad. Two days earlier, Russia had carried out its first air strikes in Syria. When I asked Bush how he would respond if he were President, he said that it was the lack of American action that had created the dire situation in Iraq and Syria, and invited the Russian military to bolster the Assad regime.","3110","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I think we need to stand up to Putin, not just as it relates to Syria,” Bush told me. “This sends a signal all around the world of the United States pulling back, not being serious. Our allies don’t believe that we’re going to have their back. And this emboldens our enemies.” Bush offered no details on how to “stand up to Putin” or what, exactly, he would do to pacify the killing floor of the Middle East and South Asia and reconcile the tangled rivalries and interests there. But his message to the base was clear: We must do something. And we must do it now.","3111","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush’s view represents a return to a simplistic interventionism that seemed discredited in the wake of the Iraq debacle. For decades, the G.O.P. has been split into two camps. The realists, who dominated the Presidency of Bush’s father, George H. W. Bush, emphasized diplomacy and coalitions over go-it-alone displays of force, and a skepticism about America’s ability to shape the internal dynamics of foreign countries. They also expressed a willingness to tolerate tyrannical regimes that advance U.S. interests or create greater stability in volatile regions of the world. The other camp—variously described as idealists, hawks, and neoconservatives—dominated the Presidency of Bush’s brother. They have more often called for the overthrow rather than the containment of hostile regimes, and they remain committed to exporting American-style democracy to places where it has never flourished.","3112","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"The hyper-interventionist foreign policy of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney was widely blamed for the Republican Party’s loss of Congress in 2006 and of the Presidency in 2008. But many hawks, once more in full voice, now believe that the Obama years—the emergence of ISIS, the crisis in Syria and Iraq, Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, the rise of Putin at a time of Russian isolation and economic weakness—have vindicated Bush. “Any Presidential candidate, the first thing he or she needs to do is put up a map of the Middle East in 2009 and one today,” John McCain, a leading hawk in the Senate, told me, as we discussed foreign policy in his office. “And point out that it is this President’s failures. He said he got out of conflicts. He got out of conflicts, but the conflicts didn’t end.”","3113","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Obama thinks that intractable foreign-policy crises should be guided by the physician’s maxim of “first, do no harm”—or, as his aides have said privately, “Don’t do stupid shit.” To Republican hawks, this sounds like a willful and dangerous abdication of American power and influence. Lindsey Graham, who is one of the long-shot Presidential candidates and McCain’s closest ally in the Senate, has called for ten thousand American troops to be sent back to Iraq. Last week, Chris Christie said that he would set up a no-fly zone in the Syrian airspace in which the Russians are now operating, and shoot down any planes that entered it.","3114","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But of all the Republican candidates vying to reform the world of foreign affairs only one belongs to a family of Presidents that, for better or worse, did so much to give that world its present shape. When Jeb Bush began his campaign, he enlisted as advisers some of the realists from his father’s camp, including the former Secretary of State James Baker. But the heaviest contingent consisted of his brother’s liege men: Paul Wolfowitz, the Defense Department official who made the ideological case for invading Iraq; John Hannah, who had been an adviser to Dick Cheney and pushed bad intelligence into Colin Powell’s famous speech at the U.N. making the case for war; Porter Goss, the former C.I.A. director who condoned waterboarding as an interrogation technique; and Stephen Hadley, the former national-security adviser, who took the blame for false assertions that President Bush made about nuclear yellowcake allegedly sought by Saddam Hussein from Niger.","3115","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Another adviser on his team is Otto Reich, who served in various foreign-policy roles in the Reagan Administration and in both Bush Administrations, and is perhaps best known for his participation in the 2002 attempted coup against Hugo Chávez, the late socialist leader of Venezuela. (Reich denies that he or the U.S. played any role in the coup.) In May, Jeb Bush, after providing a series of confusing responses on the issue, said that, given what is now known about the condition of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear-, biological-, and chemical-weapons program in 2003, he would not have invaded Iraq. Not all of his advisers share this sentiment.","3116","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I can defend the invasion of Iraq,” Reich told me. “What did the invasion of Iraq do? It caused all of the people who would’ve otherwise come and attacked us and killed Americans on our soil—it caused them to go to Iraq and die there. That may sound very brutal, or whatever, but we have seen what has happened when you have an Administration like the current one, that did not realize what Bush had done; sent the troops home from Iraq; created a vacuum that was filled by ISIS. And they’re killing Americans and everyone else—they’re mostly killing Muslims. I lay that at the feet of the Obama Administration.”","3117","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He added, “All Republicans say what I just did . . . but it’s not reported. Nobody listens. It goes against conventional wisdom. Conventional wisdom is that Bush was a failure in foreign policy, because of Iraq. Well, history is beginning to tell a different story.”","3118","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"The American public’s appetite for military interventions runs in cycles. After the triumph of the Second World War, policymakers were emboldened to roll back Communism, but the miasma of Vietnam instilled a wariness of major overseas military entanglements that spanned the Carter and Reagan Presidencies. In 1991, the relatively quick and successful Gulf War sparked a new bipartisan consensus that American force could again be deployed wisely if it was undertaken with overwhelming strength and with the benefit of an international coalition. The lack of intervention in Rwanda was widely seen as a moral calamity for which politicians, including Bill Clinton, have apologized.","3119","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"That uneasy consensus lasted through the 2001 toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan. But the invasion of Iraq in 2003 came to be seen as such a catastrophic mistake that even its progenitor could not avoid casting blame on his own circle. George W. Bush, during his last two years in office, forced out Donald Rumsfeld and marginalized Dick Cheney. It was too late to save his own popularity. When voters went to the polls in November, 2008, Bush’s job-approval rating dipped to twenty per cent, the lowest of any outgoing President in the history of polling.","3120","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Voices of restraint can still be heard in the Party’s debates, including on Jeb Bush’s team. One adviser, in contrast to Reich, told me, “I’m sure he’s not going to invade Iraq again. We did that one. You can’t compare him to his brother, because his brother was operating in a different environment. We had just been attacked; we didn’t know what was coming next.”","3121","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Senator Lindsey Graham, whose candidacy is essentially limited to a hard-line foreign policy, said his opponents were trying to sort out the politics of interventionism. “Here’s the problem,” he said, “Republicans know it’s not popular to be for Obama’s foreign policy, but they’re nervous about how far to go. They’re trying to find out where the public is, and trying to take the public’s pulse.

"Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, who is also running for President, told me that he thinks he’s found it: a foreign policy that channels Reagan, by far the most popular Republican in modern history. In Cruz’s Senate office, we sat under an enormous painting depicting Ronald Reagan’s 1987 speech at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, in which he declared, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.”","3123","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz is forty-four, eighteen years younger than Jeb Bush. Other politicians of his generation, including Marco Rubio, also forty-four, were strongly influenced by 9/11, but Cruz told me that he draws more lessons from Reagan’s fight against Communism than from Bush’s and Obama’s fight against terrorism. “The foreign-policy events that shaped my world view the most did not occur in the past two Presidencies,” he said. “I believe in peace through strength. It’s worth underscoring. Reagan went through eight years in the Presidency, and the biggest country he ever invaded was Grenada.”","3124","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He emphasized that “among Republicans there is a spectrum of views of foreign policy. At one end, there is Rand Paul”—a non-interventionist who is the most skeptical of further involvement in Syria and Iraq. “At the other end, I would put John McCain. Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio are very similar to McCain. I would describe my views as a third point on the triangle.” He believes that “America should always be a clarion voice of liberty, and that the bully pulpit of the Presidency has enormous power. There is power to speaking the truth on a global stage.” He added, “However, speaking for freedom is not the same thing as using U.S. military force. Historically, America has always been reluctant to engage in military force.”","3125","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Reagan’s foreign policy was rhetorically idealistic but also deeply pragmatic. Although he described the Soviet Union as “the evil empire,” he was quick to negotiate with Gorbachev. Soon after Hezbollah attacked the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, in 1983, killing two hundred and forty-one Americans, Reagan said that a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon would send a “signal to terrorists everywhere: they can gain by waging war against innocent people.” But then he did it anyway, after concluding that the troops’ mission was unclear and that their presence offered too inviting a target to extremists.","3126","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"This strain of pragmatism was powerful enough that George W. Bush called for a “humble” foreign policy in his 2000 campaign, and condemned the kinds of democracy-building interventions for which he would later become known. Cruz strives to return the G.O.P. to its pre-9/11 philosophy. “If and when U.S. military force is required,” he told me, “it should, No. 1, always be to directly further the vital national security of the United States. No. 2, we should use overwhelming force. And, No. 3, we should get the heck out. It should not be the objective of our armed forces to engage in nation-building, to transform foreign nations into robust, utopian democracies.”","3127","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"While many Republicans now criticize Obama for not doing enough in Syria, Cruz was among those who opposed Obama’s 2013 request to strike Syria. “He repeatedly tried to justify this as ‘vindicating international norms,’ or as ‘the violation of international law,’ ” Cruz said. “It’s not the job of our military to behave like a law professor in a faculty lounge, vindicating international law. It’s the job of our military to protect the safety and security of three hundred and thirty million Americans.” He said that although “Assad is a monster” who “has used poison gas” and “killed hundreds of thousands of his own citizens,” he worries about what might happen “if the attack succeeds and you topple Assad, and the weapons then fall into the hands of Al Qaeda or Al Nusra or ISIS or any of the other radical Islamic terrorists.” (Donald Trump has said that he’s happy to have Russia in Syria fighting ISIS, though he failed to note that, so far, Russia has been mainly targeting U.S.-trained rebels, not ISIS.)","3128","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz added that the military commanders he has consulted insist that “the most potent tool to use against ISIS is overwhelming airpower.” He maintained that arming the Kurds in northern Iraq was a better alternative to sending U.S. troops. “We need boots on the ground, but they don’t necessarily need to be American boots,” he said. “The Kurds are our boots on the ground.”","3129","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But Cruz’s prescription may be more like Reagan’s supply-side tax cuts than like Reagan’s foreign policy: it promises enormous benefits with very little sacrifice. Graham, who wants American troops to lead the fight, scoffed at Cruz’s argument. “The Kurds don’t have any offensive capability,” he said, pointing out that Shiites and non-Kurdish Sunnis in Iraq and Syria would be as concerned about Kurdish advances as they are about ISIS. “They’re not gonna go down to Ramadi! Go ask the Kurds, ‘Would you help us liberate Syria?’ And they’d say, ‘Thank you, but no thank you.’ If you want to create a war to end all wars, have a marauding band of Kurds going through the Middle East.”","3130","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz has calculated that, despite the rise of ISIS, Republican voters are still hungover from the costly interventions of the Bush years, and that they share his skepticism about the ability of American troops to accomplish much in Iraq and Syria. “There are some politicians in Washington who approach foreign military action as if they’re playing Risk,” he said. “They want to deploy troops and command them in battle.” He added, “A number of politicians treat American boots on the ground as a talisman to demonstrate that they’re really tough.”","3131","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Obama, who has said that he was elected to end wars, not start them, has bombed more countries than George W. Bush did. But in fighting terrorism he has chosen to use drones and other forms of airpower, Special Forces, and proxy armies. Obama was skeptical about intervening to stop Muammar Qaddafi’s forces as they marched on a helpless population in Benghazi, Libya. He had to be talked into the operation by, among others, Hillary Clinton, and the result—a failed state in Libya that has created a haven for terrorists—shaped his skepticism about intervening in Syria.","3132","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Early on, key Republicans seemed to endorse Obama’s cautious approach. When Marco Rubio ran for the Senate in 2010, he supported Obama’s drawdown of troops in Iraq. As a former city commissioner in West Miami and then a state legislator, Rubio knew the foreign-policy issues that important Florida constituencies care about, such as the Jewish community’s staunchly pro-Israel views and the Cuban-American community’s fierce opposition to Castro. He had little experience with broader foreign-policy questions. In his early months in Congress, he supported attempts at diplomacy with Iran. During the 2013 fight over budget cuts, Rubio advocated for government-spending reform. He has since grown less cautionary, arguing for an increase in military spending and calling it the “most important obligation of the federal government.”","3133","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio, who was a leader in the Florida House while Jeb Bush was governor and is now his nearest opponent in the race, though they are both well behind Trump and Carson in most national polls, has recently positioned himself as one of the most hawkish Republicans running for President. McCain noted that Rubio, like others, had shifted into his camp after the emergence of ISIS, and he joked that Rubio has a history of switching positions, which McCain gently mocked by licking his finger and holding it in the air.","3134","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Recently, Rubio told me that he no longer believes that Obama’s drawdown was wise. “We are retreating from Afghanistan and Iraq, not anticipating the vacuum that would be left behind and the potential that creates for radicalism,” he said. His shift might seem political, but he suggested that it was the result of becoming immersed in issues, as a senator, to which, as a candidate, he had given little thought. He noted that some of his opponents, including Jeb Bush, have never held federal office. “I’m a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee,” Rubio said. “I spend a significant amount of time working on these issues on a daily basis. So most certainly I’m going to have more insight than someone reading briefings from the staffers.”","3135","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio’s foreign policy is a clear response to Obama’s alleged retreat from the world. The President’s biggest mistakes, in this view, were all failures to intervene more aggressively. Rubio has said that he would have forcefully taken the side of demonstrators in Iran during the 2009 Green Revolution. “The President was so intent on negotiating with Iran’s tyrants that he did little to help its people,” he remarked in a speech in Washington in 2011.","3136","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But the key issue for many emerging Republican hawks was Obama’s failure to attack Assad when he used chemical weapons. Obama had drawn a “red line,” but then retreated. Instead, he accepted a deal negotiated with Putin to place the weapons under international control. “Everyone heard him,” Reich said. “He said, ‘I didn’t draw the red line, the world drew a red line.’ No, Mr. President, the world didn’t stand before the cameras in the White House and say that it was drawing a red line; you did. . . . It’s very dangerous.”","3137","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"George Shultz, who is ninety-four and is also a Bush adviser, was Reagan’s Secretary of State. He said that the red line was one of the biggest mistakes of Obama’s Presidency. “I don’t think the President realizes how much damage was done,” he said. “I remember when I was in marine boot camp, at the start of World War Two, and the sergeant hands me this rifle and says, ‘Take good care of this rifle—this is your best friend. Remember one thing: never point this rifle at anybody unless you’re willing to pull the trigger.’ No empty threats. That’s boot-camp wisdom. With Obama there are empty threats lying all over the place, and they undermine his credibility.”","3138","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"This outlook relies on some revisionist history. When Obama asked Congress for authorization to bomb Syria in 2013, several Republicans, Rubio among them, voted against the resolution in the Foreign Relations Committee, and many others announced that they would oppose it on the Senate floor. It never came to a vote. Rubio said that the Administration’s proposed attack was not sufficiently robust; now he cites the failure to use force as the reason for much of the current chaos, including Putin’s recent involvement.","3139","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio told me that years ago he warned that the power vacuums in the Middle East were being filled by Islamic extremists, and he noted ISIS’s growing role in Afghanistan, where it had previously had little presence. “If they continue unabated a year from now, we could live in a world where ISIS is now operating in vacated spaces in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya,” he said. Rubio is a favorite of G.O.P. hawks. Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas billionaire who spent some $100 million in the 2012 election and is wooed by almost every Republican candidate, is reportedly also a fan. But Rubio sounds more cautious when asked for details about how to defeat ISIS.","3140","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“Intervening doesn’t mean ground troops,” he said. “Intervening can be a lot of things.” He went on, “A full-scale invasion, sending a hundred thousand troops to Iraq right now, is probably not the best way to defeat ISIS. Because it very well may be what they hope will happen, because it will allow them to point to radicals around the world and attract more recruits and more funding. I think that the better approach is to empower Sunni tribes to defeat them. And they need a lot of help from us, including air strikes and special-op forces.”","3141","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"What Rubio laid out wasn’t very different from Obama’s current plan. When pressed, he conceded that many more American troops might be necessary. “There’s no magic number,” he said. “I don’t know if nine thousand is worse than eleven thousand. What matters is: first you have to establish a mission—what are you trying to achieve? Then you have to allow the military to come up with operations and how to achieve that mission. And that will determine the number in the mission, not the other way around.”","3142","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio, Graham, and many other Republicans believe that the nation’s foreign policy suffers from timidity, not from overexertion. The problem is in the execution, not the intervention itself. “Here’s what I’ve learned,” Graham told me. “If you don’t have a plan after you take Afghanistan down, after you take Iraq down, after you take Libya down, after you take Syria down, you’re going to regret it.”","3143","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Given the failed states and the civil wars gripping Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, I asked Graham for an example of a successful intervention that would bolster his case for a more hawkish foreign policy. We were sitting outside, in Manchester, New Hampshire, and he was eating nachos. He looked at me excitedly, racing to swallow so that he could get to his answer: “How about Germany and Japan?”","3144","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Even as Bush watches his opponents solidify their foreign-policy positions, he has struggled to come to terms with his brother’s ideology. His opponents criticize him for being vague or unengaged. Graham told me, “I think he’s a work-in-progress. I think he’s been out of the game for ten years. . . . He’s gotta convince people that three Bushes are not one too many.”","3145","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Jeb Bush’s troubles began almost as soon as he declared his candidacy and included the eighty-five-year-old James Baker on his list. As Communism began to collapse, in 1989, Bush and Baker helped engineer a soft landing for the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the gradual reorientation of Europe’s Eastern Bloc countries toward the West. Hawks pilloried them for not asserting themselves strongly enough. When Bush went to Kiev, Ukraine, for instance, and warned Ukrainians not to secede from the Soviet Union, the address was mocked as the “chicken Kiev” speech. In 1991, after assembling a United Nations-backed coalition to push Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, Bush and Baker ignored the pleas of American neoconservatives who wanted U.S. forces to march on Baghdad and overthrow Saddam following the uprisings against his rule. They were again demonized. Wolfowitz said that it was as if America were “idly watching a mugging.” In 2006, Baker co-chaired the Iraq Study Group, which recommended a dramatic change in Bush’s policy in the Middle East, including the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Iraq and diplomatic engagement with Iran and Syria, policies that Bush rejected.","3146","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"When Baker appeared on Jeb Bush’s list, neoconservatives expressed alarm. His foreign-policy views—diplomacy, stability, and serious doubts about interventions requiring large numbers of U.S. troops—are closer to Obama’s than to George W. Bush’s. Jeb Bush faced a revolt from donors and excoriation in neoconservative publications. A few weeks after Jeb’s announcement, Baker was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at a Washington gala dinner for J Street, the liberal-leaning pro-Israel group founded in 2008 to act as a counterweight to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Commentary published an article about “Jeb Bush’s James Baker Problem” and warned that Jeb may be Baker’s “kindred spirit.” Mark Levin, an influential talk-radio host, wrote that “Jeb Bush turns to Israel-hater, Jim Baker, for foreign policy advice.” Adelson reportedly sent word to Bush that he should pressure Baker to cancel the speech. Bush declined, and Adelson’s allies leaked that Adelson wouldn’t support Bush.","3147","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"At the J Street dinner, Baker criticized Benjamin Netanyahu for “diplomatic missteps and political gamesmanship,” and spoke about his own role in the first Bush Administration’s withholding of loan guarantees to Israel in order to pressure the government to halt settlement construction. William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, called Baker “anti-Israel,” and tweeted, “Thankfully, James Baker doesn’t speak for today’s Republican Party.” Morton Klein, the president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America, told Bloomberg that Bush’s association with Baker would cost the candidate: “There are many mega-donors who will not be with him because of that.”","3148","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In May, Bush appeared in New York, at the Metropolitan Club, before an audience of financiers organized by Paul Singer, a hedge-fund manager and the kind of Republican mega-donor Klein had warned about. Someone asked Bush to explain Baker’s influence on his policymaking. According to the Washington Post, Jeb “said that he respected Baker, but maintained that he is not part of his foreign-policy team.” CNN, which cited four sources and the notes of someone present, quotes Bush as saying, “What you need to know is that who I listen to when I need advice on the Middle East is George W. Bush.” The Bush campaign later insisted that Jeb was speaking narrowly about Israeli policy. Either way, the message was clear: the hawks were back in control of Republican foreign policy.","3149","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Lately, in his effort to be his “own man,” Bush has displayed a willingness to move even further to the right than his brother. At the October 2nd interview in South Carolina, Wilson asked him about the U.S. prison at Guantánamo Bay. During George W. Bush’s tenure, the prison became such a source of shame for America that even Bush, who was loath to acknowledge mistakes or to bow to international pressure, said in 2007, “It should be a goal of the nation to shut down Guantánamo.” Jeb disagrees. Wilson asked if Guantánamo prisoners should be moved to maximum-security facilities in the U.S. “No,” Jeb said. “There is no option for these folks. They should stay where they are. Even if it’s—it’s expensive. It’s the nicest prison you’ll ever want to be in, by the way. And the rights of these terrorists are way beyond what a lot of people get in a lot of different circumstances. They’re not being mistreated at all. But there is no other option.”","3150","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"If the economy improves, and Democrats continue to maintain an advantage on domestic issues, the Republican candidates will increasingly highlight foreign policy, an area of perceived vulnerability for Obama and Clinton. McCain, who lost to Obama in 2008, said, perhaps hopefully, “National security, foreign policy, and terrorism will play a greater role in the decision-making of the American people than at any time since 1980.” He insisted that although Bush’s record on foreign policy contributed to his own defeat, “it has gone from a significant negative” at the start of the Obama Administration “to what has become more and more of a positive.”","3151","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In August, Bush travelled to Simi Valley, California, to give a speech on foreign policy at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Bush called Reagan “a leader of clarity and resolve, not given to idle words,” someone “who took command of events, rebuilt America’s strength, and moved the world toward peace.” But when he shifted from Reagan’s Cold War successes to more recent events his speech sounded more like a tribute to the Administration of George W. Bush.","3152","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“No leader or policymaker involved will claim to have gotten everything right in the region, Iraq especially,” he said. But he argued that, whatever mistakes were made, it was the surge of troops in 2007 that “turned events toward victory.” The surge “was a success—brilliant, heroic, and costly.” It was Obama who lost Iraq, not his brother. The “premature withdrawal was the fatal error,” Jeb said, referring to Obama’s gradual drawdown, “creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill—and that Iran has exploited to the full as well.”","3153","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He then turned this logic against the Democrats’ most likely nominee. “ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat,” he said. “And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the President himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away. In all her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly one time.”","3154","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Clinton herself has tried to create some distance from Obama’s record. Since leaving the Administration, she has repeatedly said that as Secretary of State she urged Obama to do more in the early days of the Syrian uprising against Assad, when moderates could still be found in that country and American intervention could, arguably, have made a difference. Obama has dismissed that view as “a fantasy.” But, whatever Clinton actually believes about the correct course in the Middle East, she has already shown that she will adopt the campaign position that best suits her politically. In early October, facing a challenge from the left from Bernie Sanders, she reversed her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that she championed as Secretary of State.","3155","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"It’s easy to attack Obama as feckless in the face of the chaos in Libya, Syria, and Iraq. Less apparent is how to translate vague campaign promises to do something into a plan that won’t put more American lives at risk. After Jeb Bush spoke with Wilson in South Carolina, he met with reporters backstage. His aides were scrambling to contain any fallout from the “stuff happens” remark, which had immediately elicited a response from President Obama, and echoed one of the most notorious statements of the Bush Administration: Rumsfeld’s declaration during the chaos in Iraq that “stuff happens.” After defending his remark, Jeb Bush then took some questions about Syria, Iraq, and Putin.","3156","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He has called for a no-fly zone over Syria that would help a Sunni-led army fight a two-front war against Assad and ISIS, but it’s unclear who would make up the forces. He told reporters that American airpower in Syria is “restricted by lawyers kind of imposing all sorts of conditions.” He would change the rules, he said, so “that it would be there to fight to win.” He didn’t specify which rules he would lift, but, as Graham noted, almost every military expert dismisses the idea that airpower alone can defeat ISIS. “The only way you destroy a big ground opponent is with another big ground opponent,” Graham told me. “You’re not going to bomb ISIL into submission. You gotta go tear the caliphate up by the roots. That means going into Syria on the ground.”","3157","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"To fight ISIS in Iraq, Bush made the familiar argument that America should arm the Kurds and “embed with the Iraqi military,” both of which Obama is effectively doing. When asked whether he would send more troops, Bush said that the U.S. already has thirty-five hundred troops in Iraq and that the real issue was how to better integrate them into Iraqi forces. Pressed further, he conceded, in a roundabout way, that he would be willing to send more American troops back to Iraq.","3158","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I would listen to the military commanders and I would create a strategy,” he said, a phrase that politicians revert to whenever they want to avoid details. “If it required more supportive troops, fine.” The statement was a reminder of Bush’s continuing dilemma: can he get the nomination without violating his principles? In the months since the start of his campaign, he has only clouded the matter of what, precisely, he stands for.","3159","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"At one point, someone asked Bush a churlish question about his father’s 1991 statement regarding the possibility of “a new world order” after the Cold War ended. Bush used it as an opportunity to talk about Obama’s alleged retreat from the world.","3160","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I don’t even know what that means anymore,” he said. “In 1992, it meant the end of Communism, and that the United States needed to play a constructive role in forging peace and security, and we still have that role to play. We have threats that are created by our absence. Just look at what’s going on in Syria as an example of that, where we have no strategy, where Putin, agile as he is, ends up injecting himself into something that makes it harder for me to imagine that this brutal Assad regime will depart.” He thought for a moment and added, “American leadership matters.” ♦","3161","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"If you watched Pope Francis’s historic address to a joint session of Congress on Thursday, and judged it by the standards of contemporary politics and discourse, it perhaps seemed a bit disappointing. The Pope spoke slowly and in a thick accent. He ranged widely, making it tricky to discern a common thread. Some of his language was elliptical; some of his rebukes were implied. Soundbites and applause lines were few and far between.","September 24, 2015","3162","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"But if you read the speech in its entirety—as I did after watching it being delivered—you will find something more coherent and substantial: a polite but firm request for the United States to stand up for, and live by, some of the things it claims to represent and, at times, has actually represented. Speaking in a legislature dominated by a party that is increasingly held hostage to the doctrines and interests of individualism and free enterprise, the visitor from the Holy See delivered a timely defense of communal values and solidarity with the poor and dispossessed. While he was at pains not to appear partisan or to give offense to his hosts, there was a reason why some Republicans were nervous about what the Pope might say. Between the follower of Saint Francis of Assisi and the leadership of the G.O.P. lies a gulf that no politesse can disguise.","3163","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"To the delight of the assembled, the Pope began by saying that he was grateful for the opportunity to speak “in the land of the free and the home of the brave.” But he quickly made clear that his concept of liberty and freedom doesn’t jibe with the one promoted by the Republican Study Committee or the Club for Growth. Citing Abraham Lincoln’s call for “a new birth of freedom,” he said, “Building a future of freedom requires love of the common good and coöperation in a spirit of subsidiarity and solidarity.” The “common good” isn’t a concept that gets discussed often in Washington these days, but Pope Francis invoked it several times. And in reminding the senators and representatives sitting before him of their obligation to pursue this goal, he said that they had a particular obligation to protect “those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk.”","3164","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"It was perhaps predictable that Francis would bring up Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr., two Americans who have achieved secular canonization, and to whom politicians across the political spectrum pay lip service. But the other two Americans he cited as inspirations were both figures of the left: Dorothy Day, the founder of the Catholic Worker Movement, and Thomas Merton, a Catholic theologian and mystic, whose enthusiastic support for the civil-rights movement and participation in protests against the Vietnam War attracted criticism from some conservative clergy. The Pope praised Day’s “passion for justice and for the cause of the oppressed.” (She died in 1980.) He lauded Merton, who died in 1968, as “a thinker who challenged the certitudes of his time and opened new horizons for souls and for the Church.”","3165","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"Many of Francis’s defenders would claim that he is cut from the same cloth. Turning his attention to global happenings, he referred to the world as increasingly blighted by “violent conflict, hatred, and brutal atrocities, committed even in the name of God and of religion.” He continued: “A delicate balance is required to combat violence perpetrated in the name of a religion, an ideology, or an economic system, while also safeguarding religious freedom, intellectual freedom, and individual freedoms…. We know that, in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within. To imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place. That is something which you, as a people, reject.”","3166","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"Was the Pope alluding to Abu Ghraib, the birther movement, or those Americans, such as Ben Carson, the Republican Presidential candidate, who would seek to debar Muslims from the Presidency? Of course, he didn’t say. Instead, he moved on to the global refugee crisis, which he rightly described as the worst such crisis since the Second World War. But rather than focussing on the situation in Europe, Francis noted that, “On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities. Is this not what we want for our own children?” Instead of paying attention to numbers or seeking “to discard whatever proves troublesome,” he went on, “let us remember the Golden Rule: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’ ”","3167","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"That was about the closest the Pope came to calling out Republicans explicitly for their heartless policies. Francis wasn’t done yet. In rapid succession, he called for an end to the death penalty, for concerted action to confront environmental degradation caused by human activity, and for steps to halt a global arms trade carried out in the name of “money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood.” Then, at last, he moved onto ground that is friendlier to traditional Republican doctrine, saying, “I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life.”","3168","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"The Pope will probably have more to say on this subject in Philadelphia, where he is due to attend the Catholic Church’s triennial World Meeting of Families. On this instance, though, he returned to his central message, invoking the belief, which virtually every American imbibes from childhood, that this is a great country. A country “can be considered great,” he said, “when it defends liberty as Lincoln did, when it fosters a culture which enables people to ‘dream’ of full rights for all their brothers and sisters, as Martin Luther King sought to do; when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed, as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work … and sows peace in the contemplative style of Thomas Merton.”","3169","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"In conclusion, Francis said that he had “sought to present some of the richness of your cultural heritage, of the spirit of the American people.” It was his wish, he added, “that this spirit continue to develop and grow, so that as many young people as possible can inherit and dwell in a land which has inspired so many people to dream. God bless America.”","3170","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"

"Ben Carson had wanted to be a doctor since he was a child in Detroit in the early nineteen-sixties, but he had the first inkling of what kind of doctor he might be when, as an undergraduate at Yale, he was introduced to Foosball. He played the game “with speed and ease,” he writes in his memoir, “Gifted Hands.” He had “an unusual ability—a divine gift, I believe—of extraordinary eye and hand coordination.” Even after he graduated and went on to medical school at the University of Michigan, a Yale student who made a great Foosball play was said to have scored a “Carson shot.” In the movie version of “Gifted Hands,” broadcast on TNT, in 2009, Cuba Gooding, Jr., as Carson, works the levers with a Jedi-like air—reprised in a later scene in which, during a twenty-two-hour procedure, Dr. Carson separates twin infants conjoined at the head. They were the first ever to survive such surgery.","3173","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Carson mentioned that operation in the first Republican Presidential debate, last month. “I’m the only one to separate Siamese twins,” he said. “The only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it.” It was a Carson shot. Last week, a Monmouth University poll had him in second place among Republicans, with eighteen per cent, behind Donald Trump’s thirty per cent—meaning that the choice of nearly half the respondents was someone who has never held political office.","3174","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"There have been attempts to explain Carson’s rise as being simply of a piece with this disjointed election season. Sunny and unflappable, he has been seen as the refined Trump (Rich Lowry, of National Review, called him the “superior outsider”), or the Trump that not even Trump can hate (the Donald says that he’s “a wonderful guy”). The standard narrative is that Carson first appeared on the political scene in 2013, when, at the National Prayer Breakfast, he told his life story in a speech that, as the Fox News world heard it, was a rebuke to the President, who was sitting on the dais. In fact, Carson has been out telling that story for twenty-five years.","3175","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"His mother, Sonya, married his father when she was thirteen and he was twenty-eight. He turned out to be a bigamist and, once he was gone, Sonya supported Ben and his older brother by cleaning houses. When the boys struggled in school, she made them turn off the TV, read two library books a week, and write reports on them. She was functionally illiterate, but, as Carson said at the Prayer Breakfast, “we didn’t know that—she put check marks and highlights and stuff.” He went from the bottom of the class to near the top. His mother’s motto, which informs Carson’s conservatism, was: “If you don’t succeed, you have only yourself to blame.” But Carson grew up a devout Seventh-Day Adventist, and “Gifted Hands,” like his campaign, is also about grace. When he was in ninth grade, after a friend teased him, he pulled out a knife and thrust it at the friend’s stomach. The boy could have died; Carson could have gone to jail. Instead, the blade hit his friend’s belt buckle and broke. Carson ran home, locked himself in the bathroom with the Book of Proverbs, and prayed to God to take away his temper. He says that he walked out a different person.","3176","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"In 1977, when Carson began his residency, at Johns Hopkins, he was sometimes assumed to be an orderly, but he regarded that as “a natural mistake”—what other black men did people see in hospitals? “I got a real kick out of watching them try to contain their expression of surprise,” he writes. He became an outstanding and innovative surgeon and, in 1984, at the age of thirty-three, the youngest head of a pediatric-neurosurgery department in the country. His joke about taking out half a brain was a reference to his pioneering work on hemispherectomies; the breakthrough case involved a four-year-old girl who had been racked by a hundred seizures a day.","3177","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"“Gifted Hands” was published by the Christian imprint Zondervan in 1990, after the surgery on the twins, and it has sold more than a million and a half copies. It is often assigned in schools, and a condensed version is being sold to fund Carson’s campaign. (According to the Times, as of July he had raised eighty per cent of his money from small donors, a higher proportion than any candidate except Bernie Sanders.) Carson has since written more books, started an educational nonprofit with his wife, Candy (they met at Yale, and have three sons), and gone on speaking tours. There is a parallel between his political emergence and that of Ronald Reagan, whose Prayer Breakfast moment was a televised speech in support of Barry Goldwater in 1964. The speech, titled “A Time for Choosing,” had been honed by Reagan during the decade he spent as a spokesman for General Electric, making appearances at company events in towns across the country.","3178","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Then, as now, the Republican Party was shifting in ways that were only peripherally visible to its ostensible leaders. Carson’s venues have been schools, churches, and gatherings of conservative activists, many of whom deeply distrust both their government and the larger institutions of their party. Their discontent, joined with what Carson sees as the lessons of his mother’s rejection of dependency, seems to have been a crucible for his own views. Eventually, he moved from offering himself as a role model to being a prescriber of policy.","3179","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Carson speaks to an unnerved America in terms that are themselves unnerving. He describes how our “pinnacle nation” is about to be driven down by moral decay. In his most recent book, “One Nation,” he writes that agents working against this country’s greatness include the political-correctness police, who use “faux hypersensitivity” to take power away from the majority of Americans. He regularly traces that strategy to Saul Alinsky, the mid-century community organizer whose name is a byword for conservative suspicions about Barack Obama. Political correctness, Carson says, is used to keep conservatives from invoking slavery or Nazism, both of which he cites freely. (“Obamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery”; “We live in a Gestapo age.”) He wonders if Obama will cause the elections to be cancelled: “He’s sitting there saying, ‘These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything.’ ” Trump, the businessman, tells Americans how the financial system is rigged against them. Carson, the brain surgeon, tells them how they are being denied knowledge. It doesn’t seem to matter that he is a man of science who does not believe in evolution and has called climate change “irrelevant”: he is an ideologue with the trappings of a technocrat.","3180","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Insofar as Carson has a political platform, it involves a low flat tax, modelled on the Biblical tithe; an end to Obamacare and to welfare for able-bodied adults; and the removal of restraints on our military in the Middle East. In lieu of specifics, Carson tends to say that as a surgeon he has experience “doing complex things” and making snap life-or-death decisions. His success in the polls may be best understood as desperation on the part of voters who have rejected political experience as a test of competence. But it should take more than a Carson shot to navigate this Presidential campaign, which has been played, so far, with all the reckless abandon of a Foosball game, and with little of the joy. ♦","3181","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"

"Rather than immediately asking the obvious follow-up, about whether this paralysis wasn’t largely the responsibility of the Republican Party, which controls both houses of Congress, and which has dedicated itself to rejecting virtually anything with President Obama’s name attached to it, Colbert inquired of Bush whether he could put an end to the “game of blood sport” that passes for politics. Bush made a lame attempt at praising Obama, and only then did Colbert raise the notion of Republican responsibility, before backing off and phrasing a second question more generally.","3186","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-breezes-through-the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert"

"Evidently sensing he was onto a winner, Bush offered that it was time “to restore a degree of civility” to politics. “I’ll restore a degree of civility right now,” Colbert said. “There is a non-zero chance that I would vote for you. You seem like a very reasonable guy who believes that governing is something that the government should do.”","3190","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-breezes-through-the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert"
"At this juncture Bush, perhaps concerned that this nice-sounding interviewer was luring him into saying something that would outrage conservative Republicans, or that Colbert’s researchers hadn’t read up on his record, reaffirmed his commitment to reducing the size of the government. ”I think it should be smaller,” he said. “Government plays a useful role, but it ought to be reformed. And that’s why, when I was governor of the state of Florida, I turned the system upside down … particularly with schools.” This was another point at which Colbert could have probed Bush’s record as governor, which also included gutting labor laws, curtailing affirmative action at state colleges, and cutting taxes for the richest Floridians.","3191","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-breezes-through-the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert"
"Instead, he joked about the Presidential photos that appear in schools and lobbed another softball, inquiring about Bush’s campaign slogan, “Jeb!” “It connotes excitement,” Bush said, with a smile. It was the first indication that beneath his sloth-like demeanor there lurks a lively mind, capable of self-deprecation. Then came another human moment, when Colbert brought up Barbara Bush’s statement, from 2013, since rescinded, that “We’ve had enough Bushes.” “It was a little embarrassing,” Bush admitted.","3192","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-breezes-through-the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert"
"The encounter that aired on CBS was short—less than seven minutes. Colbert appeared content to let it drift along amicably. After mocking Donald Trump in an earlier segment, he didn’t mention his name in the edited version of the interview. Nor did he mention his guest’s low poll ratings. (On Wednesday morning, CBS posted online a bonus clip of outtakes from the interview, in which Colbert did bring up Trump and pretended to help Bush prep for the next televised debate.)","3193","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-breezes-through-the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert"
"Colbert finished up by asking Bush in what ways he differed politically from his brother George—another question that Jeb seemed well prepared for. “I think my brother probably didn’t control the Republican Congress’s spending,” he replied. “I think he should have brought the hammer down on the Republicans when they were spending way too much…. He didn’t veto things. He didn’t bring order, fiscal restraint.”","3194","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-breezes-through-the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert"

"Paul Ryan has a few “requests” for the Republicans if they want him to be Speaker of the House. That is the word he used in a press conference yesterday: “Basically, I made a few requests for what I think is necessary, and I asked my colleagues to hear back from them by the end of the week.” Although, according to press reports, Ryan, in closed meetings with the Republican caucus and the more volatile Freedom Caucus, made it clear that they were not requests but conditions that had to be met before he would take the job, which he did not want. There were four: to move from being an “opposition party to a proposition party” (that is, don’t just drive the government to default); “update our house rules” (get rid of a parliamentary maneuver that was used to destabilize the outgoing Speaker, John Boehner); “unify now, and not after a divisive Speaker election” (he wants to be sure that members of the Freedom Caucus, who have been complaining that, despite his Randian tendencies, he is not conservative enough, won’t spend their time sabotaging him). Otherwise, neither he nor anyone else would be “successful,” he said.","October 21, 2015","3197","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/paul-ryan-and-the-fund-raising-life-balance"
"Then he came to the last point, which was “personal.” Ryan said, “I cannot, and will not, give up my family time. I may not be on the road as often as previous Speakers, but I pledge to make up for it with more time communicating our vision, our message.”","3198","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/paul-ryan-and-the-fund-raising-life-balance"
"Ryan was a teen-ager when his father died, something that undoubtedly influences his thinking on the importance of seizing the time that can be spent with one’s children. Ryan has three: Sam, Charlie, and Liza, who are ten, twelve, and thirteen years old. But before rhapsodizing about Ryan’s making the case for inserting sanity into the work-life equation, one might pause to ask what job we’re talking about. Why does the Speakership require time “on the road”? Isn’t the main idea to spend a lot of time in back rooms, hearing out and wheedling with colleagues, setting legislative priorities, and counting votes—and maybe occasionally playing golf with the President?","3199","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/paul-ryan-and-the-fund-raising-life-balance"
"Only in a TV version of Washington. The part of the job that apparently worries Ryan is the incessant, punishing, and no doubt somewhat humiliating fund-raising. According to the Times, John Boehner spent two hundred days a year on the road, attending fund-raising events or visiting donors. And that doesn’t count the coddling he did in the greater D.C. area. In that light, the modern Speaker’s job is less one of a chief operating officer than of a chief revenue officer—or, rather, the guy in charge of investor relations. To an extent, this has always been true. (In “The Path to Power,” Robert Caro describes how, in 1940, the House Speaker, Sam Rayburn, talked F.D.R. into giving one of Rayburn’s young colleagues, Lyndon Johnson, the task of helping a cash-strapped Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Johnson rushed out of the White House and “placed a call to Houston—to Brown and Root,” a company whose executives became a source of funds that L.B.J., taking control of the committee, distributed, gaining influence in the process.) But, in the post-Citizens United era, fund-raising has become more exhaustive and, one imagines, exhausting. This isn’t about Ryan working reasonable hours when Congress is in session. (Let alone supporting policies that would help working parents.) It’s about not spending all the rest of his time being a travelling salesman of Republican influence.","3200","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/paul-ryan-and-the-fund-raising-life-balance"
"So is Ryan suggesting that fund-raising should become less of a priority for the House Republicans? It doesn’t sound that way. According to Politico, the “informal plans” being discussed within the National Republican Congressional Committee for meeting Ryan’s conditions include this one: “Committee chairmen and other members of the leadership team would need to step up their fundraising.” Perhaps that would involve something like a regional sales-team model, or one more precisely directed at particular interest groups. Donors could have more intimate relations with the committee chairs who set up hearings on the industries and the policies that interest them. They might even give more cash. (Ryan is now the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, which helps control where federal money goes.)","3201","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/paul-ryan-and-the-fund-raising-life-balance"
"The most distinctive questions raised by Ryan’s “personal” request, then, do not have to do with whether a father can have an important job and still see his children—as important as that quandary is—but with money and politics. The connection between fund-raising and party leadership appears to be evolving. This is visible, too, in the race for the Presidential nomination. The Times reported that a hundred and fifty-eight families have put a hundred and seventy-six million dollars into the Presidential campaign (with just another two hundred families, they account for half of the total), while a few big donors can do much to sustain a candidate, like Ted Cruz, who might otherwise be marginal. The money, in other words, is both more concentrated and more fracturing. How would that dynamic play out in an already-factionalized House, under a Ryan Speakership?","3202","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/paul-ryan-and-the-fund-raising-life-balance"
"“Like many of you, Janna and I have children in the formative, foundational years of their lives. I genuinely worry about the consequences that my agreeing to serve will have on them,” Ryan said at his press conference. “Will they experience the viciousness and incivility that we all here face on a daily basis?” What is remarkable about the G.O.P. today is that the real viciousness tends to come from Ryan’s fellow Party members, whose internecine bitterness should give pleasure to no observer, of any faction. It isn’t clear that the Freedom Caucus will agree to Ryan’s requests. (Its candidate has been Representative Daniel Webster, who is still in the race.) Ryan has good reasons to approach the job with “reluctance,” as he put it. It’s not even a job likely to help him to become President. He says that he doesn’t mind if he’s turned down, but who would then be the Speaker is a bit of a mystery. Yet it’s not as if our political life would be healthy if the Freedom Caucus would only calm down (though it might help). There would still be the problem of who the guest of honor at all the fund-raisers might be. The Speakership is spoken of as a storied position; it is also one that, in ways that go beyond having to listen to the shouting of the Tea Partiers, is a little bit grubby.","3203","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/paul-ryan-and-the-fund-raising-life-balance"

"The deal announced on Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders will, if approved, keep the government open for the remainder of his term in office and offer modest budget increases in both military and domestic spending.

The debt ceiling will be lifted, so the government’s credit will remain intact. And, because the continuing operations of these functions will be guaranteed through March, 2017, two months into the new President’s term, the House and Senate will not be compelled to do anything else.","3207","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryan-won-the-right-to-do-nothing"
"Under normal circumstances, this would hardly be seen as an advantage. Throughout most of its history, Congress did a lot more than pass a budget. It passed laws to address national problems—to guarantee voting rights or expand access to health insurance or reform immigration laws. But the modern Republican Party operates principally as a negative force. It exists to oppose, and regards compromise as surrender. Indeed, it seems likely that the only reason Boehner could agree to this budget deal at all is that his comrades in the G.O.P. have no leverage against him—they’ve already forced him out.","3208","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryan-won-the-right-to-do-nothing"
"In deference to the feelings of a good number of his new constituents (that is, the Freedom Caucus and other radically conservative House Republicans), Ryan pronounced himself disappointed with the deal. “I think the process stinks,” he said. But it appears that he will vote for it. Still, if the deal does pass (not a sure thing at this point), it will be mostly with Democratic votes in the House, along with a few straggling relics of what used to be called moderate Republicanism.","3209","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryan-won-the-right-to-do-nothing"
"The bizarre, extreme behavior of the Republicans now in charge of the House of Representatives reveals itself most strikingly in those it has chosen as its principal enemies—Boehner and his counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, now the Majority Leader. They are hardly what conservatives like to call “squishes.” As the leader of his party in the Senate, McConnell was best known for this expression of his priorities: “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term President.” Likewise, Boehner said the following about his plans for Obama’s agenda: “We’re going to do everything—and I mean everything we can do—to kill it, stop it, slow it down, whatever we can.”","3210","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryan-won-the-right-to-do-nothing"
"In expressing these views, Boehner and McConnell were channelling the beliefs of their party. Republicans had no higher goals than to defeat Obama and stall his agenda. They failed to stop him from winning in 2012, but they did manage to vote dozens of time to repeal his signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. In taking all these votes, the Republicans in the House never came up with an alternative to Obamacare, but that was never the point. The point was to oppose—endlessly.","3211","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryan-won-the-right-to-do-nothing"
"The chilling reality, though, is that the new leadership in the House may make Obama and the country regard Boehner’s reign as the good old days. When he wasn’t hurling insults at the President, Boehner did have the temerity to meet with Obama and try to find common ground on a handful of areas, at least on keeping the government open.

"Republican candidates for President seem unable to shake the habit of making wildly reckless comments about science and public health. Michele Bachmann remains responsible for perhaps the most remarkable of these statements, when, in opposition to all known facts, she told Fox News, after a 2011 debate, about a girl who had “suffered mental retardation” as a result of receiving the HPV vaccine. Last week, though, Donald Trump solidified his place in the circle of scientific ignorance when he drew his own connection between vaccines and autism. “We’ve had so many instances, people that work for me,” he said, and described a “beautiful child” who, according to Trump, had recently been vaccinated, fallen ill, and “now is autistic.” Trump claimed that if vaccines were spread out, “I think you’re going to see a big impact on autism.” Trump has repeatedly expressed his view that vaccines cause autism. In 2012, he tweeted that “massive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for big increase in autism.”","September 22, 2015","3220","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"I have written many times that possible links between vaccinations and autism have been researched widely and have never been found to exist, and that words like Trump’s are dangerous—and even deadly. And I am far from alone. The comments came at a particularly bad time, because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had just begun its annual attempt to convince Americans to get flu vaccines, which, while not always perfectly effective, are safe and far better for both individual and public health than not getting vaccinated. (It has always been hard to know precisely how many people die of the flu in this country each year, but the number is in the thousands.) Federal officials say that this year’s vaccine is almost certainly going to be more effective than last year’s. But, thanks to our nationally televised lunacy, the job of convincing people to get them just got harder.","3221","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"Trump is terrifyingly popular, but we have come to expect dangerous inanities from him. Ben Carson, however, is another story.

"Carson’s first comment on the subject made him sound like a responsible, educated physician: “There have been numerous studies and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism.” One cheer. Then things went south: “Vaccines are very important, certain ones—the ones that would prevent death or crippling,” he said. “There are others, a multitude of vaccines, which probably don’t fit in that category, and there should be some discretion in those cases.” And: “A lot of this is … is … is pushed by big government.”","3223","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"What on earth was he talking about? Today, the C.D.C. advises that American children be vaccinated for fourteen diseases before age six—and each of those diseases can, in Carson’s infelicitous words, cause “death or crippling.” “The only one you could reasonably say does not kill is mumps,” Paul Offit, a physician in the division of infectious diseases at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told the Times last week. Offit, who is among the nation’s most outspoken vaccine advocates, added that mumps can, however, cause permanent deafness and sterility in men after puberty. “Tetanus kills, rubella kills unborn children, measles kills, hepatitis B virus kills,” Offit said.","3224","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"But Carson was just warming up, because what he said later was even worse: “It is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time.” With that, Carson added his voice to the rallying cry of “too many too soon,” uttered reflexively by the anti-vaccine crowd. This notion, that the vaccine schedule for children has become so crowded that it puts extra pressure on their immune systems, is immensely popular among American parents—and, increasingly, pediatricians are yielding to their requests to delay vaccines.","3225","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"This, too, is dangerous. As Tara Haelle pointed out in a particularly useful post at Forbes.com, delaying vaccines just prolongs a child’s risk for preventable diseases. The data could not be clearer. And, despite the increase in scheduled vaccines, children are exposed to far fewer antigens than ever before. As many people (including me) have written, the smallpox vaccine—which we stopped administering after the disease was eradicated, in the nineteen-seventies—contained two hundred proteins. When counted all together, the fourteen vaccines that children receive today contain no more than a hundred and fifty.","3226","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"The only other trained medical professional on the stage also failed his biology (and public-service) tests last week. Rand Paul, an ophthalmologist, said, “I’m all for vaccines.

"“I don’t mean to be disrespectful,” Donald Trump said, about a dozen insults into his speech in Dallas, at the American Airlines Center, on Monday night. “But when a man has a problem, and he’s got his wife or his girlfriend, and they move her over the border for one day, has the baby on the other side of the border—our side—now that baby is a citizen of our country for however long the baby lives.” Perhaps sensing that the last phrase might sound a bit ominous, he quickly added, “hopefully, a long time,” then continued his immigration-as-paternity-suit-fraud riff: “It’s wrong. It’s wrong. And by the way, by the way, the law doesn’t call that. That’s not what the law says. And people are finding out now that I’m right. We didn’t say that someone could be pregnant for nine months, come across the border, have the baby, and now it’s ours and we have to take care of that baby forever. It doesn’t say that. It does not say that.”","September 15, 2015","3230","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"The law that Trump was referring to was, presumably, the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which is, indeed, not worded in terms of a man having “a problem.” It is phrased like this: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Maybe your parents have just arrived on what is, when you take your first breath, your side of the border. Maybe your ancestors have been here for four hundred years—and, perhaps, for two hundred and fifty of them, until the adoption of that amendment, in 1868, they were, as the Supreme Court affirmed in the notorious Dred Scott decision, deprived of full citizenship themselves because they were held as slaves. (The Fourteenth Amendment voided Dred Scott. It is telling that Mike Huckabee, who has been spuriously attacking the Court’s marriage-equality decision by comparing it to Dred Scott, has also said that he wants the Citizenship Clause abrogated.) In either case, you have what has come to be referred to as “birthright citizenship.” But birthright citizenship has become a contentious issue in the Republican primary race, with outright calls that it should be done away with or disavowed (Trump, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham); that it “doesn’t make any sense” (Ben Carson); that it needs to be “reëxamined” (Chris Christie); or that it is being “taken advantage” of in ways that should be countered (Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush)—or just a waffling unwillingness to defend it (Scott Walker). If there is a single question that the candidates should be confronted about in the debate on Wednesday night, it is the nature of their commitment to birthright citizenship, because there are few issues that reveal more about their ideas of America, and about their willingness to play on the country’s fears and divisions.","3231","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"In the debate, there is likely to be mention of “anchor babies,” a term that serves to hook certain Republican audiences with its insinuations. In his speech in Dallas, Trump moved directly from immigrant criminals—“It’s disgusting what’s happening to our country. We are a dumping ground for the rest of the world”—to “the whole subject of anchor babies,” as if they were mini vectors of destruction. In fact, an American child cannot help his or her parents gain residency until he or she is twenty-one. The suspicion of alien identity attached to the phrase has already moved beyond the realm of rhetoric to affect the lives of American children: some babies born in Texas have had a hard time getting birth certificates, because their parents don’t have proper identification. But what is an “anchor baby”? Insofar as a slur can have a technical definition, it refers to a child born in the United States to parents who are undocumented, whether those parents have been here for years or for a day, and regardless of how long they hope to stay. This definition, at any rate, has been the basis for claims that two, three, or four hundred thousand such babies are born in this country each year. (The Wall Street Journal did a survey of various studies.) But those numbers have, in the Republican campaign, been joined with definitions that are anecdotal and demagogic—like Trump’s talk of a woman practically in labor stumbling over the border for twenty-four hours to give birth, or accounts of “maternity tourism.” Jeb Bush, acting puzzled that anyone thought his use of the term “anchor babies” was an insult to Latinos, said, “Frankly, it’s more related to Asian people—coming into our country, having children in that organized effort, taking advantage of a noble concept, which is birthright citizenship.” Those babies, he said, were involved in a “fraud.”","3232","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"As it happens, fear-mongering about Asian immigrants was part of an early effort, in the eighteen-nineties, to compromise the Fourteenth Amendment. Chinese workers had come to build the railroads and a good part of the state of California; the Chinese Exclusion Act denied them citizenship, but some of them had children here. One of those children was Wong Kim Ark, who was born at 751 Sacramento Street, in San Francisco, in an apartment above his father’s store. Twice, as a young adult, he took trips to China. The first time, in 1890, he was readmitted as a matter of course—he was American. The second time, in 1895, he was denied entry. As Fred Barbash recently recounted in the Washington Post, opponents of Chinese immigration had been looking for a test case that could be used to get courts to do something that, partly because it went against the plain meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, they hadn’t done before: to read the phrase about being born in and “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States as excluding people with foreign parents. Why it would do so is a little baffling: San Francisco was certainly subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Wong’s parents, as they went about their business in California, were certainly not exempt from its laws. (The jurisdiction phrase is generally understood to deal with special areas within the United States, such as Native American reservations and embassies.) Part of the argument that the U.S. Attorney trying to deport Wong made was that Wong’s parents were, nonetheless, “subjects” of someone else, namely the Emperor of China—which might be a valid reading of a sentence including a different meaning of the word “subject,” but not the one in the citizenship clause. That the amendment’s language was, in truth, not the heart of the matter was made clear when the U.S. Attorney added, “The said Wong Kim Ark has been at all times, by reason of his race, language, color and dress, a Chinese person.”","3233","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"Wong Kim Ark’s case went to the Supreme Court, and he won. The decision cited the “clear words and manifest intent” of the Fourteenth Amendment. The principle in the decision has since been affirmed and codified. But the idea that there is a qualification to the Citizenship Clause, one that is being ignored by forces willing to see America overrun by foreigners, has gained a sort of murmuring traction. It is what Trump is referring to when he says, “people are finding out now that I’m right.” Last month, Sean Hannity, of Fox News, introduced Mark Levin, the author of “Plunder and Deceit,” a book that argues that the Fourteenth Amendment is being misread, by saying, “Rand Paul was right on this. Trump was right on this. Cruz is right on this. Walker is right on this,” and asking, “Why are so many people getting this wrong?” Levin explained that it was thanks to “some phony constitutional lawyers” focussed on the “results” of greater immigration. He added that anyone who thought otherwise didn’t know “the history.” “Agree completely,” Hannity said. It is as though “and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” was just a bar of white noise, which could be filled in with anything—dual citizenship, the illegal crossing of a border, a strange language, religion, or clothing—to ignore the claim of an American child.","3234","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"Ted Cruz says that birthright citizenship should “absolutely” be limited, but he believes that the constitutional arguments on both sides are made in “good faith.” He said on “Face the Nation” that Congress could start by passing “a law defining what the words in the Fourteenth Amendment ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ means,” but that amending the Fourteenth Amendment would be more effective. It might just take a lot of time.","3235","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"One might better ask what vision of America it would require. Trump, in his speech in Dallas, said that he had been told that “anchor babies” was “not a nice term,” but said that it was one “we have to use.” (Hillary Clinton has suggested another option: “babies.”) Trump’s embrace of the phrase points to another use of “anchor baby,” one that seems to tempt candidates like Jeb Bush: as something that cool conservatives can say to show that they are not subject to the jurisdiction of “political correctness”—that they are brave enough to insult babies. But protestations on that count should not, in the debate on Wednesday, substitute for an engagement with the real ugliness of what is being proposed by the frontrunners in the Republican race. Are any of them willing to say that they value, rather than fear, birthright citizenship? Do they envision people with certain names or skin colors being asked not only for their own papers but for those of their parents and grandparents? A better question might be this: since when has the idea that an immigrant hopes that her child will be born in America, because she believes in America, been something to scorn? Aspirations like that have always been the country’s foundation—and, one might say, its true anchors.","3236","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"In late February, 1944, when the United States was at war and national unity was in fashion, the Democratic Senate Majority Leader, Alben Barkley, announced that he was resigning, effective immediately; he put down his gavel and walked out of the Capitol building. But unlike Speaker John Boehner, who on September 24th told Republican House members that he intended to quit at the end of October, Barkley’s complaint was not a rebellion from fellow Democrats but arrogance in the White House. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, he felt, had little regard for the Senate and, with provocative disrespect, had vetoed a revenue and tax bill, something his fellow Democrats had pleaded with him not to do.","October 20, 2015","3237","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"For Barkley, who had served in Congress for thirty-one years and was sometimes mocked as Roosevelt’s lapdog, that was one humiliation too many. He declared that “there is something more precious to me than any honor that can be conferred upon me….and that is the approval of my own conscience and my own self-respect.” What followed, as the New York Herald Tribune reported, was something that bore little resemblance to the sour aftermath of Boehner’s decision: an “ovation unprecedented within the memory of Senators now living.…Senators on both sides of the floor broke the customary rule of decorum and rose in their places to applaud.…The business of the Senate was suspended for ten minutes while the congratulations went on.”","3238","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"There was no such outpouring for Boehner, and little appreciation for his futile attempts to bring stability and civility to a House divided by factions and, in the case of the House Freedom Caucus, an ideological certitude bordering on zealotry. During Boehner’s tenure the “people’s House” became a virtually rudderless organization that now seems unable even to choose a replacement leader. Its members were in full rebellion against—what, exactly? The Freedom Caucus leader, Ohio’s Jim Jordan, seems to crave more legislative anarchy: “reform” that would allow anyone to introduce, and offer for debate, even hopelessly doomed bills and amendments, a process that he said “will benefit everyone.” It has the potential to make caucus members sound like Steve Martin in his routine as a hostage-taker with three demands: a hundred thousand dollars in cash, a getaway car, “and I want the letter ‘M’ stricken from the English language.”","3239","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"Back in 1944, the Times saw Barkley’s resignation as “the greatest political crisis of [Roosevelt’s] three terms”; the Trib called it “one of the most dramatic conflicts between the executive and legislative branches” in American history. Outside Washington, there was alarm at the seeming inability of the President and Congress to cooperate; it was front-page news in wartime London, where headlines said, “Roosevelt faces grave crisis on home front” and “Democrat rages at FDR.” There was concern that Roosevelt’s leadership in foreign affairs might be compromised, especially after his veto was overturned by embarrassingly large margins (299–95 in the House, and 72–14 in the Senate).","3240","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"In the case of the Boehner, the world outside Washington didn’t seem to care very much, which was not surprising. Why should anyone care? In a list of problems facing the planet, Boehner’s pending departure, the abdication of Kevin McCarthy, the unenthusiastic courtship of Paul Ryan to take a job he doesn’t seem to want—maneuverings barely comprehensible to most Americans—would probably not rank high.","3241","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"Unlike the disarray in Boehner’s House, the intramural Democratic fight in the 1944 Senate was resolved with great haste. Roosevelt sent Barkley a “Dear Alben” message that, after recounting their differences vis-à-vis the tax bill and assuring Barkley that he didn’t doubt his good faith, went on to “hope your colleagues will not accept your resignation; but if they do, I sincerely hope that they will immediately and unanimously re-elect you.” That is precisely what happened; history’s earthquake ended overnight. Perhaps because the sixty-six-year-old Barkley harbored Presidential, or Vice-Presidential, ambitions (he wanted to run with F.D.R. in 1944; he became Harry Truman’s running mate in 1948), he still flattered Roosevelt. He told F.D.R. that he had worked for him “with an inspiration, a devotion, and a personal affection which has not been approached by any other men.” He was still able to burn bridges and then cross them.","3242","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"But if little seemed different after Barkley’s one-day drama, there was nonetheless a significant change: he emerged from his reinstatement, as the Trib pointed out, as the “majority’s majority leader” rather than a Roosevelt whip. He had become his own man, which gave him increased stature in both branches of government. Boehner’s successor, who will need approval from the forty-person Freedom Caucus, may end up being the “majority’s minority’s Speaker.”","3243","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"Alben Barkley had many of the attributes of a bloviating politician, but he did rise to this singular occasion, writing to Roosevelt that “there is something broader and more fundamental than any personal acquiescence as between you and me over matters of public policy and fundamental principles.” He continued, “In this great crisis of our nation’s history we must all seek some common ground….If we cannot trust one another…how can the people trust us?” Someday it will certainly be asked why House Republicans in the Boehner era were unable to ask the same question.","3244","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-houses-g-o-p-rebels-can-learn-from-alben-barkley"
"“President Obama and Hillary Clinton’s idea that we should bring tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America—it is nothing less than lunacy,” Ted Cruz said on Fox News, the day after the attacks on Paris. If there are Syrian Muslims who are really being persecuted, he said, they should be sent to “majority-Muslim countries.” Then he reset his eyebrows, which had been angled in a peak of concern, as if he had something pious to say. And he did: “On the other hand,” he added, “Christians who are being targeted for genocide, for persecution, Christians who are being beheaded or crucified, we should be providing safe haven to them. But President Obama refuses to do that.”","November 16, 2015","3245","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"The next day, at a middle school in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Cruz spoke even more openly about those whom he considers to be the good people in the world. He told reporters that we should accept Christians from Syria, and only Christians, because, he said, “There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror.” This will come as a profound surprise to the people of Oklahoma City and Charleston, to all parties in Ireland, and to the families of the teen-agers whom Anders Breivik killed in Norway, among many others. The Washington Post noted that Cruz “did not say how he would determine that refugees were Christian or Muslim.” Would he accept baptismal certificates, or notes from pastors? Does he just want to hear the refugees pray?","3246","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"On Monday, President Barack Obama reacted to this suggestion with some anger. “When I hear folks say that, well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims, when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which person who’s fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefitted from protection when they were fleeing political persecution, that’s shameful,” Obama said. (That last bit, about “families who’ve benefitted” when fleeing persecution, was an unmistakable reference to Cruz and Marco Rubio.) Obama continued, “That’s not who we are. We don’t have religious tests to our compassion.” The question is whether Obama can put that compassion to use, in this precipitous moment after Paris, when so many bad choices will seem appealing, including attacks on our fellow-citizens. (On Monday, Donald Trump said that, though he’d “hate to do it,” as President he would “seriously consider” closing mosques that were viewed as centers of radicalism.) The real criticism is that the United States has taken so few Syrian refugees of any religion—just about fifteen hundred, all of whom have been screened by a process that can take up to two years.","3247","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"Cruz is cruder than some, but he is not alone among Republicans. On Sunday, Jeb Bush also said that, although he isn’t entirely opposed to helping refugees who’d been screened, “I think our focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore.” (Christians were ten per cent of Syria’s population when the civil war broke out.) On Monday morning, Bush spoke about how “we should focus on creating safe havens for refugees in Syria rather than bringing them all the way across the United States”—a life in no-fly zones, while, according to a vision Bush also laid out over the weekend, a major land war involving U.S. troops was launched around them. He quickly added, “But I do think there is a special, important need to make sure that Syrians are being protected, because they are being slaughtered in the country and, but for us, who—who would take care of the number of Christians that right now are completely displaced?” Others, like Rubio, have avoided the Christian question by saying that they don’t think we should take refugees at all. Ben Carson, speaking to Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday,” said that taking in refugees “from that area of the world, I think, is a huge mistake. … To bring them over here, under these circumstances, is a suspension of intellect,” and would ignore “the reason the human brain has these big frontal lobes, as opposed to other animals.” (He then talked at greater length about “brain stems.”) Trump, in the past, has claimed that Syrian Muslim refugees can get into America “easily” (they cannot), while “if you’re from Syria and you’re Christian you cannot come into this country” (again, not the case). But, mostly, Trump doesn’t want to let anybody in, at least not anybody of the tempest-tossed type. Indeed, it’s not clear that the talk of Christian refugees is meant, even by the loudest Republicans, to translate into the appearance of Syrian Christians in America, as opposed to being an acknowledgment that some of the crowds that cheer when they hear anti-immigrant rhetoric might have qualms of conscience. The problem, they can be told, is just that our Muslim-sympathizing, cowardly leaders would bring in the wrong refugees.","3248","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"Christians are in danger in Syria. Their danger is distinct but not unique. The Yazidis, an even more isolated religious minority, have been a particular target of ISIS. Shiites and Alawites have been targeted, too. Refugee policies have at times rightly recognized the urgent danger that certain religious or otherwise distinct groups are in, and have properly responded. This is something quite different than saying, as Cruz does, that being a Muslim should be a basis for exclusion. Would he let in atheists, for that matter? It seems strange, when moderate Muslims are trying to distance themselves from a milieu of terror, that we would insist that such a thing is impossible. There are international and American laws that recognize people who need protection. There are principles of common decency which do the same. What they do not do is use faith, or the lack of it, as a basis for rejection. (America should have let in more Jewish refugees during the Second World War; that wouldn’t have meant turning away Thomas Mann.) And it is a brutal insult to Syrians who have gone through four and half years of carnage to say that the fact that they are Sunnis gives them some sort of immunity from ISIS or from the Assad regime. There are four million Syrian refugees outside of the country now, and many more inside it. There will likely be some bad people among them. That fact does not obviate their suffering. Taking more of them in can be an unpopular position at a moment when the news is full of speculation that one of the Paris attackers had passed through a refugee camp in Greece with a Syrian passport. But their desperation will not disappear if we lose interest in it; it may just take a different and more destructive form. We have a role in deciding where they will go next.","3249","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"One of the more dishonest aspects of Cruz’s comments on Fox was his characterization of who the Syrian refugees are. He mentioned an estimate that, in the “early waves” of refugees entering Europe, “seventy-seven per cent of those refugees were young men. That is a very odd demographic for a refugee wave.” Perhaps it would be, if the number were accurate. A bare majority of the Syrian refugees are women, as FactCheck.org noted in September, when Ben Carson and Scott Walker raised similar alarms. About twenty-two per cent are men between the ages of eighteen and fifty-nine—a broad definition of “young.” Cruz is smart enough to know this. He may be referring to a number given for migrants who arrived in Europe, from nine different countries, by taking a specific, dangerous Mediterranean sea route in 2014 (seventy-two per cent). Among the two million Syrian refugees the United Nations has registered in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon, a full thirty-eight per cent are under the age of twelve.","3250","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"For that matter, why shouldn’t there be young men among the refugees? In stories about why people emigrate, like the one told by Nicholas Schmidle last month in The New Yorker, one reason young men give as a motivating factor for leaving their countries is the fear of being conscripted by one side or the other. They don’t want to be killed, and they don’t want to be killers. Is it Cruz’s view that a nineteen-year-old, just out of high school, should head for the hills, looking for the moderate Syrian opposition that even the C.I.A. has been unable to find? Or should he languish in a camp, with no prospects of really settling anywhere, as a target for the wrong type of tutor? That is not going to make Europe or the United States any safer. What Cruz and the others are saying is that the threat people are living under, which has been enough to drive them from their homes, should not matter. What does matter is whether we feel threatened by them.","3251","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"The other insinuation that Cruz and others are making is that Obama doesn’t like Christians, and refuses to acknowledge the Islamic character of terrorism—maybe, they suggest, because of his character, or because of who he is. “I recognize that Barack Obama does not wish to defend this country,” Cruz said.

Later, Rand Paul got into it with Marco Rubio, questioning whether the Florida senator’s promises to build up the military and provide costly tax credits for moderate-income families could be described as conservative. (Rubio, as smooth as ever, insisted that they could.) There was even a discussion of too-big-to-fail banks and how to prevent a repeat of the collapse of 2008.

Indeed, Cruz almost had a Rick Perry moment when he seemed to forget one of the five federal agencies that he has promised to abolish. Unlike Perry, who got caught in a similar predicament during one of the G.O.P. debates in 2011, Cruz saved himself by naming the Department of Commerce twice.

So did Bush, which, admittedly, isn’t saying much. “You’ll see a different Jeb Bush,” Al Cardenas, one of his Floridian pals, had promised, and so we did—up to a point. In his first answer, Bush promised to repeal virtually every regulatory rule that President Obama has introduced and took a swipe at Hillary Clinton, earning himself a sympathetic cheer from the crowd. Then, after Kasich had torn into Trump’s deportation plan, describing it as a “silly” proposal that “makes no sense,” Bush stepped in and backed the Ohio governor up.","3257","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"

And it would send a signal that we’re not the kind of country that I know America is.” Maybe it was the influence of his new media coach, but, for once, Bush seemed exercised. “Even having this conversation sends a powerful signal,” he went on. “They’re doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this. That’s the problem with this. We have to win the Presidency. And the way you win the Presidency is to have practical plans. Lay them out there.” With that, he moved briefly on to his own immigration plan, which includes a so-called path to citizenship for undocumented workers who obey the law.","3258","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"By Bush’s previous standards, this was practically Lincoln-versus-Douglas material. It also drew in Cruz, who, on this issue, is broadly aligned with Trump. After brushing aside a question about government spending, Cruz turned Bush’s words back on him, commenting, “You know, what was said was right. The Democrats are laughing—because if Republicans join Democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose.” While the mainstream media doesn’t often cover immigration as an economic issue, Cruz continued, “I can tell you, for millions of Americans at home watching this, it is a very personal economic issue. And I will say the politics of it will be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande. Or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press. Then we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation. And I will say for those of us who believe people ought to come to this country legally, and we should enforce the law, we’re tired of being told it’s anti-immigrant. It’s offensive.”","3259","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"Cruz, as I said, is a good debater. There is a larger point here, too, though. This brief exchange exhibited the ideological and policy gulf that divides the Republican Party and will make it so difficult for a candidate like Bush, Kasich, or even Rubio, who has also endorsed a path to citizenship, to win the G.O.P. nomination.

"It is for this reason, perhaps, that the actual content of the debates (as opposed to the surrounding theatre) hasn’t mattered very much so far—at least as far as determining the leaders in the opinion polls. By any objective measure, Trump has put up two or three poor performances. Once again, last night, he drifted out of the discussion for extended periods. Even when he was involved, he sometimes seemed to be struggling with policy details. Asked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he delivered a lengthy rant about Chinese currency manipulation, only for Paul to remind him that China isn’t a signatory to the agreement. At one point, he snapped at Kasich, saying, “I don’t have to hear from this man, believe me.” And he complained about Carly Fiorina interrupting him, which came across as ungracious, to put it kindly.","3261","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"

A Republican Administration was the first to put such a system in place. The Reagan Administration used a cap-and-trade approach to phase out lead in gasoline. Then, under President George H. W. Bush, the U.S. set up a cap-and-trade system to curb power-plant emissions of sulfur dioxide. Under President Bill Clinton, the U.S. remained committed to the concept, so much so that the administration insisted that a cap-and-trade provision be included in the Kyoto Protocol. (Although the U.S. subsequently rejected the Protocol, the Europeans, who had resisted the idea of cap-and-trade, ended up establishing an E.U.-wide trading system.)","3269","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"
"Somewhere along the line, Republicans turned against cap-and-trade, branding it as “cap-and-tax,” and this brings us to today’s irony. During his first term, President Obama tried to get a cap-and-trade system implemented for carbon emissions. He’s often been criticized for not having tried hard enough, a criticism that’s probably fair. However, as the President pointed out in a recent interview with Rolling Stone, there weren’t enough votes in the Senate to get the bill through without some G.O.P. support, and none was forthcoming. Indeed, even Democrats were balking.","3270","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"

"In his second term, Obama has turned to regulations to limit carbon emissions. Most significantly, the Environmental Protection Agency has issued a series of new rules to cut power-plant emissions. From a political perspective, this turn is laudable; doing something about climate change is certainly better than doing nothing. However, from an economic standpoint, it’s regrettable that things have come to such a pass; it’s likely—many would say inevitable—that, on a ton-for-ton basis, the regulations will prove more costly than a cap-and-trade system would have.","3272","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"
"All of this is not to say that a cap-and-trade system is a panacea, or that the Chinese embrace of the idea is suddenly going to solve the world’s carbon-emissions problem, which is now on the order of ten billion metric tons a year. Carbon trading systems are tricky to design; early on, for example, the Europeans handed out too many credits, with the result that their system very nearly collapsed and even now is just barely functional. Few details have been provided on what China—which now accounts for more than a quarter of global emissions—is planning. One obvious question is how high the cap will be. Another is how the system will be enforced. Reliable data in China are hard to come by, and no one at this point even has very good information on who is emitting how much.","3273","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-china-achieve-with-cap-and-trade"

"Under the timetable announced today, it will still be several years before anyone will know whether the Chinese can develop an effective carbon-trading program.

"The most notorious example of American hostility to vulnerable outsiders came on the eve of the Second World War, when the U.S. government refused to admit many Jewish refugees from Hitler. The voyage of the ship called the St. Louis, which left Hamburg on May 13, 1939, with nine hundred and thirty-seven mostly Jewish refugees on board, provides the most heartbreaking example of the consequences of American policy. After a stop in Cuba (which didn’t want the refugees, either), the ship was turned away from Florida when it was so close that passengers could see the lights of Miami. Back in Europe, two hundred and fifty-four of those passengers ultimately died in the Holocaust.","3278","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/two-american-answers-to-the-refugee-question"

"During the war, the government, and the courts, turned on a different vulnerable minority. In Korematsu v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld, by a vote of six to three, the exclusion of Japanese-American citizens from much of the West Coast of the United States. As with a curfew imposed on Japanese-Americans, which the Court also upheld, the decision said that “exclusion of those of Japanese origin was deemed necessary because of the presence of an unascertained number of disloyal members of the group, most of whom we have no doubt were loyal to this country. It was because we could not reject the finding of the military authorities that it was impossible to bring about an immediate segregation of the disloyal from the loyal that we sustained the validity of the curfew order as applying to the whole group.”","3280","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/two-american-answers-to-the-refugee-question"
"Several facts stand out about the Korematsu decision. It was written by Hugo Black, a justice who otherwise had a sterling reputation as a civil libertarian. It was argued in October, 1944, and decided in December of that year—a time when America’s victory in the war in the Pacific, if not the date of Japan’s surrender, was already a foregone conclusion. There was no evidence presented that any specific Japanese-Americans presented a threat to the war effort; the Court said only that it could not evaluate any such claims if they had been made. Fear, not facts, justified the Court’s conclusion.","3281","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/two-american-answers-to-the-refugee-question"
"Nor can these examples be dismissed as ancient history. As Rick Perlstein pointed out in his 2014 book, “The Invisible Bridge,” the Vietnamese boat people, who were refugees from a war that the United States conducted, were widely despised and feared when they arrived in 1975. Perlstein quotes the famous Harvard sociologist David Riesman, who said at the time, “The national mood is poisonous and dangerous and this is one symptom—striking out at helpless refugees whose number is infinitesimal.” Sound familiar?

In the 1975 Vietnamese crisis, for example, President Gerald Ford expressed himself in words nearly identical to those of President Obama last week. “We can afford to be generous to refugees,” Ford said, “as a matter of principle.” Many Americans (like me) can trace their ancestries to times in our history when we opened our doors to victims of famine in Ireland, pogroms in Russia, or other natural and man-made disasters. But it’s simply not the case that this kind of generosity defines “who we are.” Sometimes it does, and sometimes, like now, apparently, it doesn’t.

"The idea that “our guys should talk” and do something—anything—to bring order to a chaotic field of candidates may hold some attraction for the Republican Party this time around. There has been amazement that the field still stands at fourteen (or sixteen, if you count broadly). When the exchange between Clinton and Edwards took place, the Democrats had eight candidates, and that seemed like a lot, even though it was four months earlier in the cycle than it is now. In thinking about why the Republicans’ numbers have somehow not been winnowed, and the possible risks in forcing that question, the Edwards-Clinton exchange is instructive, too.","3287","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"
"At the time of the forum, Clinton was in first place in the polls, with numbers in the high thirties, and Edwards was in third, polling in the teens. They were both “serious”: Clinton was a senator and a former First Lady; Edwards was a former senator and the 2004 Vice-Presidential candidate (he hadn’t yet lapsed into National Enquirer absurdity). In between them, in second place and polling in the twenties, was freshman Senator Barack Obama, followed by a single-digit panoply of Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson, Joe Biden, Chris Dodd, and, not quite registering statistically, Mike Gravel. When the hot-mic video came out, the “not serious” candidates, particularly Kucinich and Gravel, were understandably angry: there was talk among their supporters of an establishment conspiracy. Obama, though, with numbers that would put him at the top of the G.O.P. field now, wasn’t going to be brushed away.","3288","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"
"What would it mean if something like the Clinton and Edwards plan was enacted today, and the front-runners in the G.O.P. race got together and swept away the single-digit guys? Currently, only Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Marco Rubio would be in the race, with Ted Cruz almost in the running. Jeb Bush would be long gone. (Even through 2012’s odd moments, like the brief Herman Cain spike, Mitt Romney’s numbers never fell so implausibly low.) The establishment bid for seriousness seems to be to keep the field broad enough to encompass its credentialed but low-performing candidates. When several of the candidates’ guys talked this weekend about the structure of the debates, the idea was not to get a smaller group but to perpetuate a large one. (Ryan Lizza has more on those discussions, from which Trump, notably, withdrew, and which may be breaking down.) What is a “gotcha” question, after all, but an attempt to identify disqualifiers, and get the numbers down? Megyn Kelly, of Fox News, correctly characterized the candidates’ various requests for improving debates, which include giving them approval over onscreen graphics and room temperature, by asking if they also wanted “foot massages.” What they really seem to want is for someone to keep massaging the poll numbers. The idea seems to be for everyone to keep hanging on until, miraculously, the Trump-Carson dynamic fundamentally changes. But how?","3289","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"
"To say that Trump and Carson are not serious candidates is to say that the Republican electorate is not serious. And that judgment, despite the hollowness of the candidates’ ideas, is unfair in one important way. As George Packer writes in this week’s magazine, the Republican Party has failed to respond to the real concerns, fear, and even desperation on the part of many of its traditional voters. Trump’s support is the product not of frivolity but of pain. How profound that pain might be can be seen in another set of numbers, distinct from the political race, about the rising and unexpected mortality among white, middle-aged men without a college degree. They are dying more not because of obesity or heart disease but because of suicide and substance abuse—the physical manifestations of, among other things, disquiet and displacement. The numbers in the study, carried out by Princeton University economists, caught public-health professionals by surprise. If nothing else, the study shows that there are deep pools of unhappiness in this country that the experts don’t understand.

The limitations of their notion had become clear by the time it was effectively a three-person race, and they lost. (In the 2008 Iowa caucuses, Obama won thirty-eight per cent, Edwards thirty per cent, and Clinton twenty-nine.) Indeed, watching the open-mic video now, the most pertinent point is that neither Edwards nor Clinton was, ultimately, the Democratic Party’s nominee.

The point—the only point—is that, everywhere else, that person rants in isolation or on his keyboard; only in America do we cheerfully supply him with military-style weapons to express his rage.

Like it or not, according to this argument, the Constitution limits our ability to control the number and kinds of guns in private hands.

This sense can be summed up in a sentence: if the Founders hadn’t wanted guns to be regulated, and thoroughly, they would not have put the phrase “well regulated” in the amendment.

Anyone who wants to both grasp that decision’s radicalism and get a calm, instructive view of what the Second Amendment does say, and was intended to say, and was always before been understood to say, should read Justice John Paul Stevens’s brilliant, persuasive dissent in that case.

"Stevens, a Republican judge appointed by a Republican President, brilliantly analyzes the history of the amendment, making it plain that for Scalia, et al., to arrive at their view, they have to reference not the deliberations that produced the amendment but, rather, bring in British common law and lean on interpretations that arose long after the amendment was passed. Both “keep arms” and “bear arms,” he demonstrates, were, in the writers’ day, military terms used in military contexts. (Gary Wills has usefully illuminated this truth in the New York Review of Books.) The intent of the Second Amendment, Stevens explains, was obviously to secure “to the people a right to use and possess arms in conjunction with service in a well-regulated militia.” The one seemingly sound argument in the Scalia decision—that “the people” in the Second Amendment ought to be the same “people” referenced in the other amendments, that is, everybody—is exactly the interpretation that the preamble was meant to guard against.","3298","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-second-amendment-is-a-gun-control-amendment"

"“You can make them vicious, violent, horrible questions, even though you’re sort of, probably, on live television,” Donald Trump said to the audience at a campaign event in Rochester, New Hampshire, on Thursday night. He was explaining the format of the event, something that he thought would be more “fun” than a speech—“which I’ve been doing over and over and over”—but the instructions could also be a shorthand for Trump’s theory of campaigning, if not of everyday life. In New Hampshire, he elicited ugliness, he got it, and, to all appearances, he relished it.","September 18, 2015","3320","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-man-in-the-t-shirt"

"“You know he’s not even an American,” the man continued, and at that Trump interrupted again, saying, “We need this question. This is the first question!” The word “first” was subsumed in a Donaldian chuckle—the kind that serves as an ambiguous indicator of both sarcasm and glee.","3325","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-man-in-the-t-shirt"

"Afterward, Trump was widely criticized for not correcting the man, for not acting, in fact, as that “loser” John McCain had, in 2008, when a questioner at one of his rallies described Barack Obama as “an Arab” whom she couldn’t trust. It would seem like the minimal act a decent candidate could undertake. One might ask the other Republicans in the race why they haven’t really found the opportunity to correct Trump—at this point, they’ve been on plenty of stages with him. On Friday, Lindsey Graham said that Trump should apologize for not acting as Graham’s friend McCain did, and Christie said that he would have handled the encounter differently—though he added that he didn’t want to “lecture” Trump. Otherwise, the Republican candidates were slow to speak. Trump is not just someone who stands by when the President’s faith, birthplace, or basic identity are put into question; he pushes that view. As recently as this July, when Anderson Cooper asked Trump if, with all the documentation out there, including a long-form birth certificate, he accepted that the President was born in America, Trump said, “I don’t know. I really don’t know.”","3328","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-man-in-the-t-shirt"
"But even more outrageous, this week, was Trump’s tolerance of the questioner’s premise: that Muslims in America are “a problem.” Calling Obama a Muslim is not wrong because being a Muslim is bad; it’s wrong because he is a Christian, and so “Muslim” becomes a shorthand for impostor and liar, for deceptive secret agent. Trump, though, went well beyond not defending the President: he affirmed an attack on the millions of Muslim Americans who are as much a part of the national community as anyone else. The man in the T-shirt’s actual point, after all, was about the supposed training camps “where they want to kill us.” He wanted Trump to answer his question: “When can we get rid of them?”","3329","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-man-in-the-t-shirt"
"The campaign did say, according to the Washington Post, that it understood “them” to refer to the “training camps,” not to a potential ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population as a whole. A campaign official also said that Trump was focussed on the part of the question about this larger phantom threat, and not on the part about Obama’s religion—as if entertaining an insult to an entire community, rather than just to the President, were a defense. Trump’s own statement seemed to underscore the man in the Trump T-shirt’s fears: “The media wants to make this issue about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country. Christians need support in this country. Their religious liberty is at stake.” Donald Trump, Christian warrior.","3330","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-man-in-the-t-shirt"

Jeb Bush, too, has made the case that the problem with Trump is that he is inadequately conservative—as if, with Trump’s talk of building walls, the G.O.P. were being pestered by a moderate in its midst. Perhaps his comments in New Hampshire will persuade his competitors to confront his extremism instead. So far, they have been too fearful or too eager for the votes of people like the man in the T-shirt. Or maybe they agree; Ben Carson, for one, has talked about the possibility of staged civil disorder leading to the cancellation of elections.

And he had another opportunity to do so when, later in the event, another questioner rose to say, “I applaud the gentleman who brought up the Muslim training camps here in the U.S.A.—the F.B.I. knows all about that.” To which Trump replied, again, “right.”","3332","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-man-in-the-t-shirt"

It can seem, though, as if they are not only listening to him but as if he is listening to them. Trump is learning the practice of politics in halls echoing with American paranoia. There has always been a strain of that, and he is not alone in playing to it: a number of Republican senators solemnly presented themselves as concerned investigators of Jade Helm, a U.S. military training exercise that, in some circles, was presented as a dress rehearsal for martial law.

Lincoln Chafee, as he noted, was the liberal Republican, a once influential, though maybe not numerous, group that was long ago expelled from its original party but has not been fully accepted by its new one. Jim Webb was the Reagan Democrat—the military-culture white Southerner who leans conservative on social issues. Martin O’Malley was the urban Catholic white-ethnic liberal, representing what’s left of the old political machines that produced the Kennedys.

Yes, Hillary Clinton won the debate, and yes, she will be the Democratic nominee, but the big surprise of the Democratic campaign so far has been voters’ response to Sanders. A year ago, nobody would have predicted that of the other Democratic presidential candidates, Sanders would be the one who mattered.","3340","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"There seems to be more going on here than Sanders’s ability to take advantage of the atypicality of Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two voting states in the campaign for the nomination. More than the other candidates, he has a simple, clear, strong message, which he repeats constantly. The packaging—Brooklyn accent, bad hair—reinforces the sense of angry authenticity. And it’s worth noting that he’s obviously uncomfortable when forced outside the tight box of economic populism. That’s why he has trouble talking about Black Lives Matter and gun control.

"One aspect of Clinton’s adept performance last night was that at every opportunity, she tried to change the subject from her Democratic opponents to the Republicans. She knows they’re her real opponents, and a far more significant obstacle to her becoming President. So, on the evidence of the debate, how do her prospects look? Merely being prepared, assured, and on-message doesn’t guarantee victory. You also have to connect.","3342","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"The big, obvious gap between the two parties at this moment is on non-economic issues. In the Republican debates, it has been interesting to see how difficult a time the more moderate candidates have had creating any general-election breathing room for themselves on issues like abortion, gun control, marriage equality, and immigration. Conversely, it was interesting to see last night how completely comfortable Clinton has become with what not long ago were dangerously liberal positions, even for a Democrat, on these issues. This year Clinton and her party are obviously betting that social issues will break strongly their way. If they turn out to be wrong, that will be an unpleasant surprise for Clinton.","3343","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"The strong feelings that Sanders has tapped into present a greater challenge for Clinton. For one thing, the voters this year, in both parties, are in an anti-Establishment mood—that explains not just Sanders’s popularity, but also Donald Trump’s and Ben Carson’s. Clinton is part of the Establishment, and there’s no way around it. She was also the least anti-Wall Street candidate on the stage last night. It was almost surreal to see Anderson Cooper, the moderator, have to define Glass-Steagall—a Depression-era piece of financial regulation that Bill Clinton effectively repealed when he was President—because the candidates were so eager to talk about it that they forgot the first rule of debate training, which is never to get technical. Clinton noted that as a senator, she represented Wall Street, and her attempts to distance herself from it were obviously well rehearsed, but not even in Sanders’s range, emotionally.","3344","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"In the Times last week, Thomas Edsall wrote a counterintuitive column arguing that the Democrats have become, if not the party of the rich, the party that has the loyalty of most rich people. Clinton would never sign on to that sentiment, but Sanders’s challenge has forced her into speaking supportively about “capitalism” and “business”—not traditionally Democratic terms—onstage. And on the Republican side, though almost everyone’s rhetoric is anti-government, we have not heard defenses of Wall Street in response to the Democrats’ attacks. The Democrats don’t automatically own economic populism in this election.","3345","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"There is no chance that the Republican nominee, whoever it is, will talk like Bernie Sanders. But it’s almost certain that he will argue that, more than Clinton, he understands the behind-the-eight-ball feeling that pervades the American middle class, and propose to do a better job of fixing it than she would. Such an argument won’t necessarily come across as hollow just because it’s coming from a Republican. Bernie Sanders is getting at something powerful, which matters to a lot more people than socialists. Clinton’s biggest challenge is finding her way to a more powerful, and perhaps less prepared, way of persuading the disempowered middle class that she can be its champion.","3346","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"Like many parents, I suspect, my first reaction to the news of the shootings at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, on Thursday was to think of the families of the victims, and my second reaction was to turn away and mutter some obscenities. With the implacable grip that the gun lobby has on Congress, there is virtually no prospect of the United States following the example of nearly every other advanced country and restricting the supply of deadly firearms to civilians.

"Evidently, President Obama felt the same frustration and hopelessness that many others did. But rather than resigning himself to the situation, he went down to the White House briefing room and issued one of the most powerful statements that he has delivered since taking office. We should be grateful that he did. Even if it doesn’t do much immediate good, it will be there in the record, to remind historians where the primary blame lies for this ongoing national disgrace.","3348","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The President started out by saying some words about the victims and their families, and said, “America will wrap everyone who’s grieving with our prayers and our love.” Then he said, “It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America—next week, or a couple of months from now…. We are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.”","3349","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Earlier this year, the President recalled, he made this point in an interview, noting that the country persists with lax gun laws despite repeated mass killings. “And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day! Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to this.”","3350","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Obama’s emotion—his anger—was palpable. He went on: “We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out. We need more guns, they’ll argue. Fewer gun-safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?”","3351","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Whether they believe it or not, supporters of the gun lobby were already out there making this argument—on cable shows, on conservative Web sites, and on social media. Some of them argued that the shooter targeted Umpqua Community College because it was a “gun-free zone,” a claim that has been disputed. Others accused President Obama of playing politics—apparently ignorant of, or oblivious to, the fact that he had already addressed this very criticism.","3352","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"“What’s also routine is that somebody, somewhere, will comment and say, ‘Obama politicized this issue,’ ” the President said. “Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.” He challenged news organizations to “tally up the number of Americans who’ve been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who’ve been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports.” He went on: “We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?”","3353","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"We all know the answer.","3354","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The Republican Party has long exercised a veto on any meaningful addition to the gun laws. And among its current crop of Presidential candidates, there is no sign of anybody breaking ranks. Reaction to the shooting ranged from nonexistent to predictably depressing. As far as I could see, Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina, the third- and fourth-place candidates in the polls, didn’t say anything on Thursday about what had happened in Oregon. In a message on Twitter, Jeb Bush called the massacre a “senseless tragedy.” Donald Trump, in an interview with the Washington Post, referred to it as a “terrible tragedy.” He also said, “It sounds like another mental-health problem. So many of these people, they’re coming out of the woodwork.” Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, took a similar line. “Obviously, there are those who are going to be calling for gun control,” he said on “The Hugh Hewitt Show.” “Obviously, that’s not the issue. The issue is the mentality of these people.”","3355","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"That is a familiar trope, of course: it’s not the guns that are the problem, it’s the shooters. There was no suggestion from anybody on the Republican side that what had happened might justify a reconsideration of gun laws, let alone a significant recasting of them. Even those G.O.P. candidates who have previously expressed support for some forms of gun control, such as Chris Christie and George Pataki, didn’t have anything to say on that subject.","3356","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The Democratic candidates, by contrast, were united in calling for action. Speaking to reporters in Massachusetts, Hillary Clinton said, “We have got to get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe.” She suggested that it wasn’t a hopeless task: “I know there is a way to have sensible gun-control measures that help prevent violence, prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands, and save lives. And I am committed to doing everything I can to achieve that.” Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, said in a tweet, “Tweets won’t stop this. Thoughts and prayers won’t either. Only real gun reforms will stop mass shootings from occurring nearly every day.” Bernie Sanders, who has been accused by Clinton allies of shifting his positions on gun control, called for “sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them.”","3357","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"But Democrats aren’t entirely blameless. After experiencing a political backlash during the nineteen-nineties, when the Clinton Administration pushed through gun-control measures that included a ban on assault weapons, too many members of the Party adopted a craven approach as, during the Bush years, Republicans in Congress rolled back some of the reforms. Even President Obama, who urged for stricter gun control during his 2008 campaign, can’t entirely escape criticism. During his first term, when for two years the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, his Administration didn’t propose any actual gun-control legislation. It wasn’t until 2013, after the massacre in Newtown, that the White House made a serious effort to persuade Congress to act—one that failed in the face of implacable Republican opposition.","3358","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"If you listened closely to Obama on Thursday, you would have noticed that, in his words of anger and despair, he didn’t entirely spare himself, or the rest of us, from responsibility. “This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America,” he said. “We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.”","3359","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"That is true. But it is also true, as Obama pointed out, that “this is not something I can do by myself.” To break through the politics of hopelessness, it will evidently take something more than blood—the blood of women, men, children, teachers, pastors, janitors, pensioners, first responders, anybody who happens to be in the way—being shed. “I hope and pray that I don’t have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances,” Obama said. “But based on my experience as President, I can’t guarantee that.”","3360","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Tuesday’s headline in the world of U.S. politics is that Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, has moved ahead of Donald Trump in a CBS News/New York Times poll of likely Republican-primary voters. The survey shows Carson with twenty-six per cent of the vote, and Trump with twenty-two per cent. The rest of the candidates are lagging far behind, in the single figures.","October 27, 2015","3361","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Since the start of October, half a dozen polls have shown Carson leading in Iowa, where evangelical Christians, who are flocking to his candidacy, make up about half of the Republican electorate. But the CBS/Times poll is the first major survey to indicate that Carson is ahead at the national level. Coming as it does the day before the third Republican debate, which will be held on Wednesday night in Boulder, Colorado, the numbers are sure to inspire headlines about whether Carson can win the nomination, and whether the long-predicted Trump slump is finally upon us.","3362","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Such speculation is probably premature. While the Democratic race appears to have settled into a predictable pattern—centrist favorite versus progressive underdog—the Republican race is still a freak show, to borrow a term popular with political operatives. Carson is now enjoying his moment, but more ups and downs can be expected, with other candidates rising and falling. As for Trump, strange as it would have sounded a couple of months ago, his presence at the top of the polls has become the one fixture in the race.","3363","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Arguably, the most important finding in the new poll isn’t the four-point gap that Carson has opened up over Trump—which, in any case, is within the survey’s margin of error. The key number is twenty-eight per cent. That’s the proportion of respondents who said that they had already made their minds up about which candidate to vote for: fewer than one in three. As a Times story about the poll put it, “Seven in 10 of those who expressed support for a candidate said it was too early to say for sure who they would support.”","3364","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"These figures aren’t too surprising. The Iowa caucus is still more than three months away, and the primary is proving to be quite a spectacle. If you were a potential G.O.P. voter, wouldn’t you sit back and enjoy the show for a while before deciding whom to vote for? Wouldn’t you be tempted to flirt with one or two of the candidates, especially the ones who seem new and different? It’s not as if we haven’t seen this sort of behavior before. In the last week of October, 2011, Herman Cain, the “9-9-9” man, was leading in the G.O.P. polls. A couple of weeks later, his campaign went into a free fall, and in December he dropped out of the race.","3365","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"I am not suggesting that Carson is another Cain, who was hit with allegations that he had made unwanted sexual advances toward women, and that he had been involved in at least one long-term extramarital affair. From what we know about Carson, his personal life and professional life are above reproach: that’s one reason why many Republicans are warming to him. (Another reason is that he has adopted ultra-conservative positions on abortion, gun control, and other social issues.) My point is simply that, at this stage in the campaign, the G.O.P. electorate is volatile, and much of Carson’s support is provisional. The CBS/Times poll explicitly confirms this. Four out of five of Carson’s supporters say that it’s too early to say for certain that they will vote for him.","3366","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"As for Trump, his impending demise has been announced many times before. This is just one poll. Another survey, released on Monday by the firm Morning Consult, showed him leading Carson by thirty-five per cent to twenty per cent. Since that poll was conducted over the Internet, it was probably less reliable than the CBS/Times survey, which was a telephone poll that relied on both landlines and cell phones. But the rule with polls is to look at the averages of multiple surveys, rather than at individual results. And, according to the Real Clear Politics poll average, Trump is still leading Carson by almost five percentage points—26.8 per cent to twenty-two per cent—nationwide.","3367","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"To be sure, Trump’s advantage has narrowed sharply since the end of August, when he was way ahead. But the fact is that he has been leading the race for more than three months. After a lacklustre performance at the second Republican debate, on September 16th, his numbers fell back. Since then, though—at least, prior to the CBS/Times poll—they appeared to have rebounded to the high twenties. This persistence suggests that Trump, in defiance of the general pattern of volatility, has established a base of support that amounts to somewhere between a fifth and a third of the Republican electorate. Unlike Carson’s supporters, a majority of Trump’s backers—fifty-five per cent of them, according to the CBS/Times poll—seem to have made up their minds about their choice.","3368","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Of course, winning over a quarter of the primary electorate won’t be sufficient to carry Trump to the nomination. With up to half of potential Republican voters telling pollsters that they won’t back him under any circumstances, he faces serious obstacles to expanding his support. Still, unless something dramatic and unexpected happens, his presence in the race seems likely to remain its defining feature for at least a while. And that, in turn, means that the main task facing the other candidates is to navigate a way around him.","3369","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"So far, most of the traditional politicians in the field have struggled mightily to do this, especially Jeb Bush (whose troubles I considered a couple of days ago) and the now-departed Scott Walker. Carson, radiating calm and exploiting his status as a non-politician politician, has fared much better. Now, however, he will be in the spotlight, with higher expectations, more media attention, and more potshots coming at him from Trump and others. “It really is like a cleansing action,” Trump said Tuesday, on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “A lot of things will come out now, and we’ll see how he holds up to the scrutiny.” Beginning tomorrow night in Colorado, we certainly will.","3370","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"

One of my roles, very important in the United States Senate, is to be a shomer, to be the shomer Yisrael”—the guardian of Israel—“and I will continue to be that with every bone in my body.” Schumer and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s efforts to rally Democratic opposition to President Obama’s Iran nuclear deal have now failed. On Tuesday, the support of Senators Richard Blumenthal, Ron Wyden, and Gary Peters assured Obama that any Republican resolution of disapproval would not even come up for a vote. But the extraordinary identity Schumer was claiming—to be a “guardian of Israel,” without apparent fear of being at odds with American foreign policy or the Democratic Party—may be the greater loss. It’s hard to see how AIPAC, and Schumer, come out of the Iran fight with the authority they had going in.","September 9, 2015","3371","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s story, which he is sticking to, is that Israel and AIPAC have won a moral victory. Dore Gold, the director-general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, told Israel’s Army Radio that Netanyahu never intended to keep the deal from being approved but rather to raise awareness about its perils. “Most of Congress is against the deal,” as is Isaac Herzog, who leads the opposition in the Knesset, Gold added. He then returned to the claims that Netanyahu made in his speech before Congress in March—that the deal was bad, that it endangered Israel—which might have been mistaken for an attempt to convince American legislators to reject it.","3372","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"AIPAC’s influence was first advanced, in the nineteen-seventies, by hard-line Democratic senators like Henry Jackson and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who felt that the State Department was controlled by Eisenhower-era Republicans who were too indebted to oil interests and not adequately sympathetic to Israel’s plight. Ever since AIPAC managed to coördinate the defeat of Republican Senator Charles Percy, in 1984 (Percy was then the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and had argued that Jewish settlements preëmpt Palestinian rights), AIPAC has been able to present itself as a powerhouse, flush with money, focussed on Congress, and with strong claims on both Republican hawks and evangelicals and the Democratic center. Tom Dine and Steven Grossman, AIPAC leaders in the eighties and nineties, were Democratic operatives; Grossman went on to become the chairman of the Democratic National Committee under Bill Clinton. President Obama courted AIPAC’s support in 2008, assuring attendees of its yearly conference that Jerusalem would be “undivided.”","3373","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Israel, in AIPAC’s playbook, is the best judge of its defense needs, a sister democracy, and, besides, a strategic asset in a volatile region. (It proved this for the first time in September, 1970, when Israeli jets helped protect the Jordanian monarch from a Palestinian insurgency and Syrian invasion.) Schumer’s opposition to the Iran deal was supposed to signal that AIPAC remained influential among Democratic principals and fund-raisers, and that the man who chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2005 to 2009, and is now the favorite to lead Senate Democrats when Harry Reid retires, could still fend off challenges to Israeli policy—if, for example, the U.N. Security Council were to vote on another resolution condemning West Bank settlements. The signal, meant to be cautionary, seems rather weak.","3374","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Even if, as some claim, Schumer came out against Obama only because he knew he could not muster the votes to override a Presidential veto, he surely expected to make a better showing. Now progressive groups like MoveOn have rallied Democratic insurgents to call Schumer’s prospective Senate leadership into question. AIPAC officials know that Netanyahu is to blame for emancipating Democrats from AIPAC’s embrace. “Netanyahu’s speech in Congress made the Iranian issue a partisan one,” an AIPAC official told Israel’s Walla!News. “As soon as he insisted on going ahead with this move, which was perceived as a Republican maneuver against the President, we lost a significant part of the Democratic Party, without which it was impossible to block the agreement.” AIPAC’s efforts to exploit Herzog’s opposition to the deal were almost as counterproductive, given that the deal has the support of Israeli Army and intelligence leaders. Amos Yadlin, the man who Herzog said would have been his defense minister, had he defeated Netanyahu, said that the deal should not be opposed.* As Channel Two’s veteran analyst Amnon Abramovitch told me, “Herzog’s effort to gain some reputation for ‘security’ and lean to the center is an understandable political move. But Iran is a subject that inevitably involves Israeli-American relations, and here Herzog got messed up.”","3375","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Schumer’s declaration of guardianship is not only a political but also a personal statement, and part of how many Jewish Americans of his generation understand their secular Jewish distinctiveness. It conjures the embattled, vulnerable Jews of their parents’ generation, in what often appears to be a passion play. If there is a Netanyahu at the center of this history, it is not Benjamin, the son, but Benzion, the father, who, in the early nineteen-forties, was one of the leaders of the Revisionist Zionism movement in the U.S. and, with Hillel Kook (then known as Peter Bergson), helped found the Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People of Europe. Kook and Netanyahu publicly railed against American Jewish leaders like Rabbi Stephen Wise, who was close to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, for not doing enough to raise public consciousness about the plight of European Jews. “They cannot claim, with a clear conscience, to have done everything within their power to save those condemned people,” Benzion Netanyahu wrote in 1944. “They have been too cautious, too appeasing, and too ready to swallow the meaningless statements of sympathy that were issued from high places.”","3376","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"American Jewish leaders of his son’s generation won’t make that mistake again. AIPAC’s push against the deal included a write-in campaign and a multimillion-dollar stream of television ads, under a new 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization called Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran. When Obama and the Administration’s nuclear experts appeared to be persuasive on nuclear issues, AIPAC tried to shift the conversation from Iran’s nuclear threat to its capacity, if sanctions were lifted, to fund violence in the region. (“Iran will receive up to $150 billion,” an AIPAC fact sheet warns. “Iran could then dramatically bolster its support for international terrorism.”) More and more, the Iran deal became more symbolic than strategic: if the President really cared about Israel, then he would take its side. “He accommodated radical Islamist theocrats when he should have insisted on the opposite, that the survival of Israel is non-negotiable. In effect, he betrayed the trust of the Jewish state,” Mort Zuckerman wrote even before the deal was done. In other words, as Leon Wieseltier told a reporter last month, Obama is “the first U.S. President who doesn’t really have a special feeling for Israel.”","3377","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Fortunately, that sensibility has not passed down easily to younger generations. AIPAC’s liberal rival, J Street, strongly advocated for the deal; it has an endorsement list that has grown from about two dozen candidates in 2008 to nearly a hundred for the coming election year. On the whole, Todd Gitlin and Steven M. Cohen wrote last month in the Washington Post, Jewish Americans are more likely than other Americans to support the deal. Only a fifth of Jewish Americans under forty, who are also less likely to be affiliated with synagogues and communal organizations, oppose it, according to an L.A. Jewish Journal survey from mid-July, which Cohen directed. But Jewish leaders tend to be older and more conservative than the Jewish population as a whole, as Cohen found in an earlier study, and more grounded in what the historian Salo Baron famously called the “lachrymose conception of Jewish history.”","3378","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"(Ironically, Hillel Kook, who died in 2001—and whom I knew at the end of his life—could not adjust to AIPAC’s rhetoric, either. He had returned to Tel Aviv in 1948 and sat in the first Knesset, but he rejected Likud’s evolution, including its satisfaction with a religious “Jewish state,” with which American Jews easily identified. For Kook, Zionism meant a secular “Hebrew republic,” which would have a Western-style constitution with a Bill of Rights, and exist beside a Palestinian state. He hoped Israelis would avoid what the writer Arthur Koestler called “claustrophilia.” Kook lacked, presumably, “a special feeling for Israel.”)","3379","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Netanyahu wants us to believe that the fifteen-year duration of the Iran deal is a historical “blink of an eye,” as he told Congress in March. His implicit message is that he does not expect the regional status quo to significantly change: he assumes that the settlement project will continue growing, that Palestinians will remain in despair and disarray, and that ayatollahs will remain fixated on Israel. Democrats have rejected that message, but Netanyahu retains some influence over the deal’s eventual implementation. “The provisions are complex,” Steven Simon, the former senior director for Middle East and North Africa affairs in the Obama White House, told me. “Iran will exploit this, and Israeli analysts will claim cheating.” If Iran can be presented as not in compliance, it does “raise the spectre of military action,” Simon added. Still, the presumption that any Israeli government deserves the benefit of the doubt seems obsolete. In 2010, after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton complained about Netanyahu’s settlement policy, Schumer told a conservative radio host that he had persuaded three-quarters of the Senate to sign a letter “rebuking the Administration for these confrontational stances toward Israel.” Would he even attempt this today?","3380","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"

"There was a time—how often has this sentence been written?—when the Republican Party stood for certain ideas, even if they sometimes contradicted each other: for instance, antipathy toward high marginal tax rates and a belief in balanced budgets. On issues involving national security and economic emergencies, many were willing to entertain, and even seek, coöperation from Democrats, as happened after the financial collapse of 2008. It was the approach taken by our postwar (or post-New Deal) Republican Presidents, up to and including George W. Bush, even if the party went through occasional ideological swerves, as when it nominated the sometimes alarming conservative Arizona senator Barry Goldwater, in 1964. But the real live-and-let-live Goldwater, popular with his Senate colleagues, never fully fit his scary image.","October 1, 2015","3382","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"The emergence of the Republican Class of ’16 may be changing the shape of historic Republicanism once and for all. Part of it stems from the “outsiders”—Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina, who have never held elective office and probably never will. But no one better embodies this change than the freshman Texas senator Ted Cruz, who seems unable to stop talking, although the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, recently outsmarted him, as Politico’s Burgess Everett put it, by effectively putting him in party “quarantine.” (McConnell, like past Senate leaders such as Howard Baker and Bob Dole, has the job here of representing the sanity wing of the party.) Cruz, though, knows where to find receptive audiences, as when he recently spoke to the conservative religious Values Voter Summit, in Washington, and went on to win the group’s straw poll, for the third year in a row. (Cruz got thirty-five per cent, followed by Carson, at eighteen per cent, and Mike Huckabee, the perennial champion of his own values, at fourteen per cent.)","3383","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Cruz still surprises. Just when you think he can’t go any further, he goes further. Considering the venue, you can understand why he got an appreciative laugh at the “Values” meeting when he mentioned Xi Jinping’s meeting with President Obama and said, “Media all across the world are reporting on this historic meeting of the world’s most powerful Communist, and the President of China.” (Drum roll.) But his ear has difficulty recognizing the proper key. A few days after Vice-President Joe Biden’s son Beau died, of a brain tumor, Cruz was having his fun: “Joe Biden … You know what the nice thing is? You don’t even need a punch line. I promise you, it works. At the next party you’re at, just walk up to someone and say, ‘Vice-President Joe Biden,’ and just close your mouth. They will crack up laughing.” That wasn’t nearly as funny as the Obama-is-a-big-Communist gag, and perhaps that’s why Cruz offered an apology.","3384","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"On foreign policy, Cruz is even less funny, as when he dilated on the Iran nuclear deal: “If you vote for me, under no circumstances will a nation led by a theocratic Ayatollah, who chants ‘Death to America,’ under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.” So far, that is pretty much what Obama says. Cruz, though, added, “If the Ayatollah doesn’t understand that, we may have to introduce him to his seventy-two virgins,” which sounded very much like a threat to murder Iran’s Supreme Leader. Cruz did not approve of recent Supreme Court decisions that upheld the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage. His solution, as he told Steve Inskeep, of NPR’s “Morning Edition,” is a constitutional amendment—“one that would make members of the Supreme Court subject to periodic judicial retention elections … [so that] if judges overstep their bounds, violate the Constitution, then the people have a check to remove them from office.” This was an attack on a branch of government far more radical than Franklin D. Roosevelt’s infamous “court packing” scheme, in 1937, to add as many as six members when Justices reached age seventy and didn’t retire.","3385","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Sounding mean-spirited and over the top is nothing new in American politics. Senator Joseph McCarthy, to whom Cruz bears a slight physical resemblance (it’s the eyebrows), made use of the Red Scare to attack Democrats. McCarthy, like Louisiana’s Huey Long, belonged to a subcategory of demagogic, disruptive senators, a role that suits Cruz perfectly. McCarthy never ran for President.","3386","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Cruz’s thoughts and language bring to mind the 1993 American Scholar essay “Defining Deviancy Down,” by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (though not Moynihan himself). In it, Moynihan writes, “I proffer the thesis that, over the past generation … the amount of deviant behavior in American society has increased beyond the levels the community can ‘afford to recognize’ and that, accordingly, we have been re-defining deviancy so as to exempt much conduct previously stigmatized, and also quietly raising the ‘normal’ level in categories where behavior is now abnormal by any earlier standard.” Moynihan was writing about crime and antisocial behavior in general, but the change in standards might just as well apply to politics. That someone like Ted Cruz is running for President, and taken seriously—that nearly sixty per cent of Republicans now support, in aggregate, Trump, Fiorina, Carson, and Cruz—suggests that the modern Republican Party is close to “defining politics down.” With more than a year to go before the next Presidential election, Cruz may be posing the essential question: “How far down?”","3387","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"In November, 1954, Dwight D. Eisenhower was mulling a matter that he mulled with some frequency: the effects of age on someone in a stressful, non-stop job like his. He’d been President for nearly two years and, in his diary, wrote down some of the reasons why seeking a second term might be a bad idea: “The greater likelihood that a man of 70 will break down under a load than a man of 50,” a need for “younger men in positions of the highest responsibility so as to symbolize the youth, vigor and virility of the Republican Party,” and, perhaps above all, the “growing severity and complexity of problems that rest upon the President for solution.” As far as he knew, he was in good shape, but intimations of mortality shadowed him, and he thought a lot about the next political generation. At a White House political dinner a few days before Christmas, he said, “We have got to begin right now, at the state level and at the precinct level, to see to it that the Party puts up the right kind of young man to run in ’56. All the programs in the world, and all the Eisenhower prestige, cannot elect some revolting old Republican hack against a youthful, able, and personable Democrat.”","September 23, 2015","3388","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"Modern readers will note a certain gender bias in phrases like “a man of 70,” “the right kind of young man,” and “virility,” and should know that these somewhat depressed observations came soon after the midterms, in which Democrats took control of the Senate and House, by majorities that the party would keep for decades. Eisenhower’s worries became far more intense several months later, in late September, 1955, when he suffered a major heart attack.","3389","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"This is a roundabout way of getting to the sensitive, impolite subject of when, if ever, a candidate might be too old for the Presidency. It is a question whose premise, in an era when the word “ageism” is embedded in the language, many are inclined to reject, in part because the motives for asking it tend to be suspect. The thuggish wing of the talk-radio community uses the age question to undermine Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, who will be sixty-eight in October. That makes her more than a year younger than Donald Trump, although age is the least of many concerns about him. Age should certainly count a lot less than the goofy ideas and inexperience demonstrated by too many Republicans. But the curious absence of a new political generation should concern Democrats, and a party whose other poll-leading 2016 candidates, declared and not, are Bernie Sanders, who is seventy-four, and Joe Biden, who will be seventy-three in November. (Barely registering in the polls are Jim Webb, who is sixty-nine, and Martin O’Malley, a relative teen at fifty-two.) Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Mike Huckabee are in their early sixties, but, for better or worse, Republicans also have half a dozen contenders in their forties and fifties. The distinct problem for the Democrats isn’t the presence of elders; it’s the absence of young women and men with the potential to be credible national candidates.","3390","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"

"In the early winter of 1956, as the next Presidential cycle began and Eisenhower recovered from his heart attack, he wrote to his childhood friend Edward E. (Swede) Hazlett to say, “We all know that when advancing years and diminishing energy begin to take their toll, the last one that ever appreciates such a situation is the victim himself.” In another letter, to a doctor who’d recently examined him and thought that he was healthy enough to run again, Ike expressed still more doubts. In “contemplating my own future duty,” he compared his job to that of a quarterback: “He may have all of the wisdom to be derived from years of experience in the game. But when the need arises, he has to throw himself unreservedly into the play…. If we merely needed a brain on the field, a quarterback could play if he had to be in a wheelchair; but that isn’t true in his case, nor is it in the Presidency.”","3392","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"At the end of February, 1956, a month after sending that letter, Eisenhower announced that he would indeed seek a second term, though he planned to let Vice-President Richard Nixon do most of the campaigning. Ike went on to win reëlection in a landslide. But his health was shakier than his doctors were willing to say, and he suffered two more serious medical alarms—ileitis, an intestinal condition, in the summer of 1956, and a minor stroke, in the fall of 1957. In October, 1960, he marked his seventieth birthday, which, until the Reagan era, made him the oldest President ever to serve.","3393","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"

During the 1956 campaign, the Democratic candidate, Adlai Stevenson, made an issue of Eisenhower’s health—and the possibility that Nixon, deeply hated by Democrats, might become President. Democrats, without a successor generation in clear view, may get lucky in 2016, especially facing a Republican field whose contenders include people who say, inexplicably, as they did in last week’s debate, that George W. Bush left the country safer (Jeb Bush), or that vaccines may cause autism (Trump), or that it’s worth shutting down the government to defund Planned Parenthood (Ted Cruz, Chris Christie). Sixty years ago, Eisenhower was willing to consider the nation’s welfare ahead of personal ambition.

"The moment Hillary Clinton seemed to realize that her testimony Thursday before the House Select Committee on Benghazi was not going to be a big problem for her or for her campaign came about forty-five minutes in. When the hearing opened, she had regarded the chairman, Trey Gowdy, of South Carolina, with irritated skepticism. She looked as if she might say something rash, if not throw something, and perhaps she might have. Nearly three years ago, in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Benghazi, she lashed out after having been asked many times about U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice’s comments on the Sunday talk shows about what had instigated the attack, on September 11, 2012, in which four Americans, including Chris Stevens, the Ambassador to Libya, died. “What difference, at this point, does it make?” Clinton demanded. Out of context, she sounded unmoved by the men’s deaths. Now, in the House hearing, it seemed to dawn on her that the proper response to her Republican interrogators was not outrage but pity.","3395","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"Peter Roskam, of Illinois, was laying out a scenario in which Clinton’s assumption of a leadership role on Libyan policy “didn’t come easy,” when he stopped and said, in case he might be overwhelming her, “I can pause while you’re reading your notes from your staff.” Clinton replied, “I can do more than one thing at a time, Congressman—thanks.” A minute or two later, Roskam said, “Go ahead and read the note if you need to.” This time, Clinton laughed. “I’m not done with my question,” Roskam said; he was just doing her a “courtesy.” “That’s all right,” Clinton responded, with a friendly wave of her hand. From then on, she was in control. “I’m sorry that doesn’t fit your narrative, Congressman. I can only tell you what the facts are,” she told Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who is the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. As he spoke, she rested her chin on the palm of one hand, as if he were not much more than a loud boor at a party who, puzzlingly, doesn’t seem to know how he sounds. When Lynn Westmoreland, of Georgia, informed her that he spoke slowly, Clinton laughed again and said, “I lived in Arkansas a long time. I don’t need an interpreter.”","3396","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"But in one sense she did need interpreters, and she got them. There was plenty of combat in the course of the hearings, but on Clinton’s side it was waged, for the most part, by the Democrats on the panel, who served as her anger translators. Elijah Cummings, of Maryland, repeatedly called out his Republican counterparts on conspiracy theories mooted and on inaccurate statements made, such as the charge that Clinton had personally turned down requests from Ambassador Stevens for more security. (“Four Pinocchios!”) Cummings, in his opening statement, asked why the committee existed at all. The answer that he suggested—“to drive down Secretary Clinton’s poll numbers”—seems almost a truism by now; indeed, it has been confirmed by a number of prominent Republicans in less guarded moments.","3397","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"There have now been seven full investigations of the circumstances surrounding the Benghazi attack, five in the House and two in the Senate. The Tampa Bay Times’s PolitiFact Web site noted recently that it was largely accurate to say that all the investigations found things that could have been done better (such as intelligence sharing) but none found “overt wrongdoing.” (Meanwhile, the Obama Administration’s larger Libya policy and its real failures have hardly been discussed.) Gowdy, whose defensiveness was palpable, said that his committee was better than the others: he has found more e-mails and more witnesses, even though they have led farther away from the burning compound in Benghazi.","3398","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"One such witness was Sidney Blumenthal, the writer and longtime Clinton friend. (He has worked for the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation and, in the nineteen-nineties, for The New Yorker.) Blumenthal sent Clinton a number of e-mails about Libya, some of which she passed on to others in the State Department. As a result, he was questioned by the committee, in a closed hearing, for almost nine hours, despite having no real knowledge of what unfolded in Benghazi; his name has become one that Clinton’s opponents obsessively allude to. “I honestly don’t understand this fixation,” Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, said.","3399","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"Gowdy’s rationale was essentially that the people in the State Department might have been as distracted by Blumenthal as he apparently is, and in a way that harmed national security. “It’s relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal’s drivel,” he said. (Gowdy was also bothered by the fact that one of Clinton’s aides, Huma Abedin, had sent her an e-mail about milk.) There is plenty to debate in Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server and the potentially overlapping interests of the State Department and the Clinton Foundation without lapsing into that sort of illogic. Any Americans who are not yet tired of hearing about Clinton’s e-mails may finally have had their fill.

She spoke about sleepless nights spent worrying about diplomats’ safety and “racking my brain about what more could have been done.” Gowdy, speaking next, used his time to rail against Schiff, who, several minutes earlier, had called the hearing a “prosecution.” At one point, the proceedings turned into a shouting match between Gowdy and Cummings. Clinton straightened the papers on the table in front of her, pausing occasionally to contemplate Gowdy or to smile at Cummings. There were several more rounds of questions, in which her interrogators manifested all of Washington’s pathologies—dysfunction, partisan squabbling, insularity—in such extreme form that Clinton came across not only as a grownup, as her supporters had hoped, but as the most normal person in the room.","3401","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"

(He has twice retweeted someone who called Kelly, the star of Fox’s news division, a “bimbo.”) In the political world, indeed, there has been growing acceptance that Trump can get away with saying things that other candidates can’t; in some quarters, there was even reluctant admiration for how adeptly he was exploiting this advantage.","3407","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Until now, that is.","3408","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"On Thursday, with very good reason, he was subjected to criticism from virtually every quarter, including from some Republican rivals who, earlier in the summer, had tried to ignore him. Jeb Bush called Trump’s remarks about Fiorina “small and inappropriate,” and said that he seemed intent on insulting his way to the Presidency. Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, called Trump an “egomaniacal madman who has no principles,” and said that it was time for him to return to reality television. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton said that Trump “seems to delight in insulting women every chance he gets.” Fiorina refused to respond directly, stating merely that, with her recent (if modest) rise in the polls, she seemed to be getting under Trump’s skin.","3409","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Trump, for once, seemed to be knocked off balance by all this. Initially, in an interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, he had suggested that Jann Wenner, the liberal publisher of Rolling Stone, had altered the article to make him look bad. “The writer actually called me and said, ‘I’m so upset, I wrote this great story and Jann Wenner screwed it up . . . because they added a lot of stuff, a lot of garish stuff, that I think is disgusting,’ ” Trump claimed.","3410","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Perhaps realizing that this story might not go over well, he provided an alternative explanation to Fox News, arguing that he had been talking about Fiorina’s “persona” rather than her physical appearance. “I say that about a lot of people,” he said. “I say, Look at that . . . . That’s not going to be our President!” Unfortunately for Trump, a quick glance at the article confirms that his remarks were surely directed at Fiorina’s appearance. The writer, Paul Solotaroff, was hanging out with Trump and some of his staffers on his private plane. They were watching the news and joshing around. This is Solotaroff’s description of the scene:","3411","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Later on Thursday, Trump tried out yet another line. Appearing once again on Fox News, he was confronted by a skeptical Greta Van Susteren, who said to him, “I don’t think you’re a first-time offender making a personal crack at a woman . . . the remark was about her face, and not about her persona.” This time, Trump suggested that he had been speaking not as a Presidential candidate but as an entertainer. “I did ‘The Apprentice’ and it was one of the top shows on television,” Trump said, adding, “Some comments are made as an entertainer and, as everybody said, as an entertainer is a much different ballgame.”","3412","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"That it is, and the issue now is whether Trump will finally suffer some adverse consequences for breaking the rules of his adopted sport. One theory, expostulated in this week’s edition of The Economist, suggests that he won’t. “He says things that no politician would, so people think he is not a politician,” an article in the magazine said. “His supporters . . . think his boorishness is a sign of authenticity—of a leader who can channel the rage of those who feel betrayed by the elite or left behind by social change.”","3413","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Surely, there is something in this argument. Even angry Republicans, however, demand a certain level of civility in their Presidential candidates. Or, at least, Trump’s frantic efforts to divert attention from what he actually said about Fiorina suggest that they do. So does the rise in the polls of Ben Carson, who is civil to a fault. Trump, by contrast, just can’t seem to quit. Like a gambler on a lucky streak, he keeps doubling down. Unlike normal gamblers, however, he has appeared during his campaign to be playing with the odds loaded in his favor.","3414","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Maybe, just maybe, that is changing. When Trump made his remarks about Megyn Kelly having “blood coming out of her whatever,” there was at least some ambiguity about what he really meant. This time, there is none. Still, Trump won’t apologize. “What can I say, I’m leading with the evangelicals, I’m leading with women,” he said to Van Susteren. “I’m leading with African-Americans, with a very high number, and I’m leading with Hispanics, which is very interesting and I’m not surprised, because I’m gonna bring jobs back to our country.”","3415","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"On the morning of October 10th, Marco Rubio, Florida’s junior senator, mounted a small stage at the Elks Lodge in Boulder City, Nevada, a popular retirement spot near Las Vegas. In his twenties, as an obscure Republican state legislator, Rubio exhibited such innate political skill that Dan Gelber, the Democratic leader of the Florida House, warned his colleagues, “When Marco Rubio speaks, young women swoon, old women faint, and toilets flush themselves.” Now that he was a Presidential candidate, Rubio was trying to speak to as many different audiences as possible. The Elks Lodge was decorated modestly, with just a few campaign banners hoisted amid the taxidermy—a demonstration of thrift intended to contrast with the front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, the billionaire Donald Trump, and to counter claims that Rubio occasionally spends more money than he should.","3416","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The attendees were predominantly older white couples, who were seeing Rubio in person for the first time. The son of Cuban immigrants, he grew up mostly in Miami, but he lived in Las Vegas from 1979 until 1985, when he left, after eighth grade. “I love coming back to southern Nevada, because it’s a place where I actually learned so much about the American Dream,” he said. “My father was a bartender at Sam’s Town”—an Old West-style casino, seven miles off the Strip. “My mother was a maid at what was then called the Imperial Palace.” He went on, “They used to have a show called ‘Legends in Concert.’ We saw that show, like, ten times. I met ‘Elvis’ and ‘Marilyn Monroe.’ You know you’re getting old when the Legends in Concert are people you used to listen to in high school.” Big laugh. Adam Hasner, a friend who served with Rubio in the Florida House, told me, “When you’re running for office in Miami-Dade County, you’re spending a lot of time in senior centers.”","3417","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At the age of forty-four, Rubio has lively dark eyes, soft cheeks, and downy brown hair affixed in a perfect part. He sometimes asks crowds to see him in the tradition of a “young President who said, ‘Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.’ ” (J.F.K. was forty-three when he entered the White House.) Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, is only five months older than Rubio, but nobody calls him boyish.","3418","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"If the Democrats nominate Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, the Party will be offering the oldest candidate that it has ever run in a general election, and Rubio has taken to saying, “Never in the modern history of this country has the political class in both parties been more out of touch with our country than it is right now.” But in policy terms Rubio can appear older than his years. His opposition to same-sex marriage, to raising the minimum wage, and to restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba puts him out of step with most American Latinos. In the Spanish-language media, he is sometimes described as un joven viejo—a young fogey.","3419","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After a summer submerged in a raucous primary field, Rubio had recently climbed into third place. He was ahead of Jeb Bush, his former mentor, and far behind Trump and Ben Carson. Trump’s campaign marched to the sound of a dirge—“The American Dream is dead,” he told crowds—and Rubio presented himself as a sunny alternative, a way out of Trump’s sulfurous moment. “We’re very blessed to have so many good people running for President,” he said earnestly to the crowd in Boulder City.","3420","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I had seen Rubio at half a dozen events—in Iowa, New York, Nevada—and his speeches were blemished only by a tic: he occasionally slips into a singsong cadence, turning his story into a breathy schoolboy lullaby about the “new American century.” On the whole, he is impressively consistent. Rubio in Dubuque in October was nearly indistinguishable from Rubio in Miami in April, the political equivalent of a well-managed restaurant chain: “Repeal and replace Obamacare,” scrap President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran “on Day One,” create the “most affordable business taxes in the world”—all the while heeding the populist frustrations of the moment. Vowing to remake higher education, he said, “When I’m President, before you take on student loans you’re going to know how much people make when they graduate from that school with that degree. You’re going to know that the market for philosophers has tightened over the last two thousand years.” In 2012, Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, spoke worshipfully of “job creators.” Rubio rarely mentions them. He returns, over and over, to his central task: how to make helping the poor and the middle class a Republican issue. He tells crowds, “We can no longer allow big government to be used as a tool of crony capitalism.”","3421","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But, at bottom, his campaign is only partly about policy. In a contest against a real-estate tycoon and the son and brother of former Presidents, Rubio is campaigning on the vision of a country where “the son of a bartender and a maid” can reach the White House. “It’s not just my story—it is literally our story,” he told the Boulder City crowd. “In this nation, we are all but a generation or two removed from someone who made our future the very purpose of their lives. Whether or not we remain a special country will be determined by whether or not that journey is still possible for the people trying to make it now.”","3422","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The applause was long and loud, and as Rubio climbed down from the stage to pose for selfies I asked the first couple I saw what they made of him. Cornelia Wallace, a retired nurse from the Chicago suburbs, said, “Well, I’ve got tears welled up in my eyes.” She laughed at her own reaction. “It touched my heart,” she said, and shrugged. “I get a passion from him that I don’t get from the others.”","3423","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In Las Vegas, Rubio was staying at the Bellagio. We met in a suite appointed in the Vegas Italianate style—leather, chrome, photos of fountains. When I stopped by one morning, the windows were shrouded by heavy burgundy drapes, and Rubio was worried about his voice. “I’ve been coming down with something,” he said, crossing the conference room to retrieve a bottle of water. “My throat is always feeling dry.” Doctors had told him it was an allergic reaction. “I said, ‘How come I’ve never had allergies before, and now, suddenly, the last four years I’ve developed allergies? And the answer the doctor gave me was: ‘Well, because you’re travelling to places that you never used to travel to before.’ ”","3424","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"He had made his first impression on many people outside Florida in 2013, when he gave the rebuttal to the State of the Union and leaned awkwardly offscreen to guzzle from a Poland Spring bottle—a moment that took flight on Twitter as #watergate.

"Rubio, who was spending three days in Nevada, had scheduled both public and closed-door activities. On the first night, he met with Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and donor. In April, Politico had published a story headlined “RUBIO TAKES LEAD IN SHELDON ADELSON PRIMARY,” which reported that Rubio had been calling Adelson every two weeks. I asked Rubio about it, and he said, “I don’t know about every couple of weeks, but I talk to him quite a bit.” Adelson spent about ninety-eight million dollars in connection with the 2012 campaign, including twenty million on the campaign of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. He has yet to commit to a candidate in 2016. Rubio described Adelson and himself as natural allies. “The only thing Sheldon Adelson has talked to me about policy-wise is Israel,” he said. “And he doesn’t have to convince me on that, because I’m pro-Israel with or without Sheldon’s support.”","3426","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s campaign had invited donors from around the country to join him at the Bellagio, for a football-themed retreat. The guests attended a “breakfast and team talk” and a strategy session called “Quarterbacking Victory.” One afternoon, they played flag football at a nearby sports complex, and Rubio was the quarterback on both teams. Over the years, he has developed the ability to disarm jaded donors. Bob List, the former governor of Nevada, told me about watching Rubio work a roomful of prosperous Las Vegas businessmen. At one point, Rubio was asked where his inspiration for politics originated. “He said, ‘I remember one day my father took me in the car, and we drove over to the neighborhood where Liberace’s house was.’ ” List noted, “And everybody knew where Liberace’s house was.” He went on, “He said, ‘We would drive around that neighborhood, and he’d show me where all the rich people lived, and he’d say, “Son, if you want to live like these people, you can do it.” ’ ” List shook his head and said, “He’s good-good.”","3427","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio, who has entered six elections and never lost, is alert to the appearance of overweening ambition. “All my life I’ve been in a hurry to get to my future,” he wrote in his memoir, “An American Son,” published in 2012, his second year in the Senate. In conversation, he sometimes answers so quickly that his friend Dennis Baxley, a Republican in the Florida House, once gave him a piece of advice. “I said, ‘Marco, don’t change anything you’re saying, but just wait, like, three seconds before you say it, and you’ll look so pensive.’ ” When things go wrong, Rubio’s impatience can suggest a man climbing too fast for his own good. In Washington foreign-policy circles, people remember a moment at the Brookings Institution, in April, 2012, when Rubio was delivering a major foreign-policy speech. Reaching the final page, he discovered that it had been removed accidentally from the lectern. Some politicians might have improvised; Rubio stopped awkwardly, in mid-sentence, and asked for the page to be returned.","3428","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For Republican strategists, the loss of the 2012 Presidential election contained signals that spoke to the Party’s future. Latinos are the largest minority group in America, but in 2012 “there was more talk about electrified fences than there was about higher education and tuition,” Peter Wehner, a Republican speechwriter and strategist who served in the past three Republican Administrations, told me. “You can’t win elections when you do that.” Romney, who had called for the “self-deportation” of immigrants, received just twenty-seven per cent of the Latino vote—seventeen points less than what George W. Bush received in 2004. For years, Republicans have believed that they should be faring better with Hispanic voters. Ronald Reagan liked to say that Latinos are Republicans but “just don’t know it yet.” Lionel Sosa, a Texas adman who was hired to run Reagan’s outreach program to Latinos, recalled, “Ronald Reagan told me, back in the 1980 race, ‘Latinos are conservative people. As Republicans, we share the same basic conservative values. We believe in hard work. We believe in family.’ ”","3429","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For Wehner and other reform-minded conservatives, the lessons of 2012 were also economic. “The middle class felt vulnerable and nervous, because of stagnant wages for twenty-five years and skyrocketing costs in health care and higher education,” Wehner told me. “The Party needed an agenda, and it was out of touch with middle-class concerns.” The reformers urged the Party to get over same-sex marriage (a “losing battle”), focus on economic anxiety, and, above all, identify a leader who could articulate a vision that reached beyond Party orthodoxy. As Wehner put it, “You need a figure like a Bill Clinton or a Tony Blair, who can reassure the base and inspire them, but also to signal to people who are not voting for you, ‘We get it.’ ”","3430","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Whit Ayres, a leading Republican analyst who has been Rubio’s pollster for the past five years, drew a somewhat different lesson. He agreed about the demographic reality. “Unfortunately for Republicans, the math is only going to get worse,” he wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. “Groups that form the core of G.O.P. support—older whites, blue-collar whites, married people and rural residents—are declining as a proportion of the electorate. Groups that lean Democratic—minorities, young people and single women—are growing.” He calculated that, in order to win, a Republican Presidential candidate would need at least forty per cent of the Latino vote. But in “2016 and Beyond: How Republicans Can Elect a President in the New America,” published earlier this year, Ayres made a subtle distinction between style and substance. He wrote that polls have found “no evidence that America has shifted to the left.” In his view, America remains a center-right country, the Party’s core ideas are sound, and the problem lies in finding “the right candidate, the right message, and the right tone.” He tested a range of ways of presenting core Republican ideas and composed a list of dos and don’ts. Don’t say we have to reform entitlements or “we will never balance the budget.” Do say that entitlement reform is “the only way to save popular programs.”","3431","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The Party’s plans to change its tone did not last long. In the 2014 midterm elections, conservative candidates seized on reports of a surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the Mexican border, spurred largely by gang- and drug-related violence in Central America, and proclaimed an immigration crisis. Though the number of undocumented immigrants apprehended at the border was at its lowest level in decades, voters who were anxious about jobs and opportunity responded to increasingly militant language. When Trump announced his candidacy, this summer, he said of Mexicans, “They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” Mel Martínez, the former Florida senator (the chamber’s first Cuban-American) and a former head of the Republican National Committee, told me, “Republicans say, ‘Mel, what do we have to do to get the Hispanic vote?’ And one thing I would say is, ‘First of all, stop offending Hispanics!’ ” He urged the parties not to regard a diverse range of voters as a single bloc. “The bottom line is that we are not ‘Hispanics.’ We’re Cuban-Americans, we’re Mexican-Americans, and so forth.” Cuban-Americans represent only about four per cent of the Latino population, and their votes and interests are not always in accord with those of other Latinos. For one thing, many Latinos resent the accelerated path to citizenship that Congress bestowed on Cuban arrivals during the Cold War, a privilege not granted to Colombians, Guatemalans, and others who have faced repression.","3432","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"“There are persuaders and there are crusaders, and I think Rubio is a persuader,” Wehner told me. “When you’re losing Presidential elections on a consistent basis, you’ve got to nominate somebody who is a persuader.” A conservative Super PAC ranked Rubio as the ninth most conservative member of the 114th Congress, but, unlike Ted Cruz, who amplifies confrontation, he excels at rounding off the corners of conventional conservative prescriptions. “I want to be the world leader in renewables,” he tells crowds. “But we better also be the world leader in oil and natural gas.”","3433","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At times, Rubio’s desire to embrace competing views becomes unworkable. In January, he voted for a Senate resolution affirming that climate change is real, but he often voices doubts about the role of humans in it. I mentioned that this puts him at odds with the young generation that he wants to represent. He said, “People who are passionate about climate change come to us and say, ‘The environment is changing because of human activity. The scientists say so.’ And then they say, ‘And here’s what we want you to do.’ And so they present me with this idea, and I look at this idea, and I ask them, ‘Well, if I pass this, how many inches or feet of sea rise will it prevent?’ And they’ll say, ‘Well, it won’t prevent any.’ I say O.K. Then I turn to the economists and say, ‘What impact will this law have on the economy?’ And they say, ‘It will increase the cost of living, it will cost jobs, it will make America less competitive economically.’ And so I say, ‘So you’re asking me to pass something that’s bad economically and does nothing for the environment other than lead the way by example? I think that’s a bad trade-off. I’m not supporting those laws.’ ” (Ken Caldeira, a senior scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science’s Department of Global Ecology, at Stanford, told me, “If Senator Rubio is talking to scientists who say that avoiding greenhouse-gas emissions won’t help avoid sea-level rise, he is talking to the wrong scientists.”)","3434","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s inclusiveness can invite caricature. He considers himself a Catholic, but he attends two churches—an evangelical Protestant service on Saturdays and a Roman Catholic Mass on Sundays. He used to proclaim his love of nineties-era hip-hop—particularly Tupac Shakur—but recently he has also taken to praising cross-genre artists, such as Drake and the Weeknd, who blend electronic dance music with hip-hop, rap, and R. & B. “It’s a twenty-first-century ability to take music and use it in a way that motivates people,” he said last month on CNN, mirroring his campaign rhetoric. “Some of it is blended with other sounds that are sampled from recordings that others have had in the past, and you see traditional artists being brought in and their voices used on an electronic soundtrack.”","3435","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s ecumenism is one reason that prominent Democrats consider him the most worrisome contender. David Axelrod, Obama’s former chief strategist, told me that Rubio “seems to be able to build bridges between the two factions of the Republican Party.” He said, “There is a real civil war going on between populist anti-government Republicans and the establishment conservatives, and Rubio has thus far been able to escape that divide.” Axelrod added, “But it’s going to be harder as time goes on, and he is probably going to have to plant his feet in one place or another.”","3436","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked Rubio if it concerned him that Republicans often appear to be at war with themselves. A day earlier, the House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, facing intense criticism by conservative members of his party, had abandoned plans to run for Speaker. “If the alternative was they all went into a smoke-filled room and cut a deal outside the limelight, everyone would say, ‘Oh, then it’s a done deal, it’s a stagnant process,’ ” Rubio said.

"Marco Antonio Rubio was born in Miami in 1971, the third of four children. (The oldest, Mario, became an Army Green Beret and, later, a city official in Jacksonville; Rubio’s sisters, Barbara and Veronica, live in Miami.) For years, he described himself, in political terms, as the “son of Cuban exiles.” “Nothing against immigrants, but my parents are exiles,” he said during his Senate campaign. “Folks that are exiles are people that have lost their country.” But in October, 2011, the Washington Post and the St. Petersburg Times reported that, according to immigration records, his family had left Cuba voluntarily, as émigrés, aboard a commercial flight, in May, 1956, more than two and a half years before Fidel Castro took power. Like many other immigrants, Rubio’s parents, Oriales and Mario, left in pursuit of jobs and opportunity. (Mario, the bartender, died in 2010.) The Post suggested that Rubio had embellished his story to gain cachet with political refugees, some of whom regard pre-Castro migrants with suspicion. Rubio called that suggestion “outrageous,” saying that he had relied on his family’s “oral history.”","3438","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s allies have defended his misstatements as an innocent error, but Guillermo Grenier, a sociologist at Florida International University, who studies the political attitudes of Cuban-Americans, told me that the explanation left many people unconvinced. “I think the dominant view is that he was misrepresenting his life story to make it more like the community he was trying to represent,” Grenier said. In a speech to the Hispanic Leadership Network, in January, 2012, Rubio said that the controversy had turned into “a blessing in disguise.” He explained, “It made me do something that we don’t do enough of. And that’s go back and discover who our parents were when they were our age.”","3439","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

When the family moved to Nevada, he immersed himself in Mormon reading, and joined the Mormon Church, along with his mother and one of his sisters. A few years later, they reëmbraced Catholicism, “mostly at my instigation,” he wrote in “An American Son.” He also recalled that he was an “inattentive and undisciplined student.”","3440","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The autobiography of a sitting senator is a carefully manicured history. “I wrote a paper in the fifth grade praising President Reagan for restoring the U.S. military after it had been demoralized and allowed to decay in the years before his presidency,” he notes. But he writes vividly about the most influential figure in his childhood—his maternal grandfather, Pedro Víctor García, whom he calls “my closest boyhood friend.” According to Rubio’s biographer Manuel Roig-Franzia, in 1962 García arrived from Cuba without a visa and was eventually ordered to be deported. He stayed anyway, becoming an undocumented immigrant. The Cuban missile crisis saved him; commercial air travel to Cuba was suspended, and, eventually, he was granted permanent residency. In Rubio’s recollection, his grandfather spent much of his retirement in an aluminum chair on the front porch of his daughter’s home, smoking cigars and advising Marco on the alleged perfidy of Jimmy Carter:","3441","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

Marco became an ardent supporter—making signs, blocking management’s cameras. But when the family ran low on money his father crossed the picket line. “I accused him of selling out and called him a scab,” Rubio wrote later. “It hurt him, and I’m ashamed of it.”","3442","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

The arrest added to the strain on the family. Rubio’s grade-point average at the end of his senior year was 2.1; he was allowed to graduate after attending summer school.

After his sophomore year, he had called a local congressional office and got a summer internship, and then, in 1996, while in law school at the University of Miami, he was hired to run the local branch of Bob Dole’s Presidential campaign. On and off since high school, Rubio had been dating Jeanette Dousdebes, a Colombian-American who became a Miami Dolphins cheerleader. In 1998, they married, and they have four children, ranging in age from eight to fifteen.","3447","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Jeanette never moved to Washington, preferring to stay in Florida with the children. “She’s not a political person,” Rubio told me. “She doesn’t have any political ambitions for me or for herself.” She does not enjoy politicking; she once told an interviewer, “If I have to do it, of course I’ll do it. But in general I am shy.” She works part time for the family foundation of Norman Braman, a billionaire auto dealer and former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, who has been an unusually supportive patron of the Rubio family. Over the years, he has donated repeatedly to Rubio’s campaigns, hired him as a lawyer, and made contributions to a public-policy center at Florida International University, where Rubio was an instructor.","3448","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Unlike most modern Presidential candidates, Rubio began his life in elected office at the lowest rung. (Jeb Bush’s first campaign was for governor.) Rubio was twenty-six and living at home with his parents when, in April, 1998, he won a seat on the five-member city commission in West Miami, a Cuban enclave with fewer than six thousand people. He weighed questions about the location of bus benches and the snacks in vending machines, all the while courting local political bosses.","3449","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Raúl Martínez was the mayor of blue-collar Hialeah, and he greeted Rubio warily. “In my office, we meet, and you know what? He’s a very personable person,” Martínez told me. But over time he was put off by Rubio’s ambition. “Marco was the prince—he was the chosen,” Martínez said. “You can see him deciding, ‘Where’s my next move up the ladder?’ ” Nevertheless, Rubio accumulated mentors, including Governor Jeb Bush, who noticed him during his first race, for the West Miami commission, and called to congratulate him on Election Night. They became friends, and Rubio took every chance to praise Bush: “He’s practically Cuban, just taller,” he told reporters, and later said that, whenever he confronted a difficult problem in the Senate, he asked, “W.W.J.D.?”—What would Jeb do?","3450","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Within two years, in 1999, Rubio spotted an open seat in the state legislature. He didn’t live in that district, but he won a special election and moved his residency in time for the swearing-in. He arrived at an auspicious moment: newly installed term limits, inspired by a bonanza of corruption cases, were driving out senior lawmakers. He was sometimes mistaken for a clerk, but he embraced conservative doctrine—he read Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged” twice in his first term—and attracted allies. Nine months later, he was the majority whip; two years later, he was the majority leader; and a year after that he was in line to be the youngest Speaker in Florida history, a post that he assumed in 2006.","3451","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At his swearing-in, Jeb Bush presented him with a faux-precious sword from a “mystical warrior.” (The inscription, “Unleash Chiang,” had been a rallying cry in the nineteen-fifties for right-wingers who wanted to arm Chiang Kai-shek’s government in Taiwan, so that it could attack mainland China. In the Bush family, however, the slogan was a tennis-court joke that George H. W. Bush used when he was preparing to serve.) Jeb told the audience, “I can’t think back on a time when I’ve ever been prouder to be a Republican, Marco.” Rubio displayed the sword on a wall of his office.","3452","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For the work of political arm-twisting, he relied on two fellow-representatives, David Rivera and Ralph Arza—or “Boris and Natasha,” as Dan Gelber, the minority leader, nicknamed them, after the “Rocky and Bullwinkle” villains. “I said it jokingly, but there was a little bit of truth,” he told me. “Something would pop up in a bill, and I’d wonder how the hell it got there. Then I’d look at them and they’d smile.” Rubio’s lieutenants proved to be problematic. Arza was forced to resign from the legislature in 2006, after he used the word “nigger” in a drunken message left on a colleague’s voice mail. He pleaded guilty to intimidating a witness and agreed to undergo alcohol and anger counselling. Rivera (who had bought a house with Rubio in Tallahassee, to use when the legislature was in session) went on to Congress but has been the target of state and federal investigations into his income and into his alleged role in supporting a shadow candidate to undercut his rival in the 2012 campaign. He has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged. The Bush campaign, in a slide presentation to donors, has cited the friendship with the “scandal-tarred” Rivera as evidence that Rubio is a “risky bet.” Rubio aides tell reporters that the candidate rarely sees Rivera anymore, but Rivera and Arza were among Rubio’s supporters at the Republican debate in Cleveland.","3453","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio has struggled to manage his personal and professional finances. On several occasions, he used a Republican Party American Express card to charge personal expenses—$3,765 for landscaping stones at his house, ten thousand dollars for a family reunion in Georgia, a hundred and thirty-four dollars in a hair salon. In each case, he made good on the charge before it was publicly reported and explained it as a mixup. A state ethics commission investigated the incidents and cleared him, but that hasn’t stopped his opponents from bringing them up.","3454","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"His income has fluctuated dramatically. In 2000, his first year in the legislature, he was still saddled with student debt. As he ascended in the House leadership, he was hired by Broad & Cassel, a prominent law and lobbying firm, and his annual income grew to more than four hundred thousand dollars. In 2012, he received a contract for his memoir, worth at least eight hundred thousand dollars, and yet, even with his rising income, he cashed out sixty-eight thousand dollars from a retirement account, paying a heavy tax penalty. When reporters asked about it, he said, “My refrigerator broke down.” Political rivals wondered if he had a gambling problem, and searched for evidence but found none. Indeed, Rubio has incorporated the questions about his financial dealings into his self-narrative. “Here’s the truth,” he said, flanked by prosperous rivals, during the third Republican debate, in Boulder, Colorado. “I didn’t inherit any money.” He added, “But I’m not worried about my finances. I’m worried about the finances of everyday Americans.”","3455","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After Rubio finished at the Elks Lodge in Boulder City, he drove to North Las Vegas, a blue-collar suburb where he and his family once lived in a two-bedroom cinder-block house. The city has a large Hispanic population, and bus shelters advertise lawyers who specialize in inmigración. He was scheduled to speak at an event organized by the LIBRE Initiative, a nonprofit group funded in part by the Koch brothers.

"To fulfill Reagan’s prophesy that Latino voters will become Republicans, the Party will need to make its economic case in places like Nevada. Between 1994 and 2012, the Latino share of Nevada’s electorate tripled, from five per cent to fifteen per cent. So far, Latinos have been voting mainly for Democrats. Senator Harry Reid won a tight reëlection fight in 2010 largely because he received ninety-four per cent of the Latino vote. By the end of this decade, non-Hispanic whites will likely be a minority in Nevada.","3457","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The event was held at St. Christopher Catholic School, which Rubio attended briefly as a child. (After lobbying his parents to find a way to cover the tuition, he arrived to find that he hated the uniforms, the extra schoolwork, and the distance from his friends, and he pleaded to go back to public school. “I made life unbearable in our house, and within a week, my parents had relented,” he writes. “I cringe today when I remember how selfishly I behaved.”)","3458","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Drawing on the ideas of reform-minded conservatives, Rubio told the audience, “We have government policies that, quite frankly, have not allowed this economy to grow fast enough and create better-paying jobs.” He went on, “These are the impediments to upward mobility: an economy that isn’t creating better-paying jobs and a higher-education system that’s too expensive or inaccessible. And the result is we are leaving people behind.”","3459","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The crux of Rubio’s economic argument is that the poor and the middle class are facing different problems from those his parents faced. He opposes raising the minimum wage, arguing that it will lead to automation and outsourcing. He wants a greater share of young people to consider trade schools and apprenticeships instead of incurring the debts of a four-year education. “You’re going to have eighteen-year-olds in this country making fifty thousand dollars a year making cars, making seventy thousand dollars a year as a welder!” he says. (His rhapsodies about welding have been ridiculed, because the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the median wage for welders is less than thirty-eight thousand dollars.)","3460","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio told the audience that the notion that “big government is good for the people who are trying to make it” is a “lie.” He said, “When the government dominates the economy, the people that can afford to influence the government—they win. And everybody else is stuck.” He went on, “They know that you can’t start a business out of the spare bedroom of your home if you have to fill out fifteen permits and hire lawyers and lobbyists, and they love it because that means they have no competition.”","3461","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At one point while Rubio was in the Florida House, he and David Rivera visited Washington and got in touch with Mel Martínez, who was then in the Senate. “I walked him around the Capitol, and he was like a kid with his eyes popping out, you know? ‘Oh, my gosh, this is so cool. Oh, my gosh,’ ” Martínez recalled. Within a few years, Rubio was back, with a purpose. “I invited him to lunch in the Senate dining room, and I got the definite impression that he was kind of fishing around as to if I was going to run for reëlection or not,” Martínez said. “I thought it was a bit premature to be talking about that.”","3462","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After term limits forced Rubio out of the Florida House, in 2008, he worked as a consultant for hospitals, a television pundit, and a college instructor, but by 2009 he was antsy. Martínez had announced his retirement, and Rubio wanted to challenge Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor, for the vacant Senate seat, but Party leaders had chosen Crist, and they told Rubio that they would oppose him with money and endorsements. Rubio’s friend Dennis Baxley received a text message from him: “I can’t quit thinking about U.S. Senate. They want me to do Attorney General of Florida instead, but what do you think?” Baxley said, “I texted him back. I said, ‘What does your wife think?’ She’s the spiritual depth gauge.” Jeanette approved.","3463","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio began more than thirty points behind, and almost dropped out. But he sensed that Crist was vulnerable on the right. Small, far-right rallies were gathering steam around the state; they eventually became the Tea Party. Driving around Florida in an F-150 pickup, Rubio went to rallies, and he portrayed Crist as an ally of Obama. He accentuated new priorities. Previously, progressive immigration activists had considered him an ally, because he supported tuition assistance for the children of undocumented workers and used his power to bury hard-line anti-immigration bills. But now he renounced the tuition program; he made use of the phrase “illegal aliens,” and condemned the Dream Act, which would have protected undocumented young people, as a step toward “a blanket amnesty.”","3464","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"He said that he would have supported a controversial Arizona measure that critics called the “Show me your papers” law. (Before his campaign, he had said that the law would be akin to creating a “police state.”) He also received help from Jeb Bush, who introduced him to top donors and helped him secure endorsements. He got the nomination, and won the general election by nearly twenty points. At his victory party, Bush introduced him. The Weekly Standard hailed Rubio as “the most important freshman senator.” In the Senate, Rubio maintained his opposition to the Dream Act. Presente, an online Latino activist group, ran a campaign with the tagline “No Somos Rubios”—“We’re not Rubios.”","3465","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In 2012, Mitt Romney considered Rubio as a possible running mate. Democratic researchers had assembled and released an opposition-research file that focussed on Rubio’s relationship with Rivera and on the financial errors, portraying them as evidence of ineptness or profiteering. In the end, Romney chose the Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan. In materials shared with donors and reporters, the Bush campaign has alleged that Rubio was rejected because of concerns about his background. But Beth Myers, the Romney adviser who oversaw the Vice-Presidential search, told Politico last month that that is “simply wrong,” and went on, “I can say that Senator Rubio ‘passed’ our vetting and we found nothing that disqualified him from serving as VP.”","3466","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After Romney lost, the G.O.P.’s official autopsy concluded that the Party had to “embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.” A small group of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate were organizing the first push for a bill that could satisfy both the left and the right, by combining a path to citizenship for eleven million undocumented immigrants with border-control measures. The group coveted Rubio’s participation, because he had both Tea Party support and Latino heritage. In December, Senator Dick Durbin, of Illinois, the No. 2 leader in the Democratic majority, encountered Rubio in the Senate gym and recruited him to what became known as the Gang of Eight. Time put him on the cover with the tagline “The Republican Savior.” He blitzed conservative media and white Evangelical audiences, arguing that border security and citizenship had to be “interwoven” in the bill. “It’s literally impossible to do one part without doing the other,” he said.","3467","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But his staff was ambivalent: his political strategists worried that it would cost him conservative support. After Rubio signed on to the bill, Glenn Beck declared, “What a piece of garbage this guy is.” But Rubio stayed with it, and when the bill reached the Senate floor, on June 27, 2013, he delivered the most powerful speech of his career, recalling that the first words that his father learned in English were “I am looking for work.” He quoted from the inscription on the Statue of Liberty, and said, “Here in America, generations of unfulfilled dreams will finally come to pass.”","3468","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The bill passed the Senate, but Rubio’s poll numbers were dropping, and he was having second thoughts. He was the only one of the eight senators who did not attend a news conference after the vote. In the weeks ahead, he walked away from the immigration bill. He told Sean Hannity, of Fox News, that repealing Obamacare was “more important” than his legislation. In October, he dismissed the bill as something “the Democrats in the Senate are demanding.” He stopped talking about immigration almost entirely. Matt Viser, of the Boston Globe, searched the Congressional Record and found that Rubio referred to immigration a hundred and thirty-five times on the Senate floor in 2013. In the next two years, he mentioned it twice. (The House never brought the bill up for a vote, and it died.)","3469","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio had come to Washington with ambitions to cut the debt, reduce spending, and curb E.P.A. rules in Florida, but none of those plans succeeded. In his first year, his only successful bill was a measure that designated September as National Spinal Cord Injury Awareness Month. He began losing enthusiasm for the Senate. The failure of the immigration bill hastened the process.","3470","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio had talked about running for President, but in Florida political circles few people imagined that he would run in 2016 if Bush did. “I didn’t conceive of them both deciding to compete, because the relationship goes so far back,” Baxley said.

"For those with strong ties to both Rubio and Bush, Rubio’s decision was discomfiting. The Miami Republican operative Al Cardenas, who gave Rubio his first job out of law school (and attended his wedding), and pushed for him to be a Vice-Presidential candidate in 2012, told Fox Latino, “I had hoped he would stay in the Senate,” adding, “It’s like running against your uncle for the president of the company.” When Rubio was asked why he did not defer to his mentor, he replied, “I didn’t know there was a line.” Asked about the sword that Bush gave him, Rubio told reporters, “I have it somewhere at home. I have young kids. I don’t want them running around with a sword.”","3472","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

It was nicknamed the Ellis Island of the South. Flanked by enormous American flags, he told the crowd, in a message that pointed at both Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, “Yesterday is over.” At the announcement, demonstrators from Latino advocacy groups carried signs declaring “El Sueño de Rubio Es Nuestra Pesadilla” (“Rubio’s Dream Is Our Nightmare”). On “Despierta América,” the morning newscast on Univision, the host Satcha Pretto noted the presence of the protesters, and said, “Many immigrants are already asking themselves, ‘Does he want to support us or deport us?’ ”","3473","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

Barrel-chested and bearded, he wore a cardigan and rectangular glasses.

"He was born in Mexico while his parents and three siblings were en route to the United States. A church helped them get green cards and allowed them to sleep in the pews for three years until they had saved enough for an apartment in a poor section of Las Vegas. “My parents would go without food. I don’t remember buying new shoes when I was a kid. But I think a lot of people go through that, in different ways.” He learned English from “Sesame Street.” “So I was the family translator until I was eight.” His older brother found work bagging groceries, and the family moved to West Las Vegas, another troubled part of town.","3475","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Murrieta became a naturalized citizen in 2010—“my American birthday,” he calls it. “It was the most beautiful moment of my life. And I registered to vote literally the moment after that, because all I ever wanted to do was vote.” In 2013, he worked nationally on immigration reform and labor issues. “I was blessed to be able to be in a lot of the rooms where policy was being discussed.” He said that Latinos would be receptive to a Republican message, but he thinks that the LIBRE Initiative promotes the interests of big business rather than the interests of the community.","3476","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked what he made of Rubio’s work on immigration reform. “He was for it before he was against it,” he said. “I’m an immigrant kid from the poorest parts of Vegas, and my family is touched by every form of immigration.” His brother-in-law and sister-in-law are undocumented. “This bill would have saved my family a lot of fear. You know, we still live in fear that our family is going to be torn apart.” He went on, “I’ve seen Marco Rubio give us lip service. I’ve seen him and his staff say that they support us. But then, when the spotlight is put on them, they don’t have the muscle to stand. And that’s not what we need in a President. We need someone who can stand up and stay true to what he’s said.” He added, “One of us has forgotten where we came from.”","3477","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The more we talked, the more dispirited Murrieta became about the state of the immigration debate in America. The Obama Administration’s executive actions, announced in 2014, would have shielded members of his family against the threat of deportation, but then a court ruling blocked that protection.

"A Gallup poll released in August found that among Hispanic voters Bush has a net favorability rating of eleven points; Rubio trails him, with five points. Clinton’s net favorability with Hispanics is forty points. But when I asked Lionel Sosa, Reagan’s Latino outreach director, how he thought Rubio would do with Hispanics in a general election, he said that although he had heard the criticisms, he thought they would fade. “The first Latino that has a chance to become President?

"It was, perhaps, inevitable that Marco Rubio would open the deepest cut in the troubled campaign of Jeb Bush. For days before the third Republican debate, the Bush campaign had been criticizing Rubio for missing Senate votes this year. During the debate, Bush sensed an opportunity and turned to face his former protégé. “Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work,” Bush said. “I mean, literally, the Senate—what is it, like, a French work week?” He delivered the line awkwardly, like a principal making a cameo appearance in a school play.","3482","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio stared at him evenly. “I don’t remember you ever complaining about John McCain’s vote record,” he said, and added, pityingly, “The only reason why you’re doing it now is because we’re running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.” Applause rose from the audience. The phrase “Someone has convinced you” was lethal. Bush—suddenly in the role of the misled, desperate old pol—smiled wanly and tried to speak, but Rubio turned to face the camera. “My campaign is going to be about the future of America—it’s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage,” he said. “I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.” It sounded like a eulogy.","3483","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The next day, Rubio appeared on six network- and cable-news shows and attracted three-quarters of a million dollars in donations online. Then came the mother lode. On October 30th, Paul Singer, the hedge-fund billionaire, who donated more money to Republican candidates and causes last year than anyone else in America, sent a letter to dozens of donors, encouraging them to help raise money for Rubio, calling him “perfect for this moment” and the best choice to “navigate this complex primary process, and still be in a position to defeat Secretary Clinton in November 2016.” Rubio had been courting Singer for weeks.","3484","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"A few days later, I met Rubio for breakfast in New York, at a restaurant in the Hyatt in Times Square. He arrived at seven-thirty, with two staff members, and slid into the booth. He ordered a cappuccino, and then called after the waitress, “Can I get a double shot of espresso in it?” He looked tired. He was trying to maintain a semblance of a routine: six hours of sleep, a gym visit for “anything that gets your heart rate up for thirty minutes,” a morning call to his kids on the way to school, and an uninterrupted block of time at home with his family on Sundays.","3485","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

"I suspected he might have more difficulty defusing concern that he is becoming indebted to powerful donors—some of the very same “people that can afford to influence the government,” whom he disparaged in his speech at St. Christopher. More than four in five Americans—an equal share of Republicans and Democrats—believe that money plays too large a role in political campaigns, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released in June. While Rubio was getting help from Singer, and perhaps Adelson, a nonprofit group called the Conservative Solutions Project—which, by law, can conceal the identities of its donors—was running millions of dollars’ worth of ads promoting him, more than any similar group devoted to a Presidential candidate.","3487","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked Rubio if he thinks Americans will worry that he is beholden to big backers. He shook his head, and said, “I’ve never had a single donor come to me and say, ‘I’ll support you, but only if you support this initiative.’ ” I said that sounded like a false standard, an unrealistic description of political influence. He continued, “People may not believe this, but the vast majority of big donors in America don’t really ask a lot of government—at least on our side of the aisle. What they really, largely, want is to be treated fairly and be left alone.” He added, “I’ve never changed any item on my agenda in search of a supporter.”","3488","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"On several issues, Rubio has taken a position that suits the faithful in the primaries but is guaranteed to repel voters in a general election. His most obvious vulnerability is on abortion. In the first Republican debate, Rubio said that his opposition to abortion extends to cases of rape or incest—a position at odds with that of more than three-quarters of Americans. Axelrod told me, “No exceptions is a position so extreme that no Republican candidate has ever held it. Presidential races are defined by moments. Maybe he will try to amend that position, but in the age of video it’s hard to extinguish a declarative statement like that.” When I asked Rubio about it, he said, somewhat confusingly, “Look, I personally believe that all life is worthy of protection, and therefore I don’t ever require, nor have I ever advocated, that I won’t support a law unless it has exceptions.” After some more twists and turns, I sensed that we had reached the line he plans to use in a general election: “My goal is to save as many lives as possible, and I’ll support anything that does that. Even if it has exceptions.”","3489","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"During the third debate, he had said that it was time to end an immigration system based largely on family ties. “That’s the way my parents came, legally, in 1956, but in 2015 we have a very different economy. Our legal-immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.” I told him that people have said that he is, in effect, pulling up the ladder after his family has reached safety.","3490","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"“I understand the argument,” he said, but he thought it was unfair. “In 1956, two people with barely any command of English, who had no formal education of any sort, were able to find jobs.

"I asked what he thought would have happened to his parents if they had faced the system he is proposing. “It’s not clear what would have happened to them,” he said. “We can all get into hypotheticals about what would have happened two hundred years ago, or one hundred years ago, or fifty years ago, when somebody’s relatives came, but the world changes, and our policy has to keep pace with that.” He seemed dissatisfied with that answer, and went on, “Unlike most of the other people running, I live surrounded by immigration. My family are all immigrants. My kids go to school with kids who are immigrants. So this is not a theoretical issue for me. I live it personally. And it is hard. You know the stories of people that are here illegally, but it’s heartbreaking, because they came because they don’t want their daughter to be abducted by a drug gang in Central America. But the flip side of it is, every country in the world has immigration laws. And America has to have immigration laws, and if you don’t enforce them you don’t have laws. So this notion that somehow to be compassionate you have to be lawless is something I don’t buy, and I think most Hispanics don’t buy it.”","3492","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s campaign faces a range of tactical questions—Does he have the organization to win an early state? Will he lose his home state to Trump? Could Cruz win with only conservative and evangelical voters?—but the larger question will be harder to solve: Rubio has succeeded in politics by straddling as many positions as possible. He is the Catholic at the Protestant church, the quarterback of both teams, the joven viejo. But it isn’t clear that he can continue to do that and also be as bold as he would need to be to alter the Presidential prospects of the Republican Party in a changing country.","3493","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Since entering the primary, he had redoubled his language about enforcement. In October, he co-sponsored a bill that would punish “sanctuary” cities—localities that have objected to enforcing federal immigration laws. Democrats dubbed it the Trump-Rubio Sanctuary Cities Bill.","3494","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"If Rubio makes it to the general election, some of his positions are unlikely to budge. Hillary Clinton favors an activist American foreign policy, and Rubio mentioned to me that he was rereading “The Last Lion,” by William Manchester. He said, “It’s this book about Churchill. It’s really long. Only because I’m just so fascinated by the leadership he provided.” He went on, “Churchill was a guy who was largely ignored through much of the thirties as a warmonger, and a guy that was crying wolf, and Chamberlain was this heroic figure that was going to achieve peace in our time by diplomacy. And I think, in many cases, we’re kind of at a similar moment, where many of us, including myself, are warning about dangers that are percolating around the world and what they could turn into. Whether it’s Iran, Russia, China, North Korea, or radical Islam.”","3495","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In retrospect, those were the final moments of a phase in the Presidential campaign: when Islamic State militants assaulted Paris on November 13th, the candidates lurched away from talk of taxes and Wall Street regulations to face questions of national security. Jeb Bush, after straining, for months, to distance himself from his brother’s invasion of Iraq, said, “We should declare war” on the Islamic State, and called for the deployment of American troops “without their hands tied.” In a Democratic debate on the day after the attacks, Clinton said that the Islamic State “cannot be contained—it must be defeated.” She declined to identify the threat as “radical Islam,” saying that the term was “painting with too broad a brush” and risked alienating allies in the Muslim world.","3496","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio held up that point as a flawed gesture of diplomacy. “I don’t understand it,” he said on ABC’s “This Week,” the next day. “That would be like saying we weren’t at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren’t violent themselves.” It was a shrewd reply—the cool placement of safety over diplomacy—that nevertheless avoided Bush’s sharp turn toward war.","3497","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But in reaching for a broad rhetorical vision Rubio presaged an instinct for aggressive intervention.“This is a clash of civilizations,” he told ABC. “There is no middle ground on this. Either they win or we win.” It was the politics of absolutes, a vocabulary that harks back to the with-us-or-against-us logic of an earlier era. Even George W. Bush disavowed the clash-of-civilizations argument. Rubio stopped short of specifying how many troops he wants to send to the Middle East, but he left no doubt that he believes such action is unavoidable. In an article that Rubio wrote for Politico, he said that the United States should “provide direct military support to Sunnis and the Kurds if Baghdad fails to support them.” He also called for no-fly zones in Syria, for grounding Bashar al-Assad’s Air Force, and for the establishment of “safe zones” to “stem the flow of refugees and provide a place to train and arm rebel fighters.” He said that he would “oppose Russia and Iran” in their efforts to buttress Assad’s regime.","3498","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In one of our conversations, I asked Rubio if his instinct for intervention was out of step with a generation that is exhausted by war and confrontation, young men and women who have come of age in the years since September 11th. He responded instantly: “We’re not Luxembourg. We’re the United States of America—the highest-profile, most important, most influential country in the world.” He went on, “And we may ignore problems that exist far away, but those problems don’t ignore us. America, in the world today, is the only nation capable of convening collective action.”","3499","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Barely two months before the first Iowa caucus, the debates about national security and immigration were converging in ways that Rubio seemed well positioned to exploit. In the days after the Paris attacks, more than thirty governors said that their states would resist the resettlement of Syrian refugees. Rubio, as he so often does, found a way to embrace two sides of a painful question, expressing both empathy and tough-mindedness. He said of the refugees, “It’s not that we don’t want to—it’s that we can’t.” ♦","3500","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

But it would be a mistake to conclude that Ryan is “running,” or ever truly “ran,” for Speaker. He said often enough and feelingly enough that he didn’t want the job. What he did do, eventually, was to express a tentative, reluctant willingness to be Speaker: he allowed that, if certain conditions were met, he would condescend to accept. He didn’t run for Speaker; he invited the Speakership to run for him. It did, and now he must be wondering if it will run him over. He may yet end up roadkill, a sail cat on the highway to oblivion.","3502","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"

"Latest Unease On Right: Ryan Is Too Far Left","3504","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"The story, by Jennifer Steinhauer, reported that “far-right media figures,” with encouragement from Tea Party extremists in the House, were on a “furious Internet expedition” to cover Ryan in “political silt” on account of his history of being “traitorous to conservatism.” To be sure, Ryan is on board with outlawing gay weddings and nearly all abortions, privatizing Social Security, voucherizing Medicare, abolishing Medicaid and replacing it with ever-diminishing block grants to the states, and ignoring global warming. His famously wonky budget proposals would shrink food stamps and college aid while cutting rich people’s taxes, in many cases by half. He requires his interns to read “Atlas Shrugged.” His treason consists solely of what Steinhauer calls “flashes of pragmatism,” such as questioning the wisdom of shutting down the government and/or forcing the Treasury to default on its obligations.","3505","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"After his announcement of availability, Ryan found himself facing an unappetizing choice. He could compromise (i.e., surrender) on some of his demands, such as his unrealistic insistence on getting the formal endorsement of every single House Republican faction—thus suggesting that he buckles under pressure. Or he could stick to his guns (as is his right under the Second Amendment), withdraw, and be blamed for consigning his party to endless chaos, failing to step up in the hour of Republican need, etc. He chose the former.","3506","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"

"Let’s go to the Constitution. “The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker,” Article I, Section 2 says—without adding “from among its Members” or something to that effect. This was almost certainly a drafting error, an inadvertent omission. But its undisputed effect is to leave the House free to “chuse” anyone it chooses.","3508","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"

But Watts has a fatal taint: he has held public office. In the government. The federal government.","3509","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"There’s a better way.","3510","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Donald Trump fulfills the constitutional requirements for the Speakership, because there are none. Also, Speakers speak, and Trump is very good at speaking, as he has regularly proved on television, not only as a budding politician but also as a “reality” star—and reality, with or without scare quotes, is something of which the Republican Party is sorely in need.","3511","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Another thing Speakers are supposed to do—according to good-government types, bipartisanship junkies, and even the unknown but not insubstantial number of Republicans who suspect that it may be politically advantageous to at least show an interest in “governing” and “getting things done”—is make deals, as long as said deals are struck by a “tough negotiator.” Sound like someone you know? Someone like, maybe, the best-selling author of “The Art of the Deal”? Like the guy who, just last week, bluffed CNBC into immediately yielding to his demand that the next G.O.P. debate be an hour shorter and an opening statement longer?","3512","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"A Trump Speakership would be a win-win for all concerned. For the rest of the Republican Presidential field, “establishment” (Bush, Rubio, Kasich, etc.) and “insurgent” (Cruz, Huckabee, etc.) alike, it would eliminate a dangerously unpredictable, ideologically inscrutable, incomprehensibly popular rival who makes the others look like flop-sweat-covered, low-energy professional politicians hopelessly in hock to rich contributors and corporations. (The Ben Carson problem would persist for a while, of course, but, sooner or later, the doctor’s profound weirdness, among other problems, may be relied upon to dispose of that one.)","3513","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"As for Ryan, the deal would spare him the doom that very likely will be his fate if he becomes Speaker. Nothing about the terms under which he has agreed to accept the post changes the fact that, absurd as the notion may be, he is still “too far left.” For a small but procedurally decisive segment of his Republican colleagues in the House, governmental dysfunction, gridlock, paralysis, and chaos are features, not bugs. These features of the status quo are not about to go away. Ryan’s political business plan called for him to spend the next four years as the respected (among conservatives) chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, followed by eight triumphant years in the White House, followed by a comfortable retirement at the Ryan Presidential Library and Foundation. The prospect for him now is a short, harrowing, career-ending interval of misery on Capitol Hill followed by a lucrative but soul-killing job as a K Street lobbyist.","3514","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"For Trump himself, the deal is just as good. Let’s start with an assumption: notwithstanding the current hysteria, Trump is not going to be the Republican nominee. He can go down in the annals of politics and entertainment as a curiosity, a footnote: the flamboyant mogul who ran for President on a lark, threw a scare into the regulars for a while, got bored and/or boring, and went back to his perch at Trump Tower and the tabloids. Or he can be the first and only non-member of the House of Representatives to be its Speaker in the two hundred and twenty-six years since its founding. He probably wouldn’t last long in the job, and he probably wouldn’t want to, and, anyway, he wouldn’t have to. No matter what, he will have become a truly historic figure, and he can spend the rest of his life preening as such.","3515","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Not only that: Speaker Trump could continue to nurse his White House fantasies. It’s true that, for a conventional politician, the Speakership has always been a too-slippery steppingstone to the Presidency. Being a governor, a senator, or a victorious general has always been a better route. Ex-Speakers Henry Clay and James G. Blaine managed to make it as far as winning their respective parties’ nominations, but they got creamed in November. Of the sixty-one Speakers so far, only one has ever actually become President: James K. Polk—and he had quit the House six years earlier to take the governorship of Tennessee. But, for a conventional Republican politician like Ryan, given the nihilistic ungovernability of today’s G.O.P. caucus, the Speakership is a gravestone. Hence the man’s reluctance.","3516","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Trump, however, is not a conventional politician. A few months as Speaker would be just the dollop of “government experience” he needs to fill out his résumé for next time. Nor could this time be entirely ruled out. The Speaker of the House is third in line for the Presidency. An accident or some such could befall whoever is President and Vice-President.

"Yesterday the New York Times examined in some detail how a House inquiry to examine the tragic events of September 11, 2012, when extremists attacked two U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, and killed four Americans, evolved into an investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State. The Times report shows that Trey Gowdy, the chairman of the committee, gradually abandoned the effort to understand what happened in Libya. Instead, he became obsessed with Clinton’s e-mails.","October 13, 2015","3518","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-house-benghazi-committee-protected-obama"
"To be fair, Gowdy’s emphasis on the e-mail issue had some justification. As he documented in an interim report on the committee’s work, the State Department was slow to respond to requests for information and took months to acknowledge that Clinton used a private account. Not for the first time, Hillary’s reluctance to be fully transparent fed the more conspiratorial instincts of her opponents. And not for the first time, her fiercest opponents now look like partisan operatives who cared more about damaging her politically than they did about producing a trustworthy record of what happened in Benghazi.","3519","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-house-benghazi-committee-protected-obama"
"Given the polarization in American politics, it takes some serious effort for an investigative body to maintain credibility. It can be done, though, and the best example in recent years is the 9/11 Commission, whose chairman, Thomas Kean, a former governor of New Jersey and a Republican, made a point of forging consensus with his Democratic colleagues on nearly every controversial issue. The result was a report that received acclaim and whose main conclusions are contested only by the lunatic fringe.","3520","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-house-benghazi-committee-protected-obama"
"Gowdy’s committee, which has long been criticized for its biases, has now been so discredited that his final product will inevitably be seen as nakedly partisan. First Kevin McCarthy, the Republican Majority Leader, bragged at the end of last month to Fox News that, “everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi Special Committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping.” Then on Sunday, Bradley F. Podliska, a former Republican investigator on the committee, stepped forward to allege that he was terminated partly because he refused to focus narrowly on Clinton rather than the broader issues of the attack.","3521","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-house-benghazi-committee-protected-obama"
"The problem for the House Republican isn’t just that they now look foolish. It’s that they missed an opportunity to both do something useful for the country and to score some legitimate political points. The G.O.P.’s descent into pure partisan politics blinded it to the Administration’s broader failure in Libya. After all, Barack Obama himself has said that he bungled his Libya policy:","3522","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-house-benghazi-committee-protected-obama"
"It’s not often that a President makes an admission like this. The consequences of Obama—and Hillary’s mistake—have been serious, and not just because Libya is now a chaotic haven for terrorists. The NATO mission in Libya quickly transformed from an effort to protect a vulnerable population from Qaddafi’s imminent attack, to an effort to overthrow the Libyan leader. Obama’s decision to change the objectives of the Libya intervention has made it more difficult for him to gain international support to intervene elsewhere. In 2011, Obama miraculously managed to convince the Chinese to abstain during the Security Council vote authorizing the NATO attack on Libya. (Obama’s strategy in securing that vote is what gave birth to the phrase “leading from behind.”) But as Thomas J. Christensen recently noted in Foreign Affairs, when the Libya mission changed, “China felt betrayed by the UN process” and “subsequently joined Moscow in actively opposing U.S. and European efforts to move against the Assad regime in Syria.” The subsequent collapse of all institutions capable of bringing order to Libya has reminded a lot of people of something that happened a decade before. After it became clear that the Bush Administration had no post-attack strategy for Iraq, Democrats, including Obama and Clinton, rightfully argued that Bush’s lack of planning was scandalous and a prime reason that Republicans couldn’t be trusted on foreign policy. Republicans now make the same argument about Obama and Libya.","3523","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-house-benghazi-committee-protected-obama"

"You could hear Eisenhower at his best during a televised speech that he delivered on April 5, 1954, one he began by asking his listeners to survey America’s “strength, its problems, its apprehensions, and its future,” before attempting to do that. The talk was soon called the “multiplicity of fears” address (he’d actually used the phrase in a press conference a few weeks earlier) because, above all, Eisenhower wanted to tamp down what he properly sensed was enormous uneasiness in a world that had changed so rapidly in his lifetime. “Thirty-seven years ago tomorrow, our country entered the First World War,” he said; he had been a lieutenant, in Texas, serving with the United States Infantry. “My regiment was armed, as were all other regiments, with the same kind of equipment … as were the regiments that fought the Spanish-American War. Now, only a year ago, the hydrogen bomb was exploded in the Pacific. Last month, another series of tests was undertaken.” He continued, saying that “this transfer of power, this increase of power from a mere musket and a little cannon, all the way to the hydrogen bomb in a single lifetime, is indicative of the things that have happened to us. They rather indicate how far the advances of science have outraced our social consciousness, how much more we have developed scientifically than we are capable of handling emotionally and intellectually.”","3533","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"
"Because it was the height of the Cold War, the President acknowledged that “we are concerned about the men in the Kremlin,” who also had the bomb; he also mentioned the possibility of another economic depression. But what he most wanted people to hear was that “the greater any of these apprehensions, the greater is the need that we look at them clearly, face to face, without fear, like honest, straightforward Americans, so we do not develop the jitters or any other kind of panic, that we do not fall prey to hysterical thinking. Sometimes you feel almost that we can be excused for getting a little bit hysterical, because these dangers come from so many angles, and they are of such different kinds and, no matter what we do, they still seem to exist.”","3534","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"

Hysteria has become the leitmotif of Donald J. Trump, who suggests that we “strongly consider” shutting down mosques because “some of the ideas and some of the hatred, the absolute hatred, is coming from these areas.” Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz talk about clashes of civilizations and the “lunacy” of admitting refugees from the region. Have I left anyone out? Well, let’s not forget Carly Fiorina, who wants to give the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, the silent treatment while exploring her personal brand of brinksmanship: “I would start rebuilding the Sixth Fleet right under his nose, rebuilding the military—the missile-defense program in Poland right under his nose,” she said at the last Republican debate. “I would conduct very aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states.” Hillary Clinton, as is her habit, has been careful, and a little vague, saying, “We have to be rallying our partners and allies, pulling countries off the sidelines,” while not exactly spelling out an American role.

The Benghazi hearings would seem to have little credibility left, but both events will mark a new stage of the campaign for Clinton, one in which she will have to relinquish the tight control she has maintained over her appearances. At the debate, she will be joined onstage by Bernie Sanders, who has launched a strong challenge and is now favored by twenty-five per cent of likely Democratic voters, to her forty-two per cent, and by Martin O’Malley, Lincoln Chafee, and Jim Webb, all of whom are polling in the one-per-cent range. Vice-President Biden, because he is polling at around eighteen per cent, is eligible to take part, even if he declares at the last minute.","3542","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Biden’s role has been a big open question. Another is why this first debate is so late in coming. The Republicans have already had two, each of which attracted more than twenty million television viewers, and will stage ten more. The Democratic National Committee has authorized only six. One is the Saturday night before Christmas; another is the Sunday night before Martin Luther King, Jr., Day—not times likely to attract large audiences. Given the concerns about the Presidency being passed between a couple of families, why set up a schedule that seems designed to squelch lesser-known candidates’ chances?","3543","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"The lesser-knowns have objected, but Clinton doesn’t seem to mind. One reason for that might be gleaned by looking back to October 30, 2007, when the Democrats debated in Philadelphia. Clinton was the front-runner then, too, and it was the thirteenth time the candidates had met. But it was also, arguably, the first time that her opponents—Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson, John Edwards, Christopher Dodd, Joe Biden, and, most improbably, Barack Obama—seriously challenged her, on all fronts. Edwards accused her of “doubletalk.” Obama called her out for “changing positions whenever it’s politically convenient”—she was “for NAFTA previously, now she’s against it”—and for not being “truthful.” A lot of the time was taken up asking why records of her official work in her husband’s White House were sealed in the Clinton Presidential library. She responded with what must have been intended as judiciousness but came across as obfuscation. When Tim Russert, one of the moderators, tried to determine whether she was in favor of issuing driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants—she had indicated both yes and no—she called his question a “gotcha.”","3544","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"In the days that followed, Clinton and her campaign tried to frame the debate as a Hillary-against-the-world moment, a “pile-on,” orchestrated by what she called, in a speech at Wellesley College, “the all-boys’ club.” Clinton had been considered the winner in most of the previous debates, and even many of her supporters acknowledged that this one marked a turning point. A week before, she was at 48.5 per cent in an average of polls, the highest she had ever been. (Obama registered 21.2.) Immediately afterward, she began a decline and, despite some rebounds, never matched that number again.","3545","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"From her perspective, there may have been something broken about the 2008 debates. A remarkable eighteen million people voted for her during the primary season, and she and her supporters may feel that a process that derailed her then is not one to follow now. But, if Clinton has concluded that the lesson of 2008 is to avoid debates, she does not yet understand why she lost that night in Philadelphia. Polls still show that a perception of dishonesty is her greatest problem among voters. (“They don’t trust you. They might not like you,” Savannah Guthrie told her last week.) Often, that perception is the product of unfair partisan attacks, but, as in 2008, it is also sometimes the result of her decisions. Last Wednesday, Clinton announced that she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that is a high priority for President Obama, even though she had praised the negotiations when she was Secretary of State (“the gold standard in trade agreements”) and referred to them proudly after she left office.","3546","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"The thinking appears to be that she’ll score points with Sanders voters and with organized labor, while Biden, as a loyal member of the Administration, will have to support the T.P.P.—a classic triangulation. But it echoes Obama’s nafta comment from the Philadelphia debate, just as the questions about her White House records now sound like a prelude to the e-mail issue. Fair or not, she needs to push herself to a greater level of openness, and figure out how to have a good week based on a real-world confrontation, not a comedy-sketch encounter. Clinton stayed in the 2008 race for eight months after her loss in Philadelphia. By the end, Barack Obama was a palpably stronger candidate. So, for that matter, was Hillary Clinton. A few weeks after Philadelphia, she had picked herself up and gone to the next debate, in Las Vegas—the site of this week’s meeting—where she performed well. The last question, from a young woman, was a “fun” one: “Do you prefer diamonds or pearls?” Clinton laughed. “Now, I know I’m sometimes accused of not being able to make a choice,” she said. Then she added, “I want both.” ♦","3547","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"In an announcement on Monday morning, Pfizer, the big drug company, whose headquarters are on East 42nd Street, in Manhattan, said that it is merging with one of its competitors, Allergan PLC. Ian Read, a Scottish-born accountant who is Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, said that the proposed deal, which is valued at a hundred and sixty billion dollars, would “create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world.”","November 23, 2015","3548","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace"
"On Wall Street and in the world of big pharma, that statement will raise chuckles. It is widely acknowledged that the primary impetus for the deal is a financial one. In merging with Allergan, which is based in Dublin, Pfizer intends to move its corporate residency to Ireland, where the corporate tax rate is just 12.5 per cent, compared to thirty-five per cent for a company of its size in the United States. Over the next few years, the merger could save Pfizer billions of dollars in taxes and deprive the U.S. Treasury of the same amount.","3549","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace"
"Tax-driven deals of this nature are known as “inversions,” and they are becoming increasingly common. Burger King, Liberty Global, and Medtronic are among the U.S. corporations to have carried out mergers that moved their headquarters abroad. Last year, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said that inversions were “wrong,” and that he would try and restrict them. Only last week, the Treasury Department issued some new administrative guidelines in this area. Without actual legislation, though, there isn’t very much the Obama Administration can do to prevent these exercises in corporate tax-dodging, and Republicans on Capitol Hill have displayed little eagerness to coöperate in a crackdown.","3550","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace"
"The Pfizer–Allergan deal will be the biggest inversion yet, and it is nothing short of a disgrace. Drug companies like Pfizer have long benefitted from taxpayer-funded research carried out under the auspices of organizations like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Now, Pfizer is seeking to avoid paying the taxes that are due on its profits, particularly profits generated by its overseas subsidiaries. Even though the Obama Administration doesn’t have the legal powers to block the Allergan transaction, it should seek to shame Pfizer and its board of directors into calling it off.","3551","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace"
"Founded in 1849, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, by two German cousins, Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart, Pfizer has a long history of researching and developing new drugs and chemicals. Its first commercial product was an anti-parasitic pill designed to fight intestinal worms, which were a common affliction at the time. In the late nineteenth century, it became a leading manufacturer of citric acid, ascorbic acid, and vitamin pills. During the Second World War, it developed a new way of making penicillin, which was then seen as a miracle drug. After the war, the company established itself as a global leader in antibiotics and other areas of medicine. During the nineteen-seventies and eighties, it investing heavily in R. & D., boosting its research budget to about twenty per cent of its sales. These investments produced a number of blockbuster drugs, including Procardia (angina and hypertension), Glucotrol (diabetes), Feldene (inflammation), Zoloft (depression), and Viagra (erectile dysfunction). In 1999, when Pfizer celebrated its hundred and fiftieth anniversary, it was widely seen as the leading drug company in the world.","3552","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace"
"Pfizer continues to employ thousands of dedicated scientists and to invest heavily in medical research. Since 2010, though, when Read took over as chief executive, it has cut its R. & D. budget significantly and raised its spending on stock buybacks. Under Read’s leadership, cost-cutting and financial engineering have sometimes seemed to be driving the company’s strategy. To some extent, these kinds of changes were unavoidable. As the pace of discovery for blockbuster new drugs has slowed in recent decades, all of the big pharmaceutical companies have come under pressure to trim their research budgets and pursue more effective ways of developing products, such as teaming up with innovative startups.","3553","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace"
"So, like many other big American corporations, Pfizer is facing challenges adapting to a changed world. But nothing in its financials or its strategic position suggests that it is facing the sort of threat that might justify the radical and potentially self-destructive move that giving up its U.S. domicile entails. A venerable member of the Fortune 500 now looks for all the world like a greedy tax exile, skipping off to a dodgy foreign locale. (Viewed in terms of its corporate tax policies and the assist it provides to big multinationals seeking to avoid paying taxes in their homelands, Ireland is distinctly dodgy.)","3554","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace"
"Read, in his statement explaining the proposal to merge with Allergen, said that it would help put Pfizer “on a more competitive footing within our industry.” This was a reference to the fact that other big pharma companies, such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novartis, are headquartered in countries with lower corporate tax rates than the United States. However, there is scant evidence that being based in the United States has handicapped Pfizer or made it more difficult for the company to raise capital.","3555","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace"
"To the contrary, being based in the United States enables Pfizer to exploit the vast reservoirs of technical expertise that reside here, and to access federal support for scientific research. For example, according to the company’s Web site, it has dozens of collaborative projects with the National Institutes for Health. And being headquartered in the United States certainly hasn’t prevented Pfizer from making a lot of money. Over the past two years, the company has generated almost nineteen billion dollars in net profits.","3556","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace"
"All things considered, it’s hard to avoid seeing the merger proposal as a cynical move designed to boost Pfizer’s stock price and generate a windfall for the company’s senior managers, who are compensated mainly in equity. If the Obama Administration can’t block the deal, the best hope may be to put some public pressure on Pfizer’s non-executive directors, whose approval is necessary for the merger to go through. Its lead independent director is Dennis Ausiello, an eminent physician who, for many years, was chief of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Other non-executives on the Pfizer board include Frances Fergusson, a former president of Vassar College; Helen Hobbs, a professor of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; W. Don Cornwell, a former chief executive of Granite Broadcasting; and James Kilts, a founding partner at the private equity firm Centerview Capital. These directors are all experienced, worldly individuals. Last year, according to Pfizer’s 2015 proxy statement, they were each paid more than three hundred thousand dollars to carry out their duties, which include overseeing the company’s full-time management and protecting the long-term interests of all of its stakeholders: employees, shareholders, and customers.","3557","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace"
"One of those key interests, surely, is safeguarding Pfizer’s reputation, which has already suffered in recent years, following a big marketing scandal over the since-discontinued painkiller Bextra and other missteps. Read has for years been telling shareholders in his annual letter to them that “earning greater respect from society” is one of Pfizer’s strategic imperatives. One of the ways the company could do this, he said, was through “acting as a respectable corporate citizen.” So here is a question for the independent directors: Do you really think that traducing Pfizer’s proud history by moving to Dublin and shafting American taxpayers would be the act of a “respectable corporate citizen”?","3558","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace"

The rally is co-sponsored by Tea Party Patriots, the Zionist Organization of America, and the Center for Security Policy. It’s likely to be as colorful as it is combative. On “Meet the Press” last month, Trump warned that the deal would be a boon to the Iranians. “They are going to be such a wealthy, such a powerful nation,” he said. “They are going to have nuclear weapons. They are going to take over parts of the world that you wouldn’t believe. And I think it’s going to lead to nuclear holocaust.”","3560","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"Former Vice-President Dick Cheney has joined the debate. He is scheduled to give a major address on Iran in Washington next week, at the American Enterprise Institute. “Nearly everything the president has told us about his Iranian agreement is false,” Cheney wrote on Friday, in a Wall Street Journal piece adapted from his book. “He has said it will prevent the Iranians from acquiring nuclear weapons, but it will actually facilitate and legitimize an Iranian nuclear arsenal. He has said this deal will stop nuclear proliferation, but it will actually accelerate it, as nations across the Middle East work to acquire their own weapons in response to America’s unwillingness to stop the Iranian nuclear program.”","3561","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"The focus in Washington is already shifting, however, to whether the Democrats might be able to win seven more endorsements—for a total of forty-one—to invoke a filibuster that would prevent the deal from even coming to a vote in the Senate. Republicans, with limited Democratic support, have been hoping to pass a Resolution of Disapproval in both the Senate and the House by September 17th. Obama pledged that he would veto it. Support from thirty-four senators now means that the President would be able to sustain his veto—if it comes to that.","3562","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"“We’ve always said that our goal was for the Administration to be able to implement this deal—whatever that took in Congress,” a senior Administration official told me Wednesday.

"So far, the prospects of the Democrats blocking a vote altogether are sketchy. Even support for the nuclear agreement—announced on July 24th, after twenty months of tortured diplomacy between Iran and the world’s six major powers—is either tepid or reluctant in both houses of Congress.

Her views reflected those of many fellow-Democrats.","3564","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"“No deal is perfect, especially one negotiated with the Iranian regime,” Mikulski said. “I have concluded that this Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is the best option available to block Iran from having a nuclear bomb.

"Kerry also made an emotional final pitch for the deal, before congressional debate begins next week, in a speech in Philadelphia. “The outcome will matter as much as any foreign-policy decision in recent history,” he said. “To vote down this agreement is to solve nothing. . . . To oppose this agreement is—whether intended or not—to recommend . . . a policy of national paralysis. It is to take us back directly to the very dangerous spot that we were in two years ago—only to go back there devoid of any realistic plan or option.”","3568","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"The White House has long claimed that the deal with Iran was about only one issue and does not represent an attempt at rapprochement between Washington and Tehran. But the Administration’s arguments increasingly hint at future possibilities. “The Iran agreement is not a panacea for the sectarian and extremist violence that has been ripping that region apart,” Kerry said in Philadelphia. “But history may judge it a turning point, a moment when the builders of stability seized the initiative from the destroyers of hope, and when we were able to show, as have generations before us, that when we demand the best from ourselves and insist that others adhere to a similar high standard—when we do that, we have immense power to shape a safer and a more humane world.”","3569","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"

Larijani is a powerful figure and a conservative. The son of a grand ayatollah, he is a former Presidential candidate.

"In the media coverage of Tuesday’s Democratic debate, there was almost universal agreement that Hillary Clinton came out on top.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, I pronounced Clinton the big winner, saying that she had been “sharp, personable, and assured.” I also said that Sanders “gave a good account of himself,” but that didn’t satisfy some readers. Within hours, the complaints were raining in—on Twitter, on Facebook, and elsewhere. Had I been coöpted by the Clinton campaign? Was I watching the same debate as everybody else? Did I have a clue what I was writing about?","3573","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"For the record, my answers are no, yes, and I hope so.","3574","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"It’s certainly possible that I, and many other commentators, got it wrong. The media has erred before, plenty of times. Back in April, when Sanders announced his candidacy, many observers wrote him off as a fringe candidate who wouldn’t have much of an impact. I didn’t make that particular error: indeed, I welcomed Sanders to the race, pointing out that he would “provide a voice to those Democrats who agree with him that the U.S. political system has been bought, lock, stock, and barrel.” That one I got right. But on the Republican side, after Donald Trump jumped in, I underestimated his staying power, as did many other members of the media. Did we get the Democratic debate wrong, too?","3575","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"Let’s look, briefly, at the case for the prosecution. At AlterNet, the alternative-news site, Adam Johnson pointed out, “Sanders won the CNN focus group, the Fusion focus group, and the Fox News focus group; in the latter, he even converted several Hillary supporters. He won the Slate online poll, CNN/Time online poll, 9News Colorado, The Street online poll, Fox5 poll, the conservative Drudge online poll and the liberal Daily Kos online poll. There wasn’t, to this writer’s knowledge, a poll he didn’t win by at least an 18-point margin.”","3576","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"At the other end of the ideological spectrum, Dick Morris, the Republican political strategist and Clinton antagonist, suggested that the media no longer understands a Democratic electorate that has moved to the left and is now highly issues-oriented. “Sanders identified and successfully focused on his two main issues: First, income inequality and the need to break up the big banks and second, the need for more restraint in committing military forces abroad,” Morris wrote on his Web site. “These two positions, clearly articulated in the debate will impel Sanders to a steep rise in the polls.”","3577","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The ultimate arbiter of who won the debate will, of course, be the public, not the pundits. But we won’t get a reliable reading of public opinion until we see some scientifically conducted surveys based on random samples of Democratic voters. The post-debate online polls weren’t of this type: their samples were self-selecting, and you would expect their results to be skewed toward the candidate with the most-committed supporters. In this race, without a doubt, that is Sanders.","3578","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The only post-debate poll I’ve seen that employed orthodox surveying techniques was carried out by the research firm Gravis Marketing, and it showed Clinton as the clear victor. Researchers for Gravis asked a random sample of seven hundred and sixty registered Democrats across the United States this question: “Who do you think won the debate?” Sixty-two per cent of respondents said Clinton, thirty per cent said Sanders, and six per cent said Martin O’Malley. It’s just one poll and its results aren’t definitive, but if most Democratic voters, in fact, believe that Sanders won, it is an enormous outlier.","3579","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The findings of the media focus groups deserve to be taken more seriously than the online polls, but here, too, representativeness is an issue. For the first G.O.P. debate, Frank Luntz, who runs focus groups for Fox News, organized a panel of Republican voters, which said that Donald Trump had performed poorly. Subsequently, Trump’s lead in the polls increased (and he excoriated Luntz on Twitter). Still, the fact that all three of the focus groups mentioned in Johnson’s article identified Sanders as the winner shouldn’t be dismissed; nor should the participants’ responses. When Luntz asked some members of his group, which consisted of Democratic voters from Florida, for a one- or two-word description of Sanders’s performance, these were some of the responses he received: “for the people,” “strong,” “straightforward,” “confident,” “direct,” “sincere,” “powerful,” “educator,” and “smart.”","3580","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"As I noted in my post-debate post, Sanders certainly “got his message through.” As Morris pointed out, it’s a message that resonates with many Democratic voters and is forcing other candidates, Clinton very much included, to adapt to it. It may also be true that Sanders benefitted from the fact that many viewers were seeing him for the first time on the national stage, and that the media underestimated this factor. “Beforehand, a third of Democrats said they didn’t yet know enough about Sanders to have an opinion on him,” Andrew Prokop pointed out in a post at Vox. “Even many of those who did know about him likely hadn’t been exposed to him all that much. So when Sanders makes the case at length for why he’s a democratic socialist, many of these voters might not have heard that before—and might like it.”","3581","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"But just because Sanders did well doesn’t mean he did best of all. In judging the winner of any debate, it’s probably wise to consider at least three questions. Who did the best onstage? Who came out on top in the polls? Who gave his or her campaign the biggest boost?","3582","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The second question I’ve already covered. The answer to the first one is subjective, though anybody who was on a high-school or college debate team knows that it’s not entirely so. Based on Clinton’s manner, her ability to react to what others were saying, and her deftness in evading awkward questions, I think she delivered the best performance, even though, as I wrote yesterday, I strongly disagreed with some of her answers, particularly those relating to Edward Snowden. Some of Clinton’s Republican critics agreed with my assessment of her manner. Trump said that she “did what she had to do.” Scott Walker, who dropped out of the race last month, said, “She came across as surprisingly very confident and I thought relatively pleasant.”","3583","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"So much for technique. The main reason that I think Clinton emerged as the winner relates to the third question: she gave her campaign a huge and much-needed boost. Of all the debate participants, she had the most to lose. After six months in which Clinton struggled to deal with the issue of her use of a private e-mail server while she was secretary of state, Democratic élites and donors were starting to question her abilities as a candidate. A poor performance on Tuesday could well have engendered outright panic. Clinton not only reassured the elected politicians, interest groups, and donors who have thrown in with her; she dealt a big blow to the “draft Biden” movement, which probably, in hindsight, needed its man to be onstage in Las Vegas.","3584","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The Clinton campaign believes that it can ultimately deal with a buoyant Sanders, even one who raises more money after the debate or gains a few more points in the polls. A panicking Democratic establishment and a swift entry into the race by Joe Biden would have presented a much more alarming scenario—one that now appears to be receding as a possibility. The Vice-President may still decide to run, but it will be harder for him to portray himself as a savior for the Party.","3585","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"

Sage grouse can fly at sixty miles per hour, for brief stretches, usually while trying to elude ravens, golden eagles, coyotes, badgers, skunks, or red foxes, which prey on them. The dances of every Plains Indian tribe include imitations of the bird’s mating strut, and in the nineteenth century the birds, sometimes called prairie chickens, were so numerous—as many as sixteen million—that they enabled hungry Europeans to expand across the American West. Although their population has dropped to between two hundred thousand and five hundred thousand, they remain an “indicator” species, reflecting the condition of elk, pronghorn, mule deer, golden eagles, pygmy rabbits, and some three hundred and fifty other plant and animal species. Within the bird’s sagebrush habitat, an area that has shrunk by more than half but is still as big as Texas and spread across eleven states, the bird’s fate is tied to the fate of just about everything else.","3588","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-the-sage-grouse-win-the-west"
"In 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service settled lawsuits filed by two small environmental groups by agreeing to decide, by September 30th, whether to list the sage grouse as endangered. The decision promises to be the most important in the forty-two-year history of the Endangered Species Act. A listing would turn what is already a hot political issue in sagebrush states into a firestorm, infuriating Republicans hostile to federal regulation and jeopardizing the Act, one of the most significant environmental laws ever passed.","3589","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-the-sage-grouse-win-the-west"
"The intensity of resistance is in direct proportion to the vastness of sage-grouse habitat; opponents see the listing as the imposition of a layer of onerous federal regulations across parts of eleven states. It would compel ranchers, miners, and oil-and-gas developers to curb activities that disturb significant concentrations of sage grouse—by, say, changing a road’s route, a proposed gas field’s location, or the timing of cattle grazing. It would rarely cause proposed projects to be blocked, but it could increase costs and bureaucratic delays for land-users. Given the expected resistance, it’s uncertain how much a listing would help the bird. But if the scientific data, which the Service’s sage-grouse biologists finished compiling last month, show that threats to the bird aren’t declining, the Service is required by the law to list it as endangered.","3590","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-the-sage-grouse-win-the-west"
"At first glance, sagebrush terrain doesn’t look particularly inviting, but it’s seductive, an old-growth forest in miniature. Sagebrush, which usually grows to no more than a few feet tall, provides sage grouse with cover from raptors and nourishes chicks with plants and insects, and its leaves provide the entirety of the birds’ diet through the harsh winter. Sage grouse require lots of space: they mate in one area, nest in another, and raise their chicks in a third, which may be as far as twenty miles from the other two. Except when they’re mating, the birds are hard to find— so hard, in fact, that though they’re one of the world’s most studied birds, there’s no way to count them accurately; population estimates are extrapolations based on the number of males who show up at mating grounds, known as leks. The result is that you can look across a sagebrush expanse and be tricked into thinking it’s empty.","3591","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-the-sage-grouse-win-the-west"
"Much of sage-grouse habitat is also prized by humans for its natural resources. Thirty-seven per cent of the bird’s population resides in Wyoming, the nation’s leading coal producer, fifth-largest natural-gas producer, eighth-largest crude-oil producer, and twenty-third-largest beef producer—and much of that activity takes places near sage-grouse habitat.","3592","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-the-sage-grouse-win-the-west"
"The sage-grouse issue “is really a question about the future of the sagebrush ecosystem,” Holly Copeland, a Nature Conservancy biologist who has studied how sage-grouse conservation affects other species in Wyoming’s Green River Basin, told me. An oil well that disturbs a lek also damages surrounding sagebrush. Mule deer that, until drillers arrived, might have slowly grazed their way through the sagebrush during their spring migration instead move quickly across the degraded ground; as a result, they arrive at higher elevations before the grass there has greened, and they risk going hungry. But where sage grouse thrive, most of nature’s clocks are still working. Copeland’s study found that sage-grouse conservation measures alone doubled conservation of mule-deer habitat.","3593","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-the-sage-grouse-win-the-west"
"With the listing deadline approaching, the issue has become so fraught that Republicans inserted a rider into last December’s budget bill that would block the Service from enforcing or even publishing a decision to list the bird as endangered or threatened, although a decision not to list could be published. In addition, the defense-authorization bill that the House approved in May includes a provision that would extend the ban on listing sage grouse for another decade. Any effort to repeal or gut the Endangered Species Act would likely be met by a Presidential veto; instead, Republicans are using riders to nibble away at it. But even if the sage grouse isn’t listed, the Act has already served the bird’s interests by setting in motion the largest collaborative conservation effort in the nation’s history. Hoping to ward off an “endangered” listing, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture—government agencies known for regarding one another with indifference, if not disdain—have worked together and with land users to protect the sage grouse. The birds require large swaths of undisturbed terrain, but their habitat has become a tangled mosaic of public and private land. Helping them, therefore, requires coöperation across boundaries and agencies, involving the ranchers and developers who own or lease the land.","3594","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-the-sage-grouse-win-the-west"
"“The main reason that I’m engaged in the sagebrush-ecosystem work is because this is setting a prototype for a whole new way of doing conservation,” Brian Rutledge, a National Audubon Society vice-president and Colorado rancher, said. “Instead of curing little postage-stamp representative pieces, it looks at the whole organism at one time, so that we can devise a plan for the whole ecosystem in one fell swoop—that’s why this is important.”","3595","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-the-sage-grouse-win-the-west"
"In late May, the Bureau of Land Management (B.L.M.), a “multi-use” agency that manages two hundred and forty-five million acres of federal land, including forty-five per cent of sage-grouse habitat, announced a plan to ban development on about ten per cent of the B.L.M. property that contains sizable oil and gas reserves, in order to protect nearby leks and nesting grounds. It devised the plan with the Forest Service, state agencies, ranchers, miners, and oil-and-gas developers after years of negotiation. The House-approved defense bill includes a provision that would enable affected governors, most of whom are Republicans, to “opt out” of the B.L.M. plan, but few are likely to take up the invitation. The enemy, they say, isn’t conservation itself, which is widely acknowledged as vital and can be molded to fit local conditions, but the particular federal regulations that an “endangered” listing would trigger.","3596","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-the-sage-grouse-win-the-west"
"By the end of 2014, more than eleven hundred ranchers managing 4.4 million acres of privately owned land—an area almost as big as New Jersey—had signed on to the Sage Grouse Initiative, a voluntary program created by the U.S.D.A., which restricts grazing practices and herd sizes in order to protect sagebrush. A hundred and fifty-eight ranchers have also signed conservation easements, which ban subdivisions of their properties in perpetuity, a restriction that applies to more than four hundred and fifty thousand acres of land. All of this represents a triumph of conservation at the state and local level. If the bird is listed, many ranchers say that they will assume that conservation is the Feds’ problem, not theirs, and will walk away from the Sage Grouse Initiative.","3597","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-the-sage-grouse-win-the-west"
"Whether or not the bird is listed, the species will continue to face the threat of death by a thousand cuts. The greatest menace is the fragmentation of sage-grouse habitat by humans, but that’s hardly the only peril. At higher elevations, juniper is encroaching on sagebrush; at lower elevations, cheatgrass, an invasive species from Asia, is moving in. Cheatgrass replaces the native bunchgrasses and flowers that chicks need with a weed that creates tinder for wildfires, which, fuelled by climate change and drought, consume vast tracts of sage-grouse habitat. Miners and energy developers invariably shred sagebrush landscape. Even when restoration programs are put in place, sagebrush requires many decades to recover. Transmission lines from wind turbines and solar-power installations offer ideal perches for raptors to stare down into the sagebrush. Feral horses and burros, which range farther than cattle and can eat twice as much forage per day, ravage sagebrush terrain; fifty thousand of them now roam through ten Western states. Even sage-grouse physiognomy has been turned against the birds: their eyes point sideways, which is useful for identifying predators but leaves a blind spot straight ahead, causing them to crash into fences.","3598","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-the-sage-grouse-win-the-west"
"Of course, few sage grouse live a full lifespan; they’re prey, after all. Each March and April, the males show up at the leks whether or not any females are present; they have a strong loyalty to the lek, which they return to year after year, even if it was turned into a road a century and a half earlier. The males strut, fanning out their spiky tail feathers and displaying two pendulous ochre sacs that hang from their chests like water balloons. The birds take a few steps forward, emit a couple of bongo-like popping sounds, and make a grand lunge that jiggles the sacs portentously. Then they look around, perhaps to see if any females have noticed. The dance looks simultaneously preposterous and archetypal, like something out of high school. The females appear only when ready to conceive. They fly in, pick out a male with requisite genes, and copulate; the act takes all of two seconds. Males usually outnumber females on the lek by at least ten to one, and only a few of the males do all the mating. With possibly unintended vividness, scientists refer to the favored males as “master cocks.” The others, having convulsed to no avail, just watch. They’re dogged birds, accustomed to disappointment.","3599","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/will-the-sage-grouse-win-the-west"

The implication is that it’s a mystery why a sixty-two-year-old third-generation politician, the grandson of a senator and the son and brother of Presidents (his own son George P.

Bush, as an insider, is supposed to know better than to be this candid, especially when he is confronted with the difficult task of persuading a very conservative Republican primary electorate to trust him, while in full view, via the press, of the much more liberal general electorate.

Right-brain politicians think about politics, and about how to connect with people. George W.’s description of himself, in the 2000 campaign, as a “compassionate conservative” was brilliantly vague—liberals heard it as “I’m not all that conservative,” and conservatives heard it as “I’m deeply religious.” It was about him as a person, not a program. Jeb’s slogan, “Right to rise,” is harder-edged, more specific in its implications, less personal, and easier to attack.","3602","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"

"It may not be so easy for liberals in 2015 to understand why many conservatives regard George W. as a sellout.

No less than liberals, conservatives feel themselves to be perpetual underdogs, because the other side’s main selling point, the provision of government benefits to people, is far more immediately appealing. Conservatives see themselves as having the challenge of arguing that you really shouldn’t want the goodies the Democrats are offering you.

"Mike Hauke opened a pizza and sub shop in Atlantic City in 2009, but only after he had failed in nine tries to rent the space to somebody else. He had bought the building three years earlier on the advice of his father, an accountant who considered distressed real estate a smart long-term bet. This piece of real estate seemed to test the proposition. It was a bedraggled three-story clapboard house that years of neighborhood demolition and neglect had stranded at the edge of several mostly vacant blocks, which together formed an urban badlands reaching all the way to the dunes. This was the South Inlet, a once thriving part of town and now more or less a desolate slum at the northeastern end of Absecon Island, the landmass that is home to Atlantic City and three other municipalities. People from “offshore,” as locals like to call the mainland, tend to think of the island’s Inlet end as north, because it’s upcoast, but locals call it east. Atlantic City has a Bermuda Triangle effect; it can confound a compass.","3609","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Three blocks west of Hauke’s place, an immense slab of steel and glass was rising over the badlands: a hotel and casino to be called Revel, destined to be bigger and more opulent than anything Atlantic City had ever seen—two towers, reaching almost fifty stories, nearly four thousand rooms, and parking for more than seven thousand cars. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, had bought the land in 2006, for seventy million dollars, and sunk about $1.2 billion into the project. (Revel, as some have noted, is “lever” spelled backward.) By the end, the cost of building Revel reached more than $2.4 billion, making it the most expensive private construction project in the history of New Jersey.","3610","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Hauke went after the crumbs. Unable to find a commercial tenant for his house’s ground floor (the apartments upstairs were designated Section 8, for low-income tenants), he started selling rudimentary takeout to Revel’s construction crews. Their rush-hour bulk orders overwhelmed his staff, but off hours the place was dead: a trickle of casino workers and, in Hauke’s words, “shitbags, crackheads, hustlers, and pimps.”","3611","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Hauke, a recent graduate of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, had spent a couple of years in Hoboken and Manhattan working in marketing, but he had no restaurant experience. One of his first customers was a neighborhood junkie known as V8 Man (“All the white kids are junkies,” Hauke said. “The Inlet does it to everybody”), who, on opening night, picked a fight at the counter with a male prostitute and another customer; Hauke smashed a pizza paddle on the counter and used the sharp end to scare him off. More than once, a guy came in trying to unload stolen merchandise as the victimized storekeeper came running up the street in pursuit. One morning, a neighborhood kid rode by on a bicycle and threw a crude pipe bomb through the window; Hauke chased him in his car and, after cornering him briefly in an abandoned house, hounded him on foot across a vacant tract called Pauline’s Prairie, named after Pauline Hill, a city planner in the sixties who’d had this stretch of the neighborhood bulldozed for urban renewal, which never came. The kid, looking over his shoulder, ran into the side of a parked box truck. The police appeared and put him in cuffs. His grievance was that cops had been patronizing Hauke’s shop and that sheriffs had evicted his cousins, Hauke’s Section 8 tenants, from one of the apartments upstairs. The tenants, according to Hauke, had been running a welfare scam. They’d also been throwing dirty diapers on his customers and fishing for pigeons from the roof.","3612","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Hauke hoped that, in spite of such annoyances, Revel would either provide him with an income stream or else buy him out. A few neighborhood property owners said that it would never happen. They’d been holding on for years themselves, in the hope of selling to a big casino, and in the interim they’d been gutted by rising property taxes and ongoing decay. The problem was that the area was zoned for big casino-hotels. You couldn’t build a house, and the few houses left in the neighborhood—most had been demolished or had burned down, accidentally or not—were old and badly battered by the salt air. One of them, down near the beach, across the street from a run-down low-income housing complex called the Waterside, belonged to a teacher Hauke had got to know named Tony Zarych, who’d moved to Atlantic City as a teen-ager forty years earlier, when his family was buying up property around town. He’d worked as a baccarat dealer at the Sands, until it closed (it was demolished in 2007), and now taught English as a second language at an elementary school. He liked to hunt wild turkey offshore and sometimes had carcasses hanging outside. His property taxes had risen sharply, as the city contended with a steep drop in tax revenues from the casinos. “Get out while you can,” Zarych told Hauke.","3613","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Sure enough, in 2009, amid the financial meltdown, Revel, only half built, ran out of money. In April, 2010, Morgan Stanley quit the project, booking a loss of almost a billion dollars. Construction stopped. Hauke’s business withered. “There were no more tourists or construction workers,” he recalled. “Mostly just cops. And crackheads wanting free shit.” But something about the city, and about the Inlet’s seaside squalor, made him want to stay on. Maybe it was the fact that his great-grandmother had attended shul in the Inlet. Or that he’d simply got sand in his shoes, as the locals say about those who take to the place.","3614","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"After grinding along for another year, Hauke shut down the shop, spiffed it up, and rechristened it Tony Boloney’s. He bought a food truck, which he named the Mustache Mobile, and developed a line of pizzas and novelty subs that he marketed as “indigenous Atlantic City grub,” as though he’d revived an obscure provincial cuisine. Soon, Tony Boloney’s began winning foodie awards and luring in not just gamblers, night-clubbers, food-truck connoisseurs, politicians, and cops but also a procession of casino magnates and real-estate speculators who were visiting the neighborhood, often on the sly, to size up the distressed property next door.","3615","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"At the beginning of 2011, Governor Chris Christie pledged tax incentives to Revel worth more than a quarter of a billion dollars. (The incentives were tied to certain revenue targets, which, in the end, Revel failed to meet.) Christie had evidently decided that Revel’s success was essential to the survival of Atlantic City, and therefore his gubernatorial track record. His pledge helped Revel secure new financing from an array of hedge funds, including Chatham Asset Management and Canyon Capital, which manage hundreds of millions of dollars in New Jersey state pension funds.","3616","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Construction resumed, and Christie came to town. After a photo op at a famous sub shop called the White House and a visit to the Revel site, he dropped in at Tony Boloney’s and urged Hauke to keep the place going. “Listen, you gotta stick around,” Christie told him. The Revel executives were emphatic as well: “It’ll look bad if you close. Please don’t go anywhere.” The head of Chatham Asset Management hired Hauke to cater his annual Halloween party, up in Essex County.","3617","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Revel opened in the spring of 2012, with Beyoncé performing a series of concerts in its auditorium. (She also took over the Presidential Suite, relegating Michelle Obama and her daughters to another suite.) The plan had been scaled back—just fourteen hundred rooms, and one tower instead of two. The tower’s midsection had a half-dozen stories not yet built out; you could see clear through it. Still, it was an impressive building, with sleek, airy marbled atriums and lobbies that had little in common with the smoky, windowless, carpeted caverns of the older mega-casinos down the boardwalk. Unlike all the rest, it directed one’s attention to the ocean and had ample outdoor space, a two-acre terrace with firepits and cabanas. Even from the outside, Revel had an ethereal appeal. The reflective glass took on the sky’s hue and became almost invisible at dusk, a stealth casino guarding the edge of town.","3618","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

"The casino wasn’t making nearly as much money as the developers had anticipated. Some observers blamed the layout—the hotel-room elevators didn’t access the casino floor, and a long, tortuous trip from the entrance to the check-in desk didn’t take you through it, either—or the fact that Revel prohibited smoking, or that its slot machines didn’t seem to pay out, or that it was stingy with the comps. Even though occupancy was decent and the night clubs and restaurants were busy, the tables and slots weren’t taking in enough to offset the cost of operating the place—the burden of debt service, high property taxes, bad leases with the tenants, and an expensive arrangement for power and light. Within a year of opening, Revel filed for bankruptcy. It restructured and emerged from Chapter 11 a few months later, but the economics still didn’t make sense, and so, in the spring of 2014, it went bankrupt once again.

"From the time Morgan Stanley began searching in vain for equity partners, Revel had been in play, and all along Tony Boloney’s had served as an informal commissary for would-be investors and buyers. Among those whom Hauke and his staff said they’d seen were Steve Wynn, who had sold the Golden Nugget in 1987 and vowed never to come back; various hedge-funders from New York; and a group of Chinese men—the Export-Import Bank of China was at one point in talks to buy a piece—who took over Hauke’s tables and held meetings for hours, without ordering anything.","3621","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"A mysterious character in tattered clothing and a handlebar mustache had been showing up a few times a year, engaging the staff in conversation about space travel and Elon Musk. He claimed to represent someone who was going to buy Revel. Hauke and his team were skeptical, but one day last summer, just before the casino closed, the man rolled up in a baby-blue Bentley convertible. Maybe he was for real. “My guy’s going to offer ninety million,” he said. His guy, he went on, was from Florida and intended to erect a “Tower of Geniuses” on the Revel site, a high-rise think tank, which would draw on NASA and the federal government’s aviation-research facility at Atlantic City Airport, just offshore.","3622","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"If not for zany schemes, Atlantic City would still be a sand dune. Within weeks, news broke that a little-known Florida developer named Glenn Straub, the owner of Palm Beach Polo Golf and Country Club, had offered ninety million dollars to buy Revel. Straub wanted to put up the aborted second tower and fill it with academics and scientists charged with solving the world’s problems: your Tower of Geniuses. Few in town took this seriously, but, as far as the bankruptcy was concerned, he’d established a baseline. Everything has a clearing price. The bad news was that Straub’s offer was less than four cents on the dollar—a chilling signal of how far Atlantic City had fallen and may yet fall. The good news was that the building—and you might even say the town—was worth anything at all.","3623","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Most cities exist as a consequence of commercial or strategic utility. Atlantic City is more of a proposition and a ploy. The town fathers of Cape May, the first American seaside resort, weren’t interested in a railway, or perhaps the class of people who’d ride in on one—the well-to-do arrived from Philadelphia by boat—so a group of investors built, in 1854, what became known as a “railroad to nowhere,” to a spot a little way up the coast that was more or less the shortest possible distance from Philadelphia to the sea. Over the decades, and with the industrial-era advent of leisure time and disposable income, this forsaken wedge of salt marsh and sand became “the world’s playground”—a crucible of conspicuous consumption and a stage for the aspirations and masquerades of visitors and entrepreneurs. In some respects, Atlantic City was where America learned how to turn idle entertainment into big business. For a while, it was home to some of the world’s grandest hotels (the Marlborough-Blenheim was the largest reinforced-concrete building in the world, and was later imploded in the music video for Bruce Springsteen’s “Atlantic City”), as well as some of its more ardent iniquities and diversions. The night clubs were as often as not fronts for backroom gambling halls, intermittently tolerated by the authorities.","3624","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The city, like so many, has its racial demons. At the turn of the twentieth century, Atlantic City had one of the highest African-American populations of any city north of the Mason-Dixon Line, owing to the abundance of jobs in the hotels. The archetypal amusement was that of white working-class visitors kicking back in the boardwalk’s famous wicker rolling chairs while black people did the pushing—a “public performance of racial dominance,” notes the historian Bryant Simon, in “Boardwalk of Dreams.” Though the Northside, traditionally a black neighborhood, had been a thriving district, the decline in tourism to the city, after the Second World War, hit it hard. With the rise of affordable air travel, people started going to Florida and the Caribbean instead. The city desegregated. Disneyland opened.","3625","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Legalized gambling was supposed to rescue the city from its obsolescence as a resort and convention town, a condition that came to national attention during the 1964 Democratic Convention there and grew more conspicuous as the decade wore on. A dozen years later, the state passed the Casino Control Act, which was, at least ostensibly, an attempt to reverse the decline. But, perhaps predictably, a lot of the money that flowed in flowed right back out—to the casino operators and their financing schemes (“I made a lot of money in Atlantic City,” Donald Trump said at the recent Republican debate. “And I’m very proud of it”) and to their subsequent efforts to lobby for the approval of casino gambling in other states. New Jersey, which taxes the casinos to fund a seniors’ prescription-drug program, among other things, always got its piece.","3626","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Neglect of the city has been attributed to a bloated municipal payroll—a budget nearly double what it was ten years ago—and the years of corruption and mismanagement in city government. Some blame the suffocating effect of the casinos, which are boxed off from the city and are designed to keep patrons inside losing money rather than outside spending it. Others point to the thorny old problem of race or the dreary question of the structure of municipal government statewide.","3627","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The dividing line between south and north, and between white and black, used to be Atlantic Avenue, the main commercial street, which runs parallel to the sea. It was where South Jersey shopped for wedding dresses and jewelry; now it’s a gantlet of shabby storefronts and fast-food joints, running toward and away from the New Jersey Transit bus terminal. In the streets that run from the boardwalk, dilapidation and squalor are not hard to find. Wood’s Loan Office, a pawnshop established in 1927, is owned and operated by Martin Wood, a seventy-nine-year-old Atlantic City native. Wood, who is white (his grandfather, a metallurgist, came to town from Lithuania at the end of the nineteenth century and used to scavenge for junk on the beach with a horse-drawn wagon), has noticed an uptick in the number of shopping bags from the outlet mall, a few blocks away. In his opinion, the sixties were worse. “It’s not that bad here. Yet.” Twenty years ago, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority moved the pawnshop a few blocks, in an effort to remedy the city’s oft-lamented lack of a supermarket. “But they opened a discount liquor store next door to the new supermarket,” Wood said. “That was not a good move. They wound up with winos hanging around. People were scared to go to the supermarket. So it closed up.”","3628","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"“Atlantic City turned its back on the boardwalk,” Paul Steelman, a prominent casino architect who grew up nearby, said. “It’s the most prominent pedestrian walkway in the world. It’s got everything going for it except the buildings that are on it.” His solution: “Cut holes in the casinos and let out all those people, all that capital.”","3629","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"In order to prevent monopolies, the Casino Control Act stipulated that no one could own more than three casinos. In the eighties, Donald Trump became the first to hit that limit. Eventually, the provision was scrapped, and by 2014 Caesars owned four. Carl Icahn now effectively controls a quarter of the market with just two casinos, the Tropicana and the Taj Mahal.","3630","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Does Atlantic City need more gambling, or less? There are proponents on both sides. Some favor alternative entertainments (concerts, water parks, polo, legalized marijuana) or the panacean potential of higher education (Stockton University, a state college headquartered offshore, has long wanted an Atlantic City campus). A few push for smaller boutique casinos, and others swear by the existing big-box regimen, just done better. In Las Vegas the ratio of revenue is two-thirds non-gaming to one-third gaming. In Atlantic City the situation is reversed. Since 2006, gaming revenue has dropped by half, from a peak of $5.2 billion to $2.7 billion. As that stream dries up, logic suggests tapping others. And yet the casinos remain lucrative. Divided among eight casinos—that’s how many are left—$2.7 billion isn’t bad. This may be the locals’ most commonly stated reassurance. The city has a higher concentration of casinos than anywhere outside Nevada. It gets twenty-five million visitors a year.","3631","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

"Two weeks after the shuttering of Revel, Trump Plaza closed—the fourth casino to do so in 2014. The first was the Atlantic Club, né the Golden Nugget, built in 1980 by Steve Wynn, with financing by Michael Milken and one of the earliest iterations of the junk bond, and then owned (and rechristened), in succession, by Bally’s, Hilton, and Resorts International. Two competitors, Tropicana (owned by Icahn) and Caesars (controlled by the private-equity firms Apollo Management and TPG Capital), bought out the bankrupt Atlantic Club, closed it, and divvied up the scraps. Next came the Showboat. It was profitable, but its owner, Caesars, hobbled by debt, needed to consolidate. (The amputation failed: in January, Caesars declared bankruptcy; another of its holdings, the Bally’s casino, has been rumored to be the next to go.) Meanwhile, Trump Entertainment Resorts declared bankruptcy (its fourth), and Icahn, who’d bought up Trump’s debt, played a game of chicken with the casino workers’ union and the state. (Donald Trump himself no longer runs the company or the casinos, and he has sued to have his name removed.) In December, the Trump Taj Mahal was about to close; Icahn, having squeezed the state and the union for concessions on taxes and benefits, found twenty million dollars to keep it open, and since then it has limped along, a zombie casbah.","3634","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"It’s not all the big shots’ fault. There’s just been less money to go around. Atlantic City has lost its monopoly on legalized gambling on the East Coast. First came the casinos on Indian reservations in Connecticut, in the nineties, and then, in recent years, the advance of gaming across state lines, in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and upstate New York. (Some industry experts will tell you that Manhattan is destined to have tables, too.) Now there’s talk of casinos in North Jersey, which, along with video-slot parlors at the racetracks (“racinos”), would cannibalize the action in Atlantic City.","3635","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Neighboring states approved legalized gambling in the hope that it would do for their economies and state treasuries what it once did for New Jersey’s. Perhaps they should hope instead that it does not. The casino closures in Atlantic City have contributed to the loss of nearly ten thousand jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and who knows how many associated income streams, reputable or not. The city has fewer than forty thousand permanent residents; the majority of Atlantic City’s workers live offshore, in the townships of Atlantic County, which, in the first quarter of this year, led the nation in foreclosures. Property taxes in the city have doubled since 2008 and were up twenty-nine per cent in 2014, to make up for the drop in tax revenue from the casinos and in the taxable value of the property. The city is around four hundred million dollars in debt. Earlier this year, its credit rating was downgraded to junk-bond status.","3636","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"After convening a few summits on the predicament in Atlantic City, which resulted in a dire report, Governor Christie, in January, appointed two emergency managers, Kevin Lavin and Kevyn Orr, to oversee the city’s finances, wresting control from the mayor and the city council. The fact that Orr had previously served as Detroit’s emergency manager, steering Detroit into and out of bankruptcy, led observers to predict that he’d been hired to do the same for Atlantic City. Perhaps mercifully, the mayor, Don Guardian, was relieved of some of the hardest decisions, about who and how many to fire and what services to deprive the citizens of. “A good manager welcomes a good auditor,” he told me. The mess was now Christie’s. Presiding over the first bankruptcy for a New Jersey municipality since the Great Depression would not help his Presidential ambitions, and, perhaps more important, it would raise the already high costs of borrowing across a state whose finances are very grim. Christie staked a lot on his rescue of Atlantic City, and so far the bet’s not looking so good.","3637","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"In May, the city submitted a plan to lay off two hundred city workers, about a fifth of the municipal workforce. Orr returned to private practice, having been paid seventy thousand dollars for three months of part-time work.

"Abandonment, and the spectre of bankruptcy, intensified the bleakness of the winter in Atlantic City. At one end of the boardwalk, Revel loomed dark. At night, the blare of piped-in pop warped in the wind, and floodlight spilled out over the dunes, which, post-Sandy, were just a layer of sand atop an armature of giant sandbags. The obituarists who came to gawk didn’t have to bother going so far. On the façade of the first casino that one saw after pulling off the expressway there was the ghost lettering of the immense sign that once spelled out “Trump Plaza” and, beneath it, a billboard that read “The Center of It All.” (The small print read “Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-Gambler”—advice, maybe, for the city itself.) Visitors regularly stopped to photograph this, to add to their portfolio of what some locals, resenting the attention, considered ruin porn.","3639","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The greatest ruin was to the lives of the thousands who’d lost their jobs. One morning, I met Dawn Inglin, who had gone to work as a cocktail waitress at the Plaza when it first opened, in 1984. She’d come to town three years before, when a friend got her a role in a dinner-theatre company down shore, in Ocean City, and then she found herself auditioning at Harrah’s, which, in those days, used cocktail waitresses as dancers in its TV commercials. “The choreography was difficult,” she recalled.","3640","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"When she applied for a job at the Plaza, she auditioned for Donald Trump at Trump Tower, in Manhattan. She remembers a weigh-in, and an interview in a bathing suit, and she and the others were required to wear two-and-a-half-inch heels. (When I met her, she had her hair up and was wearing a smart lavender suit.) “I very much enjoyed working for Donald Trump,” Inglin said. “When he was there, it was tip-top.

"Inglin’s generation of casino workers, whose professional primes track the birth and decline of the industry in Atlantic City, speak wistfully of the abundance and camaraderie of the halcyon days. “Back in the eighties and nineties, the money flowed. It was glamorous,” Inglin said. “Then the attention and the business was diverted from the Plaza to the Taj. Things started closing. Restaurants, room service. For four or five years, there were constant rumors that this or that person was going to buy us. I don’t have enough fingers and toes to count the number of people who were going to save us. The last few years were so stressful. You watched people lose their jobs. They were taking away severance, the machines disappearing, equipment rolling past you.”","3642","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"After thirty years, she was fourth in seniority among cocktail waitresses at the Plaza and was making $8.99 an hour, plus benefits. It ended last September. “When we found out we were closing, we were standing at the bar—the last bar in the casino. We saw it on the six-o’clock news. We were frantic.”","3643","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Despite coming up empty in a search for another job, Inglin felt that she was going to be all right.

"Atlantic City has had three great bosses, political or otherwise. In the decades prior to the First World War, Louis Kuehnle, a transplanted New Yorker and powerful Republican known to all as the Commodore, turned the resort into a bustling metropolis and the state party into a patron and beneficiary of the evolving local aptitude for vice. Enoch (Nucky) Johnson, his successor and the basis for the Steve Buscemi character in “Boardwalk Empire,” continued this work and presided over Atlantic City’s glory years, during Prohibition, which, largely thanks to his efforts, never really pertained. The third was Hap Farley, a Republican legislator and master puller of wires, whose political swan song was his support, behind the scenes, for the second (and successful) attempt, in 1976, to pass the state bill to legalize gambling in Atlantic City.","3648","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Since then, there have been party bosses, governors, and mayors with varying degrees of power and venality, but no kingfish of the stature of the Commodore, Nucky, or Hap. “I’ll give you Atlantic City,” the mayor of Camden said, to F.B.I. agents disguised as Arabs during the Abscam sting. “Without me, you do nothing.” But by then such an offer was beyond the reach of any one man. In city politics, the Democrats held sway. (The electorate is now thirty per cent Hispanic and forty per cent black; Democrats outnumber Republicans nine to one.) The only Republican elected to* City Hall in the casino era was James Usry, the city’s first black mayor, who got caught up in a corruption investigation that cost him the 1990 election—until 2013, when, to the great surprise of the city’s political establishment, Don Guardian, a gay white Republican, beat Lorenzo (Rennie) Langford, an African-American, by fewer than four hundred votes.","3649","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

He had on a Champion sweatshirt, jeans, and Nikes. His grandfather had come to town in the twenties, bought some trucks, and won trash-removal contracts at the big hotels. Langford’s father dropped out of high school and worked in a factory. Langford went to college, then dealer school at the Casino Career Institute, on the Black Horse Pike, one of the old Atlantic City arteries, and started at Caesars when it opened, in 1979.

He was not a part of any machine, but he worked tirelessly to round up votes, and Langford, having survived a bruising, expensive primary and confident of the black vote, apparently got complacent.

Eventually, the casinos figured out the night-club business, so Schultz and Hill got out, and started giving their money away. Twenty years ago, they bought an old building near the clubs, next door to a porn shop, and converted the top three floors into a triplex they called Casa Del Cielo, where they live together and preside as ambassadors, of a kind, over various gaudy but charitable entertainments.

But none was more conspicuous, and of greater likely consequence to the city in the long run, than Revel. Last September, with Glenn Straub’s ninety-million-dollar offer as the stalking horse, the bankruptcy court held an auction to sell it. The winner, at a hundred and ten million dollars, was Brookfield Property Partners, based in Toronto. Brookfield owned the Atlantis in Nassau and the Hard Rock in Las Vegas, and so saw some synergy here, but it couldn’t make a deal with the owners of Revel’s adjacent power plant, which had been built solely for Revel and was charging Revel three million dollars a month for utilities. (The power plant was a separate, independently owned entity, called ACR Energy Partners—an arrangement that has proved poisonous.) In November, Brookfield decided to forfeit its deposit, of eleven million dollars, and walk away.

Once, he answered his phone as he was getting fingerprinted by the Casino Control Commission, for his gambling-license application. Another time, he announced that he was at a urinal.

He’s a bit of a savant.”","3669","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub comes from Wheeling, West Virginia, where his father had a business providing transportation to the Texas Eastern pipeline and later owned auto-leasing franchises and taxi fleets. “So you worked, and if you didn’t work Dad got the belt out and beat your butt,” Straub said. “Anyway, he died, just when I got my driver’s license.” After high school, Straub and a brother helped run the businesses. In time, they owned a network of sand and gravel quarries and concrete and asphalt plants; highway- and airport-construction contracts made them rich. (In recent years, those long-moribund quarries, in the upper Ohio River Valley, have been found to sit atop vast reserves of oil and gas, extractable by horizontal drill, making Straub even richer.)","3670","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub retired at forty, moving his family (his wife, from whom he divorced in 2007, and two daughters) to Florida. “I lasted six months,” he said. He started investing in distressed and bankrupt properties. It was a good time to have cash on hand. In the wake of the savings-and-loan crisis, at a Resolution Trust Corporation auction, he bought a twenty-two-hundred-acre golf and polo club in Wellington, for $27.1 million. It was called Palm Beach Polo. “All of a sudden, people were giving me a half a million dollars for an acre,” he said. “I sold two or three hundred million dollars’ worth, and we still have another thousand acres down there.” A big driver was the equestrian center: “Never once thought it would turn out to be a gold mine, but it did turn out to be a gold mine, because then the Bloombergs of the world and their daughters, and all the movie stars’ daughters, they would go down there, and they would have the big Olympic stars do the show jumping, and there was this thing called polo. I didn’t know what a polo game looked like. They put you on a horse. And I thought, This isn’t that hard. I was good in sports, amateur sports. I can hit things. I can pick a fly out of the air.”","3671","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub has been called “the dictator of Palm Beach polo.” His reign has been contentious. In numerous lawsuits, he has been accused of neglecting his residents, as well as the grounds, and charging undue fees. In 2010, he was tried, and ultimately acquitted, on criminal charges of polluting protected wetlands. He was once convicted of contempt, after interfering with a federal marshal who’d come to seize a yacht at a marina Straub owned. He tried to appeal the verdict all the way to the Supreme Court, without success. Through the years, he has been proudly litigious. “If you check me out, I’m pretty good at protecting our rights in the court system,” Straub told me.","3672","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"In the conference room, he told me about his idea for an ocean liner. “An old ocean liner, like the QE2. I’m gonna buy it,” he said. He squeezed mayonnaise from a packet. “Bring this ocean liner in, and I don’t know if you’ve been around Ripley’s down in Orlando, the whole building shaking and everything else. I’m gonna teach my kids, or my kids’ kids, what World War II was all about, and the Holocaust, and Zeros coming in from Japan, and so when you go inside this thing, this ship, it’s gonna make you feel like you’re being bombed, like Pearl Harbor when the damned Zeros came in, took out our whole fleet in the Pacific. The ship’s suites where the crew used to be will be for my construction workers, because if we’re gonna spend this kind of money up here I need to get cheap housing for them, so instead of shipping them back to Philadelphia and bringing them here every day I’ll let them store themselves in the bottom of the ship.

"Throughout the winter, Straub made regular trips to Atlantic City and to the federal bankruptcy court in Camden, where he pressed his attempt to have his bid approved. Amid innumerable motions, hearings, and rulings, attorneys representing bank lenders, unsecured creditors, jilted tenants, other prospective buyers, the power company, and the gutted estate argued for and against his offer, sometimes changing sides as the circumstances evolved. Other bidders waded in and wandered off. The power company remained a sticking point. The lawyers racked up their fees and did their pressers on the courthouse steps.","3674","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"One cold morning in February, Straub arrived at the courthouse in a gray suit, with a trenchcoat slung over his shoulders. He said he’d left his cell phone in a bathroom at the airport, and someone had retrieved it and was sending it back. He looked at the pairs of lawyers filing in through the door. “A few more guys and we’ll get a soccer game going here,” he said. “I wish I was getting paid a thousand bucks an hour.” Straub’s lawyer, Stuart Moskovitz, of Freehold, not normally a bankruptcy attorney, called them the “bankruptcy cabal.” It was essentially the deadline on Straub’s bid, now at ninety-five million dollars, but he had failed to close, owing to some unresolved questions about his obligation to old leaseholders and to the power plant.","3675","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

"Problem was there didn’t seem to be one. With this in mind, Straub and Moskovitz had been threatening to put in a much lower bid if their offer fell through. At one point, Straub stood and handed his lawyer a piece of paper.

"In the back of the courtroom, a lanky man in a yellow sweater, his graying hair perfectly in place and his eyes darting around, fidgeted with his fingers as though he were handling invisible chopsticks. His name was Vincent Crandon. He was a low-profile Jersey dealmaker from Mahwah, and he had been circling various properties in Atlantic City for years, to no avail. He’d failed in attempts to buy Trump Plaza and the Atlantic Club. Early on, he’d been after a bricks-and-mortar property to go with an Internet-gaming company. But his quest had morphed into something else, and so now he just lurked, waiting for the court, or perhaps the entropy of Atlantic City, to scuttle Straub’s bid. Quietly casting himself as the new white knight, he’d submitted an offer, but so far it had gone unacknowledged.","3679","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"“Straub is done,” Crandon told me later. “We’ve put in a better offer. We’re sitting back, taking our time.” He added, “Straub thinks he’s the only guy in town.”","3680","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The town, and the sellers, seemed to think so, too. After the ninety-five-million-dollar offer fell apart, Straub put in a lower bid, for eighty-two million, and lawyers for Revel and the lenders, increasingly desperate, supported it in court. At the beginning of April, the presiding judge, Gloria Burns, who said she would not let the case delay her impending retirement, abruptly ruled in favor of Straub. The questions of the tenants and power plant remained unresolved. For a few days, anyway, the town experienced something like hope.","3681","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Atlantic City, formerly a breeding ground for big ideas, was now a tar pit—trapping financial mastodons and big-eyed dreamers, whether or not their intentions were pure, as the capricious gods of commerce looked on. Revel kept luring in new ones. In April, the day after Straub took ownership of Revel, he called Crandon and—according to Crandon, anyway; Straub denies it—offered to flip the property to him for a hundred million dollars. A couple of days later, Crandon drove down to Atlantic City. With Revel blacked out (owing to the inevitable dispute between Straub and ACR, the power company), the only people allowed inside were security officers from the Casino Control Commission. They stood in darkness guarding acres of idled slot machines, which Straub wasn’t technically authorized to own, since he had no gaming license. So, according to Crandon, the two men who would decide Revel’s fate met in one of its parking garages. Crandon had along one of his partners, Don Marrandino, an Atlantic City native known as Rockin’ Don, for his music-industry connections. He had been the president of Hard Rock in Las Vegas and of Caesars East Coast operations. Straub was accompanied by Tara Lordi, his adviser and “toxic-asset manager,” a horsewoman and former banker. Crandon says Straub told them he wanted much more than a hundred million for Revel, but at least he now had a possible out, and Crandon had an in. (Straub says the meeting never happened.)","3682","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Crandon had been eying Revel for a year. Crandon, who is fifty-three, grew up in Delaware, but his parents were from New Jersey, and as a kid he worked at a service station his grandfather owned on the Black Horse Pike. His surname used to be Ceccola; Crandon is an adaptation of Cranendonk. His father-in-law is Theodor Cranendonk, a wealthy Dutch oil trader who was once imprisoned in Italy on charges of delivering thirty bazookas to the Mafia. (“It was all made up,” Crandon says. According to Crandon, Dutch commandoes sprung Cranendonk from a prison hospital and brought him back to the Netherlands.) One of Crandon’s investment vehicles is called MidOil, but Cranendonk was not involved in the Revel bid. “He doesn’t do gambling,” Crandon said.","3683","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Crandon said his group—“We’re Jersey guys”—planned to spend hundreds of millions reconfiguring the space. The new name would be Rebel. Crandon said they were planning a forty-night Bon Jovi residency. Rockin’ Don had the pull.","3684","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The money wasn’t from Jersey guys. Crandon says he spent a marathon weekend in town and in New York wooing representatives from a Chinese real-estate firm that had been buying up properties around the United States. Crandon’s group and the Chinese were betting that Macau, the Asian gambling mecca, was tapped out, amid a Chinese government crackdown on corruption and gambling, and that travellers from mainland China would soon be including South Jersey on their U.S. itineraries. The Atlantic City airport would be the hub for jumbo-jet charters from Asia. The margins are better if you can lure a plane from Hong Kong than a bus from Port Authority. Atlantic City, born in proximity to the population and early industrial wealth of Philadelphia, would now reach halfway around the world for money and the guests from whom to separate it.","3685","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Crandon believed that Straub was planning to demolish Revel. A consultant had told him you could net a hundred million dollars if you sold it off as spare parts. There was a precedent: In 2004, Straub bought Miami Arena for twenty-eight million dollars, half what the city had paid to build it. He promised to turn it into a venue for horse shows, conventions, and minor-league sports, to help revive downtown Miami. “Tearing it down serves nobody’s purpose,” Straub said at the time. Four years later, he tore it down.","3686","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Events on the ground in Atlantic City seemed to be pushing Straub in that direction. As soon as he bought Revel, he found himself, not unexpectedly, in a war with ACR, the power plant, and thus, in short order, with the city. The maneuverings often seemed frivolous and petty, except that a city was at stake. Straub refused to pay ACR the three million a month for power, and ACR refused to provide it for free. And so Revel remained dark: no light, heat, air, or water, no sprinklers or alarms. The city’s fire marshal deemed the building unsafe, and the city rescinded Straub’s certificate of occupancy and began fining him five thousand dollars a day. Observers wondered about catastrophic fire and debilitating mold.","3687","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub dug in. He told reporters, as he unsuccessfully challenged the plant’s owners in court, “We’ll erase them off the map.” He brought in a fleet of diesel generators and parked them outside the casino. But he had no permits, and ACR owned much of the connecting infrastructure. Back to court they went. Straub, the loser again, sent the generators away. He told me, referring to city and state officials, “If they won’t work with me, I’ll just go back to Miami.” Publicly, he made the threat explicit: “I’ll tear the building down.”","3688","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"To circumvent ACR, Straub had set about trying to buy the empty casino next door, the Showboat, and tap into its power plant instead. The Showboat’s owner, at the moment, was Stockton University, the state college, which, a few months earlier, had bought it to establish a long-desired Atlantic City campus. The university had paid just ten dollars a square foot. “You can’t even buy tile at Home Depot for ten dollars a square foot!” Herman Saatkamp, Stockton’s president, told me.","3689","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"But the campus plan had suddenly fallen apart, when Trump Entertainment, owners of the Taj Mahal, next door, unexpectedly opted to enforce an old covenant mandating that the Showboat be a casino-hotel, and nothing else. Icahn, who controls Trump, didn’t want a college campus next door. “Who is this guy?” Bob McDevitt, the president of Local 54, the casino workers’ union, said of Icahn, with whom he has been feuding for a year. “How does he get to decide everything? He’s disembowelling the city.”","3690","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Icahn blames the unions. “I saved the Tropicana, which was bankrupt, and made it into one of the only vibrant and surviving casinos in Atlantic City,” he told me. “I have also saved the Taj Mahal and have saved six thousand jobs. Bob McDevitt has caused three casinos to close and the loss of thousands of jobs. Ask yourself: Who is the villain of this story?” Capital or labor? Germany or Greece? Depends on whom you talk to. In July, Taj workers, having lost many of their benefits, voted to authorize a strike.","3691","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"At any rate, now Stockton was stuck with a vacated casino on its balance sheet and monthly maintenance costs of four hundred thousand dollars. That’ll buy you a lot of tile. And so Saatkamp, the university’s president, who is also a leading scholar of George Santayana (“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”), rushed into a provisional agreement to flip the Showboat to Straub. At the end of April, Saatkamp, out of his depth in these sharky waters, resigned as Stockton’s president, his tenure scuttled by the Showboat and Revel mess. Santayana: “Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and it is shameful to surrender it too soon.”","3692","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Throughout the spring, Crandon pressed for a deal while Straub held out for more. Straub told me, “Everyone says, ‘Oh, you’re so fucking smart, Mr. Straub.’ And I’m saying, ‘I’m not smart. I can just outlast everybody.’ ” Tara Lordi e-mailed Crandon one afternoon in early April:","3693","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"In early May, according to Crandon, the two men met aboard Straub’s yacht, the Triumphant Lady, which he’d brought north to Atlantic City and docked at the Golden Nugget. Crandon says they actually shook on a deal, for a hundred and thirty-two million dollars. (Straub denies this meeting took place and in general was dismissive when I asked him about Crandon, referring to him as “Kramden.”)","3694","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"But they continued to haggle over terms and timing as Crandon worked out his arrangement with the Chinese. There were stories of Straub stiffing a local law firm, and of his filling a truck with Revel fixtures and tools, bound for Florida. (He denies wrongdoing in both cases.) His deal to buy the Showboat foundered, and a court gave Stockton the go-ahead to seek another buyer. As weeks passed, Crandon made promises that he’d soon hold the keys to Revel, and then the deal would recede again: Zeno’s paradox down the shore.","3695","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"At the end of June, Crandon texted me to say that his deal with Straub was off. “Greed and evil have destroyed A.C.” He explained, “What happened is we got circumvented.” Straub, apparently, had cut him out of the loop and gone directly to the Chinese. He had come to see the potential of junkets from overseas. Crandon sent photos of Tara Lordi in Shanghai with a Chinese man, whom he still, vestigially, called “my partner”: “2 days after that photo, Chinese canceled our deal.” Crandon vowed revenge: “We will keep it in litigation for years. No one will get Revel.”","3696","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"If Straub was really planning to sell to the Chinese, he wasn’t saying. Lordi says she went to Shanghai to play polo. Straub said he was looking for groups to help manage the hotel and the casino. All the while, Revel remained closed. Still no light shows or clean windows, to say nothing of the four thousand new jobs the city so desperately needed. Revel’s remaining employees were let go. There was no one left, really, except for the security guards overlooking the slots, in the sweltering heat of an un-air-conditioned glass box in high summer.","3697","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

His eldest son, George W. Bush, had just lost his first race for political office, a congressional campaign in West Texas. Bush’s best friend, James Baker, had lost his only political campaign, for Texas attorney general. It looked as if the Bushes had been right to decide that Texas would be a more propitious environment for Republicans than their former home, Connecticut, but had done so prematurely. If Ronald Reagan had not chosen George Bush as his Vice-President, there would be no Bush dynasty today.

Robert Zoellick and Stephen Hadley worked for 41 and 43, and are now advising Jeb Bush’s Presidential campaign. These are just a few of dozens of examples, from all realms of policy and politics. What the Bushes expect from these people is not just competence but loyalty. There’s family, and then there’s staff. (Only one person, James Baker, has ever transcended those tight categories.) Staff pursue the family’s interests, not their own.","3703","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-bushes-misunderstood-cheney"
"Bush 41’s news-making remark to Meacham was, in effect, an accusation that Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld had violated this cardinal rule during Bush 43’s Administration. Speaking about Cheney, Bush told Meacham, “He had his own empire there and marched to his own drummer. … It just showed me that you cannot do it that way. The president should not have that worry.” Bush had never liked or trusted—or hired—Rumsfeld, so in his case the lack of loyalty was no surprise. But Cheney, he told Meacham, had changed. “He just became very hard-line and very different from the Dick Cheney I knew and worked with.”","3704","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-bushes-misunderstood-cheney"
"Most Cheney watchers, including Bush, believe that Cheney changed from an utterly reliable servitor into an ideologue, partly as a result of the September 11th attacks. Cheney himself offered up this theory when Meacham asked him to respond to Bush’s remarks. “No question I was much harder-line after 9/11 than I was before, especially when we got into this whole area of terrorism, nukes, and WMD,” he said.","3705","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-bushes-misunderstood-cheney"

"George W. Bush, in his pre-Presidential days, was even more preoccupied than his father with extirpating aides who, in his view, had their own agendas. Partly because he felt his father had not been well served by the independent political consultants he used in his unsuccessful reëlection campaign, he insisted that Karl Rove sell his consulting firm and work as a full-time campaign employee in 2000. Cheney, who at first served as the chairman of George W. Bush’s Vice-Presidential search committee, came highly recommended by Bush 41. As the C.E.O. of Halliburton, he was living in Texas at the time, rather than in Washington, and he projected a stolid, phlegmatic trustworthiness.

After the election, the former Senator Dan Coats, of Indiana, a Christian conservative, was expected to be named the Secretary of Defense. He and Bush met (again, with Cheney present), something didn’t click, and Cheney’s old friend Rumsfeld got the job instead. Cheney was also immediately permitted—as Bush 41 pointed out to Meacham—to create his own shadow national-security staff in the White House, headed by Lewis “Scooter” Libby.","3708","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-bushes-misunderstood-cheney"
"Long before 9/11, Cheney had a hyper-awareness of threats to the American order. This may have come from his experience as a graduate student, at the University of Wisconsin, during the peak period of student radicalism there, or from having run, with Rumsfeld, the most left-wing agency of the federal government, the long-departed Office of Economic Opportunity, in the early nineteen-seventies. In any case, this attitude was amply reflected in Cheney’s voting record after he was elected to Congress, in 1978, and in his interviews and speeches.","3709","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-bushes-misunderstood-cheney"
"The most consequential examples of Cheney’s conservatism come from his years in the Bush 41 Administration. As the Secretary of Defense, he hired Paul Wolfowitz as one of the top officials in the Pentagon, and he tilted away from Mikhail Gorbachev and toward Boris Yeltsin because he believed that Yeltsin would push harder for the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After that happened, Cheney sponsored a study by Wolfowitz calling for the maintenance of a one-superpower world in the post-Soviet era as the core principle of U.S. foreign policy.","3710","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-bushes-misunderstood-cheney"
"George H. W. Bush evidently didn’t notice any of this, because Cheney was so competent and reassuring. George W. Bush didn’t notice either. It’s pretty clear that both of them figured it out later, after Cheney and his allies had adeptly shaped the first couple of years of the U.S. response to 9/11—the Patriot Act, the inexorable road to the Iraq War, and all the rest. The lesson is that, if you think somebody has changed fundamentally, especially somebody over the age of sixty, it probably means you didn’t know the person as well as you thought.

"There are theories, out there, that the pyramids of Egypt are really giant batteries, or even electric generators. Think about it: their granite blocks were originally encased in limestone, almost as if they had been insulated, as a power conductor is, with rubber. They once had golden capstones, a bit like the copper-tops on Duracells. All that granite piled up creates a magnetic field or a radioactive one, depending on which engineering schematics one favors—this reading of the pyramids takes a number of forms—and has a profound effect on negative ions. The King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid contains what may look like a sepulchre but is really where all the gold wiring that ran through the pyramid met—a pharaonic circuit board. The pyramid is a cross between the Tower of Babel and the Tesla Tower: a massive source of wireless power, which explains why the torches that figures carry in Egyptian wall paintings aren’t plugged into anything. Delve too deeply, and the question seems less whether the pyramids are big and intricate machines built by ordinary hardworking Egyptians than whether they were built (perhaps, originally, upside down) by extraterrestrials, who might someday return to activate their force fields or laser beams.

(BuzzFeed found the video.) “You know, it doesn’t require an alien being when God is with you.” The explanation for the pyramids was not only divine but laid out in one of the best-known Bible stories, which tells how Joseph, after his brothers had sold him into slavery in Egypt, had interpreted a dream of the Pharaoh’s to mean that Egypt would have seven fat years followed by seven years of famine. The Pharaoh then assigned him to do some emergency planning. (Genesis 41: “Lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.”) “My own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain. Now all the archeologists”—here, Carson waves his hand dismissively—“think that they were made for the pharaohs’ graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big if you stop and think about it. And I don’t think it’d just disappear over the course of time, to store that much grain.” Carson had his own take on the engineering: “When you look at the way that the pyramids are made, with many chambers that are hermetically sealed, they’d have to be that way for a reason.” The King’s Chamber, as he saw it, was not an instrument panel or a power substation, but a big Tupperware container.","3713","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"“It’s still my belief, yes,” Carson said, on Wednesday, when CBS News asked him if he still held to this theory. Then, with an almost pitying smile, Carson explained again, as if to a child, that “the pyramids were made in a way that they had hermetically sealed compartments. You wouldn’t need hermetically sealed compartments for a sepulchre. You would need that if you were trying to preserve grain for a long period of time.”","3714","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"“That was a strange deal,” Donald Trump said, when asked about Carson and the pyramids. This time, the Donald is right. There are problems with Carson’s theory. For one thing, there is very good archeological and historical evidence that the pyramids were built as monumental tombs with a religious function; they were first built among complexes of tombs. There is also pretty good evidence of an extensive network of granaries, often associated with local temples. It’s odd that Carson, a critic of big government, would assume that the only way to manage the storage job was with a giant four-faced bubble—but since the pyramids are not actually hollow, and don’t have all that much storage space relative to their size, perhaps they would be an example of statist inefficiency. (Putting aside the question of whether those chambers were ever “hermetically” sealed, the dry climate of Egypt did mean that such sealing would not have been necessary.) A pyramid also takes longer than seven years to build. Also, the pyramid-building dynasties—the Third Dynasty (c. 2700–2600 B.C.), with its step-pyramids, and the Fourth Dynasty (c. 2600–2500 B.C.), with the great pyramids at Giza—do not match many of the guesses for when a historical Joseph might have lived, which range to the Eighteenth Dynasty. The counter-argument to that might be that, since we know almost nothing about Joseph, we might as well place him anywhere. Why not treat all of Egyptian and Biblical history as collapsible, and shuffle their incidents and artifacts as much as we like, under the general rubric of ancientness?","3715","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"There are mysteries about the pyramids—they were built, after all, nearly five thousand years ago—and we don’t know everything about how workers (free or not) were deployed, or what the geometry of the layout symbolized. Archeologists and engineers are still learning things from, for example, the found remnants of nearby construction camps. But that sort of study is not Carson’s project. In the 1998 commencement address, he moved quickly from the pyramids to doubts about the Big Bang theory, saying, “That’s the wonderful thing about having a relationship with God. You know, God has already told us what happened, so we don’t have to come up with fanciful theories about things.”","3716","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"When Carson speaks about pyramids, he does so with the same pretense of practicality that he brings to many topics. He is a doctor, and a bearer of knowledge, including the news that the standard stories Americans are told, whether about economics, history, or science, don’t add up. Joseph was a better model, a slave who “ended up as the Prime Minister of the most powerful nation in the world at the time”; because he persisted and listened to God, he “was basically able to save the entire world with his big thinking.” Does Carson think that there is someone else who might do that? (It might interest him that the historical figure actually credited with managing the work on the earliest pyramids, a civil servant named Imhotep, was also thought to be a medical doctor.)","3717","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"Thursday, the day after his CBS News interview, was a busy one for Carson, who is leading or close to Donald Trump in many polls—between them, they’ve got half of the Republican-primary electorate covered. His campaign released a radio ad with a rap beat (“Go and support Ben Car-son/For our next President and be awe-some”) and was working to counter a CNN report that suggested that, despite what Carson wrote in his autobiography, he might not have been a violent teen-ager who once almost killed his friend. It seems strange for a candidate to be offended by the idea that he had actually been a nice kid—Romney had to answer to the opposite charge—and a little like being puzzled that an ancient torch has no wires attached. But, in the context of this campaign, in which Carson has made a point of how God changed his character, there is a rationale for both the exposé and for his response. The whole business stopped making sense some time ago. A certain number of Republicans turned to Carson because the other candidates seemed even less plausible to them. As the granary theory is to the idea of the pyramids as a giant battery or the work of alien architects, so is Carson to Trump—although, some days, it seems like the other way around.","3718","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"

"It came when Bush fumblingly tried a maneuver that he and his advisers had obviously planned—and that Rubio and his had obviously anticipated. The plan was for Bush to slam his former Florida protégé as a shirker and a grifter, the proof being that he has been running around the country campaigning for President instead of dutifully staying in Washington to vote on bills and “do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.” Here’s Bush, delivering what was no doubt supposed to be the coup de grâce:","3721","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

Really, though—isn’t it time to retire this stupid talking point, which gets trotted out every time a member of the United States Senate has the temerity to run for President? It was used against Senator Barack Obama, whose floor-vote-missing tally was slightly worse than Rubio’s. It was used against—speaking of France!—Senator John Kerry, whose absenteeism in 2004 was worse still. More to the point, it was used against Senator John McCain, who missed three-fifths of the votes the Senate took while he was a candidate in the 2008 campaign. Rubio, for his part, has skipped about a third of this year’s roll-call votes, and almost half of those taken since April, when he announced his candidacy. Which raises two questions. So what?

Over the last few weeks, I’ve listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you’re modelling your campaign after John McCain, that you’re going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.

"“Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you”—that was the saber thrust that won Rubio both ears, the tail, and the debate. Bush tried feebly to respond, but a halting “Well, I’ve been—” was as far as he got before Rubio interrupted him to talk confidently and a little patronizingly about how his own campaign is “about the future,” how much he admires his hapless former patron, and how important it is to defeat Hillary Clinton.","3728","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

Any given senator is only one per cent of the Senate, and the institution can function, or dysfunction, quite normally in his or her absence. Any given governor is a hundred per cent of his state’s supreme executive authority. Senators, like Presidents, deal mainly with national matters.

The Upshot concludes that “Mr. Cruz’s debate style is much more complicated than that of his fellow Republican candidates, close to works like Beowulf and Don Quixote.” Beelzebub and Don Knotts is closer to the mark, but the oleaginous Texan is inarguably erudite.","3733","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"With the economic recovery continuing, the budget deficit falling, and 2016 approaching, it has been clear for some time where the Republican Party is heading on economic policy: back to the old-time religion of tax cuts. About the only question left to be answered was whether the Party would endorse measures narrowly targeted toward middle-income families, which is what Marco Rubio and some others are recommending, or whether it would revert to the old Reaganite model of broad cuts in tax rates, which reduce tax payments for virtually everyone, but especially the rich—and to heck with the deficit.","September 10, 2015","3744","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-and-the-return-of-voodoo-economics"
"Now we know part of the answer. On Wednesday, Jeb Bush, the G.O.P. establishment’s standard-bearer, announced, as the centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, a plan to cut federal income-tax rates across the board. The top rate would be reduced from its current level of forty per cent (or nearly forty-four per cent, if you include a surcharge introduced as a part of Obamacare) to twenty-eight per cent. At the bottom of the income distribution, roughly fifteen million households would have their effective rates cut to zero. Bush’s tax-cutting zeal doesn’t stop there. He also pledged to cut the top tax rate on capital gains and dividends, reduce the rate that corporations pay (or, in many cases, don’t pay) from thirty-five per cent to twenty per cent, and abolish the estate tax. All told, these tax cuts would cost about $3.4 trillion over ten years. (By any standard, that’s a big tax cut. On an annual basis, it’s equivalent to about two per cent of current G.D.P.)","3745","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-and-the-return-of-voodoo-economics"
"But wouldn’t this plan inflate the deficit, which President Obama and Congress have just spent five years trying to reduce, and also amount to another enormous handout to the one per cent? Not in the make-believe world of “voodoo economics”—the term that Jeb’s father, George H. W. Bush, used in criticizing Ronald Reagan’s tax-cutting plans during their G.O.P. primary tussle, in 1980.","3746","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-and-the-return-of-voodoo-economics"
"To help pay for his giveaways, Jeb Bush said that he would cut spending, cap the itemized deductions that wealthy taxpayers take, and introduce a series of other steps designed to stimulate economic growth, such as scaling back federal regulations and reforming the education and immigration systems. “Taken together, these policies will unleash increased investment, higher wages and sustained four per cent economic growth, while reducing the deficit,” he said in a statement.","3747","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-and-the-return-of-voodoo-economics"
"Any one whose memory extends back to the seventies and eighties will find this language depressingly familiar. The original iteration of voodoo economics didn’t merely involve cutting taxes and directing the bulk of the gains to the ultra-wealthy. (The phrase “the one per cent” hadn’t been coined back then.) The “voodoo” accusation arose from the claim that, because the policies would encourage people to work harder and businesses to invest more, a lot more taxable income would be produced, and the reductions in tax rates wouldn’t lead to a commensurate reduction in the amount of tax revenues that the government collected. Indeed, some early voodoo economists, such as Arthur Laffer, claimed that there wouldn’t be any drop in revenues.","3748","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-and-the-return-of-voodoo-economics"
"By 1988, when Poppy Bush was running for President again, more than half a decade of gaping budget deficits had discredited the most extreme and foolhardy version of voodoo economics. However, some Republicans, such as Jack Kemp, the congressman from New York, were still promoting a slightly modified version of the creed. If pressed, Kemp and his supporters conceded that all of that pent-up energy and enterprise might not fully offset the fall in tax revenues consequent to a big tax cut. But, they insisted, if tax cuts were combined with other “pro-enterprise policies,” such as making a bonfire of government regulations, the deficit problem would go away.","3749","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-and-the-return-of-voodoo-economics"
"In unveiling his tax plan, Jeb Bush made it clear that he is Kemp’s political heir. He didn’t claim that cutting income-tax rates, by itself, would unleash a supply-side miracle. However, he did claim that the trick could be accomplished by combining the tax cuts with other measures, such as allowing major corporations to repatriate, at a minimal tax rate, the hundreds of billions of dollars in profits that they currently have stashed overseas.","3750","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-and-the-return-of-voodoo-economics"
"It turns out, however, that even the four conservative luminaries whom the Bush campaign rounded up to advise him on this program weren’t prepared to fully endorse this argument. (They are Glenn Hubbard, of Columbia University; Martin Feldstein, of Harvard; John Cogan, of Stanford; and Kevin Warsh, of the Hoover Institution.) In a paper analyzing and endorsing the Bush plan, these conservative academics, all of whom have worked for previous Republican Administrations, said that Bush’s tax plan would raise the growth rate of the economy by 0.5 per cent a year, and that the regulatory changes he is proposing would add another 0.3 per cent to the annual growth rate. But because the annual growth rate over the past five years has been 2.2 per cent, that gets us to three per cent growth, not the four per cent that Bush is promising to deliver.","3751","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-and-the-return-of-voodoo-economics"
"As for Bush’s claim that his plan will reduce the deficit, there isn’t any real support for it in the economists’ paper, either. To be sure, it makes the familiar argument that tax cuts, by stimulating growth, will lead to “revenue feedbacks.” On this basis, which is known on Capitol Hill as “dynamic scoring,” the economists reduce the estimated fiscal cost of the Bush tax cuts by two-thirds. But even a third of $3.6 trillion is a lot of red ink. “We estimate the tax plan, with conservative assumptions for revenue feedbacks from the Governor’s tax and regulatory policies, will reduce revenues from the current CBO baseline by $1,200 billion over the next decade; about a 3 percent reduction from projected federal revenues over that period,” the paper states.","3752","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-and-the-return-of-voodoo-economics"
"So are the economists actually contradicting Bush and saying that his plan would expand the deficit? Not quite. After citing the $1.2 trillion figure, they write, “The remaining revenue loss would be offset by reasonable, incremental feedback effects from the tax and regulatory reforms, meaningful spending restraint across the federal budget, and growth and feedback effects from Governor Bush’s forthcoming proposals to restrain federal spending and reform health care policy, the nation’s education system, energy policy, trade, and immigration policy.” Translating that mouthful into plain English isn’t easy, but here is one possible version: if Bush really does cut spending by more than he cuts taxes, the deficit won’t go up.","3753","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-and-the-return-of-voodoo-economics"
"Of course, Bush hasn’t said yet where he would cut spending, nor has he specified the income thresholds at which the new tax rates would kick in. That makes it difficult to pin down exactly who would win and who would lose under his proposals. Some things are clear, however. By raising standard deductions and expanding the earned-income tax credit, the Bush plan would boost the post-tax incomes of many low-income households. These measures, combined with a promise to eliminate the “carried interest” deduction enjoyed by hedge-fund and private-equity fund managers, are where the G.O.P. candidate doffs his hat to concerns about wage stagnation and rising inequality. (He also claims that faster growth in productivity and G.D.P. will lead to higher wages.)","3754","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-and-the-return-of-voodoo-economics"
"But that’s only part of the story. Because Bush is intending to slash the top rate of income tax, eliminate the estate tax, and reduce the tax rate on capital gains and dividends, the impact of his progressive measures would be small compared to the gains that would be enjoyed by the ultra-wealthy. Take households that earn at least ten million dollars a year, placing them in the top 0.01 per cent of earners. Such folks tend to have a great deal of property and financial wealth, which generates a lot of dividends, capital gains, and other forms of capital income. On the basis of some reasonable-sounding assumptions, Josh Barro, of the Times, calculates that, under the Bush plan, the effective federal tax rate these households pay would be reduced from twenty-six per cent to twenty-one per cent, and they would each save about one and a half million dollars a year, on average.","3755","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-and-the-return-of-voodoo-economics"
"You won’t see that figure, or anything like it, on Bush’s Web site, of course. Just like Reagan, Jeb’s brother George, and Mitt Romney in 2012, Jeb talks about simplifying the tax code, boosting American competitiveness, stimulating growth, and restoring “the opportunity for every American to rise and achieve earned success.” That’s how voodoo economics is always marketed. But, despite the welcome addition of a few populist touches, such as pledging to euthanize the carried-interest deduction, Bush is writing the same old tired script.","3756","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-and-the-return-of-voodoo-economics"

"This week, David Bowers, the Democratic mayor of Roanoke, Virginia, invoked the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War as justification for keeping out Iraqi and Syrian refugees. I wonder if the mayor (who later apologized to anyone he might have offended) would have paused for one second in his headlong rush to join the anti-refugee hysteria sweeping America if he’d known that, among the residents of his city, there’s an Iraqi named Hayder. In 2003, Hayder was working as an interpreter for the 82nd Airborne Division, in Baghdad, when his convoy was ambushed by insurgents. Dragging an American sergeant out of the line of fire, Hayder was hit in both legs and nearly killed. He lost most of his right leg. Unable to work and in danger for his life, he fled Iraq with his wife and son to Jordan, where the family languished for years in deepening misery while getting nowhere in their efforts to get visas to the United States. Finally, in 2007, his case came to the attention of Kirk Johnson, an American refugee advocate, and the next year Hayder and his family were resettled in Roanoke. In 2013, he became a U.S. citizen.","November 20, 2015","3781","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"
"Mayor Bowers hasn’t tried to have the family interned, not yet anyway, though the logic of his statement could have led him there—for keeping Muslim refugees out doesn’t solve the problem of the ones already here. (Donald Trump, tossing out answers that move beyond U.S. history to that of Nazi Germany, is talking about imposing mandatory registration on all Muslims in this country.) A bill that overwhelmingly passed the House on Thursday, by a vote of 289–137, with the support of fifty Democrats, would require the director of the F.B.I., the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the director of National Intelligence all to certify that each refugee applicant from Iraq or Syria poses no threat to the United States before being admitted. According to Betsy Fisher of the International Refugee Assistance Project, this group includes fifty-eight thousand Iraqis who have applied for resettlement through a program known as Direct Access, which was created by Congress for Iraqis who can show that they worked with the United States government or with American companies, non-profits, or media outlets. If it had the chance, the Islamic State would slaughter every one of them. The same goes for the many Yazidis applying for resettlement from Iraq—members of a religious minority who have been rounded up, enslaved, and murdered by ISIS. It’s already very, very hard for people like them to get here. Iraqis and Syrians are probably the most heavily vetted refugees in the history of the world. If three top government officials are going to be required to put their names and reputations on every admission, the very, very hard will become just about impossible. The House is counting on political cowardice and bureaucratic indifference to advance the cause of irrationality and bigotry.","3782","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"
"We’ve seen this kind of frenzied meanness during past crises, real or perceived. It hit the country in the form of the Palmer raids after the First World War, with the internment camps during the Second World War (Franklin Roosevelt’s most shameful act), and in the McCarthyite politics of the nineteen-fifties. Such moments were made for Ted Cruz—this generation’s Joe McCarthy. Not to be outdone by the House, on Thursday he introduced a bill in the Senate called the Terrorist Refugee Infiltration Prevention Act. It would add refugees from Libya, Yemen, and Somalia to the Syrians and Iraqis on what is effectively a black list. (There was no explanation for the absence of Afghanistan, Mali, and Nigeria as potential sources of Terrorist Refugee Infiltration.)","3783","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"
"Cruz’s bill would allow two exceptions to the barred door. One is for individuals who have provided “substantial assistance” to the U.S.—though the bill would require certification from the leaders of four government agencies that it was “a level of assistance without which the United States could not achieve the purposes for which the assistance was provided or sought.” This tortured language raises the already-high barrier and would keep out pretty much every last Iraqi, of any faith, who lost his leg or his safety or his future while helping Americans in his country. The second exception, Cruz explained, is for “Christians, Yazidis, small minorities that are facing genocide.” This is a back-door way of legislating a religious test for refugees, by exploiting a powerful word that didn’t seem to move Cruz when it mattered. Last year, after Yazidis were rounded up, executed, and enslaved by the Islamic State, Cruz voted against a bill that gave President Barack Obama authority and funds to fight the organization.","3784","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"
"President Obama has been admirable in refusing to give in to this stampede. He warned unnamed politicians “not to feed that dark impulse inside of us.” Obama has a lousy track record of actually admitting Iraqi and Syrian refugees, but at least he doesn’t exclude any on the basis of religion, or try to justify his poor performance by betraying liberal values.","3785","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"
"A lot of people in this country are disgracing themselves this week. They include politicians of both parties—though many more Republicans than Democrats—and all regions. Their motives vary: deep-seated bigotry, unreasoning fear, spinelessness, opportunism, or some unholy mix of them all. During the House hearings, Republicans kept demanding guarantees of absolute security. “I haven’t heard a single one of you say there’s no risk,” Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told Administration witnesses. There’s no such thing as no risk. Parisians could stop going out to cafés, Germans could turn back every single Syrian at the border, Americans could stop admitting anyone as a refugee, and there would still be risks. It’s absurd, and infantilizing, to demand that our officials promise to keep us absolutely safe. We don’t live that way, nor should we. Instead, we have to find the balance between safety and a decent life in a free society during an age of terror. Like every compromise, it will leave us unsatisfied. But the alternative is unfreedom and injustice.","3786","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"
"On Thursday night, as the House was passing its anti-refugee bill, I moderated a panel at New York University with four women who were visiting from Syria. I wish Ted Cruz, Trey Gowdy, and other panic-stricken demagogues had been in the audience. One of the Syrians, a journalist named Zaina Erhaim, screened four short films she’s made about women going about their lives in Aleppo, Syria, which is one of the least safe places in the world. Two of her subjects were on the panel—Ahed and Zein. They both work for international relief agencies in Aleppo, distributing bread and bandaging the wounded. Zein also teaches small children in a school that is literally underground. A fourth woman, Rafea, works as an activist and writer in Damascus. All four are from Sunni Muslim families, though Rafea is a self-described atheist; Ahed and Zein wore the hijab. To get to New York, Ahed had to spend several nights in the mountains outside Aleppo, since the Turkish border crossing is closed and the roads aren’t safe. Asked what she wants from Americans, Erhaim, the filmmaker, said an end to air attacks on cities, and a safe zone for civilians along the border. All of the women said that they no longer have any hope for Syria, but all of them are going back there.","3787","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"
"Caught between the Assad regime, the Islamic State, and an indifferent world, these women still feel and think, they scoff at the beliefs of the extremists, rage at the cruelty of Assad, cry while they stitch up children, mourn the dead, tease and comfort one another. They’ve found depths of kindness and resilience, hatred and love, that they didn’t know before the war. The Syrian horror hasn’t killed their humanity—if anything, it’s intensified. I went home, in the rain, with a sense of wonder and shame.","3788","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"
"The U.S. campaign to create a new ground force to fight the Islamic State appears to be a flop. The program, designed to train some fifteen thousand Syrians in the course of three years—at a cost of five hundred million dollars—has only a handful of fighters in Syria. “We’re talking four or five,” General Lloyd J. Austin III told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. Austin heads Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, a position made famous by former General David Petraeus. Austin conceded that the rebel program is “off to a slow start.”","September 17, 2015","3789","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/our-high-priced-mercenaries-in-syria"

"Exactly a year ago, President Obama announced a new “comprehensive and sustained” strategy to “degrade and ultimately destroy” the Islamic State, which became known as Operation Inherent Resolve. In Syria, the operation centered on a train-and-equip program for rebels in a “New Syrian Force” to fight on the ground, complemented by American air strikes on ISIS weaponry, facilities, and leaders, and by a social-media campaign to counter ISIS propaganda.","3792","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/our-high-priced-mercenaries-in-syria"
"A U.S.-led coalition has now carried out more than twenty-five hundred air strikes on Syria, according to Central Command data, and another four thousand in Iraq. But U.S. officials acknowledge that air power cannot alone destroy ISIS. The cost of all U.S. military operations against the Islamic State—in both countries—has reached about four billion dollars, or more than ten million dollars a day, the Pentagon said last month. The New Syrian Force, meanwhile, barely exists—and has done nothing.","3793","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/our-high-priced-mercenaries-in-syria"
"“So we’re counting on our fingers and toes at this point—when we had envisioned fifty-four hundred by the end of the year,” Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said, referring to the rebel fighters.

"The Pentagon claims some success in halting the pace of the blitz that took the world by surprise in June, 2014. ISIS has since been forced into defensive combat.

"The hearing took place amid reports that a whistle-blower within Central Command filed a formal complaint this summer charging senior officers with skewing intelligence data to portray false progress. The Islamic State still holds roughly a third of both Syria and Iraq.

"The rebel training program has been troubled from the start. Recruiting has been hard, as has vetting for past political and family connections. U.S. plans have been clumsy. The recruits, who trained in Turkey, were not always reliable or fully committed. A number of them left without completing the course. In July, shortly after returning to Syria, many of the program’s fifty-four graduates were killed or captured by an offshoot of Al Qaeda. Others simply fled, leaving only the handful in the fight. Another class that is currently training has just more than a hundred new recruits, the Pentagon policy chief Christine Wormuth told the Senate hearing.","3799","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/our-high-priced-mercenaries-in-syria"
"The failure reflects a pervasive flaw in U.S. efforts across the Middle East and South Asia—many involving U.S. Central Command—to create friendly forces to fight its causes on the ground. For many Syrians, the U.S.-trained rebels are perceived as little more than guns-for-hire, Robert Ford, the former U.S. Ambassador to Syria, told me. “American mercenaries, that’s what I’d call them. They’re trained by Americans. They’re paid by Americans.

"The Bush Administration faced a similar problem when it tried to create the Free Iraqi Forces before its 2003 invasion. Congress allocated ninety-five million dollars for a training program by U.S. troops at Camp Freedom, in Hungary. The Iraqi opposition, led by Ahmed Chalabi, pledged to recruit thousands of exiles. In the end, it mustered about ninety-five men. Some U.S. officials nicknamed it the “million-dollar-a-man army,” and acknowledged that it would probably be insignificant in the war against Saddam Hussein.

"“We witnessed the collapse of the Iraqi security forces, in which the United States invested twenty-five billion dollars over an eight-to-ten-year period,” Katulis said. Billions of dollars’ worth of U.S. military equipment was abandoned on the battlefield and became instrumental to subsequent ISIS military gains. “Now we’re back to square one,” Katulis added. “And the same thing has happened with the Afghan Army, and rebuilding it in fits and starts.” (Similar programs, to train the Vietnamese military, in the seventies, and the Lebanese Army, in the eighties, also failed. The United States was forced to hurriedly withdraw its forces from both countries.) “Much of our debate on the Middle East, about what tools will be effective, has failed,” Katulis said. “We have not produced sustainable solutions.”","3805","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/our-high-priced-mercenaries-in-syria"
"All this comes at a time when Syria’s future borders, and viability, are at stake.

"One day last fall, Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, appeared on “Meet the Press” to talk about the tense relationship between many African-American communities and the police departments charged with protecting them. In Ferguson, Missouri, the governor had declared a state of emergency as a grand jury considered whether to indict Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American. (In the end, Wilson was not indicted.) Chuck Todd, the host, asked about white officers patrolling African-American neighborhoods, but Giuliani wanted to talk about crime, not punishment. “I find it very disappointing that you’re not discussing the fact that ninety-three per cent of blacks in America are killed by other blacks,” he said, adding, “It is the reason for the heavy police presence in the black community.” The next day, on Fox News, Giuliani said that protesters who chanted “Black lives matter!” should be supporting police officers, not demonizing them. He suggested that the people who really valued black lives were people like him, who worked to reduce the African-American murder rate. “When I came into office, thousands of blacks were being killed every year,” he said. “By the time I left office, it was down to about two hundred.”","3809","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"These comments inspired a backlash, but they were not, in themselves, surprising. Giuliani has never evinced much sympathy for critics of the police; in 2007, when he launched his Presidential campaign, his law-and-order approach helped make him, for a time, the most popular candidate in either party. But the national mood has grown less punitive, and when Giuliani made his remarks last year few allies emerged to support him. Many Republicans, including John Boehner, the Speaker of the House, now say that they support criminal-justice reform; Jeb Bush has signed a reform pledge affirming that prison sentences are “not the solution for every type of offender.” And, among Democrats, fears of being labelled soft on crime seem to have subsided since the nineteen-nineties. As First Lady, Hillary Clinton called for “tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders” while campaigning for her husband’s 1994 crime bill; the law instituted “three strikes and you’re out” sentences, and the federal-prison population almost doubled over the next ten years. But in Clinton’s current Presidential campaign she calls for reforming the police and ending “mass incarceration.” In response to pressure from protesters, she has used the phrase that has come to signify outrage at police brutality: “Black lives matter.”","3810","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"This summer, the Black Lives Matter movement got a literary manifesto, in the form of Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “Between the World and Me” (Spiegel & Grau), a slender but deeply resonant book that made its début atop the Times best-seller list. Coates, a writer for The Atlantic, has been chronicling recent police killings, and he has responded with a polemic, in the tradition of James Baldwin, that takes the form of a lyrical letter to his fourteen-year-old son. Coates lists Michael Brown alongside other recent victims: Eric Garner, John Crawford, Tamir Rice, Marlene Pinnock. He writes, “You know now, if you did not before, that the police departments of your country have been endowed with the authority to destroy your body.” And he reminds his son that this destruction is so often unpunished as to be tacitly sanctioned:","3811","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"He means to confirm what his son suspects: that the shocking stories in the news are not anomalous; that police abuse is just another manifestation of the violence that has afflicted black people in America ever since slavery; that officers who kill are not rogues but, rather, enforcers of a brutal social order. One of the most severe lines in the book is also one of the most frequently quoted: “In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body—it is heritage.”","3812","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Four decades ago, a number of black leaders were talking in similarly urgent terms about the threats to the black body. The threats were, in the words of one activist, “cruel, inhuman, and ungodly”: black people faced the prospect not just of physical assault and murder but of “genocide”—the horror of slavery, reborn in a new guise. The activist who said this was Oberia D. Dempsey, a Baptist pastor in Harlem, who carried a loaded revolver, the better to defend himself and his community. Dempsey’s main foe was not the police and the prisons; it was drugs, and the criminal havoc wreaked by dealers and addicts.","3813","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Dempsey is the most vivid character in “Black Silent Majority” (Harvard), a provocative new history by Michael Javen Fortner, a professor of urban studies who wants to complicate our understanding of crime and punishment in black America. He points out that while African-Americans have long been disproportionately arrested and incarcerated for committing crime, they have also, for just as long, been disproportionately victimized by it. His focus is New York in the nineteen-sixties and early seventies, when crime rates shot up, creating a demand in African-American communities for more police officers, more arrests, more convictions, and longer prison sentences. The book begins near the end, on a January day in 1973, when Dempsey joined Governor Nelson Rockefeller at a press conference in support of what became known as the Rockefeller drug laws—a passel of anti-drug statutes that helped make New York a mass-incarceration pioneer, increasing the number of “friskings, detainings, beatings, and humiliations” that Coates writes about.","3814","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Like many scholars and activists, Fortner is profoundly disturbed by our modern system of criminal justice, calling mass incarceration “a glaring and dreadful stain on the fabric of American history.” But he thinks this history is incomplete if it ignores what he calls “black agency”: he wants us to see African-Americans not merely as victims of politics but as active participants in it, too. At a moment of growing concern about how our criminal-justice system harms African-Americans, Fortner seeks to show that African-American leaders, urged on by members of the community, helped create that system in the first place.","3815","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Last year, Coates used his blog to host an online book club devoted to Michelle Alexander’s unsparing “The New Jim Crow,” which came out in 2010 and is still finding new readers. Alexander is a law professor at Ohio State who was radicalized by her time at the American Civil Liberties Union, where she battled racial profiling. She eventually concluded that bias was inherent in the criminal-justice system, and that the system relegated African-Americans to second-class citizenship. The book’s focus was the war on drugs, which helped produce this country’s enormous prison population. She noted that President Reagan made fighting drugs a priority even before anyone was talking about the crack-cocaine epidemic of the nineteen-eighties, and she showed that penalties were disproportionately applied to African-Americans, even though blacks and whites used and sold drugs at roughly equal rates. She argued, convincingly, that our punitive solution to the trade in illegal drugs was an overreaction, and one that would never have been tolerated if more of its victims had been white. She urged activists to fight back in explicitly racial terms, demanding that prison rolls be slashed and police departments remade, not merely in the name of pragmatic reform but in the name of black liberation. In many ways, the Black Lives Matter movement is an answer to her call.","3816","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Coates shares Alexander’s skepticism about law-and-order rhetoric, and he is especially critical of what he has called the “Gospel of Giuliani,” which parries complaints about police and prisons with scary statistics about black people killing black people. In Coates’s view, the term “black-on-black crime” ignores the fact that most violent crime is intraracial, and also obscures the government policies that gave rise to segregated African-American neighborhoods and their high crime rates. “To yell ‘black-on-black crime’ is to shoot a man and then shame him for bleeding,” he writes. The formulation, he believes, encourages us to imagine that something is wrong with black people, instead of seeing that something is wrong with America.","3817","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Coates writes with a preacher’s sensitivity to the rhythms and patterns of language, and of history, too, which means that he slips almost imperceptibly between piercing outrage and something close to fatalism. In his previous book, “The Beautiful Struggle,” Coates described how his boyhood was shaped by his father, Paul Coates, an independent scholar and publisher whose booklist is a bibliography of black liberation. Theirs was not a religious household, and Coates has kept faith with faithlessness, which helps explain his profound distaste for the notion that African-American stories must be redemption stories—what, exactly, makes us think that we shall overcome, some day? “Perhaps struggle is all we have because the god of history is an atheist, and nothing about his world is meant to be,” Coates tells his son in the new book, by way of explaining the importance of fighting a system that can scarcely be fought, let alone beaten.","3818","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Alexander has been accused, credibly, of underplaying the importance and the cost of crime. (Her book begins with the example of Jarvious Cotton, one of more than two million African-Americans who are ineligible to vote because of a felony conviction. She does not mention that Cotton was convicted of murder for the killing of a seventeen-year-old during a mugging.) Coates, though, writes eloquently about common crime, especially in “The Beautiful Struggle.” Readers who come to his first book by way of his second may be taken aback not only by its seriocomic tone and hip-hop-inflected language but also by its vivid evocation of Coates’s boyhood on the gruelling streets of Baltimore. In one memorable passage, he paid dark tribute to the guys from a West Baltimore housing project called Murphy Homes, summoning the fear he felt and the reverence, too:","3819","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"“The Beautiful Struggle” was, no less than its successor, a book about black bodies in peril, although the threats tended to come from within the community. In this world, the police were a menacing presence—after Coates got in trouble in school, his father gave him a beating, asking his mother, “Who would you rather do this: me or the police?”—but Coates seems to have been more concerned about the Murphy Homes boys and the others like them. At one point, he noted that in 1986 there were two hundred and fifty murder victims in Baltimore. “That year,” he wrote, “my man Craig was butchered on his way home from work.” It was a piercing moment, but readers expecting an elegy got, instead, a few terse biographical sentences, as if Coates were underscoring the ghastly banality of this loss.","3820","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Between the World and Me,” Coates shifts his focus from the neighborhood to the nation. The book is given shape and weight by the story of another friend who was killed: Prince Jones, a college acquaintance, shot by an African-American police officer while sitting, unarmed, in his jeep, which apparently matched the description of one driven by a suspect in the theft of a police gun. Coates emphasizes the violence done to the black body to help us see the physical abuse that undergirds broad structures of oppression. Of course, Craig had a body, too, and it was destroyed in a manner far more commonplace. In “Between the World and Me,” the “black body” refers, as well, to the black body politic. When a police officer shoots and kills an unarmed African-American—especially when the officer isn’t charged with a crime, as Michael Brown’s killer was not, and Prince Jones’s killer was not—he is, Coates wants us to understand, proving the continued existence of a system in which African-Americans are victimized by state power and are powerless to demand accountability. A black college student is a body, but he is also a citizen, and this explains why, even in violent neighborhoods, some kinds of violence seem, to Coates, particularly salient: because they threaten not just the body of the victim but his citizenship, too.","3821","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Michael Javen Fortner grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and his boyhood sounds even more chaotic than Coates’s. “I was only a couple of years old when one of my brothers was stabbed to death,” he writes. “I do not remember him, but the pain and sorrow of that day stayed in my home like accumulated dust.” He thinks that analysts like Alexander, in their eagerness to indict systemic injustice, sometimes downplay the “black agony” that characterizes many neighborhoods where brutal crime is ubiquitous. Black political activists present history in ways that emphasize racial solidarity, but Fortner says that the Brownsville he remembers was “a community at war with itself”:","3822","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"It was Richard Nixon who popularized the phrase “silent majority,” as a way of insisting that the countercultural masses protesting the Vietnam War constituted nothing more than an outspoken minority. In positing the existence of a “black silent majority,” Fortner draws on the work of Charles V. Hamilton, an African-American political scientist and the author, with Stokely Carmichael, of “Black Power.” In 1970, Hamilton published an article in the Times Magazine about the mass of black Americans who were concerned about crime. “They want police protection, not police persecution,” he wrote, “and because they believe that the incidence of the latter is greater than the former, they believe the present law-enforcement systems must be viewed suspiciously, rather than optimistically.” In an essay about Harlem, James Baldwin wrote, “The only way to police a ghetto is to be oppressive.” He portrayed the officers as an occupying force: “Their very presence is an insult, and it would be, even if they spent their entire day feeding gumdrops to children.”","3823","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Plenty of citizens and politicians made a different calculation, concluding that the risks of persecution were outweighed by the urgent need for protection. In nineteen-sixties Harlem, heroin addiction was increasing steeply, and street crime had become so common that some churches cancelled evening services, to protect parishioners from being set upon as they returned home. Drug crime strained the relationship between black leaders and white liberal allies, who wanted to combat the drug trade with medical treatment, not criminal penalties. In 1962, Oberia Dempsey led a coalition of civic leaders who asked President Kennedy to “mobilize all law-enforcement agencies to unleash their collective fangs on dope pushers and smugglers.” A group convened by the civil-rights leader A. Philip Randolph urged that “a life time sentence without parole be made the punishment to meet the crime of pushing narcotics.” Testifying at a state hearing in 1969, Hulan Jack—a black state assemblyman representing Harlem, and the former Manhattan borough president—called for life imprisonment for the crime of mugging, and argued that the system of incarceration was not nearly mass enough. (The prison population had been declining despite a sharp increase in arrests.) A 1973 Times poll found that “about three-quarters of New York’s blacks and Puerto Ricans” thought that life without parole was the proper sentence for convicted drug dealers.","3824","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Rockefeller’s drug laws sharply increased the penalties for various drug crimes; possession of four ounces of heroin, for instance, would result in a minimum sentence of fifteen years to life. (In the two decades that followed, the prison rolls in New York quintupled; other states followed, creating a nationwide prison boom.) But Reverend Dempsey, the militant Baptist standing behind Rockefeller on that January day, was not representing the black political establishment. Many of the leaders and groups in Fortner’s book were careful to pair calls for more police with calls for police reform, mindful of the possibility that the “fangs” of law enforcement might sink into the wrong necks. The Rockefeller drug laws passed with hardly any help from black legislators, all but one of whom voted against them. When it counted most, black political support melted away. Fortner hastens to explain that many Democratic legislators had partisan concerns (the bill’s passage was viewed as a Republican victory) and distinct cultural identities—black political élites, he writes, tended to be more optimistic about Harlem than their working- and middle-class constituents were. He points out that a number of community leaders stood with Dempsey to support the bill. And he establishes that black politicians and clergymen helped raise the alarm about drug crime in the first place. Even so, the vote makes it hard to conclude that black political support was decisive in the passage of the Rockefeller drug laws.","3825","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Fortner’s narrative mainly reveals the bleakness of the choices facing black voters and their representatives in those tempestuous years. Statewide rehabilitation efforts had failed, owing in part to lack of funding, and so many civic leaders viewed a new punitive regime as an improvement: it wouldn’t help reform the addicts or dealers, but it might help protect everyone else. A decade later, during the crack years, African-Americans in Congress faced a similarly difficult choice in considering the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. The law established a minimum sentence of five years for trafficking five hundred grams of cocaine or five grams of crack cocaine. Years later, activists criticized this hundred-to-one disparity as unfair to African-Americans, who were more likely to be convicted of selling crack cocaine. But the bill passed with support from two-thirds of the African-Americans then in Congress, including Charles Rangel, from Harlem, whom President Reagan singled out for praise during the signing ceremony.","3826","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"None of this directly refutes Alexander’s argument that the modern carceral state is a new version of Jim Crow. Indeed, Fortner thinks that black leaders, though right to be concerned about crime, were wrong to think that exorbitant mandatory sentences—rather than better-funded rehabilitation programs and structural anti-poverty efforts—were the answer. (Rangel later worked to end the crack-versus-cocaine disparity.) When Alexander calls our criminal-justice system “the new Jim Crow,” she is drawing an imperfect parallel that tells us more about what this system does than about why it exists. It is possible, as Fortner shows, to be skeptical of the drug war while also noting that no small number of its supporters believed, as fervently as any activist today, that black lives matter.","3827","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"On April 12th, in Coates’s native Baltimore, police officers on bicycles noticed an African-American man named Freddie Gray, who saw them watching him and fled. They caught him, found a small knife, arrested him, and put him in a police van to take him to the station. By the time the van arrived there, Gray was unconscious, with his spine nearly severed, and after a week he died from his injuries. The legal reaction came quickly: on May 1st, prosecutors brought charges against six officers, one of whom was charged with second-degree murder. But the first protest began even before Gray died. The uproar seemed to inspire police officers to work more cautiously and, perhaps, to disengage; arrests dropped, and the number of homicides rose. There were forty-two murders in Baltimore in May, compared with twenty-three the previous May; in June, there were twenty-nine, compared with eighteen the year before; in July, forty-five, compared with twenty-two; in August, thirty-three, compared with twenty-six. In four months, sixty more lives were lost than in the previous year, most of them black.","3828","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Near the beginning of “Between the World and Me,” Coates recalls the night the grand jury announced that it would not return an indictment against Darren Wilson for killing Michael Brown. His son retreated to his room to cry, and Coates tried to figure out what to tell him. This book is his response, but it is not until the end that Coates allows, “Michael Brown did not die as so many of his defenders supposed.” A Justice Department report looked at the Ferguson Police Department and found a wide range of abusive practices, as well as “intentional discrimination on the basis of race.” But another Justice Department inquiry debunked the widely reported story that Brown was coöperating, with his hands up—saying, “Don’t shoot!”—when he was killed. And forensic details corroborate the claim that Brown was initially shot while trying to grab the officer’s gun.","3829","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"The ubiquity of video footage has increased the scrutiny of police killings, making it easier for citizens to contest official explanations that would otherwise go unchallenged. Until recently, however, no one kept a complete count of who was being shot by police officers, and why. The Washington Post examined reports of police shootings in 2015 and found that this year blacks were about three times as likely as whites to be killed by police. (Because of the difference in population sizes, non-Hispanic whites still form a plurality—about fifty per cent—of all people killed by police.) A Web site called killedbypolice.net has been tracking media reports of police killings since 2013; it finds that over the past three years blacks were about three and a half times as likely as whites to be killed by police.","3830","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"These findings should disturb us, but so, too, should the fact that the racial disparity is actually wider for civilian violence. Overall, blacks are about eight times as likely as whites to be murdered. As far as we can tell, someone killed by police is less likely to be black than someone killed by a civilian. In “Ghettoside” (Spiegel & Grau), an absorbing new book about murder in an African-American community in Los Angeles, the reporter Jill Leovy writes about what she calls “the black homicide problem.” She doesn’t use this term to defend police departments; on the contrary, she uses it to indict them, writing about all the cruelty and misery that flourishes in a place where there is no “state monopoly on violence.” If anything, the outrage over relatively rare police killings should remind us just how much everyday violence—and just how much everyday inequality—we have learned to ignore.","3831","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Coates’s two books show how twinned fears of crime and punishment can be mutually reinforcing: how the historic failure of the police to keep African-Americans safe from violence can make police excesses all the more appalling. The police killing of Prince Jones was, surely, that much more disturbing to a man who remembered that when he was a boy the police had failed to protect his friend Craig. For some reformers, the key is retraining police officers to minimize violence. But Coates and Alexander warn against this kind of meliorist thinking. “A reform that begins with the officer on the beat is not reform at all,” Coates has written. To many Black Lives Matter activists, the phrase “state monopoly on violence” probably sounds more like a threat than like a reassurance.","3832","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Crime statistics in Baltimore are complicated: in the decades since Coates was a boy, murders declined, but so did the city’s population. In general, though, American crime rates have fallen since the early nineteen-nineties, and the nation’s imprisoned population—while extraordinarily high, by global standards—seems to have stopped increasing. As for police killings, each one is tragic, and each unjustified one is outrageous; police departments in Europe, for instance, are vastly less likely to kill. But there is no evidence that we are living through a modern epidemic. Although there is little reliable national data, the New York Police Department keeps records. In 1973, the year Rockefeller signed his drug laws, the department shot and killed fifty-eight people; in 2013, the most recent year in the department database, the number was eight. The Black Lives Matter protests draw their urgency from the damage that violence has done to African-American communities. But they resonate so widely because, after decades of chaos, that violence seems to have subsided.","3833","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Experts disagree about how much of this change can be attributed to policing or to mass incarceration; in many ways, crime rates are mysterious. But the decades-long decrease in crime has made it much easier for politicians to heed the activists demanding that we reform our criminal-justice system. There is some indication that this year many cities besides Baltimore are suffering from an uptick in homicides; if this trend were to continue, talk of ending mass incarceration might become politically toxic, even for African-American politicians. As Fortner’s book makes clear, no political movement can afford to ignore the kind of cruel disorder that we euphemistically call common crime. A police force that kills black citizens is adding to America’s history of racial violence; so is a police force that fails to keep them safe. Alexander may be right that our criminal-justice regime is a new incarnation of the monstrous old Jim Crow system. But this should tell us something about the desperation of the many African-Americans who supported it anyway—convinced, not wholly unreasonably, that the alternative was even worse. ♦","3834","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"The keynote speaker at the annual National Prayer Breakfast, in Washington, D.C., is expected to be an agile performer: a preacher, but a nondenominational one; an orator, but a nonpartisan one. In 1997, the speaker was Benjamin Solomon Carson, who was both an accomplished pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins University and, unlike most pediatric neurosurgeons, something of a celebrity. Ten years before, he had separated twins who were joined at the head, and he used the attention that followed to establish himself as a writer and inspirational figure. He grew up poor and black in Detroit, the son of a single mother who, he likes to remind audiences, could barely read. And he has a knack, common to great motivators, for making his accomplishments seem both extraordinary and achievable.","3835","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"“I don’t feel that I really belong here,” Carson said, when he took the lectern, but his casual posture and gentle smile suggested that he knew he did. The anecdotes he dispensed had been polished smooth over the decades, and they helped him administer a carefully calibrated dose of political and spiritual incitement. He lamented the secularization of American society, asserting that religious faith was no longer acceptable in political discourse. “If it’s in our Constitution, it’s in our Pledge, it’s in our courts, and it’s on our money, but we’re not supposed to talk about it, what is that?” he asked. “That’s schizophrenia!” But he also delivered a black-history lesson, enumerating a long list of African-American inventors who were, he said, absent from school textbooks, thereby depriving young black men of role models. Midway through his talk, he issued a whimsical—and bipartisan—call to action. “What if everybody in this room, with all your influence, wrote a letter to Kellogg’s and General Mills and said, ‘Put on your cereal boxes Nobel Prize winners and people of intellect, instead of just people who use sports and entertainment,’ ” he said. “Those kinds of things, I think, will make a big difference.” When he was finished, Bill and Hillary Clinton stood up to applaud, and they pumped his hand as he returned to his seat.","3836","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Perhaps President Obama was expecting a similar performance when he settled in for Carson’s encore appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast, in February, 2013. But by then Carson’s political vision had come into sharper focus. The political pundit and entrepreneur Armstrong Williams, a longtime friend and adviser of Carson’s who is currently his business manager, remembers watching Carson “agonizing” in the greenroom, as he tried to decide whether, and how much, he should criticize the President. In the end, Carson decided not to single out Obama, but he offered a strongly divergent view of America’s problems and potential solutions: he sounded an alarm about the national debt; he called for a strictly proportional income tax, based on the Biblical principle of tithing; and he laid out a health-care reform plan, which he said would reduce “bureaucracy”—a veiled reference, perhaps, to Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The speech became an online sensation, partly thanks to its unnamed target, who stopped smiling about halfway through and skipped an opportunity for a post-speech handshake. Clips have amassed millions of views on YouTube: “Obama Destroyed by Dr. Benjamin Carson’s Amazing Speech”; “Dr. Benjamin Carson Wipes the Smile off Obama’s Face.” (Among Carson’s fans, his honorific often serves as a term of affection.) And the speech inspired the Wall Street Journal to issue the first major endorsement of the 2016 campaign cycle: “Ben Carson for President.”","3837","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The Journal editorial wasn’t actually intended as a Presidential endorsement; it was a jocular salute to a newly minted folk hero, and a mischievous suggestion that even this political layman was more sensible than Obama. But the cult of Carson grew, aided by the formation of the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee, and by tacit encouragement from Carson, who seemed to enjoy the speculation. Soon after the speech, he announced that he was retiring from neurosurgery and hinted that he was considering public office. This May, after two years of contemplation, he declared that he was running. He recalled praying for guidance. “Lord, I don’t want to do this,” he said. “But if you’re going to open the doors I will go through with it.”","3838","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"During a recent appearance at a retirement community in Exeter, New Hampshire, Carson, who is sixty-four, was interrupted by residents making a common complaint: he was speaking too softly. He adjusted the microphone and leaned into it. “I can’t get it any higher,” he said. “It would be in my mouth.” And then he returned to his subject, which was the dire prospect of a country in which citizens were afraid to criticize their government. “Back in Nazi Germany, a lot of those people did not believe in what Hitler was doing,” he said. “They kept their mouths shut and they kept their heads down. And look at what happened.” Carson has an ability—honed, no doubt, during his previous career—to deliver alarming statements in a soothing manner. “Some people say, ‘Oh, nothing like that could ever happen in America,’ ” he said. “I beg to differ.” When he speaks, Carson sometimes blinks slowly, or closes his eyes in thought, and he uttered this last phrase in the same tone of voice that you might use to recount a pleasant dream.","3839","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson announced his candidacy, he was overshadowed by Jeb Bush, who was viewed as the favorite, and then by Donald Trump, whose groundswell began a few weeks later. But Carson kept speaking, quietly. Ryan Rhodes, Carson’s Iowa state director, says that the candidate’s “soft touch” is particularly effective among women voters and Evangelicals. By this fall, national polls showed Carson catching Trump, and even overtaking him. In some ways, this is not a particularly meaningful achievement: national polls, conducted long before the primary season has begun, have little predictive power. (At this point four years ago, Newt Gingrich was the front-runner.) And Carson’s big numbers have had little effect on the skepticism of political experts, who continue to believe that the next President will be a professional politician; Marco Rubio emerged as the betting favorite for the nomination, despite polling about half as well as Carson. Even so, it’s hard to think about the crowded cluster of Republican candidates for President without considering the startling fact that, for months, none were able to command much more support than a former surgeon whose campaign platform is barely more granular than the speech that made him a conservative hero three years ago.","3840","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Like most popular political candidates, Carson promises to deliver his audiences from politics. At campaign rallies, he gets a warm ovation when he inveighs against the nameless forces of division. (“They want Democrats to believe that Republicans are evil,” he says. “Or Republicans to believe that Democrats are evil.”) But that doesn’t make him a moderate. In Exeter, he condemned Planned Parenthood, saying that he would rather direct federal funding to “organizations that don’t engage in killing babies.” A few hours later, at the Durham campus of the University of New Hampshire, he warned about the peril of “global jihadists” and said, “There are many of them, already, within our nation.” That evening, he travelled to a boathouse on Goat Island, off the Portsmouth coast, where a group of local doctors had gathered to slurp milky clam chowder and listen to a former colleague share his belief that physicians should use their “healing instinct” to revive the country. Carson was in his element, joking about the hassles of dunning insurance companies and mentioning, briefly, his interest in trigeminal neuralgia. But even there he stayed on message: when a man in the audience asked about the rising cost of medical school, Carson suggested making colleges pay the interest on student loans, to help keep down tuition, yet firmly rejected the idea of universal government-funded college education. “Anything that we do to add to the debt right now is almost like treason,” he said.","3841","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"During the Obama years, there has been no shortage of conservative leaders eager to squeeze the words “debt” and “treason” into the same sentence. And there are moments when Carson seems almost retro, thrilling audiences with an anti-deficit, anti-Obamacare message that had already started to lose its freshness when he delivered that famous speech. What distinguishes Carson from his Tea Party predecessors is his biography, which also distinguishes him from the rest of the Republican field: he has been telling and retelling his life story for nearly thirty years, hewing to a narrative that emphasizes the Biblical virtues of grace and humility. Other candidates in the race, with the notable exception of Trump, have been reluctant to criticize someone so well loved, perhaps because they don’t view Carson as a long-term threat. In the most recent Republican debate, the other candidates not only refrained from trying to hurt Carson but seemed eager to help him. After he gave a meandering soliloquy in response to a question about banks, Rubio took it upon himself to implement a Troubled Assertion Relief Program, exclaiming, “He’s right on point, there.”","3842","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Journalists haven’t been quite so supportive: BuzzFeed recently posted an old video of Carson suggesting, in defiance of archeological scholarship, that the Egyptian pyramids were actually grain-storage units, built by the Biblical patriarch Joseph. During an excruciating Fox News interview after the Paris attacks, Chris Wallace tried and failed to get Carson to tell him which countries he would recruit to help fight ISIS. (Carson promised to involve “all of the Arab states—and even the non-Arab states.”) Last week, on an Iowa television station, Carson called his foreign-policy education “an ongoing process.” Two days later, he talked about the importance of screening refugees, using an infelicitous analogy: “If there’s a rabid dog running around your neighborhood, you’re probably not going to assume something good about that dog.”","3843","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"At times, the scrutiny has led Carson to engage in atypically peevish exchanges with the media. Williams, his adviser, has been heartened by Carson’s willingness to fight back. “Somebody’s attacking your good name, your word,” he says. “He needs to get emotional. He needs to get fire in his belly.” It would make sense for any other politician to react this way, but Carson’s appeal is based largely on his seeming to be above the fray: a Baptist youth minister in Florida told me that he admired Carson because he was humble, and not “bombastic and adversarial”; a volunteer in Iowa cited his pledge to work for “all the people,” including the ones who wouldn’t vote for him. The most suspenseful thing about his surreal campaign is seeing how long he can stay in the fight without looking too much like a fighter.","3844","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson certainly seemed serene on a recent Tuesday afternoon in Florida, sitting in his temporary living room aboard a chartered bus emblazoned with his face; his head was framed by a backward “D” on the window behind him, the last letter of “BEN CARSON, M.D.” His wife, Candy, emerged from a private room in the back to show Carson a message on her mobile phone, and then disappeared. Carson pointed out that he is used to travelling a lot, and that he has been contending with big crowds for years. “When people would come to the clinic, they always would come with their cameras and their books to be autographed,” he told me. “The magnitude has just increased exponentially.” His campaign has followed an astonishing trajectory, but so has his life; he published his autobiography, “Gifted Hands,” in 1990, and it reads like an extended parable. He writes that his mother, Sonya, was a domestic worker, and sometimes left Ben and his older brother, Curtis, with neighbors while she sought clinical help for “confusion and depression”; his father, an autoworker and part-time preacher, left the family when Carson was eight.","3845","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson was raised in the Seventh-Day Adventist Church—he was baptized at eight and again, for good measure, at twelve—and he has remained a member. His surgical skill seems, in his telling, like a compensatory gift from God: afflicted with poor eyesight, he discovered that he had a knack for spatial visualization, making him well suited to navigate the delicate tangle of a child’s brain. Like many Adventists, Carson is a vegetarian, though he downplays any differences between Adventists and other Christians. Decades ago, in an interview in Vegetarian Times, he expressed certainty that meat eating would fade away by 2010, and that animals would “breathe a sigh of relief.” But, on the bus in Florida, he was eager to explain that his diet is merely a personal choice, and that he has nothing against meat eaters or hunters. He offered a brief explanation of his church’s best-known tenet. “There’s no place in the Bible that says the Sabbath was changed from Saturday to Sunday, so we worship on Saturday, that’s all,” he said. “Does that mean that people who worship on Sunday are evil? No! Of course not.”","3846","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” Carson recalls the two years that he and his brother spent in Boston, living with his mother’s sister: he remembered “winos and drunks,” as well as “squad cars racing up the street.” At the retirement community in Exeter, he added grislier details, saying, “I saw people lying on the street with bullet holes and stab wounds.” The Boston Globe talked to longtime residents of the neighborhoods where Carson lived, who remembered a less menacing atmosphere; one called the claim of bodies in the streets a “vast exaggeration.” Of course, Carson’s exaggeration, if that’s what it is, surely wouldn’t seem so vast if he were not a Presidential candidate; one suspects that few motivational speakers would emerge unscathed from an encounter with a pack of investigative reporters.","3847","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"A number of Carson’s favorite anecdotes seem impervious to research. When he tells his life story, he rarely omits the moment when, at the age of fourteen, he tried to stab another boy with a camping knife; he struck the boy’s belt buckle, the blade “snapped and dropped to the ground,” and Carson retreated to a bathroom, where he begged God to rid him of his violent temper. In Carson’s telling, the prayer worked. “Since that day,” he wrote, “I have never had a problem with my temper.” It says something about Carson’s reputation that reporters have grown suspicious not of his redemption but of his original sin: CNN talked to former friends and classmates and noted, solemnly, that “the violent, impulsive person Carson has described himself as is unrecognizable to them.” Similarly, Carson often talks about a moment of rage when he attacked his mother with a hammer, but, in 1988, the Detroit Free Press published an article in which Carson’s mother recalled the altercation differently. In her version, it was she who wielded the hammer, and might have used it, if Curtis had not intervened.","3848","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The most damaging potential debunking is also the least clear-cut. Carson was part of the R.O.T.C. program in high school, and in “Gifted Hands” he remembers being “offered a full scholarship to West Point.” But, earlier this month, Politico reported that Carson’s campaign had “admitted” that “a central point in his inspirational personal story was fabricated”: he had never applied to West Point, let alone been accepted, and the school does not charge tuition. But Carson had never mentioned applying, and so Politico, under pressure, softened its language, saying only that Carson “conceded that he never applied nor was granted admission.” Since then, the controversy has grown more obscure—it is now an argument over what “offered” means, and whether a West Point representative might have made some encouraging remarks that Carson misinterpreted. In a press conference, he called the reports a “witch hunt.” Raising his voice (possibly for the first time all year), he claimed that Obama had not faced similar scrutiny. “There is a desperation, on behalf of some, to try to find a way to tarnish me,” he said, dejectedly—unlike Trump, Carson takes no visible pleasure in tangling with the media. “It’s just ridiculous!”","3849","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"For Carson, being attacked is a relatively new experience. In the years after “Gifted Hands” was published, he turned his autobiography into an industry. He embarked upon a never-ending speaking tour and founded a charity, the Carson Scholars Fund, which has recognized more than six thousand students for their “academic achievement and humanitarian qualities.” His book spawned nine sequels, and also two documentaries, a cable-television feature film (starring Cuba Gooding, Jr.), and a long-running play in Baltimore, which was often performed for schoolchildren judged to be in need of supplementary edification. The legend of Dr. Carson was ubiquitous in the predominantly African-American schools of Baltimore. (The essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates, who grew up there, wrote, of Carson, “I saw him speak so many times that I began to have that ‘This guy again?’ feeling.”) It was ubiquitous, too, in many churches around the country, where Carson’s story served as proof that faith could conquer all. Many of the people who wait in line to hear his stump speech think of him primarily as a religious figure, which is part of the reason that the media skepticism hasn’t harmed him. Like his policy positions, which are often vague or confusing, the precise details of his biography matter less to voters than the opportunity he offers them to become characters in his uplifting story.","3850","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” politics rarely intrudes. Carson joined his high school R.O.T.C. program in 1967, a few months before the Detroit riots, but the book makes no mention of them, or of the uproar over the Vietnam War, or of Martin Luther King, Jr. (Carson recently told the Wall Street Journal that, during the riots inspired by King’s assassination, he sheltered some white students in the high-school biology lab, although the Journal could not find anyone to corroborate this story.) Carson says that he was brought up to be “a fairly partisan Democrat,” but he evidently wasn’t much interested in activism. He attended Yale during a tumultuous period: in 1970, near the end of his freshman year, the campus was overtaken by protests that accompanied the trials of members of the Black Panther Party, who were accused of murder. (Hillary Clinton, then studying at Yale Law School, served as a liaison to the group that planned the protests.) But his campus life seems to have revolved mainly around Candy, his wife, a fellow-student who was also from Detroit. She is the author of a forthcoming book about their marriage, the co-author of his last three books, the leader of the Carson family string quartet (they have three grown sons, who fill out the lineup), and, he often says, the only woman he has ever been with. One of the black student leaders in those days at Yale, Kurt Schmoke, says that Carson was not among the rabble-rousers. “The Ben Carson I knew in college was a very studious person—focussed like a laser beam on going to medical school,” he says.","3851","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson got his medical degree from the University of Michigan and, in 1977, arrived at Johns Hopkins, where he became known as a precise but imaginative surgeon. Readers who have heard about his life-saving feats might be surprised to learn, in “Gifted Hands,” how many of his best-known surgeries ended in disaster, or in a more equivocal result. Benjamin and Patrick Binder, the German twins who played such a large role in Carson’s career, were seven months old when the operation took place: Carson and his team had to temporarily induce hypothermic arrest so that they could disentangle the interlaced blood vessels before the babies bled out. Both survived the operation, but they suffered brain damage, and one has since died. One of the things Carson learned is how not to become paralyzed by self-doubt. He likes to say that he has performed fifteen thousand surgeries, which would mean an average of more than one a day, for more than three decades.","3852","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In Baltimore, Carson was a friend and ally of Schmoke, the former student leader, who transformed his activism into a career in elected politics: from 1987 until 1999, he served as the Democratic mayor of Baltimore, and he and Carson often talked about ways to support young people in the city. At one point, when a Democratic gubernatorial candidate sought Carson’s endorsement, Schmoke urged him to decline, so as not to damage his spotless reputation. “I guess I thought that his story was above partisan politics,” Schmoke says now, chuckling. Back then, Carson liked being politically uncategorizable. In his book “The Big Picture,” published in 1999, he noted with satisfaction that he had once heard hosts on a radio show arguing over whether or not he supported Louis Farrakhan’s Million Man March. Carson conspicuously declined to settle the question. Elsewhere in the book, he preëmptively defended himself against the suggestion that he was a conservative Republican. “I’m not,” he wrote, adding that he would accept no political label more restrictive than “independent.”","3853","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Schmoke remembers the day, some years ago, when Carson casually mentioned that he was skeptical of the scientific consensus on evolution. Schmoke thought he was joking, but Carson made clear that he wasn’t. “I said to myself, ‘Gosh, there must be a lot of things that Ben believes that I’ve never talked to him about,’ ” Schmoke recalls. Carson now says that his political outlook began to shift in the nineteen-eighties, when he found himself captivated by President Reagan’s message of “self-empowerment.” That became Carson’s message, too, although for many years he delivered it in nonpolitical terms. “Gifted Hands” begins with a letter from Carson’s mother, who reprises one of her favorite phrases: “If you don’t succeed, you have only yourself to blame.” In one passage, Carson declares that it is time for “minorities” to “stand on our own feet and refuse to look to anybody else to save us.” But later, in a discussion of “disadvantaged kids,” he suggests that there is “a system precluding these people from achieving.” Of course, self-help and systemic change need not be mutually exclusive. And, anyway, as a surgeon and motivational speaker Carson didn’t have to choose.","3854","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson registered as a Republican only a year ago, as he considered running for President. By all accounts, it was the battle over health care that pushed him to finally embrace a political party. In 2004, President George W. Bush appointed Carson to his Council on Bioethics, and Carson began thinking more seriously about how the federal government might rein in the insurance industry, which seemed to him to consume too much of the nation’s medical spending. At a town-hall meeting in 2005, organized by the Congressional Black Caucus, he suggested a health-care system modelled on “something that already works”: the food-stamp program. (He liked the idea that recipients could shop for medical care, just as food-stamp recipients shop for groceries.) Two years later, at a council meeting, Carson suggested that, if insurance could be made more affordable, universal coverage could be achieved by fiat. He said, “There is where the government perhaps comes in and makes it mandatory, just like it’s mandatory for you to have automobile insurance.”","3855","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"These ideas don’t seem radically at odds with the reform bill that President Obama eventually passed. But as the debate over the Affordable Care Act began, in 2009, Carson was dismayed to find himself shut out of the process: Obama disbanded Bush’s Council on Bioethics, and Carson tried in vain to secure a Presidential meeting. “It left him very disappointed, and devastated,” Williams says. The 2013 Prayer Breakfast speech was an expression of frustration, and also a final attempt to get through to a President who seemed intent on ignoring Carson’s expertise. On the campaign trail, Carson rarely fails to mention his idea for “health savings accounts,” which would be personal and shareable: family members could contribute to each other’s medical bills, and seniors might pass on leftover funds to their descendants. He hasn’t fully explained how these accounts would be set up, or what would happen to patients who depleted theirs. Even more than the competition, he is devout in his belief that systemic problems can be solved by topical applications of common sense.","3856","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"By the time Carson launched his campaign, he had completed his evolution from Democrat to independent to eager exponent of movement conservatism. He evinced a newfound passion for gun rights. And although the Adventist Church suggests that in some “exceptional circumstances” a woman might justifiably choose to terminate a pregnancy, Carson is now “unabashedly and entirely pro-life.” Like any successful speaker, Carson knows how to read a room, and he admits that his transformation has been aided by his recent immersion in politics, and by the receptive audience that he has found among conservatives. He has emerged, for instance, as an advocate of tightened immigration laws, arguing that children born in the U.S. to unauthorized immigrants shouldn’t be given citizenship. “In talking to a lot of Americans, I realized how strongly they feel about people who come here illegally, and I think that probably has influenced me,” he says. “Because if you want to be a representative of the people, in a republic-type government, then obviously you have to represent what they feel.”","3857","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson’s bus arrives at an event, his supporters often break into applause, although some find other ways to express themselves. In Waterloo, Iowa, a woman hopped in place, in anticipation of being in his presence; more than one fan, after shaking his hand, bent over and wept. In Florida, the crowds included eager teen-agers and shuffling seniors but only a small number of African-Americans. Carson occasionally acknowledges that his ideological journey has put him at odds with black voters, who play a vanishingly small role in the modern Republican Party. On the bus, which was trundling from his hotel, in Clearwater, to a Barnes & Noble in Tampa, Carson thought about how, exactly, Democrats manage to win so many African-American votes. “Don’t you think Lyndon Johnson had it right?” he said. “I’m sure you’ve heard his quote where he said, ‘Give those N-words a few goodies and we’ll have their vote for the next two hundred years.’ ” The quote comes, lightly paraphrased, from a book by Ronald Kessler, who attributes it to a former Air Force One steward, who said that he overheard a conversation between Johnson and “two governors.” The line is meant to illuminate the cynicism of Democratic politicians, although, by crediting it, Carson can’t help but belittle the intelligence of African-American voters, too. This tactic is common in politics, where leaders often devise patronizing explanations for the otherwise unaccountable fact that people sometimes vote for their opponents. (Think of Obama’s claim, during the 2008 campaign, that inhabitants of depressed towns “cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them.”) But the notion of black voters as dupes for white politicians has a particularly nettlesome history in the U.S., stretching back to Reconstruction; nowadays, some Republican politicians prefer to simply say, instead, that their party needs to get better at reaching out.","3858","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Because Carson is African-American, he need not be so circumspect—one of his advantages is his willingness to talk about race in language that his rivals would be wise to avoid. He has called Obamacare “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,” and has said, of abortion, “I think it’s a moral issue—just like slavery was a moral issue.” While blasting Planned Parenthood, he asserted that its founder, Margaret Sanger, “believed that people like me should be eliminated or kept under control.” (Sanger did suggest preventing “feeble-minded” people from having children, but there is no evidence that she supported sterilization on the basis of race.) Some of his gentler formulations, too, convey a coded racial appeal: Carson often excites largely white audiences by sketching a vision of racial harmony, just as Obama once did. When he tells crowds that “our unity is what provides our strength,” he could be echoing Obama’s famous claim, from the 2004 speech that made him a national figure, that “there’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America.”","3859","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Some of Carson’s biggest supporters see race as an important part of his appeal. Unlike Obama—and, for that matter, Herman Cain, the African-American businessman who briefly captivated Republican voters during the 2012 campaign—Carson entered this race as a figure well known and widely admired in African-American communities. John Philip Sousa IV, the leader of an unaffiliated pro-Carson political-action committee, is the author of “Ben Carson: Rx for America,” a slim paperback that is given out free at Carson events. (The front cover announces, “Over 1,000,000 in Print!”) Sousa, a great-grandson of the composer, argues that Carson could attract a significant minority of the African-American vote, enough to make a Democratic victory mathematically impossible; a Carson Presidency, he argues, would “forever destroy” the “false narrative that conservatives and Republicans are racists.”","3860","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"There is something paradoxical about Sousa’s argument, which urges Republican voters to agree that race matters in order to demonstrate that it really doesn’t. As Carson’s audience has changed, he has modified how he talks about race, in ways that make him more acceptable to the party he recently joined. Writing in 1999, he affirmed his belief that “our justice system metes out different treatment to blacks and whites,” and declared that police in a Detroit suburb had recently arrested his mother and impounded her car, because she matched the description of a suspect. Now he suggests that African-American frustration with the criminal justice system is misdirected. “I just don’t agree that that’s where the emphasis needs to be,” he says.","3861","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"At times, there are signs of tension between Carson’s old life, as a community-minded motivator, and his new life, as a Republican favorite. During one recent appearance, his customary reminiscences of boyhood gave way to a memorable digression about the joys of throwing rocks at cars. “Everybody did it, because it was so much fun,” he said, and he chuckled at the thought of police officers scrambling to catch him and his friends. “Of course, that was back in the days before they would shoot you,” he said. He stopped himself. “I’m just kidding,” he said, adding that he had “a tremendous amount of respect for the police.” He paused to accept the crowd’s applause, and, back on safe ground, added that the police were “the very last people that we should be targeting.”","3862","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson mentions racial uplift, he often adds a quick disclaimer, noting that his policies are meant “not only for African-Americans but for everybody.” Sitting on the bus, though, he advocated a kind of economic separatism. “If we would learn how to turn our dollars over in our own community, two or three times, before you send it out—that’s how you generate wealth,” he told me. “That’s how the Jews did it. That’s how the Koreans did it.” Half a century earlier, Malcolm X made a strikingly similar argument, saying, “If we try and establish some industry in our own community, then we’re developing to the position where we are creating employment for our own kind.” Of course, Malcolm X’s entreaty was accompanied by a caustic corollary that probably would not impress the Republican electorate. “Once you gain control of the economy of your own community,” he added, “then you don’t have to picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for a job in his business.”","3863","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"If Carson has a specific pitch to African-American voters, it is indistinguishable from his general economic pitch. He wants to lower taxes for everyone in order to spur economic activity and raise interest rates, so that poor and middle-class families can earn more interest in their savings accounts. And he wants to allow corporations to repatriate overseas money, tax free, if they use ten per cent of it to “create jobs for unemployed people and people on welfare.” His campaign’s outreach to African-Americans has consisted largely of a radio advertisement featuring a hip-hop track that not even Carson seemed to enjoy. (“I probably would have taken a little different approach,” he said after it was released.) Maybe it doesn’t much matter, given the racially polarized state of American politics. Florida, for instance, is about seventeen per cent African-American, but exit polls conducted there in 2012 suggest that only about one in a hundred Mitt Romney voters was African-American. Sometime in the future, black voters might help Republicans win the Presidency. But in this cycle it’s highly doubtful that they will help a Republican win the nomination.","3864","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Earlier this fall, Carson startled the press corps—and some of his own advisers—by cutting back on his campaign schedule so that he could promote his latest book, “A More Perfect Union,” in which his political platform takes the form of a constitutional exegesis. (Carson’s ten books all cover pretty much the same territory, and so some conceptual ingenuity is required to keep his bibliography growing.) The plan, which Carson explained by saying that he wanted to fulfill his obligations to his publisher, puzzled many observers; National Review posted a blog item under the headline “this isn’t normal.” And yet the book tour helped him—or, at any rate, didn’t hurt. During October, when he was mainly off the campaign trail, his popularity increased. National polls showed him in a virtual tie for first place, with Trump; in Iowa polls, for the first time, he was the front-runner. At book signings, hundreds and even thousands of fans lined up to buy a copy of “A More Perfect Union,” have it signed, and maybe get a quick handshake. Carson apparently hasn’t lost his surgical dexterity, because often he executed the handshake while holding an uncapped Sharpie in the same hand. At a Books-A-Million in Kissimmee, Florida, employees made sure that customers didn’t linger for more than a few seconds, but one man brought the line to a halt. Bob Santos, a fellow-Adventist who had first heard about Carson through his church, had spent more than five hundred dollars on a basketful of Carson books, which he planned to distribute to friends and relatives. Once Carson had worked his way through the basket, Santos seemed exhilarated, even though he hadn’t quite got everything he wanted. “I thought he was going to personalize one of them,” Santos said. “He said he can’t.”","3865","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Before Carson’s Presidential campaign was a campaign, it was a business—one largely independent of Carson himself. The Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision allows political-action committees to be more or less unregulated, so long as they don’t coördinate their activities with official campaigns. In December, 2013, Carson told potential supporters that none of the groups soliciting on his behalf had his blessing, but the pro-Carson groups didn’t need it. They kept making money and plowing it back into fund-raising, creating a virtuous and potentially lucrative cycle. The following year, as the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee—run by Sousa and Vernon Robinson, a political entrepreneur—was raising millions, Armstrong Williams suggested that the organization was dishonest. “People giving money think it’s going to Dr. Carson, and it’s not,” he said, adding, “I don’t like misleading people.”","3866","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Once Carson announced his candidacy—yielding, he said, to the people who had been “clamoring” for him to run—he had to make peace with the Carson industry. Williams now believes that the unaffiliated PACs are “not as exploitative” as he had thought, and concedes that they have played an important role in boosting Carson. Williams says that he is careful not to communicate with the Super PACs. (He suffered a scandal of his own, a decade ago: he was working as a syndicated columnist, and it was revealed that the Bush Administration had paid him to promote its No Child Left Behind Act.) This must require special vigilance, because his brother, Alvin Williams, runs Black America’s Political Action Committee, which solicits donations in order to “push Dr. Carson to victory.”","3867","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The official campaign has proved adept at fund-raising, too, using expensive telephone and direct-mail solicitations to reach small donors. Last month, the Federal Election Commission reported that Carson’s campaign had raised nearly twenty million dollars from donors who had given two hundred dollars or less—vastly more than any other Republican. Bush, Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Chris Christie have all attracted much more Super-PAC money than Carson, while Trump has attracted about as much as he seems to need, which is none. But, if individual donations were votes, Carson would be the people’s choice.","3868","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"This is partly a matter of strategy: Carson’s campaign devotes an unusually large portion of its spending—more than fifty per cent—to fund-raising. It is also a result of Carson’s status as a kind of conservative eminence, the kind of figure who makes people excited to put a check in the mail. At the Barnes & Noble in Tampa, Sousa’s Super pac was outside in the parking lot, selling T-shirts and giving away copies of his book. An independent vender was there, too, hawking buttons. One showed Carson with hands clasped in prayer; another said, “Vote Republican—we can’t ALL be on welfare!” An elderly man wandered through the store, gawking at the line of customers that snaked around the bookcases and outside into the muggy afternoon sun. “Is Ben Carson here?” he asked a store manager. “I’ll probably vote for him—but I hate those annoying phone calls.”","3869","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson’s determination to do right by his publisher, Penguin, has fuelled speculation that he is more interested in making money than in becoming President. Indeed, Carson seems as proud of his business acumen as of his surgical skill—he often reminds voters that he has served on the board of both Kellogg and Costco, and promises to reinvigorate government by bringing in people he knows from “the business world.” One of Carson’s connections has caused him some trouble during the campaign: Mannatech, a multilevel-marketing company that sells nutritional supplements it calls “glyconutrients.” In 2009, the company agreed to pay six million dollars to settle a suit, brought by the Texas attorney general, which accused it of claiming that its products “cured, treated, or mitigated” a list of ailments that included cancer, autism, asthma, toxic-shock syndrome, and attention-deficit disorder. Carson has given speeches at Mannatech events, and he appeared in a regional public-television program about brain health, sponsored by Mannatech distributors, in which he stressed the importance of glyconutrients. When I asked about Mannatech, he said the company had behaved in a way that was “a little bit dishonest,” by uploading a promotional video he appeared in that was supposed to be available only to sales associates. But even now, when discussing the company’s product, Carson can’t help but offer a sales pitch. “I use it every day,” he told me. “Since I’ve been taking it, the incidence of me getting sick has dramatically declined.”","3870","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Many of Carson’s supporters are true believers: they earnestly explain how he and no other candidate could pull the country together. It can be harder to detect what Carson himself wants. Throughout the campaign, he has shown relatively little interest in the specifics of policy. His tax plan is more like a statement of general principles—he wants everyone to pay the same rate, but he hasn’t specified what that rate would be. And his foreign policy can seem like one long improvisation. During a recent debate, he responded to a question about Syria and Afghanistan with a confusing claim that “the Chinese” were active in the region; in the days afterward, the campaign clarified that Carson hadn’t meant to suggest that Chinese troops were present in Syria. At times like this, Carson’s insistence that he is a reluctant candidate can seem all too convincing—a few months before he officially announced, he told a medical journal, possibly in jest, that he would be relieved if he didn’t win. Williams remembers Carson saying, of the people urging him to run, “Maybe they see something in me that I don’t see.”","3871","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Most Republican strategists maintain that voters will eventually settle on a more conventional choice, chastened by the prospect of President Carson or, more likely, of another President Clinton. But the rise of unaccountable PACs has weakened the party élites, which means that no one seems to have the credibility to tell the Republican base that nominating Carson might be a bad idea. The increasing messiness of the modern political primary has been, so far, a Republican story; this is in large part an accident of history. In Obama, the Democrats have had a leader who inspires loyalty. But in the next election cycle, or the one after it, the Democratic Party, too, may confront a base of voters eager for a candidate who has as little affection for politics as they do. Perhaps sober, élite-approved Presidential candidates, seasoned by decades of political experience, will come to seem as old-fashioned as network news anchors, and for some of the same reasons.","3872","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson is, even more than Trump, the ultimate 2016 outsider. In the years since the Prayer Breakfast, he has often played the role of soft-spoken firebrand, standing up for the core principles of conservatism. But one sometimes gets the sense that his ideological conversion is incomplete. The Club for Growth, a small-government think tank, often criticizes the timorousness of the Republican establishment, and it has been critical, too, of this year’s insurgents. The group’s Super PAC spent half a million dollars on a television ad to tell Iowa voters that Trump “supports higher taxes.” (The claim relied heavily on a Trump tax proposal from 1999; the Trump campaign responded with a cease-and-desist letter.) David McIntosh, the group’s president, says that he was alarmed by Carson’s suggestion, in a 2012 book, that it was possible to “extract socialism’s positive aspects and actually implement them within capitalism.” (Carson was referring to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps.) McIntosh is not reassured by Carson’s frequent paeans to liberty. “In the Republican primary, ‘free market’ and ‘less government’ are the buzzwords,” he says. “I think he may be using those, but they don’t really reflect a well-thought-out philosophy of the role of government.” The group says it is “unable to conclude that Ben Carson would be a pro-growth president,” but its Super pac has not spent money attacking him, because it does not view him as a serious threat. “As he gets closer to the election,” McIntosh says, “people will say, ‘I’m not sure he’s ready, yet, to be President.’ ”","3873","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson believes that readiness is overrated. “There’s no one person who knows everything,” he says, and he is confident in his ability to learn as he goes. But his struggles with difficult questions about governance have made that confidence harder to credit. There are signs that his popularity in Iowa is beginning to ebb—some polls suggest that Trump has regained a narrow lead there. Carson became a front-runner by deploying his motivational skills on his own behalf: he inspired Republican voters to believe that they could have any kind of President they wanted and that they did not need to settle for a mere politician. Now some of them may be realizing that there is no alternative to politics—no way for a retired neurosurgeon to become a Presidential candidate without becoming a politician, too.","3874","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” Carson admitted, “I don’t handle failure well,” although he added a humblebragging clarification: “I guess the Lord knows that, so He keeps it from happening to me often.” It’s not clear that he would regard an inability to win the Presidency as a failure. If the media interrogations grow too withering, or the polls too discouraging, Carson might happily return to a new version of his old life, talking and speaking a bit more about his journey out of Detroit, and a bit less about tax rates or military movements in Syria. In the meantime, he is enjoying the crowds and the adulation. At a recent book event in Lakeland, Florida, fans filled the parking lot, and a book-tour staffer climbed onto Carson’s tour bus to photograph the scene. A small media pen had been set up near the portable lectern where Carson was signing books, and he strolled over to take questions. One reporter wanted to know how he had been preparing for the next debate. “By listening to your questions,” Carson said.","3875","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"

"Republican insiders, however, called the Kochs’ plan to sell Walker highly optimistic, and noted that the market for the Wisconsin Governor was, at this point, virtually nonexistent.","3881","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/cutting-losses-kochs-to-sell-scott-walker"
"The Kochs, who reportedly had been frustrated by Walker’s poor performance in the polls, finally decided to sell the Wisconsinite after last weekend’s odd pronouncement, in which he seemed to support a border wall with Canada.","3882","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/cutting-losses-kochs-to-sell-scott-walker"
"According to a Koch associate, “Ignorance has always been a part of Scott’s appeal, but that Canada thing was just too much.”","3883","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/cutting-losses-kochs-to-sell-scott-walker"
"After their plan to sell him was announced, the Kochs immediately pulled Walker off the campaign trail for fear that he might say something that would further reduce his dwindling market value.","3884","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/cutting-losses-kochs-to-sell-scott-walker"

"On Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton went on the “The Tonight Show” to talk about, well, mostly Donald Trump. She first appeared in a skit in which the host, Jimmy Fallon, dressed as Trump, called her on the phone to catch up, offer campaign advice, and provide a set-up for her to discuss the many ways that she has fought for women’s rights throughout her long career in public service. Later, during the interview portion of her appearance, she and Fallon joked about Trump’s hair (she invited Fallon to touch hers) and mocked his stream-of-consciousness speaking style.","September 17, 2015","3886","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Noting that Trump and other Republican candidates have never held political office, Fallon asked Clinton, “Is this possible, that you have too much experience to become the President of the United States?” The questions did not get harder hitting from there. Are you tough enough to be President? How did you figure out how to use Twitter? Fallon tried to ask Clinton about the ongoing scandal involving the e-mails she sent as Secretary of State, but she parried the question by joking about gefilte fish, then offered a vague explanation about how various governmental agencies interact. Fallon, nodding, was ready to move on.","3887","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Fallon, as Trump might say, always wins in the ratings, and is a great big, huge, massive success on social media. Clinton was eager and a good sport, but if there was a viral moment I missed it.","3888","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"It could have been different. Clinton was reportedly offered a spot on Colbert’s first show, which aired last week, but her campaign team turned it down. (Perhaps they were worried that he would ask a coherent question about the e-mails; he probably would have.) So the invitation went to Jeb Bush, who, during an oddly paced conversation, earned from Colbert some lukewarm and circuitous praise. “There is a nonzero chance that I would consider voting for you,” Colbert said, causing Bush to pause for a moment, taken aback, perhaps thinking that the host had said “a zero chance.” But such scorn from Colbert was instead reserved for Trump, who is, despite the host’s antipathy, appearing on “The Late Show” next week, a day after Ted Cruz. Before that, on Friday, it will be Bernie Sanders, who earlier this summer went on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” There, Meyers began the interview by making fun of Sanders’s hair, but then, remembering perhaps that he is supposed to be the intelligent late-night alternative (or is that Colbert now?), led a substantive conversation about economic inequality.","3889","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"All of the candidates—including those among the herd of Republicans in the race, some of whom have started their own late-night tours—have the misfortune of campaigning to replace an all-star yakker, Barack Obama, who looks more comfortable on talk-show sets than at least half of the guys (yes, still all guys) currently behind the desks. In 2009, he became the first sitting President to appear on a late-night show, when he visited the “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.” This summer, he offered quasi-official Presidential goodbyes to the departing David Letterman and Jon Stewart. The 2016 candidates aren’t just running for President, but auditioning for the role of Guest-in-Chief.","3890","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"And this campaign arrives at a time when the hosts, too, are jockeying for position in a crowded field. Some see the booking scramble as a new iteration of the late-night wars, with Fallon and Colbert reëstablishing the old Leno-Letterman dynamic, in which Fallon, like Leno, wins the ratings, but Colbert, as was true of David Letterman, enjoys more cultural cachet. (This interpretation relegates “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to third-party status, and the others to the further fringe.)","3891","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"The emerging conventional wisdom suggests that if you want to behave like a grown-up, you’ll go on Colbert’s show, and if you want to make a dent on social media, you’ll go to Fallon and make yourself look gently ridiculous in exchange for a little viral gold dust. But, for politicians, it hasn’t worked out that way so far. Last week, Trump chose Fallon and faced off against the genial host’s Trump impression. (He seemed pleased at what he saw.) When Fallon asked him how he would create new jobs as President, Trump replied, “I’m just going to do it.” (Same thing with the border wall.) At the end of the bit, Trump blew Fallon a kiss. The exchange did not make waves.","3892","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Trump might have made more of a splash on Jimmy Kimmel’s show, which, like Fallon’s, produces reliably shareable moments, but with a touch more vinegar thrown in. Watching Trump read mean tweets about himself could have been fun for all. Then again, the invitation might not be forthcoming: Kimmel doesn’t seem to like Trump much. (An even better, but sadly impossible, match for Trump: the short-lived but sensation-making “Morton Downey Jr. Show,” which ran for a couple years in the late nineteen-eighties, and where Trump could have traded insults with the vituperative host, mocked his fellow-guests, and basked in the madhouse frenzy stirred up by the braying audience.)","3893","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Remarkably, the most viral late-night moment for any politician during this cycle was a long, wide-ranging conversation about authenticity and grief. When Vice-President Joe Biden went on Colbert last week, they talked about how religious faith has shaped the way that they both have faced personal tragedy, and the discussion was raw and unsettling and poignant. No one quite knew how to put this politely, but it was political gold. Colbert, visibly moved, more or less demanded that Biden run for President—if he does, these several minutes on television will be cited, rightly or wrongly, as a turning point. They were also a reminder that Internet virality is not always a reflection of our most shallow selves. Sometimes people share things for the simple reason that they mean a great deal.","3894","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Watching Clinton on Fallon, Wednesday night, I was reminded of just how many times Clinton has, while running for office, strained to come across as an ordinary person. No amount of self-deprecating quips about dyeing her hair or wearing pantsuits, or jokes about being a kooky grandma, will make the case. She is not ordinary, but rather an exceptional person with an exceptionally complicated public history. That doesn’t mean that she can’t connect with people, though, even in the constricting genre of late-night TV. She was always funny on Letterman, but during an appearance in 2003 she was more than that, talking about how she felt in the days after her husband admitted to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky. She was there to promote her book, but everyone goes on late night for a reason. She had profound things to say about marriage, pain, and forgiveness. Viewers have come to expect a politician’s appearance on a talk show to be frivolous and opportunistic. When it is more than that, they are surprised and sometimes even moved. Humanizing yourself, after all, is a different thing from showing your humanity.","3895","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Now we finally know what Bernie Sanders means by “democratic socialism.” Speaking on his political philosophy at Georgetown yesterday, the Vermont senator and Democratic Presidential candidate opened with a long invocation of Franklin Roosevelt and the social protections that the New Deal created: minimum wages, retirement benefits, banking regulation, the forty-hour workweek. Roosevelt’s opponents attacked all these good things as “socialism,” Sanders reminded his listeners.","November 20, 2015","3896","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"Curiously, Sanders seemed to agree with them, taking his definition of “socialism” from its nineteen-thirties opponents, the people Roosevelt called “economic royalists.” “Let me define for you, simply and straightforwardly, what democratic socialism means to me,” Sanders said. “It builds on what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all Americans.”","3897","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"This isn’t the first time Sanders has defined his position from the right flank of history. Pressed in the most recent Democratic debate to say how high he would take the marginal income tax, Sanders answered that it would be less than the ninety (actually ninety-two) per-cent level under the Eisenhower Administration. He added, to cheers and laughter, “I’m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.”","3898","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"But, of course, both Roosevelt and Eisenhower distinguished themselves vigorously from “socialism,” which they understood to be a revolutionary program of extreme equality, committed to centralized control of the economy, and a cat’s paw of Soviet power. Accusations of “socialism” trailed liberals for decades after Roosevelt parried his opponents, from Ronald Reagan’s attacks on Medicare to the Republicans’ refrain against Obamacare. Democrats, like Roosevelt, have furiously defended themselves against the charges. But now a candidate whose ideal American economy does in fact look a lot like Eisenhower’s—strong unions, secure employment, affordable college—is waving the red flag, and finding favor with large numbers of Democratic voters.","3899","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"The new eagerness to embrace the word reflects the climate that a Pew poll captured, in 2011, when more respondents between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine reported a positive view of “socialism” (forty-nine per cent) than “capitalism” (forty-six per cent). (Gallup polls regularly find that a slim majority of Democrats express a positive view of socialism, but an overwhelming majority supports “free enterprise,” suggesting, charitably, some ideological flexibility.) Those under-thirty respondents are, of course, the first voters of the post-Soviet era, whose formative experiences are of a not very heroic unipolar world of American power and market-oriented ideas. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet empire put the word “socialism” up for grabs again: it may have landed in the dustbin of history at first, but that left it free for scavenging and repurposing.","3900","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"A decade before the Wall fell, the United States saw the quieter but also momentous collapse of the pro-government consensus that dominated the middle of the twentieth century. The Eisenhower paradox—that he was a big-government, welfarist conservative—is no paradox at all: he led the center-right at a time when the center was deeply welfarist and big-government. American politics after the Second World War was founded on the core idea of the earlier Progressive movement, which both F.D.R. and his cousin Theodore championed: the old ideals of personal liberty, economic opportunity, and civic equality could not survive in a laissez-faire industrial economy. Values once associated with small government now needed big government—the regulatory state—to preserve them. So, in 1937, F.D.R. urged that government should “solve for the individual the ever-rising problems of a complex civilization,” and, in 1965, L.B.J. echoed him, warning that “change and growth seem to tower beyond the control and even the judgment of men.” Strong government was the answer: a counter-power to wealth and to economic crisis. Their world was also Dwight Eisenhower’s.","3901","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"Ronald Reagan’s declaration, in his 1981 inaugural address, that “government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem” announced a new era. Government did not in fact shrink, thanks largely to military spending and retirement benefits, but the willingness to say that it could provide what F.D.R. had called “a permanently safe order of things,” let alone F.D.R.’s economic “Second Bill of Rights,” was almost forgotten. The market was the new all-purpose solution, even before the Soviet collapse and the subsequent elevation of disruption, innovation, and self-branding as the language of emancipation.","3902","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"So, between roughly 1979 and 1989, two figures went into the wilderness: the long-dominant American idea that strong government was necessary to humanize a market economy, and the word “socialism” as a name for a different kind of society. Exiled as opponents, they returned as friends. Bernie Sanders’s socialism is Eisenhower’s and F.D.R.’s world if Reagan had never happened: economic security updated by the continuing revolutions in gender, cultural pluralism, and the struggle for racial justice. In a word, Denmark; but also America with a counterfactual history of the last forty years.","3903","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"The mid-century political settlement between government and markets that Eisenhower took for granted never really had a name. It was not a fighting faith. “Welfare capitalism,” which is a pretty accurate name for a market system that redistributes for common benefit, sounds like the worst of both worlds. “Socialism” is historically inaccurate, and using it to name Eisenhower-era welfarism may come at the cost of further burying its other, more radical meanings. But some of the term’s appeal, as a name for Sanders’s program, is that it sounds more radical than it is. The radical label accentuates the feeling that something has gone wrong in economic life. It marks the intensity of dissent.","3904","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"In this way, Sanders’s use of the word harkens back to pre-Soviet, even pre-Marxist socialism. Then the term named a clutch of objections to industrial capitalism: the physical toll of the jobs, the equal and opposite toll of unemployment and economic crisis, widespread poverty and insecurity in a world where some lived in almost miraculous luxury. Assessing the socialists of the nineteenth century, whose programs ranged from the nationalization of industry to the creation of village coöperatives, John Stuart Mill doubted that they understood how markets worked, but he admitted their moral claims unreservedly: “The restraints of Communism would be freedom in comparison with the present condition of the majority of the human race.”","3905","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"Mill predicted that capitalism would burn out its fuel of cupidity and become a realistic version of what socialists (and communists) wanted. Worker-owned co-ops would out-compete traditional enterprises by aligning workers’ motives with the company’s success. At the same time, with poverty overcome, people would care less about getting richer, and spend their time in what Mill felt made life worthwhile in the first place: conversation, friendship, appreciation of poetry and painting. His optimism came from faith that, once people had less to fear from material want and from one another, they would find new ways to coöperate without the narrowness and cruelty of old hierarchies. He applied exactly the same premises to the relations between men and women, insisting that absolute legal equality would spur new discoveries about how to live and who to be—new creativity in gender identity (not his term but certainly his thought) and new experiments in how equals could care for one another. This humanistic faith in gender equality was one of the most accurate social prophecies in modern thought, but the same faith in egalitarian coöperation was a nonstarter in economic life.","3906","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"Mill was hardly alone in expecting capitalism to work out its kinks. Eisenhower’s world lacked a name for its settlement between government and markets partly because that settlement was the new normal, and the normal doesn’t need a name. Mature capitalism was supposed to produce only a moderate level of inequality. A strong government, staffed by public-minded experts, would iron out economic wrinkles. The remaining problems for reformers were remedial: bringing in previously excluded populations, especially African-Americans and isolated Appalachians. For those already on the inside, the challenges were those of what the liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith called “the affluent society”: how to want less, enjoy life more, and help build a post-materialist paradise of humanism. It is no coincidence that L.B.J., who supported the civil-rights movement and launched the War on Poverty, also promoted the National Endowment for the Humanities to enrich the lives of those whose historical labors were over. He described his Great Society program as seeking an economy that satisfied “the desire for beauty and the hunger for community,” where “the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.”","3907","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"That is the lost world to which Sanders’s “socialism” points back. The return of the label, though, doesn’t mean that anyone knows how to get more radical than tacking toward Scandinavian social democracy, with its socialized health care and higher education and generous family leave. Sanders isn’t much of a socialist compared to F.D.R., either. At the heart of Roosevelt’s program was the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which greatly strengthened the hand of unions, essential parts of every welfare-capitalist order in the twentieth century, from Scandinavia to Canada. Sanders, astonishingly, didn’t once mention unions in his Georgetown speech. Roosevelt proposed a maximum income of twenty-five thousand dollars (the equivalent of about four hundred thousand dollars today), which we won’t be hearing from Sanders. Sanders’s socialism is a national living wage, free higher education, increased taxes on the wealthy, campaign-finance reform, and strong environmental and racial-justice policies.","3908","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
"This is not a program for a different kind of economy, based on coöperation and deepened democracy— what socialism used to stand for, which powered it as both a threat and a hope. The heart of Sanders’s program, like F.D.R.’s, is economic security: like F.D.R., he argues that “true freedom does not occur” without it. In the same way, he sees a strong government as protecting individualism from an economy that bats people around like the gods in Greek dramas. Calling this once mainstream idea socialism is a way of saying how far it feels from where we find ourselves now, how radical a step it would be to get back to it.","3909","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bernie-sanderss-new-deal-socialism"
