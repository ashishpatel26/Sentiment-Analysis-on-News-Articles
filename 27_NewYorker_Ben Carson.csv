"In July, 1953, a former Communist named Manning Johnson testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee about the menacing implications of Bolshevism in American life. He warned that Communists had infiltrated civil-rights organizations, making it difficult to distinguish the movement for racial equality from the movement for centralization and wealth redistribution. The civil-rights movement was often accused of Communist subversion, so little about the appearance warranted particular notice, save for one fact: Johnson was African-American. Black critics howled accusations of racial betrayal, but Johnson was engaged in something subtly different and vastly more interesting: desegregating the American tradition of paranoia.","March 10, 2015","1","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"

"It’s tempting to see Ben Carson—neurosurgeon, notable black success, conservative pundit, and coquettish potential Presidential candidate—as this election’s Herman Cain: the black conservative whose mere presence inoculates other Republicans from charges of racism as they attack Obama. The ability to provide that kind of racial cover may be part of the reason for Carson’s prominence in the party, but it’s not its overriding rationale. Instead, Carson is heir to the tradition of people like Manning Johnson and George Schuyler, the black conservative who defended Joseph McCarthy even after McCarthy’s fellow Senate Republicans rejected his conspiratorial canards. To the broad public, Carson’s crackpottery—his argument that the sexual behavior of prisoners proves that homosexuality is a choice, his contention that Obamacare is the biggest travesty to befall the nation since slavery, his theory that Obama may declare martial law and cancel the 2016 elections—disqualifies him from being taken seriously. But, for the small segment of the population that he is concerned with, those statements are assurances that they are not monochromatically white. Carson is a black representative and standard-bearer, not for conservatives but for paranoid Americans.","3","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"Carson first attracted mainstream attention when, in February, 2013, he delivered the keynote speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, which he prefaced several times with warnings about his disdain for political correctness. Carson, as is his habit, opened with the impressive details of his personal biography: the impoverished childhood in a single-parent household, in Detroit; the moral values inculcated in him by his illiterate but fiercely protective mother; the against-the-odds success that validates his creed of hard work, godliness, and education. With President Obama seated just feet from him, he went on to warn of the dangers of the federal deficit, advocate a flat tax based upon Biblical tithing, and endorse private health-care accounts that would replace the Affordable Care Act.","4","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"While Internet commentators hailed Carson’s speech for “wiping the smile off Obama’s face,” the President’s countenance would have been more aptly described as expressing a default neutrality. None of Carson’s comments marked him as exceedingly conservative; it wouldn’t be difficult to find Democrats who share those sentiments. In fact, Carson’s Booker T. Washington-esque prescriptions of personal virtue as a cure for poverty are almost identical to the arguments that Obama himself deploys when talking to black audiences. Nor do these admonishments encompass the entirety of Carson’s thinking on matters of race. The National Prayer Breakfast speech became the basis for his book “One Nation,” in which he criticizes racial profiling:","5","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"Even with the false note of evenhandedness, in which Martin’s death is the product of shared racism, this marks a departure from the reactionary arguments made by other black conservatives, like Carol Swain, in which Martin was seen as essentially responsible for his own death. And, at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, Carson urged congressional Republicans to create an alternate plan to insure health benefits for poor people before dismantling Obamacare. He is not among those who feel that the government has no role in insuring that the poor have access to health care.","6","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"Yet if Carson is only moderately conservative, he’s radically paranoid. His rhetoric betrays a sweaty-palmed fixation on government power, and a fear that President Obama has made himself into an American Caesar. Those fears are most clearly manifested in his tendency toward hyperbolic comparison. From his somewhat nuanced take, in “One Nation,” on Trayvon Martin’s death, Carson goes on to argue that the liberal disdain for black conservatives is as pernicious as Jim Crow. At the Values Voter Summit in 2013, he compared the Affordable Care Act to slavery, and argued that both are mechanisms of government control. This is part of a world view in which homosexuality is a matter of volition and possibly a product of a willful, covert effort to subvert traditional values. This is why Carson is able to reconcile support of civil rights for African-Americans with their denial to gays and lesbians, as he stated on CNN last week. African-Americans are not, after all, black on purpose.","7","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"
"The most relevant comparison for Carson isn’t to Cain but to Michele Bachmann, the last Presidential aspirant who, despite membership in a group with a history as targets of discrimination, came to represent the twitchy ideals of American panic. Carson has written of his youth, “Many of the whites in those days found ways to rationalize their unjust treatment of fellow human beings, arguing that they were not racists but rather protectors of traditional values.” Carson’s presence as a potential Presidential candidate represents a triumph, albeit a cynical one, over those rationalizations. He’s moved the country one step closer to that moment when we will be measured not by the color of our skin but by the content of our conspiracy theories.","8","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carson-paranoid"

"Whatever happened to Marco Rubio? In February, 2013, his picture appeared on the cover of Time magazine, accompanied by the headline “The Republican Savior.” At the time, many political analysts—Bill Clinton reportedly among them—viewed the Florida senator as a big threat to the Democrats in 2016. Now, following his announcement on Monday in Miami, he’s officially in the race for the Republican nomination, but as a rank outsider. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, just 7.5 per cent of likely Republican voters consider him their first-choice candidate. That puts him in seventh place, behind Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ben Carson, and Mike Huckabee.","April 14, 2015","17","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"Of course, it’s early in the process. Having gone all in, Rubio might get a boost, just as Cruz, the junior senator from Texas, has since he announced his candidacy last month. Right now, though, it’s hard to see how he could challenge the front-runners. Although Rubio was elected to the Senate in 2010 as part of the Tea Party wave, and although he still espouses extreme views on issues like climate change (he’s a skeptic) and same-sex marriage (he opposes it), many people in the conservative movement don’t view him as a true believer. In any case, the right-wing end of the Republican field is very crowded. Rubio’s best hope is probably to position himself as a center-right candidate and hope for a slipup on the part of Jeb Bush, his fellow Floridian.","18","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"

"The proximate cause of Rubio’s current problems is well known: his role in co-sponsoring a bipartisan immigration-reform bill that would have established a lengthy pathway to citizenship for law-abiding undocumented immigrants. With the support of Rubio and thirteen other Republicans, the Senate passed the bill in June, 2013. After the bill generated a backlash among conservative and anti-immigration groups and died in the House of Representatives, Rubio backtracked, disavowing the legislation and saying that it wasn’t realistic. But the damage to his reputation on the right had been done. And so, as the race to 2016 began to shape up, Rubio found himself outflanked by other conservative hopefuls, such as Cruz and Walker.","20","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"In the past year or so, Rubio has been trying to regain the trust of his party’s hard-liners, saying that nobody has an automatic right to immigrate to the United States and stressing that improving border security should be the first priority. He’s had some success in this enterprise. “I think that Sen. Rubio has done something that most politicians don’t do,” Jenny Beth Martin, the president and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots group, told Politico. “He evaluated what went wrong … [and] is working to make sure he doesn’t make the same mistakes again. I think that neutralizes his mistakes.”","21","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"But what use is a Marco Rubio who panders to the right on his defining issue? The Republican Party is chockablock with supine politicians of this sort, and that helps to explain why it has lost the popular vote in five of the last six Presidential elections. The thing that made Rubio an exciting figure a few years ago, the reason he landed on the front of Time magazine, was that he seemed to combine youth, a compelling personal story, and conservative views with a willingness to reach out to parts of the electorate that the G.O.P. had neglected, particularly, but not exclusively, Hispanics. Immigration reform was supposed to be the test case for whether the Republican Party could adopt a more pragmatic and inclusive approach, and when it sunk, it took Rubio down with it.","22","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"The bigger story is that this Republican golden boy fell victim to what I refer to as the three-strikes theory of politics. If you look around, you will find that it generally takes not just one or two but three defeats for an unpopular political party to reform itself and abandon the things that made it unpopular. Because of the influence of established politicians, vested interests, and ideology, all democratic parties tend to resist change. Two strikes aren’t enough to overcome this inertia. Only after a third successive beating at the hands of voters can reformers overcome the ideologues and seize control of the party.","23","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"Of course, it’s only a theory, and it has its exceptions. But look at what happened to the Democratic Party in the nineteen-eighties. After losing to the Republicans for a third successive time in 1988, Bill Clinton and his business-friendly “New Democrats” gradually gained the upper hand and won the 1992 election. Something similar happened in the United Kingdom, when the Labour Party, after defeats in 1981, 1984, and 1987, jettisoned much of its ideological baggage: its commitments to public ownership, unilateral disarmament, and compulsory trade-union membership. The more recent experience in France, which saw the Socialist Party lose Presidential elections in 1995, 2002, and 2007, isn’t quite as stark, perhaps, in that the current President, François Hollande, could hardly be described as a great departure from previous Socialist leaders. But even Hollande, in the run-up to the 2012 Presidential election, advocated for some policies that had previously been considered off limits, such as raising contributions to the retirement system and making it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers.","24","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"Where are the Republican reformers? Despite talk about making the party more electable, the evidence suggests that the G.O.P. ultras, even if they don’t hold many very senior posts in the party, retain an effective veto over any efforts to modernize. With Rubio now parroting the immigration line laid down by Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, et al., the task of taming the right wing has passed to Bush, who, to his credit, has not yet backed down from his support for comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for the undocumented.","25","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"As I’ve mentioned before, Bush is hardly a moderate. During his eight years as governor of Florida, he pursued a stridently conservative agenda on spending, taxes, labor laws, and many other issues. Still, compared with the likes of Cruz, Walker, and Carson, he’s practically a Rockefeller Republican. But if you look at the surveys of Republican voters collected on Real Clear Politics that I cited earlier, you will find that Bush is stuck at well under twenty per cent. If you then add together the vote shares of Walker, Cruz, Paul, Carson, and Huckabee, all avowedly conservative candidates, you get a total of 53.1 per cent. Add in Rick Perry and Rick Santorum, and the conservative tally is even higher.","26","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"

"Set aside, for a moment, his repeated refusal, in the past few days, to say whether he believes that President Obama loves America, or whether he believes that the President is a Christian, and look instead at Walker’s record running what used to be one of America’s more progressive states. Having cut taxes for the wealthy and stripped many of Wisconsin’s public-sector unions of their collective-bargaining rights, he is now preparing to sign a legislative bill that would cripple unions in the private sector. Many wealthy conservatives, such as the Koch brothers, who have funnelled a lot of money to groups supporting Walker, regard him as someone who’s turning his state into a showcase for what they want the rest of America to look like.","29","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"But just how threatening is he? If you’ve been following the political news during the past week, you may well have the impression that he’s stumbling in his campaign for the 2016 G.O.P. nomination. Among the political commentariat, the consensus of opinion is that Walker’s repeated refusal to distance himself from Rudy Giuliani’s incendiary comments about Obama, and his subsequent encounter with the Washington Post’s Dan Balz and Robert Costa, during which he appeared to question Obama’s religious faith and took some shots at the media for asking him silly questions, weren’t merely reprehensible: they were serious gaffes that raised questions about Walker’s political abilities.","30","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"It wasn’t just liberal columnists who piled on. In a column at the Daily Beast, Matt Lewis, who also writes for the Daily Caller, said that Walker’s comments raised the question of whether he “might not be ready for prime time on the national stage.” Lewis went on: “Conservatives should be worried that Walker hasn’t proven capable of navigating these land mines.” MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, who is a former G.O.P. congressman, wrote at Politico: “Good candidates know how to make dumb questions look, well, dumb.”","31","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"Rather than deflecting the reporters’ queries about Obama’s beliefs, as other Republicans had done, Walker used them to send a none-too-subtle message to Republican voters. His refusal to say whether Obama was a Christian wasn’t merely a shot at a hostile media. As Dana Milbank, of the Washington Post noted, it allowed Walker to “wink and nod at the far-right fringe where people really believe that Obama is a Muslim from Kenya who hates America.” Milbank also wrote that Walker was “refusing to grant his opponent legitimacy as an American and a Christian.”","32","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"In a more just world, Walker’s indecent and craven antics would disqualify him from playing any further role in the Presidential race. But in the current political environment, his tactics, far from hurting him, may well bolster a candidacy that is already thriving.","33","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"Having cemented his reputation as an economic conservative, Walker is busy making a concerted effort to win over social conservatives and evangelical Christians, some of whom apparently believe that Obama is the Antichrist (or perhaps the Seventh King). Earlier this month, during a trip to London, he refused to say whether he believed in evolution, commenting: “That’s a question a politician shouldn’t be involved in, one way or the other.” In addition to making that hat tip to the Book of Genesis brigade, Walker has been reiterating his opposition to gay marriage and taking a notably harder line on abortion than he did during his gubernatorial reëlection campaign, last year. In a recent meeting with Iowa Republicans, the Times reported earlier this week, he stressed his support for a “personhood amendment” that would define life as beginning at conception and effectively outlaw the termination of pregnancies.","34","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"Evaluated in this context, Walker’s comments, or refusals to comment, about Obama’s beliefs look less like gaffes and more like carefully considered elements of a larger plan—and one that’s working for him. On Tuesday, the research firm Public Policy Polling released the results of a new national survey of Republican voters, which showed Walker leading the G.O.P. race, with twenty-five per cent of the vote. He was seven percentage points ahead of the candidate in second place, Ben Carson, the author and neurosurgeon, and eight percentage points ahead of Jeb Bush. “Walker is climbing fast in the polling because of his appeal to the most conservative elements of the Republican electorate,” said P.P.P. “Among ‘very conservative’ voters he leads with 37% to 19% for Carson, 12% for Bush, and 11% for Huckabee.”","35","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"This is just one poll, and the sample size was small—three hundred and sixteen—but recent state-level polls also show Walker near or in the lead. In California, according to the highly respected Field poll, he’s favored by eighteen per cent of Republicans. Bush is in second place with sixteen per cent, and Rand Paul is in third place with ten per cent. In Texas, a survey carried out by the University of Texas at Austin shows Walker running second, but he’s trailing local boy Ted Cruz by just one percentage point. When a previous poll was taken, in October, only two per cent of Texan Republicans favored Walker; now, he’s standing at nineteen per cent. In South Carolina, according to another P.P.P. survey, he’s also running second, just one point behind Bush, and leading Lindsey Graham, the state’s senior representative in the U.S. Senate.","36","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"It’s still early, very early, of course. But Walker is an ambitious and determined politician who has already been through one tough race—his 2012 recall election—that subjected him to a great deal of media attention and hostility from Democrats. Thanks to his ties to the conservative plutocracy, he’s almost certainly going to have some serious money behind him, and he is trying to pitch his campaign in the sweet spot of G.O.P. primaries, where conservatism and antagonism toward coastal élites meets electability. He has the advantage of youthfulness, at age forty-seven, and, finally, as he pointed out to a convention of Christian broadcasters on Monday, he is, “unlike some out there,” a self-made fellow who “didn’t inherit fame or fortune from my family.” That jab was presumably aimed at Jeb Bush, but if Walker were to get the G.O.P. nomination, it could be modified and directed at Hillary Clinton, assuming that she wins the Democratic nomination.","37","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"

"The conventional wisdom is that Cruz hasn’t got a chance, and, as far as the Presidency goes, it’s probably accurate. To many Americans, he is the loudmouth who, in the fall of 2013, less than a year into his first term as a senator, helped bring the federal government to a halt. Noted for railing against President Obama and denying the existence of climate change, he holds views that, according to an analysis by the Web site FiveThirtyEight, make him “more conservative than every recent G.O.P. nominee, every ’12 contender and every plausible ’16 candidate.”","41","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"But if Cruz’s ultra-conservatism rules him out as a serious Presidential contender, it won’t necessarily work to his disadvantage in the Republican primaries, where his first goal is to distinguish himself from other right-wingers who are leading him in the polls, such as Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee, and Ben Carson. As Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich demonstrated in 2012, the conservative G.O.P. electorate is a fluid one, which falls for articulate rogues who can package age-old nostrums and prejudices in rhetoric that vaguely resembles a coherent political philosophy. Although Cruz is off to a slow start, this weakness should play to his rhetorical skills, which are superior to those of the rest of the G.O.P. field.","42","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"At Princeton, Cruz was a national debating champion (and was, according to a roommate, known to carry a book entitled, “Was Karl Marx A Satanist?”). At Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1995, he was also known as a formidable public speaker. “He had brilliant insights and he was clearly among the top students, as revealed by his class responses,” the Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz told the Daily Caller last year.","43","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"About ten hours after sending out his tweet, Cruz took the stage at Liberty University, which Jerry Falwell founded, in 1971, in Lynchburg, Virginia, and which is now the world’s biggest college for evangelical Christians. The weekly convocation at Liberty has long served as a platform for conservative Republicans, and it’s less than two hundred miles from Washington, D.C., which means that it is within easy access for the media hordes. All in all, it’s an ideal location for a conservative candidate in need of a lift.","44","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"Cruz, clad in a conservative dark suit (what else?) and accompanied by his wife, Heidi, and their two young daughters, rose to the occasion. Prowling the stage, he talked for almost half an hour without notes, casting himself as the leader of a “grassroots army” of liberty-loving Christians who would pull America back from the jaws of secular damnation. Although most of the students in the crowd were obliged to attend, Cruz appeared to engage many of them, and he avoided making any slip-ups.

"He started out by talking about his background as the son of a Cuban immigrant who fought to bring down the dictator Fulgencio Batista during the Cuban revolution, but who subsequently turned against Fidel Castro and, at the age of eighteen, decided to move to the United States. “Imagine, for a second, the hope that was in his heart as he rode that ferry boat across to Key West and got onboard a Greyhound bus to head to Austin, Texas, to begin working, washing dishes, making fifty cents an hour,” Cruz said. But the thoughts of an immigrant fifty-odd years ago weren’t the only thing that he wanted the crowd to imagine. Indeed, as the speech developed, it sounded increasingly like he was channelling John Lennon. But not Lennon the atheist skeptic and peacenik: this was a Liberty University version of the Beatle.","46","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"

"Appearing to be thoroughly enjoying himself, Cruz conceded that some of his wish list might be difficult, or even impossible, to imagine. He reminded his audience that, in 1979, when Ronald Reagan started his second Presidential campaign, it would have been equally impossible to imagine the Berlin Wall coming down and the Soviet Union collapsing. “Compared to that, repealing Obamacare and abolishing the I.R.S. ain’t all that tough,” Cruz said. Then he asked the audience members, most of whom weren’t born when Reagan left office, to text the words “Constitution” or “imagine” to the number 33733.","49","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"What did that mean? Most likely that Cruz intends to run as the Howard Dean of the religious right—a tub-thumping insurgent who uses social media to outmaneuver better-financed rivals. Speaking on Fox News, Joe Trippi, the Democratic strategist who ran Dean’s campaign in 2004, said after the speech, “I thought he did a great job.” Ed Rollins, the veteran Republican operative who was once Ronald Reagan’s campaign manager, was equally impressed.

Priebus’s memories of 2012, when the competition was intense and curiously entertaining, are by his own admission a little nightmarish. As he told the Washington Post’s Dan Balz and Philip Rucker, the Republican debates, in particular, were “an embarrassment and ridiculous.”","January 21, 2015","53","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"
"This time, the Party is aiming to keep things under control by limiting the number of debates to nine and exercising ideological caution in its choice of interlocutors; MSNBC, which has a reputation for left-leaning partisanship, will not be invited to host a debate. “It means that there’s even a greater responsibility on the national party to contain a process that could get out of control,” Priebus said, with artful understatement.","54","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"
"Why then should there be a feeling of angst? It may be because, despite Priebus’s brave hope to “contain” the process, the perpetual-political-motion machine—the Iowa caucuses, the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, the attempts to “front load” early voting—will run with or without much direction from a legacy political party. The idea that the major parties should have a role as gatekeepers, as a shield against the excesses and illusions of pure democracy, seems almost quaint when the largest field ever may be at the starting gate. By some estimates, as many as twenty-five men and women, few with the benefit of any popular support, are giving the race for the Republican nomination serious thought.","55","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"
"In the early nineteen-nineties, Alan Ehrenhalt, the former editor of Governing magazine, described a phenomenon that was already becoming obvious: candidates for public office were bypassing party machinery and simply nominating themselves—self-selected lone wolves who attracted loyal freelancers who were willing to work for a cause and raise a lot of money. Sometimes, they prevailed. In “The United States of Ambition: Politicians, Power, and the Pursuit of Office,” Ehrenhalt focussed on state and local races, but his argument encompassed national candidates, too, and as a general rule it could describe many people in politics who have ambition, a lot of free time, communication skills, a personal fortune or wealthy backers, and no obvious qualifications (either by training or experience) to deal with the real world beyond America’s borders.","56","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"
"Because the first Republican debate is in August, seven months from now, the Party has time to work out the delicate question of who to take seriously. August also happens to be the month of the notoriously meaningless Ames, Iowa, straw poll, which in 2011 was portrayed as a dramatic turning point by the victor, Representative Michele Bachmann, who said afterward, “What we saw happen today is the very first step toward taking the White House in 2012, and you have just sent a message that Barack Obama will be a one-term president.” The Ames poll probably prompted former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, who finished third, to make a premature exit from the race.

"Earlier that summer, a marketing expert named Mark McNeilly wrote about the art and science of “positioning,” the next stage in the Presidential-election cycle. In the commercial world, positioning means showing why the attributes of Tide have a broader appeal than the promises of Wisk. In politics, potential candidates employ gamesmanship and salesmanship to claim narrow territory on issues where a single misstep can be your undoing—they try to find a safe position without actually saying too much.","58","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"
"Indeed, only minuscule differences are visible in the positions of three potential candidates who’ve addressed immigration (none dare speak of “amnesty”): Jeb Bush, who co-wrote a book called “Immigration Wars” with the Goldwater Institute’s Clint Bolick, argues for a narrow path to “legalization” (not citizenship) while encouraging the influx of highly skilled workers. Rick Perry’s main theme, since he ran for President in 2012, has been making the borders less porous, but he’s also made an effort to protect his position with Latino voters. In a Q&A with the Wall Street Journal the other day, he said, “Americans want to have a thoughtful process in place, following the rule of law to allow people to immigrate to this country . . . in a legal way”—a position with which it’s hard to take issue. Marco Rubio, who has modified if not changed his position, now emphasizes the borders, too. Rubio may emerge as the grandmaster of positioning in general; not long ago, he spoke to CBS and said, “The future is now. It’s here. It has arrived. And we need new ideas and new thinking, and quite frankly a new generation of leadership.”","59","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"

"Nearly eight years ago, Democrats held their first televised Presidential debate of the 2008 campaign, marking the debut of a cast of characters that ranged from the plausible to the preposterous. For two hours, the candidates, some of them now remembered only by those with an unhealthy attachment to politics, went at it as the moderator, NBC’s Brian Williams, made game attempts to nudge them into saying something interesting. The most incautious remarks came from former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel and former Representative Dennis Kucinich, both of whom had nothing to lose and knew it. When Williams asked for reactions to Senator Harry Reid’s remark that “the war in Iraq is lost,” Gravel replied, “Well, first off, understand that this war was lost the day that George Bush invaded Iraq on a fraudulent basis.” Kucinich talked about impeaching Dick Cheney. The leading competitors were simply careful. Senator Joe Biden said, “Look, Brian, this is not a game show. You know, this is not a football game. This is not win or lose. The fact of the matter is that the President has a fundamentally flawed policy.” Senator Hillary Clinton said, “Well, Brian, at the outset let me say that the American people have spoken; the Congress has voted, as of today, to end this war. And now we can only hope that the President will listen. … This is not America’s war to win or lose. We have given the Iraqi people the chance to have freedom, to have their own country.” Senator Barack Obama said, “Well, Brian, I am proud that I opposed this war from the start, because I thought that it would lead to the some—the disastrous conditions that we’ve seen on the ground in Iraq.”","April 3, 2015","62","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"

"The other debate participants included the former Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd, the former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, and the former senator and Vice-Presidential candidate John Edwards. They have faded from the scene, in Edwards’s case not in a good way. Yet most of the topics—gay marriage, climate change, immigration reform, and Iraq—are still with us. Hillary Clinton is still being asked to defend her 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq-war resolution, and still sounds much as she did when she said, “Well, Brian, I take responsibility for my vote. … It was a sincere vote based on the information available to me. And I’ve said many times that if I knew then what I now know, I would not have voted that way.” At the same time, Clinton brought real conviction and knowledge to discussions of universal health care, a central issue in 2008 that is still with us. Those Democrats acted like a party engaged by issues and eager to win back the White House.","64","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"
"That’s how the Republicans are behaving this year—eager. The candidacy of Ted Cruz, possible encores by Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, and Rick Santorum, the emergence of Rand Paul, and a “center” represented by Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, and even Lindsey Graham may induce Romney nostalgia for horror-struck Democrats. But it’s a race that’s bound to become ever more compelling, possibly with more candidates (Ben Carson? Carly Fiorina?), and the contenders will be sharpened in the process. They’re looking for a contender, just as the Democrats were eight years ago, when debates and primaries altered early perceptions that Clinton, or possibly Edwards, was bound to win.","65","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"
"Democrats, meanwhile, seem ready to cede the whole thing to Clinton, who, for all her experience and intelligence, may be a less-than-ideal candidate. Even her e-mail problems, which polls at first suggested could be shrugged off, aren’t going away. It didn’t help when her lawyer, David Kendall, in response to a subpoena from a congressional committee looking into the 2012 attack on the American Embassy in Benghazi, told the Times, “There are no hdr22@clintonemail.com emails from Secretary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate or legally authorized.” That her personal e-mail server has been wiped clean of any records from her years at the State Department erases the chance of anyone ever making an independent study of their contents and is bound to encourage the suspicion that there was something worth hiding. The investigation community is like a perpetual scandal-seeking machine, quick to seize on any hint of inconsistency, and both Clintons, understandably, are weary of being pursued by those who don’t wish them well. But the public may be getting weary of seeing the words “Clinton” and “lawyers” juxtaposed yet again with any sort of frequency, which could explain her slippage in the polls in three battleground states.","66","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"
"Not long ago, Ryan Lizza wrote about Clinton’s aura of inevitability and the historic failure of most challenges to strong front-runners. At this point, though, any insurgencies are more notional than real. Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, has been gently critical of her as he shyly contemplates getting into the race. The former Virginia Senator James Webb, who began exploring a run last November, is still hinting that he intends to run. But when you look for signs of the Webb campaign, which promised a fresh view of income inequality, military commitments abroad, and the terrible waste of lives—mainly black lives—caused by mass incarceration, what you’re likely to find is the status of the James Webb space telescope, which will replace the Hubble. (That Webb ran NASA in the years of the Apollo program.) Clinton, meanwhile, has not exactly announced her intentions, but her campaign, without coyness, has reportedly leased two floors of office space in Brooklyn Heights, and that, as Politico notes, may be regarded by the Federal Election Commission as the beginning of a campaign.","67","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"

"Brett Crawford was demolishing the floor of the dinosaur exhibit at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History recently when a crumpled newspaper blossomed from an opened pocket of plywood near the bony tail of the resident Camarasaurus. It was a Washington Post comics page. The ink was so vibrant that, at first, Crawford—a metalworker with Research Casting International, a Canadian company that mounts, disassembles, moves, stores, and replicates dinosaur skeletons and other fossils—figured it to be new. Then he noticed the date: Sunday, November 12, 1944. In the lead strip, Joe Palooka, a fictional boxer stationed overseas during the war, receives an embarrassing care package containing a pink nightie.","71","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/message-box"

From the torn-up floor, he removed a crude wooden box, held together with nails. “Friday, January 10, 1947,” someone had pencilled on an exterior slat. Crawford next found a Boy Scouts of America membership card dated June 30, 1945, that certified Arlton C. Murray as the scoutmaster of Troop 226, in Green Meadows, Maryland. Last, he pulled out a slip of paper bearing neatly sloped handwriting, which read, “Pieces from Right side of caudal vertebra 4—specimen No. 15492, mounted 1947; F. Pearce, A. Murray & N. H. Boss.”","72","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/message-box"
"Turning to a colleague, Crawford said, “I think we just found a time capsule.”","73","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/message-box"
"No. 15492 referred to the tail of Camarasaurus lentus, a Jurassic Period sauropod (the ones with a very long neck, a small head, and legs like redwoods) that lived in what is now Utah, about a hundred and fifty million years ago. The skeleton was collected in 1923 and later acquired in an exchange with the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Pittsburgh. The names inscribed on the slip of paper belonged to three early fossil preparators—the people who clean, repair, and mount fossils—including Murray and Norman Boss, the chief preparator. The men had worked closely with Charles Gilmore, the legendary museum curator and paleontologist, at a time when the Dinosaur Hall was known as the “Hall of Extinct Monsters.” By the time Crawford found the capsule, the Camarasaurus specimen had been on display for nearly seventy years—the skeleton was soon to be disassembled and stored, along with all but a few dinosaurs, as part of the largest renovation since the museum opened, in 1910. The fossil exhibit will reopen in 2019.","74","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/message-box"
"The time capsule soon wound up in the office of Siobhan Starrs, the exhibit’s developer, and one morning in December several of her colleagues dropped by to see it.

"The museum’s historical records held a clue. As a child, during a 1928 scouting trip on the Chesapeake Bay, Murray found a skull, which he took to the museum for assessment. Gilmore determined it to be that of a fossil porpoise. The Boy Scouts led Murray to his life’s work. Later, after a religious conversion, he became a “creation scientist” and used paleontology to argue against evolution.","76","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/message-box"

New York stages have been overrun with melancholy Danes in recent years: Christian Camargo (brooding Hamlet), Michael Stuhlbarg (ranty Hamlet), Jude Law (pretty-boy Hamlet). The latest, Peter Sarsgaard, managed to miss them all; he has never seen a production save for his own, which opens at Classic Stage Company on April 15, under the direction of Austin Pendleton.","81","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/speak-daggers"
"“I’ll be really straightforward: this is entirely for me,” Sarsgaard said during previews. Having turned down a previous offer to play the role, he reconsidered when his longtime mentor Penelope Allen mentioned that she wanted to play Gertrude. “She was talking about murderers,” he recalled. “She said, ‘You know, Hamlet’s a murderer.’ She claims that I got a twinkle in my eye.” That’s no surprise. In movies such as “Garden State” and “An Education,” Sarsgaard’s purring, disassociated intelligence have lent him a touch of menace, which surely comes in handy when it’s time to psych out Ophelia.","82","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/speak-daggers"
"After booking the theatre, Sarsgaard read the play every day, keeping it tucked under a cushion as he shot the NBC miniseries “The Slap.” In the intimate quarters of Classic Stage—where he has appeared in “Three Sisters” and “Uncle Vanya” opposite his wife, Maggie Gyllenhaal—he enjoys playing to the audience directly. “I don’t just do it during the soliloquies,” he said. “I tend to do it even during scenes. I’m always aware, as Hamlet, that there’s an audience there, in a way that I’m not with other roles.” Pendleton’s production doesn’t hew to a time period—there are no cell phones, but no doublets, either—and Sarsgaard reads different books onstage night to night.

"Does it take a certain kind of hubris to play Hamlet? “I really don’t feel the pressure to be the greatest of all time,” Sarsgaard said, adding that the role is, among other challenges, an endurance feat. “It actually cuts through any nerves you might have.

Politics was in my blood, at the family dinner table, in my work and my free time. But at some point in the past few years it went dead for me, or I for it. Perhaps it was week thirty-eight of the Obama-Romney race (a campaign between “Forward” and “Believe in America”), or the routinization of the filibuster, or the name Priorities USA Action, or the fifty-eighth vote in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act—something happened that made it very hard to continue paying attention. I don’t take this as a sign of personal superiority: I’ve always disliked people who considered themselves to be “above” politics. I mourn my lack of political passion as I would if I were to lose interest in reading fiction, or to stop caring about someone who’d been important to me for most of my life. And I count on getting back the feeling—the intense mix of love, hatred, anxiety, astonishment, and gratification—because life, public life, is impoverished without it.

"The other Republican non-signers were Susan Collins, of Maine; Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee; Dan Coats, of Indiana; Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska; Jeff Flake, of Arizona; and Thad Cochran, of Mississippi. There was a certain amount of curiosity about why they hadn’t—as if sending a Dear Ayatollah letter was a fun group activity that they had skipped out on. Collins’s answer was fairly sensible: “I don’t think that the ayatollah is going to be particularly convinced by a letter from members of the Senate.” Others, meanwhile, were more circumspect. “I just didn’t think it was appropriate” (Flake). “I just don’t think we ought to be discussing it in public” (Cochran). Maybe they just didn’t think that the Republican Party had become quite so lacking in leadership. The real question, though, isn’t why the seven didn’t sign, but how Cotton, a freshman senator with a well-known habit of engaging in flights of destructive rhetoric, had persuaded forty-six colleagues to join him.","105","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"As he often points out, Cotton, who is thirty-seven, is both a veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq and a graduate of Harvard Law School. In 2006, when the Times published a piece revealing that the government, in the name of fighting terrorism, had collected the private financial information of Americans who had nothing to do with terrorism, Cotton, then an Army lieutenant stationed in Baghdad, sent a letter to the newspaper, saying that the editors should be put “behind bars.” The “next time I hear that familiar explosion—or next time I feel it,” he wrote, “I will wonder whether we could have stopped that bomb had you not instructed terrorists how to evade our financial surveillance.” He added, “I am well-versed in the espionage laws” that could be used to prosecute people at the paper. The Times didn’t publish the letter, but the conservative Web site Power Line did. Cotton was rewarded with praise from conservatives and, after he left the military and returned to his family’s cattle farm in Arkansas, a chance to run for Congress.","106","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"In 2012, he was elected to the House, where one of his first acts was to call for an amendment to a sanctions bill that would impose penalties not only on those who broke the law but also on their relatives, including their “great-grandkids,” “to the third degree of sanguinity.” The amendment failed—as the Washington Post pointed out, it was blatantly unconstitutional—but Cotton didn’t have much time for regret, because he had already decided to run for the Senate against Mark Pryor, the two-term Democratic incumbent, with the backing of the Tea Party Express, the Club for Growth, and national Republican figures who regarded his future as limitless. (Last September, the Atlantic ran a profile of Cotton entitled “The Making of a Conservative Superstar.”)","107","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"Cotton campaigned by opposing abortion rights and Obamacare, and by appealing to fellow veterans and foreign-policy hawks, while touring the state, as the AP reported, “in a bus decorated with a giant boot print on the front, the Arkansas flag and camouflage.” Last spring, on “Morning Joe,” when asked about suggestions that he was “extreme,” Cotton replied with a reference to Pryor’s record: “The only thing that’s extreme is casting the decisive vote for Obamacare five years ago.” He beat Pryor by seventeen points. In addition to trying to scuttle the Iran talks, during the two months that Cotton has been in the Senate he has attempted to block the release of any more detainees held at Guantánamo, even though nearly half of them have been determined to pose no threat to the United States. Cotton’s recommendation was that the prisoners should “rot in hell.”","108","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"Something seems to be out of kilter in the political marketplace that yielded Tom Cotton. How are younger legislators with assets like military experience—something in too short supply in Congress—deployed and, more crucially, developed, and which talents are rewarded? In last year’s campaign, Cotton had to answer charges that he was “reckless.” Recklessness now seems to be treated as a charm. Extremism, clumsiness, anger—other Republican members of the Senate, with a few hundred years of tenure between them, took a look and jumped on board. What was so appealing? Or what were they afraid of?","109","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"John McCain told Politico, “I saw the letter, I saw that it looked reasonable to me and I signed it, that’s all. I sign lots of letters”—as if he didn’t have to worry about anyone actually reading them. McCain told Greta Van Susteren, of Fox, that the Iranians needed to know that Congress had a serious role, but conceded, with what might be taken as a hint of regret, that the letter “maybe … wasn’t the best way to do that.” Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, said that he wished that he could sign Cotton’s letter and that he hoped that other potential 2016 Presidential candidates would, too. Senators Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz, of course, already have.","110","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"
"Cotton reportedly lobbied the senators personally and strenuously. And yet perhaps it wouldn’t have taken much for someone to stop him. Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declined to sign the letter because he had been trying to organize a bill that would undermine the Iran talks in a more dignified way. (“I just don’t view that as where I need to be today,” he told Politico. “My goal is to get 67 or more people on something that will affect the outcome.”) His fellow-Tennessean, Lamar Alexander, told the Knoxville News-Sentinel that he was guided by his colleague’s expertise. Murkowski’s spokesman noted that she was co-sponsoring the Corker bill. It may be relevant that, last year, Thad Cochran, though by traditional measures an archconservative, was targetted by Tea Partiers during a bitter campaign that involved a break-in at his wife’s nursing home and a suicide. Then again, the non-signers might just have had a sensible conversation on the subject before saying yes. If that were the case, perhaps it’s no surprise that so many others signed. The odds of having a chance encounter with rationality in today’s Senate are vanishingly small.","111","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter"

"For decades, Barbara Ortiz Howard has owned an exterior-restoration business in Mount Vernon, just north of the Bronx; she is used to being the only woman among men. Several years ago, she began to think about another male-dominated part of her life, to which she had previously paid little attention: the portraits on U.S. banknotes. Each of the eleven denominations in circulation, from the one-dollar bill to the ten-thousand-dollar bill, depicts a man. They include eight Presidents (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, William McKinley, Grover Cleveland, and James Madison), two Treasury Secretaries (Alexander Hamilton and Salmon Chase), and the unclassifiable Benjamin Franklin. The people featured on the banknotes haven’t changed since 1929.","March 4, 2015","121","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"Howard, who is sixty-two years old, told me, “I grew up in the sixties and had strong feelings about women’s rights, and everyone’s rights. We marched against the Vietnam War and for civil rights and women’s rights back then.” Then she started a family and opened her business; she hasn’t been involved in serious activism for some time, other than canvassing for Hillary Clinton in 2008. In the summer of 2012, she began toying with the idea of trying to get a woman on a banknote, but she didn’t quite know where to start. She e-mailed some friends (“HI SISTERS!” her message began) to ask them which women they would put on bills if it were up to them.","122","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"

"Among the e-mail’s recipients was an old friend of Howard’s, Susan Ades Stone. Ades Stone is a journalist, and she saw the potential for a serious campaign. Together, Howard and Ades Stone decided to mount an organized effort to put a woman on a bill by 2020, the centennial of women’s suffrage. They settled on the twenty-dollar note, not only because of its resonance with the anniversary year but because they thought that Andrew Jackson was the best candidate for removal from U.S. currency. “George Washington and Abe Lincoln and Alexander Hamilton, who invented the Federal Reserve System”—technically, he created a predecessor to the system—“and Ben Franklin—they have a legacy that we’ve been honoring that would make them hard to remove,” Howard said. “But Andrew Jackson?” Jackson had strongly opposed the notion of central banking. Plus, he sought—and signed—the Indian Removal Act, which led to the expulsion of Native Americans from their homes.","124","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"Howard and Ades Stone registered their nonprofit, called Women on 20s, and recruited others, including a co-founder of the National Women’s History Project, to join the campaign. Over several months, they built a Web site, and started a Twitter feed and a Facebook page. On Sunday, Women on 20s began inviting people to visit the site and vote for their favorite candidates to replace Jackson on the twenty-dollar bill; the choices include Alice Paul, Betty Friedan, Shirley Chisholm, Sojourner Truth, Rachel Carson, Rosa Parks, Barbara Jordan, Margaret Sanger, Patsy Mink, Clara Barton, Harriet Tubman, Frances Perkins, Susan B. Anthony, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. The women were selected from a longer list of a hundred names based on their societal impact and the difficulties they faced in pursuing their goals.","125","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"It wouldn’t require a vote in Congress or Presidential approval to get a woman on the twenty-dollar bill. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for the designs that appear on paper notes, including the portraits. Nor do the people depicted on bills have to meet particularly stringent standards; according to U.S. law, they just have to be dead. Even so, the appearance of U.S. banknotes was hardly modified during the twentieth century; according to historians, this was partly to keep the bills recognizable and partly due to the American public’s resistance to change. “I think the choices of people on those bills, at this point, is more a tradition than it is a matter of consciously choosing these individuals,” Mark Tomasko, an expert on the history of currency, told me. He couldn’t recall any past campaigns to put a woman on a bill. Some Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have tried—and failed—to put Ronald Reagan on the fifty-dollar bill, replacing Ulysses S. Grant.","126","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"Ades Stone and Howard are already facing some controversy, and they haven’t even brought their idea to the government yet. It turns out that settling on fifteen finalists, let alone choosing a winner, is easier said than done. The list includes several black women and an Asian-American woman; some people have expressed disappointment that more minority groups aren’t represented. “We would have liked a more diverse list that would have included Native-American women and Latino women, but we weren’t going to just put people in to be representative,” Howard said. “They had to meet the criteria.” Ades Stone added, “We’ve had a few people comment that if we were kicking Andrew Jackson off the bill, he should be replaced by a Native American.”","127","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"Howard and Ades Stone hope to present the winning candidate to President Obama some time in the next several months, with the hope that he might help persuade the Treasury Secretary to sign off on a new twenty-dollar-bill design. (A spokesperson for the Treasury Department declined to comment on the campaign.) This might seem like a bit of a circuitous route, but Ades Stone believes that it will make for better P.R. She said, “We could approach the Treasury Secretary, but it’s much more compelling for the public to know that their wishes are being delivered to the President, and, if he wants it done, it’s within his power.” (Ades Stone and Howard have a feeling that Obama might be open to their suggestions, in part because of an offhanded comment he made in a speech last year about a young girl who had written to him asking why there aren’t any women on U.S. currency and offering a list of possible candidates. Obama said at the time that he thought this “was a pretty good idea.”)","128","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"I asked Matthew Wittmann, a curator at the American Numismatic Society, which is dedicated to studying currency, what he thought of the campaign’s chances. He told me, “2020 seems doable, and Jackson seems like the low-hanging fruit as Presidents on the currency goes, so I think they probably have a shot.” (He also pointed out that, in the nineteenth century, before paper bills became prevalent, most of the money in circulation were coins that did picture a woman: Lady Liberty. There have also been coins featuring Susan B. Anthony and Sacagawea, though they haven’t gotten much use.) When I spoke with Howard and Ades Stone on Tuesday, they were still waiting for their campaign to go viral; it had received some press coverage online—Vox and Buzzfeed had written about it—but hadn’t yet gained the traction they were hoping for. Howard brought up a dashboard that tracked how many people had cast votes on the site; the number had reached eight thousand five hundred and fifty-two. I asked how many total votes they had hoped for when they began the campaign; Ades Stone said, “We thought five million.” Howard pointed out that it was early—it hadn’t been seventy hours since the voting had opened. The suffragettes’ campaign, it’s worth noting, took seventy years.","129","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"In the mid-nineteen-nineties, Charles Grodin retired from acting and withdrew to Connecticut, to spend more time with his wife, Elissa, his young son, and a collection of life-size fibreglass animals—including a buffalo—that he installed in his back yard. He wrote books filled with lightly curmudgeonly anecdotes and began recording one-minute syndicated commentaries, about this and that, for CBS Radio, sometimes ending with the words “Oh, boy.”","130","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"But, a few years ago, when Grodin was in his mid-seventies, he began to act again: demand for his representations of pained, wincing men somehow overpowered his wish never to leave Wilton. For example, Grodin played a recurring character—an unsolicitous, if insightful, doctor—in the fourth season of “Louie.”","131","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"At eleven-thirty on a recent morning, Grodin was not far from his home, in the Red Barn restaurant, in the shadow of the Merritt Parkway. Staff members greeted him as “Mr. G.”; the hits of the Carpenters, including “Top of the World,” played on the sound system. Grodin—baseball cap, zip-up corduroy jacket, wan smile—said that he hadn’t been out to the movies in fifteen years. When he is offered work, “I never say, ‘How much?’ I say, ‘Where?’ ” He praised Louis C.K. for getting him home at a reasonable hour. Grodin then described his first day on “While We’re Young,” Noah Baumbach’s new comedy, in which he plays Ben Stiller’s father-in-law. Baumbach spent perhaps two hours shooting a brief scene in which Grodin has his bow tie adjusted by Naomi Watts. Quoting a remark made by the actor Joe Bologna during a visit to the Universal Studios theme park, Grodin asked Baumbach, “Who do you have to fuck to get off this tour?”","132","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"Grodin ordered a turkey club sandwich and described his garden animals. “I’m kind of on hold for a cow right now,” he said. He started his collection after a visit to United House Wrecking, in Stamford. “I decided—I don’t know why—that I was going to get a number of these. My wife looked at me. She calls it Chuck’s World.”","133","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"He went on, “That’s O.K., but then I wired them for sound. And it wasn’t the sound of a horse or a buffalo or an elephant or a dog—it was me doing different dialects. Like the buffalo has a Yiddish dialect. And the elephant is an upper-class English.” Impersonating his elephant, he said, “ ‘Have you been talking to Bob the buffalo?’ ” Each animal has only one short recorded speech. The loudspeakers are hidden in the undergrowth. Referring to the over-all effect, Grodin said, “It’s a good idea. I activate them with a remote control from a golf cart. I wouldn’t do it for myself; you’d only do it for somebody who’s never heard it. Here’s the horse: he goes, ‘Mr. Ed, Francis the Talking Mule, and I all studied with Strasberg. Fran is actually a talking horse, but he calls himself a talking mule. That’s his humor. Go figure.’ ” Grodin claimed that even the elephant is full-size, but then thought for a moment: “Well, I’m sure there are bigger elephants.”","134","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"Grodin, widely admired for his disobliging performances on late-night talk shows, once had dinner with Johnny Carson, who asked if he’d join him on an African safari. “He was serious. I have a place in Manhattan—I barely go there. I said, ‘Being in a tent with wild animals trying to get in at us?’ ” Grodin told Carson, on the air, about growing up within earshot of the Pittsburgh Zoo: Grodin would lie in bed, tell himself a joke, and wait for the hyenas to laugh. “Elissa saw that, and got an assignment from American Film to interview me, and within thirty minutes of the tape recorder being on I asked her to shut it off, and at the end of the next thirty minutes I was discussing marriage with her, and now we’ve been married thirty-three years.”","135","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"His wife had asked him to buy something for her printer. He also needed corduroy pants. After leaving the Red Barn—“So long, Mr. G.”—Grodin drove to a mall in Norwalk. In the car, he recalled that Cybill Shepherd, his co-star in “The Heartbreak Kid,” had mentioned in a memoir that they had once slept together. “I said, ‘Why would you put that in a book?’ She said, ‘You should be grateful I included you.’ ”","136","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"The men’s section in Marshalls disappointed him. “This is all lightweight,” Grodin said. “I don’t see anything flannel.” Walking across to Staples, he described his exercise regimen: “I used to have a treadmill that I would look at.” A young woman was wearing a red Staples uniform and a red Staples name tag. “You work here, right?” he asked her, and she laughed and pointed the way to the ink-and-toner wall. ♦","137","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"The first scene of “Other Space,” a new sci-fi sitcom by Paul Feig, which streams on Yahoo on April 14th, begins with one of the show’s central characters, a hapless spaceship captain named Stewart Lipinski, navigating the ship through an asteroid shower while eating a hot dog. On a Saturday last August, however, on the first day of casting, the script was in flux and the hot dog was still written as a banana. Allison Jones, the casting director, was reading the scene with actors trying out for the Stewart role, who faced a decision: audition with a real banana, or just pretend to eat one?","138","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones works out of a bungalow in the quaint Larchmont neighborhood of Los Angeles. The rooms of the house are airy and filled with mementos of her thirty-year-long career in Hollywood: bobble-heads of characters from “The Office,” which Jones cast; a bulletin board collaged with head shots. In the waiting room, next to the sign-in sheet, a bowl of candies and bubble gum greets nervous actors. The audition room is austere, with no windows and just two chairs. Jones hates asking her staff to work on weekends—“They don’t make enough money,” she said—so she was alone, with a video camera mounted on a tripod, reading lines as one aspiring Stewart after another passed through, four minutes apart. Most of the actors pretended to eat a banana, but some had brought in a real one, which suggested to Jones that they were trying a little too hard. Early in the day, a young man came in wearing suspenders over a Stanford T-shirt and with military ribbons taped to his chest. When he pulled a banana out of his pocket, Jones quietly sighed. A few moments later, it popped out of its peel and landed at Jones’s feet. This was nothing, she later told me; once, during an emotional table read, an actress accidentally punched her in the face.","139","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"In the early days of Hollywood, casting directors had little decision-making power. Most working actors were signed to individual studios, and casting mainly involved matching individuals to roles based on the actor’s availability and type. In the nineteen-sixties, as the studio system broke down, the influence of casting directors grew. Heavyweights like Marion Dougherty discovered young talent on Broadway and persuaded directors to hire such unknowns as Al Pacino, Paul Newman, and Robert Duvall. Jones began her career with the two-beats-and-a-punch-line sitcoms of the nineteen-eighties, but, in working with Feig and the director Judd Apatow, she was required to try something revolutionary: find comedic actors who, more than just delivering jokes, could improvise and riff on their lines, creating something altogether different from what was on the page.","140","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"In the process, Jones has helped give rise to a new kind of American comedy. In 1999, she cast Seth Rogen, James Franco, and Jason Segel in the critically acclaimed, poorly watched teen series “Freaks and Geeks.” The show, created and written by Feig and produced by Apatow, was a coming-of-age story set in the suburban Michigan of Feig’s youth. Jones won the show’s only Emmy, for her casting. Several years later, she met with a young, sweaty Jonah Hill, who was desperate for an introduction to Apatow. She told Apatow that Hill was weird and hilarious. That sufficed; Apatow expanded a cameo part for Hill in “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” as an odd but lovable eBay customer. Two years later, Hill was cast with Michael Cera in “Superbad,” a raunchy teen comedy that Apatow produced. It was left to Jones to find their nerdier-than-thou friend McLovin. Jones posted notices seeking high-school students in L.A. After seeing thousands of candidates, she caught a glimpse of a camera-phone head shot sent in by a sixteen-year-old named Christopher Mintz-Plasse. She called the director, Greg Mottola, and excitedly said, “I think I found McLovin; he’s like Dill from ‘To Kill a Mockingbird.’ ” Jones told me, “You could tell he was a kid who probably had seen the inside of a locker.” Since then, Mintz-Plasse has starred in six movies.","141","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“Allison doesn’t just find us actors; she finds us people we want to work with the rest of our lives,” Apatow said. “That’s good, because the older you get you don’t want to see tons of people. I know if Allison sends two they will both be great.” Feig said, “Years from now, she will be recognized as having changed the face of comedy as much as any comedy filmmaker. All the best comedy people have come through her or from her.” Jones did the casting for Apatow’s 2007 film, “Knocked Up,” and for Feig’s 2011 comedy, “Bridesmaids.” This summer, Feig will direct a remake of “Ghostbusters,” with all-female stars and a supporting cast assembled by Jones; already it’s the most highly anticipated comedy of 2016.","142","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones is in her fifties, and nearly six feet tall, with unruly curly hair. In jeans and blouses from Liberty, she comes across as someone’s favorite aunt. She met Feig more than twenty-five years ago, when he was a struggling actor, and their professional relationship deepened through their collaboration on “Freaks and Geeks.” In 2013, Feig reacquired “Other Space” from Twentieth Century Fox Television, where it had been stuck for years. Feig once described the show in the Times as a sci-fi version of “The Office.” The lead character, Stewart Lipinski, is a dorky twentysomething space commander. He is assisted by Karen, his sister, and Michael, his best friend, both of whom are miffed at having been passed over for the position. The other crew members are Kent, a wealthy humanoid who has wakened from a chemical bath; Tina, Stewart’s ditzy love interest; and Natasha, a Spock-like virtual sexbot and the ship’s operating system, who appears on a computer screen.","143","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"By the time Jones finishes reading a script, she already has ideas about which actors might be right for the roles—and who can handle the pressure of constantly improvising during the eighty-hour workweek that shooting a television comedy often requires. But she also likes the surprise of the unknown, and on the first day of casting she was wading through fifty or so candidates chosen from some nine thousand who had appealed to her in online head shots. She was looking in particular for “Paul Feig types,” well-meaning nerds who are endearing in their benevolent oddness. “She finds people that your heart can break for,” the actor Paul Rudd told me. By lunchtime, however, Jones hadn’t seen anyone worth showing to Feig. “They’re forcing it,” she said. “It’s not real. You’re either a nerd or you’re not.”","144","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Between auditions, to lift her spirits, Jones watched an old “Saturday Night Live” sketch of Will Ferrell spoofing James Lipton. At one point, she whispered, “I’m going to hit the ladies’ room and blow my brains out.” But she caught a glimpse of someone interesting in the waiting room, and when she came back her eyes were alight.","145","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"

"Nick Azarian was a mountain of hair nesting on a tiny, teen-age face. He carried a binder and wore a turtleneck with a space-camp sticker. As he walked in, a wide smile broke across Jones’s face. According to his IMDb résumé, Azarian, who is from Charlotte, was a “full-out power geek.” He told Jones that he’d found the shirt at Goodwill and printed the sticker himself.","147","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"

"“See? That’s the face we’re looking for,” she said. “A real face. You can’t fake that face. I’ll show him to Paul; he’ll find something for him.” She sighed dreamily. “That face!”","150","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“I don’t know why I’m drawn to nerds,” Jones told me recently over a burger at the Astro Burger, a restaurant near her office. Her face brightened and she pushed her glasses up on her nose. She admitted that on Valentine’s Day she had stayed up till 3 A.M. watching the Weather Channel, mesmerized by Jim Cantore’s dancing reaction to thundersnow. “I mean, why am I obsessed with the people on the Weather Channel? Because they’re so pure, nice, and nerdy. There’s nothing cynical about them.” For Jones, the definition of “nerd” is broad enough to include every Jack Lemmon role, Elaine May in her 1971 film “A New Leaf,” and Cecil Vyse, the benign but misguided character played by Daniel Day-Lewis in the Merchant Ivory adaptation of “A Room with a View.”","151","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"The category might also include Jones. When I told Apatow that I was writing about her, he asked, “What does she do outside of work? What are her hobbies? Please tell me, because I don’t know.” Jones is single and enjoys sewing. Sometimes she visits nephews and nieces on the Eastern Seaboard. Mostly, she works. “I’m the person that people forget they met,” she said. She lives in a modest house not far from her office, but she preferred not to show it. Instead, on the Saturday after the first day of casting, she offered a tour of her storage space, in Studio City. We drove there in her black Audi S.U.V. She opened a rattling, white sliding door to her space, revealing thirty years of boxes, files, and memorabilia.","152","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones grew up in Needham, Massachusetts, outside Boston, the second youngest of six children. Her father, an executive at John Hancock, loved Walter Matthau and hated John F. Kennedy; her mother managed the kids. Growing up, Jones watched quietly as her parents and her older siblings battled over Vietnam and long hair. “I was the fifth of six kids,” Jones said. “I didn’t want to make any adult pissed off. I’m still terrified of fucking up, because the business is a little bit of that same mentality—who do you blame for something that’s a failure? Gotta blame casting.”","153","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones credits her brothers with shaping her comedic tastes. One brother and his friends made up stories called “Christmas Tragedies,” for which they invented and recited straight-faced accounts of misery—Jones fondly recalled a bit in which a plane full of pregnant nuns crashes into an orphanage. “I admired so much how the boys could tell each other to fuck off without anyone getting mad,” she said. “The girls I knew got so sensitive. My brothers were not prim and proper.”","154","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"She enjoyed watching a “real but weird” local program called “Community Auditions,” a low-budget precursor to “American Idol,” in which amateurs would sing and perform, sometimes backed by a lumbering orchestra. Later, at Pomona College, in California, she and her friends watched the first episodes of “Saturday Night Live.” She loved comedy, but it seemed impractical; she earned an M.B.A. at U.C.L.A. and endured a year at a New York advertising firm, working on the Stroh’s beer account. She recalled a moment at business school when she froze just before she was due to give a presentation.","155","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“I just couldn’t do it,” Jones told me. “I got massive stagefright and started shaking. The next presentation, I did it from a humorous point of view, and then I could do it.”","156","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones returned to California and enrolled in the producer program at the American Film Institute. One of her early assignments was to cast another student’s adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov’s short story “The Potato Elf.” She showed me a file containing head shots and film memos from the project. “I rejected Anjelica Huston,” Jones said. “At that time, she was John Huston’s daughter, Jack Nicholson’s girlfriend, and a model. That was her claim to fame. Thirty years later, I still don’t know what I’m doing.” Jones confessed that she passed on Ryan Gosling for a pilot and chose not to bring Kristen Wiig back for a second audition for “The Office.”","157","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Her first significant job out of school was as a casting assistant on “Family Ties.” She soon realized the extent to which casting could make or break a show. There were spirited battles internally over whether Michael J. Fox was right for the role of the teen-age conservative Alex P. Keaton, with some executives arguing that he was too short and not charismatic enough. (Fox became the breakout star of the show.) In her downtime, she watched films and TV shows and, when the credits rolled, wrote down the names of promising comedians and actors. She showed me a tiny, tattered notebook that read, “Carson: 11/28/86 Ellen?” It was Ellen DeGeneres’s first appearance on the “Tonight Show.” (The next line read, “Ordered two salads from Mr. Pizza.”)","158","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones found regular work on “Family Ties” and “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” but she was also casting sitcom pilots. In one, a short-lived TV show called “Grand,” she had to cast the role of “wolf boy,” a teen-ager who was raised in the forest by wolves. The applicants included a young Leonardo DiCaprio. But Jones often chafed at working for the networks. One writer complained that DiCaprio and the other kids “looked too well-fed.” She brought in Jim Carrey for another project, but his mouth was deemed to be too big. Producers would insist that Jones call agents late at night and inform them that their client need not show up in the morning. She has had to fire Dane Cook and Pauly Shore. “Other Space” is part of Yahoo’s first wave of original programming, and its budget is a sliver of what “Ghostbusters” will spend. But, for Jones, part of the appeal is that it’s not a network show.","159","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“The networks micromanage so much that it just makes me fucking berserk,” she told me. “So I can’t do it. I’m just cranky all the time, and I hate being that way.”","160","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"In the nineteen-eighties, even smart comedies like “WKRP in Cincinnati” featured misfits who were nonetheless gorgeous. Through her casting, Jones has introduced actors who more closely resemble people in real life. She found Andy Buckley, Michael Scott’s boss on “The Office,” at a farmers’ market in L.A., several years after Buckley had given up acting to become a stockbroker. The “Office” character Phyllis, a feisty, heavyset saleswoman, is played by Phyllis Smith, who was not trained as an actor; for several years she had worked as Jones’s casting associate. In 2013, Jones cast Joe Lo Truglio, a nebbish comedian, as a detective alongside Andy Samberg on the police comedy “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” Lo Truglio had auditioned for Jones dozens of times in the past two decades. “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” won a Golden Globe Award for best comedy series during its first season.","161","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"In Studio City, Jones was still opening boxes and sifting through artifacts: green “Family Ties” coffee cups, a publicity photo of an adolescent Will Smith leaning between pillars, clippings from old TV Guides. I caught sight of a dusty spec script from the early nineteen-nineties that had the words “Seinfeld” and “Allison Jones” on it. I asked if she had written a script for “Seinfeld.” Jones tried to change the subject, then claimed that she could remember only the subplot, which turned on the idea that in 1985 Kramer had been aboard the Achille Lauro when Palestinian terrorists seized the cruise ship. It was Kramer, not the terrorists, who (accidentally) pushed Leon Klinghoffer overboard.","162","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jeff Garlin, a principal actor on “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and a longtime friend of Jones’s, later told me that he’d read the script. “It was hilarious,” he said, and added that she was instrumental in helping him write his 2006 comedy, “I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With.” “I always try to get her to write more. She is so talented.”","163","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones had shown the script to a couple of agents, one of whom told her, incorrectly, that she had misspelled “George Constanza.” “They had some stupid comments and I got discouraged, like an idiot,” she said. She once wrote spec scripts for “Family Ties” and “Murphy Brown,” but those also went nowhere, and she is no longer writing. She put the “Seinfeld” script back into a box and sealed it up. “I’m still really terrified, but not as afraid as I used to be.”","164","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"The files she turned up from “Freaks and Geeks” had a Dead Sea Scrolls feel about them—modern comedy at Year One. The show’s plot centered on three nerds and five burnouts; Apatow and Feig told Jones to find the kids that never get cast. Jones and her team saw hundreds of prospects in Los Angeles, New York, Vancouver, and Chicago. Feig and Apatow saw Rogen on tape and invited him to an open call in Vancouver, pegging him to play Ken, a sarcastic burnout. She spotted Segel, a handsome high-school basketball player, and cast him as Nick, a vulnerable drummer with a Rush obsession and a jackass dad. She remembered Franco from “1973,” a failed pilot that she had cast that year, and slotted him as Daniel Desario, a handsome but insecure James Dean wannabe.","165","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“When Jones found Jason, I didn’t know what to do with him,” Feig told me. “He wasn’t what I was looking for. Judd said the beauty is we can rewrite to fit these great people that Allison’s found.”","166","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"In late 1998, at a Los Angeles casting call, Jones met the ultimate Feig type: a gangly, freckle-faced kid named Martin Starr. “When Martin walked in, I remember thinking, Please, please be able to talk,” Jones said. He was cast as one of three freshman geeks trying to make it through the day without being humiliated. (He now stars on HBO’s “Silicon Valley.”) Later, Jones went on to cast Shia LaBeouf as a terrified school mascot and Lizzy Caplan as Segel’s disco-loving girlfriend. She spent weeks trying to get a script to a teen-age Scarlett Johansson. A very young Shailene Woodley auditioned, and Jones scrawled “very talkative” next to her name. The cast didn’t meet as a whole until the first table read, to go through the pilot script together. Feig, Apatow, and Jones saw the glimmers of a more realistic comedy, in which the laughs come from the human foibles of the nerds and burnouts who make up the cast. Feig has called it “pushed reality.”","167","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“It’s a sensibility,” he told me over breakfast one morning. “I don’t want anybody ever doing things where they feel fake, because that’s a kind of nineties style of comedy—‘Look how funny I am!’ ” He mentioned Dwight Schrute, the scheming but harmless salesman played by Rainn Wilson, on “The Office.”","168","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“Dwight’s a really crazy character,” Feig said. “But he so believes it, he’s so grounded, and he’s not winking at us. That’s what makes you go, ‘That’s hilarious.’ The key is finding people who have a natural governor. I can push them and push them and they won’t go into cartoon land.” Wilson was the first actor Jones saw when she was casting the show’s pilot. “Everyone is obsessed with ‘heat,’ who’s hot,” Jeff Garlin said. “But Allison has never cared about who’s hot, and she’s never changed what she thought was funny.”","169","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones’s collaboration with Apatow has given rise to a brand of “dude humor”—bumbling young guys who behave badly but have hearts of plated gold. “It’s a little strange, since they’re so much younger than me and talk so much about vaginas,” Jones said at one point. In the past couple of years, critics of Apatow have suggested that his work is misogynistic. Jones said that it just reminded her of her older brothers. Still, she looked forward to casting “Ghostbusters.”","170","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“It’s nice to get a break from the testosterone every once in a while,” she said. “I was thrilled to do ‘Bridesmaids’—it was a true ensemble of odd characters, all of whom I had observed in real life. There wasn’t one scene that called for a push-up bra. Most female descriptions in screenplays and TV scripts—and I am not kidding—are basically ‘astonishingly beautiful, even without makeup,’ and ‘brilliant.’ Never just beautiful, always astonishingly so.”","171","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"A few days after the first audition, Jones conducted another, for the part of Karen, Stewart’s sister in “Other Space”; she set up her video camera while her assistant, Ben Harris, took a seat and prepared to read with the actresses.","172","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"As the film industry has turned digital, the technical process of editing has become far less painful, but it has created more work. Many of the directors who collaborate with Jones shoot exponentially more film than a comedy in the nineteen-nineties might have. (For “Knocked Up,” Apatow shot the equivalent of more than a million feet of film, four times more than Ron Shelton shot in making the 1988 classic “Bull Durham.”) It has also made Jones’s ability to find prodigies more important, since so much of the film’s comedy emerges in post-production.","173","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"The Karen role was challenging: the character has been passed over for command in favor of Stewart, so she must be both crabby and funny. Jones had already seen half a dozen actresses when Milana Vayntrub sat down in the waiting room, wearing glasses and a prim plaid dress with a white collar. To break the tension in crowded audition rooms, Vayntrub told me, she likes to slurp water loudly from a cup, see who laughs, and befriend them. She was waiting alone for Jones, so she repeated a mantra from her acting coach: “I release and destroy my need to get this part. I am just here to tickle myself and play in these circumstances. This is not a scene; I am just going to behave as though it’s really happening.”","174","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Vayntrub was born in Uzbekistan and grew up in a Russian enclave of West Hollywood. Jones first saw her in 2014, at an audition for the Billy Crystal sitcom “The Comedians.”","175","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“Milana Vayntrub, how are you?” Jones asked.","176","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Vayntrub’s face scrunched up; Robin Williams had died the day before. “I’m kinda shitty, kinda sad,” she said.","177","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“I know, it’s just the most awful thing,” Jones said. “Just awful.”","178","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"That set Vayntrub at ease, she later told me: “I knew I could say that to her and that she was connected to me as a person and not just like a number.” She stumbled early in Karen’s monologue, when she tells Stewart that she feels that he’s always upstaging her. But she found her rhythm, pointing out that Stewart even won the part of Juliet over her in drama club, then improvised: “You were beautiful. For the record, you looked really great in the Juliet corset. The painted-on cleavage was a really nice touch.”","179","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones laughed along during Vayntrub’s four minutes, nodding encouragingly. Jones paused for a moment before the next audition. “I love her so much,” she said. “She has that energy.” But she thought Vayntrub was better for the role of Tina, Stewart’s love interest, and arranged for her to come back and read for that part.","180","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"The competition for Tina was already fierce. Earlier in the week, Jones had brought in a Korean-American actress named Susan Park, whom she noticed in a small part in the recent television version of “Fargo.” Park was born in Los Angeles to Korean immigrants. Her parents were supportive but doubtful of her career choice until her mother watched her in “Fargo.” Jones was eager for inside news about the show.","181","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“So they’re going to do a second season with a totally different cast?” she asked. “That’s so interesting.”","182","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"In the scene that Park was reading, Stewart tells Tina to chart a course into a new galaxy. Park played it spacey at first—she skipped a navigation class, she said, because the professor was a creep. Then she recalled that her boyfriend, Ted, had called the professor Commander Grabber, and she slowly dissolved into tears at how much she missed Ted. After a pause, Park spoke again, with mock gravity: “Hold on, something’s not right. Ted’s not my boyfriend.” Her chin began to quiver, then she blurted, “He’s my fiancé.” Her face took on a dreamy aspect. “I love that word.”","183","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones had Park do another scene. Auditions require an actor to switch moods far faster than is called for during actual filming. In the second scene, Park played Tina as a smart-ass; in one exchange, she asks permission to wear a sweatshirt so that the male crewmen won’t gawk at her. Karen, Stewart’s sister, replies that she has no sweatshirts. Park looked incredulous: “So you don’t have any ratty old condiment-stained sweatshirts? This is stunning to me.” Park shouted, with a head wag, “I know you go baggy. Don’t act like you don’t.”","184","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones laughed—she seemed genuinely entertained. Park said goodbye. Jones popped a piece of chocolate from the waiting room into her mouth.","185","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“Susan Park just gets it,” she said. “I’ve never seen someone play it so quiet and then be so fun. Actors think they have to play it big. Quiet works, too.”","186","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones worked on “Other Space” for a month; at the time, she was also casting the fourth season of “Veep,” with Julia Louis-Dreyfus. After a month, Jones had whittled a list of hundreds of actors down to fewer than two dozen. Jessie Henderson, Feig’s producing partner, and Owen Ellickson, the showrunner of “Other Space,” had begun watching during the middle rounds, and Feig sat in on the finals. Feig is gangly and tall, with boxy glasses; he arrived on a weekday afternoon in an English tailored suit with a Ralph Lauren tie and a pocket square. “The secret of life in the big city is wear a suit, because you can take a shit anywhere,” he said. “Folks are, like, ‘Hello, sir, welcome back!’ ”","187","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Extra chairs were brought into the audition room. Feig clicked off his phone and looked at Jones.","188","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“O.K., Jonesie, show me what you’ve got.”","189","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"One of the first actors to see Feig was Karan Soni, a young Indian-American actor whom Jones had met through another of her finds, Aubrey Plaza, a star of “Parks and Recreation.” Soni was from New Delhi; in his first attempt at acting, at the international prep school he attended, the instructor screamed at him that his robotic line reading in Molière’s “Tartuffe” was ruining it for everybody. Soni moved to Los Angeles and graduated from the University of Southern California. He had played a regular on “Betas,” a quickly cancelled Amazon show, and a large role in “Safety Not Guaranteed,” an indie film.","190","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Soni walked into the audition room wearing a button-down shirt. There were a lot of lines; to put him at ease, Feig told him that he could use his script.","191","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“No, I can never feel comfortable,” Soni said. “It’s not a good thing. Always better to be terrified.”","192","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"He read with Ben Harris, who was punchy from having recited the same lines so many times. At one point, Soni, as Stewart, gets on the intercom and tells the crew members to “holla if you hear me.”","193","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Harris, noting that the show is set in the twenty-second century, improvised his own line: “Really? Holla? That line is, like, a hundred and fifty years old.”","194","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Soni played along: “They’re into the past—it’s a whole movement. Hipsters never die. . . . Did you see the new iPhone 26? Apple does it again!”","195","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“That’s hilarious,” Feig said.","196","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"He had Soni do three scenes with different shadings. “See what his interpretation is when he’s being super cool and smooth,” Feig said at one point.","197","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Soni complied. He told a crew member about his crush on Tina and took the scripted line “The vibe between me and her is getting intense” and added, “I don’t usually sweat, but I sweat around her. She’s giving off the heat.” The crew member tires of his monologue; Soni riffed an apology: “What’s up with you? Have you been tanning? You look good.”","198","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"As Soni left, Feig shook his hand and told him that he was fantastic. A few seconds later, everyone exploded with laughter.","199","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Feig got up to take a break and gave Jones a thumbs-up on the way out.","200","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“Good find, Jones.”","201","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Some casting directors have been known to curse a director for not following a suggestion. Jones is less direct. “She doesn’t do it in a confrontational way,” Greg Daniels, who developed “The Office” and co-created “Parks and Recreation,” told me. “She does it with a lot of blinks and facial expressions.” Jones pushes actors for shows even if the part starts out small. Until Chris Pratt met with Jones, he was known only as eye candy on teen shows like “Everwood” and “The O.C.,” but in a meeting Jones saw an untapped comic side. She took him to Daniels for “Parks and Recreation.”","202","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“He was so good in the audition we had to rethink everything,” Daniels said. “The character”—the layabout Andy Dwyer—“was meant to be a complete asshole who was only around for a few episodes, so we had to rewrite all season long to take advantage of him.”","203","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones can be sneaky. She had long been a fan of the Chicago actor Nick Offerman and was impressed with his progress as a comedian. She brought him into the “Parks and Recreation” casting process early, but the producers were undecided. Jones waited a few weeks, then remarked, “Your instincts about Nick Offerman were good. Let’s bring him back.” The producers agreed, and Offerman went on to become the government-hating bureaucrat Ron Swanson, an anchor of the show.","204","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“They forget that shit, they see so many people,” Jones said. “I do that all the time.”","205","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones doesn’t share in a film’s profits; instead, she receives a flat fee of up to ninety thousand dollars. She cast “The Office” pilot for forty thousand dollars, and received a fraction of that for each episode, but receives nothing from reruns or digital sales of any of her shows. In the past, she has offered to take no money up front and just a tiny percentage of profit if a show does well, but producers have never taken her up on the deal. She noted that there’s still no Academy Award for casting. “Believe me, it’s sad for me that I have to still get a J. Crew shirt instead of a shirt from Barneys when I know that Jonah Hill is worth millions of dollars,” she said. “It’s not a bitter thing, but it’s just, like, ‘Ah shit, I’m doing something wrong.’ ”","206","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"After six weeks and several hundred auditions, it was time for Jones and Feig to finalize the cast for “Other Space.” The male leads began to settle into place. Soni was set for Stewart, and Eugene Cordero, a Filipino sketch comedian, for Michael, Stewart’s boyhood friend and downtrodden third-in-command. Neil Casey, a former “S.N.L.” writer, won the part of Kent, who has awakened from a deep saline bath, where he was kept in order to provide organs for his brother.","207","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Narrowing down the three women was a bigger challenge—an indication, Jones said, of how much the opportunities for women comics have improved in the past decade. “There have always been funny women—I mean truly funny, not fake funny. But now they are sought after, written for, and valued, not just as sidekicks or wise-cracking receptionists. Joan Rivers, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Melissa McCarthy are now truly culturally important.”","208","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Feig came back for a second day. Jones was pushing Vayntrub and Park for the parts of both Karen and Tina. But Park had just been cast in a Fox medical drama that was filming in Atlanta, “Red Band Society,” as the mother of a boy in a coma. Her taped auditions with Jones would have to suffice.","209","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Vayntrub was called back so that Feig could have her read again for Karen and for the third female part, Natasha, the ship’s bombshell and operating system. (Natasha worked previously on the Hooters casino space shuttle.) For the latter role, Vayntrub shook out her hair and wore a more revealing dress. She ably delivered a series of lines in which Natasha coyly begs for free will, but she didn’t seem quite right for the part. She exited, and Feig looked confused.","210","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“I thought she was going to read for Tina,” he said to Jones.","211","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Jones’s face reddened and she shot an e-mail to Vayntrub’s agent. The next day, Vayntrub came back, a mock pout on her face. Her hair was swept to the side, and her dress was a compromise between her uptight Karen look and the sultriness of Natasha. In the scene, Tina is being thrown a girls’-night-out party to help her get over her missing boyfriend, but she is uninterested. Vayntrub’s Tina perks up at the possibility of giving Karen a makeover, and then pauses.","212","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"

"Vayntrub nodded and tried again, improvising: “When I’m around you guys, I often feel very lonely. I’m bored. Things that interest you make me want to nap. I feel allergic to you guys.”","215","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Feig appeared to love the bit. As Vayntrub left the room, he gave her a wink. Initially, the casting of Soni had raised the question of whether Karen should resemble her brother, Stewart, but that concern had been put aside. “The show is set in the twenty-second century; it can be explained,” Jones said. “Let’s just go for the funniest people.”","216","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Another dozen or so women auditioned. Feig was enchanted by a woman named Conor Leslie. “She’s really good, and beautiful,” he said to Jones. By two-thirty, he was done. He, Ellickson, and Jones adjourned to another room to deliberate, and a few minutes later he said that he’d settled on the finalists: “Neil Casey for Kent. Maybe we’ll have Milana read with some people. Conor Leslie is literally good for any role. Karan Soni . . .”","217","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"

"Feig wrote down the name.","219","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"That Saturday, Feig e-mailed Ellickson and Jones with his choices: Soni as Stewart, Cordero as Michael, and Casey as Kent; Leslie as Karen, Vayntrub as Natasha, and a latecomer named Katherine Cunningham as Tina. Jones and Ellickson felt that Leslie would be hard to buy as the put-upon sister and persuaded Feig to switch her for Natasha and Vayntrub for Tina. Cunningham seemed too classically beautiful for the Karen role, so Feig switched to Rosa Salazar, a close friend of Vayntrub’s. Jones pressed for Susan Park as Tina, but Feig was unpersuaded.","220","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"“I just thought the way she underplayed Tina—she had this kind of weird delivery,” Feig told me later. “It was hysterical, but it just wasn’t quite the dynamic we needed for the Tina character, and it wasn’t quite right for the Natasha character. For this project, she fell kind of in the cracks.”","221","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"

"All that was left was to make the deals. Usually, this fell to network lawyers, but, because this was one of Yahoo’s first ventures into original programming, Jones was involved in the negotiating. At first, Yahoo budgeted ten thousand dollars per actor per episode for eight episodes, and added a clause prohibiting them from auditioning for other pilots until after Yahoo had decided whether to renew “Other Space” for a second season. “I told them they’re going to end up with community players from Long Beach at that rate,” Jones said.","223","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Eventually, the rate went up to between twenty thousand and thirty thousand dollars per episode for the main actors. Salazar had signed a movie deal with a studio, so Jones brought in Bess Rous, another of her favorites, for the role of Karen. Finally, the calls went out. When Vayntrub got the news, she was on a callback for a network comedy. She had been asked to return to audition for the producers. “They said, ‘For this callback, they really want you, they love what you did. They just want you to be sexier, dress a little sexier.’ I didn’t listen to that and wore exactly what I wore to the first audition. So I go, and it’s twelve men,” Vayntrub said. She joked, “And I was, like, no wonder you shits wanted me to wear a short skirt while I stand here in front of you.”","224","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Susan Park didn’t get a call, but when I told her that she’d been a finalist her eyes widened. “Just to know they think I’m good is amazing,” she said. “I mean, Allison Jones thinks I’m good. That means everything.”","225","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"On the Saturday after the casting for “Other Space” had been finalized, Jones was back at work, auditioning a long line of six- and seven-year-old girls for “Daddy’s Home,” an upcoming film with Will Ferrell. The day was hot, and the office air-conditioning was broken. For hours, the shiny, sweaty kids sat in grownup chairs, legs dangling, and delivered the same line: “I think it’s cute that he’s crying like a little bitch.”","226","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Between girls, Jones made notes. “You can tell the ones who have been coached by their parents,” she said. “They’re the ones making the dramatic gestures and moving out of the frame.”","227","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"
"Some of the girls looked terrified. To ease the tension, Jones began asking them what they planned to be for Halloween. “I’m going as Corpse Bride,” one said. “I’m a big fan of Tim Burton.”","228","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/the-nerd-hunter"

"Oh, to have been a fly on the wall at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee, or at Jeb Bush’s campaign office, when the latest opinion poll from Fox News came in over the weekend. It showed Donald Trump in first place, with twenty-five per cent of likely Republican voters backing him. Ben Carson, the surgeon-turned-politician, was in second place, with twelve per cent.

Governor Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, who not so long ago was vying with Bush for the lead, was in fifth place, and Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, tied in fifth place, with six per cent. Carly Fiorina, the businesswoman, was in seventh place, with five per cent.","238","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"These are pitiful numbers, but others did even worse. Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, and John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, whom many pundits hailed as the victors of the televised debate a couple of weeks ago on Fox News, were locked in a dismal embrace at four per cent. Kentucky senator Rand Paul and Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, both got three per cent. Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, one of the few Republicans to criticize Trump directly, scored zero per cent—yes, zero.","239","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"Come on, you might object,that’s just one poll. But it isn’t. On Tuesday, CNN released its latest poll of Republicans and independents who lean Republican, which showed remarkably similar results. Once again, Trump was way ahead of the field, at twenty-four per cent. Bush came in second, at thirteen per cent; Carson was in third, at eight per cent: Walker and Rubio tied for fourth, at seven per cent; Paul was in fifth place, at six per cent.","240","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"The establishment candidates, Bush included, fared a bit better in the CNN survey. But when you allow for sampling errors—plus or minus four per cent in the Fox poll, plus or minus 4.5 per cent in the CNN poll—there isn’t much difference in the results. Trump looms over everything, with the other candidates snapping around his ankles. It’s bit like Gulliver and the Lilliputians.","241","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"One possible interpretation of these figures is that we are witnessing a temporary phenomenon. At some not-too-distant point, Trump will blow up and the real business of electing a G.O.P. candidate will resume. Having argued along these lines myself a couple of weeks ago, I wouldn’t dismiss the argument, but it needs amending. The longer Trump stays in the race, the more damage he is doing to the Republican Party and its prospects of winning back the White House.","242","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"At this stage, he isn’t merely leading in the horse-race polls, which can change rapidly. His overweening presence is driving the G.O.P. toward policy positions, particularly on immigration, that make it virtually unelectable. As Karl Rove and other Republican strategists have realized since the late nineteen-nineties, the party’s future depends on attracting Hispanic voters in such battleground states as Colorado, Florida, and Nevada. Now, Trump is pushing a plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, deport undocumented immigrants, and deprive the children of undocumented parents the right to U.S. citizenship. And other G.O.P. candidates are following his lead.","243","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"Ted Cruz has praised Trump for focusing on immigration. On Monday, Scott Walker, said that he, too, would eliminate the automatic right to citizenship for children born to undocumented immigrants. Yet another candidate who is struggling in the polls, Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, said the same thing on Twitter. About the only Republicans who pushed back publicly against Trump’s immigration proposal were Carly Florina, who said it was “completely unrealistic”; Lindsay Graham, who described it as “gibberish”; and Kasich, who bravely defended the idea of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, calling them “a very important part of most of our communities.” Jeb Bush, who also supports a path to citizenship, was conspicuously quiet.","244","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"Perhaps that’s not surprising. The problem that candidates like Bush and Kasich face is that it’s not just Trump’s celebrity and outspokenness that are attracting support. Many Republican voters say they like Trump on the issues, as unrealistic as his proposals are. When CNN’s pollsters asked Republicans which candidate could best handle illegal immigration, forty-four per cent of them said Trump. Bush came in second, with just twelve per cent.","245","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"Just as alarming for the G.O.P. establishment is the fact that the party’s supporters also ranked Trump highest in handling other important matters. On the economy, he led Bush by forty-five per cent to eight per cent. (Fiorina came in third place, with six per cent.) On handling ISIS, Trump’s lead was a bit smaller, but he still got thirty-two per cent compared to Bush’s sixteen per cent. (Cruz came in third here, with six per cent.)","246","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"You didn’t misread the previous paragraph. When asked which candidate in their party could best deal with the threat of Islamist terror, a plurality of Republicans overlooked four sitting senators, three sitting governors, and seven other candidates who in the past have held elected office, in order to opt for a blabbermouth from New York whose foreign-policy and national-security experience consists of hosting golf events in Scotland (where he presumably avoids handshakes so as not to contact germs).","247","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"To repeat: it is still early, and no one should underestimate Trump’s capacity to implode. But if his campaign goes on like this for much longer, the G.O.P. could be forced to resort to the same tactic that the Lilliputians used on a visitor who had outstayed his welcome, and put him on trial for treasonous acts. That’s impractical, sure, but Republican leaders would be overwhelmed with delight if Trump, like Gulliver, decided to return from whence he came.","248","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"As you may have heard, two more candidates have entered the G.O.P. primary contest: Ben Carson, the famous neurosurgeon from Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, who turned to conservative politics a few years ago, and Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard.

Beyond these eight lie a host of maybes, wannabes, and long shots. They include the former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum and the former Texas governor Rick Perry, both of whom lost to Mitt Romney in 2012; John Kasich, the governor of Ohio; Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana; Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina; Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey; and Donald Trump, the governor of Trump Tower and a bunch of upscale golf resorts.","250","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"

"If your head is spinning, join the club. Nobody should be expected, or forced, to keep up with every detail of the G.O.P. primary, especially when, Lord help us, we still have more than eight months to go until the Iowa caucuses. At this stage, the important thing to remember is that there are really two spectacles taking place: a high-stakes horse race for the Republican nomination, and a circus held on the infield of the track. Although the events run concurrently, and are ostensibly geared toward the same end, they shouldn’t be confused with one another. One is a serious political contest. The other is a sideshow, designed to amuse the spectators, give the media something to cover, and further the ambitions, varied as they are, of the participants.","252","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"Ostensibly, the G.O.P. field looks confusing and wide open. In many polls, nobody gets the support of even twenty per cent of potential Republican voters. But if you allow for some variability from survey to survey, a distinctive pattern has emerged. The Real Clear Politics poll of polls, which combines data from many individual polls, shows that Bush has been in the lead for most of the past six months, and that he’s still ahead, with a polling average of 15.5 per cent. Rubio has been gaining ground since he announced his candidacy three weeks ago, and is now in second place, at 14.3 per cent. Walker, who enjoyed a surge earlier this year, is now in third place, with 12.8 per cent.","253","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"Appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, the horse race is settling down, with Bush as the front runner, Walker and Rubio tucked in behind, and Paul and Cruz further back. A new survey, by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, confirms this picture—indeed, it suggests that the front runners may be pulling a bit further ahead. The poll showed Bush at twenty-three per cent, Rubio at eighteen per cent, and Walker at fourteen per cent. Paul and Cruz were both at eleven per cent.*","254","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"Huckabee could yet emerge as a sixth serious contender. A fixture on conservative television and radio, the Arkansan will pick up votes from evangelical Christians, although it’s hard to see him expanding much beyond that demographic. The rest in the field look as though they are destined for the circus. Of course, one of them could still burst through the rails and join the front-runners, as Herman Cain did for a time in 2011. But the polls, the money, and the political topography are against them.","255","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"The ultra-conservative end of the field is already crowded, with Walker, Paul, and Cruz competing against each other, and Huckabee and Carson about to join them. Carson, an African-American who grew up in a poor family in Detroit, has a compelling personal story to tell, and his message of small government and self-reliance goes over well with many Republicans. But the long buildup to his campaign launch has been marked by a series of inflammatory statements, including one, while he was discussing same-sex marriage, in 2013, in which he equated gays with members of NAMBLA, the North American Man/Boy Love Association. (He later apologized.) And in March of this year, he said that being gay is a choice, and added, “A lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they’re gay.’ ” It’s not clear whether Carson has been deliberately outrageous in order to attract the attention of right-wing talk-show hosts, or whether he is just gaffe-prone. In either case, he is looking increasingly like a fringe candidate.","256","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"The moderate-conservative end of the G.O.P. field has a bit more space open than the conservative end. With Chris Christie’s candidacy snarled up in the Fort Lee traffic, Bush and Rubio are the two leading contenders in this part of the spectrum—although, as I’ve noted before, it’s far from clear that either of them deserves to be called a moderate. Potentially, there is room for an avowedly non-ideological candidate who can reach across party lines, and Fiorina may be aiming to occupy it. Since entering politics, she has adopted conservative positions on issues such as climate change, same-sex marriage, and eliminating the estate tax. In the campaign video announcing her candidacy on Monday, however, she didn’t focus on any of these things. Instead, she attacked Hillary Clinton, but also, by extension, many of her Republican rivals, saying, “Our founders never intended us to have a professional political class…. If you’re tired of the sound bites, the vitriol, the pettiness, the egos, the corruption… then join us.”","257","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"As the only woman likely to enter the G.O.P. field, and a possible foil for Clinton, Fiorina is guaranteed to receive some media attention. Her challenge is that many people don’t think she has much of a record to run on. If this were 1998, when she was a senior executive at Lucent Technologies, and Fortune magazine named her as the most powerful women in business, she would be in better shape. However, her tenure as Hewlett-Packard’s C.E.O., from 1999 to 2005, was widely criticized, and ended with the board of directors forcing her out (albeit with the consolation of a twenty-million-dollar golden parachute). In 2010, she ran for the U.S. Senate in California, and Barbara Boxer beat her handily. During the campaign, the Los Angeles Times reported that Fiorina hadn’t voted in numerous elections. She apologized, saying, “Shame on me.”","258","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"Currently, Fiorina is running dead last in the G.O.P. polls, but she was visited New Hampshire on Monday, attending a luncheon with local lawmakers and pressing the flesh. In the early stages of Presidential races, hope springs eternal. And even if things don’t work out for her campaign, it will probably help her sell some books. As it happens, she’s got a new one that is being released on Tuesday: “Rising to the Challenge: My Leadership Journey.”","259","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"

"“Get a warrant! Get a judge to sign the warrant!” Senator Rand Paul, of Kentucky, shouted, about a quarter of the way through the first Republican Presidential debate, last night in Cleveland. His target was New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, but one might be forgiven for thinking that he was warding off some unseen men, equipped with handcuffs or straitjackets, come to take him—or possibly another of the ten candidates on the stage—away. But which one? The debate, hosted by Fox News, Facebook, and the Ohio G.O.P., was supposed to bring on a winnowing of the field. That doesn’t seem to have happened. No candidate looked dominant—not Donald Trump, who talked about all the politicians he had bought (“When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me. … With Hillary Clinton, I said, ‘Be at my wedding,’ and she came to my wedding”), and not Jeb Bush, with his uncomprehending answers about his family connections (“Maybe the barrier—the bar’s even higher for me”). The minor candidates solidified their toeholds; the field even seemed to expand, as the moderators played a video clip of Carly Fiorina, who was seen as the winner in the earlier debate among seven low-polling candidates who didn’t make the cut for the prime-time stage. At one point, the candidates were asked whether God spoke to them directly. This could go on for a long time.","August 7, 2015","266","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"Trump did make it clear that, if Trump were the nominee of the Republican Party, he would support Trump. The debate opened with a call for candidates to raise their hands if they couldn’t commit to supporting whoever the Republican nominee might be and who might consider running as an independent. It yielded what was, no doubt, the intended result: Trump, stage center, standing alone, hand raised, wondering why he should “respect” anyone given his position in the race. (“I’m, you know, talking about a lot of leverage.”) Maybe that’s when he decided that the moderators didn’t like him. Megyn Kelly asked about his tendency toward misogynistic insults: “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals.’ ” Trump interrupted to say that it was “only Rosie O’Donnell”—an unparalleled moment in drive-by ad-hominem debate attacks. But O’Donnell (who tweeted, “try explaining that 2 ur kids”) wasn’t the woman in front of him, and so, after barking something about political correctness, he said, “And honestly, Megyn, if you don’t like it, I’m sorry. I’ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me.”","267","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"Kelly smiled. A few minutes later, she asked Scott Walker about his opposition to abortion even in cases when the mother’s life was in danger. “Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion?” she asked. Walker equivocated, essentially insisting that such a choice never really came up. But then there was never a moment in the debate that Walker really seized. (On Russia: “You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage: you probe with bayonets. When you find mush, you push. When you find steel, you stop.”) Walker, who has ranked ahead of Bush (though behind Trump) in some polls, may have had the most to gain in the debate. Instead, he plodded along, even as the abortion discussion veered into anti-choice one-upmanship, with Huckabee invoking “DNA schedules” as a reason to give fetuses Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Trump said that he’d “evolved” from the pro-choice views he’d held in the nineteen-nineties, in part because he had some friends who “were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn’t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar.”","268","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"But where were the debate superstars? Cruz was more like a lava lamp. He seemed so oleaginous as he outlined hidden Iranian plots, and yet he has a core of fans who consider him profound; its members will be pleased with how he did. Cruz was upset that President Obama hadn’t defended crusaders and the Inquisition. Paul was upset that Christie had hugged Obama. Christie said that his more memorable hugs had been with the families of 9/11 victims. He also said that it was “completely ridiculous” for Paul to talk about limiting the National Security Agency’s surveillance of ordinary Americans. Christie wasn’t alone. When Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon, was asked whether he would countenance waterboarding, he said that “what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business,” as though there were no international Convention Against Torture, or simple ethical constraints. Huckabee said, “The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is kill people and break things.”","269","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"The most fractured rhetoric on the purpose of American military action, though, came from Bush, and in a way that shows his weakness as a candidate. Kelly asked him how he could look at the families of soldiers who’d died in Iraq “and say that your brother’s war was a mistake.” His answer had a stream-of-consciousness quality to it. Bush mentioned twice how difficult it had been for him to talk to families of soldiers in Florida (“It was really hard to do”), said that Obama shouldn’t have left Iraq, and ended with something like a non sequitur about how “to honor the people that died, we need to—we need to—stop the—Iran agreement, for sure.” He has been asked this question, in one form or another, more times than there are Republican candidates in the primaries. He still doesn’t have an answer.","270","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"Is it Trump’s fault that Bush comes across as well-mannered but nebulous? Trump does encourage brute branding. When one of the moderators said, “Mr. Trump, Obamacare is one of the things you call a disaster,” Trump corrected him: “Complete disaster.” But the other contestants seemed able to figure out what character they are playing in this reality show—Bush hasn’t yet, given that the role of “undisputed front-runner” doesn’t seem to be available. Rubio, for example, talked brightly about how Hillary Clinton wouldn’t be able to “lecture” him; he’s kept himself in for another few rounds. Rubio also suggested that anyone who complained about his lack of experience was aiding the enemy, since Clinton would win a “résumé competition.” The G.O.P. primary race certainly isn’t one of those. It is a collection of niche candidates, and the niches are so entrenched that it is hard to imagine how they will be shaken out. There is even a semi-sensible niche, occupied in this debate by John Kasich, the governor of Ohio. He made obvious points that have eluded many in his party: about not turning down Medicaid money that could help people in his state, or how, if he learned that his daughters were lesbians, his love for them would be what it always was: “unconditional.” The audience cheered for that. But it also cheered when Huckabee complained about the military trying to accommodate transgender soldiers. Bush, meanwhile, tried to explain who he was by citing nicknames others had given him. He boasted about being known as “Veto Corleone,” and later said, “In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it.” How do you earn a Jeb? And how is Jeb going to earn this nomination?","271","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"“Our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid,” Donald Trump said, surrounded by leaders and politicians. A sign that the system was broken, he said, was how many of them listened to him politely—“You know, most of the people on this stage I’ve given to, just so you understand, a lot of money.” Apart from Rand Paul, the other candidates left the task of going after him to the moderators. (Afterward, Trump complained that Kelly “behaved very badly.“) Chris Wallace, of Fox, pressed Trump on the bankruptcy of four businesses that had been associated with him. Trump responded by offering up the sort of knowing assertions about how the system is rigged, which he tosses out to his supporters like coins. “I’m not going to name their names because I’m not going to embarrass, but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they’ve used the law. … When I use it, it’s like, ‘Oh, Trump, Trump, Trump.’ ”","272","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"And more Trump. Before the bankruptcy question was done with, he’d insulted Atlantic City, saying of his creditors, who’d lost a billion dollars, “These lenders aren’t babies. These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, O.K.?” Trump is here to confirm your fears, about killers and criminals, both among people in business or those trying to cross the border—“If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even be talking about illegal immigration”—and then to offer something shiny. The wall that he’d build along the length of the border (“Mexico’s going to pay for it,” he told Bill O’Reilly last week) could, he said, have “a big beautiful door”—a classy one, no doubt. After the debate, Trump told Fox News’s Sean Hannity, “We had such a great crowd, and they really agreed with what I said,” which is a measure more of his gleeful shamelessness than the debate’s reality. Trump is having fun; he’s not about to leave. He’s ready to earn his Donald.","273","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"A couple of weeks ago, I was driving along the Belt Parkway, listening to Sean Hannity’s radio show, when the right-wing commentator said something that surprised me about the ever-expanding field of Republican primary candidates.

"Hannity’s fears have proved to be well grounded. On Wednesday, the former senator Rick Santorum, who had been the runner-up to Mitt Romney in the 2012 G.O.P. primary, announced his candidacy. On Thursday, it will be the turn of George Pataki, the former governor of New York. Who knows whom Friday will bring? Lindsey Graham? Rick Perry? Donald Trump? Herman (999) Cain? Ted Nugent?","275","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"Here, in alphabetical order, are the eight Republican candidates who, by Thursday, will be officially running: Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, Pataki, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Santorum. Then there are Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, two front-runners who have all but announced that they are in. Currently in the “exploratory” stage, we have Graham, Trump, Bobby Jindal, John Kasich, and the benighted Chris Christie. That makes fifteen, with other outlying possibilities, too.","276","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"The number turns out to be too high for Roger Ailes, Hannity’s boss at Fox News. The network (along with Facebook) is set to host the first televised G.O.P. debate, in Cleveland, on August 6th, and it has said that it intends to limit participation to the top ten candidates in the polls, plus those who are tied. “It was a difficult call based on political necessity,” Howard Kurtz, the veteran media reporter, who now works for Fox, explained in a post on Tuesday. “With 17 or 18 Republicans gearing up to run, you simply can’t have a viable debate with all of them. Each candidate would receive a miniscule amount of time. No sustained questioning would be possible. And it would be bad television.”","277","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"Not everyone associated with the Republican Party is happy about Fox’s decision. Appearing on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Wednesday, Bill Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard, accused Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, of colluding with Fox to cull the field prematurely. “There are fourteen candidates who are serious people,” Kristol said (doubtless prompting a protest call from Trump). “I think they all deserve to be on the stage.” He proposed that they have two debates, with the candidates split up randomly. “Republicans would be interested. They wouldn’t turn off the TV halfway through.”","278","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"Kristol raises a good point. If Fox applied its proposed criteria on the basis of current polling data collated by Real Clear Politics, Santorum, who won eleven state primaries in 2012, would barely make the cut. Fiorina, the only female candidate, who has reportedly impressed Republican audiences in Iowa and New Hampshire, would miss out. So would Graham, Jindal, and Kasich, all experienced elected officials. That doesn’t seem fair, or even particularly democratic. So what to do?","279","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"The G.O.P. needs a procedure that affords all of the candidates an opportunity to impress while also acknowledging that voters (and viewers) can’t be expected to take all fifteen or twenty candidates seriously. One solution might be to turn the early stages of the G.O.P. primary into a version of “Survivor,” the long-running reality-television series.","280","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"Here’s how it could work. Following Kristol’s suggestion, Fox and Facebook would hold two debates on August 6th, with the candidates drawing lots to decide whether they appeared on the first or the second one. Each would receive the same amount of airtime, and the questions in the two debates would be broadly similar.","281","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"For the second debate, which CNN is scheduled to host from the Reagan Library, in Simi Valley, on September 16th, things would be different. A limit of twelve candidates would be imposed. Rather than follow the “Survivor” template literally, and have the candidates themselves decide who gets to appear at the debate and who doesn’t, it would be best to rely on surveys of likely Republican voters. The top dozen candidates in the poll of polls on September 9th, a week before the debate, would make the cut; everybody else would miss out. I’d leave it to the network executives and the R.N.C. to decide whether this debate would need to be split in two, like the first one. (CNN has suggested an alternative format for its event, using the full slate of candidates, in which the top ten candidates appear in one debate and the rest in another.)","282","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"The winnowing process wouldn’t end there. For the third debate, which will take place in October, there would be another cut, to ten candidates, with the poll of polls again deciding who is invited. And for the fourth debate, in November, there would be a final cut, to eight candidates.","283","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"By that stage, the G.O.P.’s Iowa caucus would be on the horizon—it’s now slated for February 2nd, but may well move up a bit—and the field might be starting to narrow of its own accord, regardless. But for now, and for the next few months, there are too many candidates, and some way of treating them equitably needs to be found.","284","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"My solution perhaps isn’t the best. Quite probably, it would favor candidates who have raised enough money to launch advertising campaigns and boost their poll numbers—but the current system does that anyway. Another possible objection is that focussing attention on the minor players would blur the message of the front-runners. I doubt that would happen. Bush, Rubio, and Walker would still get the bulk of the media’s attention.","285","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"

"If you’re following the 2016 Presidential campaign closely (and, at this early stage, I’m not suggesting that’s necessary), you’ll find an interesting subplot. While much of the media is focussing on the rise of Donald Trump and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders, the two pre-race favorites, Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, are continuing to focus on each other. At the start of this week, the Clinton campaign put out a video highlighting what it said were Bush’s “extreme ideas about immigration” and claiming that he was following Trump’s lead. On Thursday, the Bush campaign released a video highlighting Clinton’s e-mail travails and promoting Bush’s upcoming e-book, ”Reply All,” which will contain some of the e-mail exchanges he had when he was the governor of Florida.","August 27, 2015","287","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"It’s pretty clear what’s going on here. The seasoned operatives running both campaigns are operating on the assumption that, six or seven months from now, Jeb and Hillary will both be on their way to securing the nominations of their respective parties, after which they will face each other in a general election. The Trump tornado will have blown itself out. Sanders will have maxed out his support among progressive Democrats. Order will have been restored, and it will be Bush versus Clinton, after all.","288","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"On the Democratic side, arguably, this strategy of playing a long game makes sense. Clinton, despite recent slippages—notably in New Hampshire, where two successive surveys have shown Sanders ahead of her—retains a big lead in the national polls. For example, a Quinnipiac University survey of likely Democratic voters released on Thursday showed Clinton at forty-five per cent and Sanders at twenty-two per cent.","289","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"As my colleague Ryan Lizza pointed out in a post arguing that Vice-President Joe Biden can’t win the nomination, Clinton also has the support of a majority of elected Democrats, which, in the past, has been a good predictor of success. I’m a bit less convinced than Ryan that a Biden campaign would be a no-hoper. In the Quinnipiac poll, he came in third, at eighteen per cent—not bad for someone who isn’t even a candidate yet. But there is no doubt that, right now, Clinton is the strong favorite. Most British bookmakers, where people wager real money on these things, have the odds of her getting the nomination at one to three or one to four. This implies that bettors put the probability that Clinton will prevail at seventy-five or eighty per cent.","290","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Bush’s campaign, on the other hand, appears to be in free fall. His poll numbers are tanking, his message is blurred, his verbal stumbles are multiplying, and his money men are reportedly getting nervous. In the betting market, he remains the favorite to get the G.O.P. nomination, but at some of the sites his odds have slipped to seven to four, which implies that the probability of his winning is about a third. Rather than worrying about Clinton, Bush and his strategists desperately need to find a way for him to counter his Republican rivals—not just Trump, whose whirlwind campaign would be difficult for any regular politician to deal with, but Marco Rubio, John Kasich, and Carly Fiorina, any of whom could conceivably end up supplanting him as the moderate conservative candidate. (I use “moderate” in a relative sense. All of the G.O.P. candidates, Bush included, are solidly on the right.)","291","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Until Memorial Day, when Trump wasn’t yet in the race, Bush was polling in the mid-teens—enough to keep him in or close to the lead. The new Quinnipiac poll has him at seven per cent, sharing third place with Rubio and Cruz. That’s just one survey, of course, but the Real Clear Politics poll average also shows him dropping into single figures, at 9.8 per cent. And it’s not just the national polls that are bringing bad tidings. In Iowa, Bush is tied, with Rubio, for sixth place—yes, sixth—behind Trump, Ben Carson, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, and Fiorina. In New Hampshire, he is in third place: Kasich, who is making a big effort there, has moved ahead of him (with both of them well behind Trump). In South Carolina, too, Bush is in third place, behind Trump and Carson. Based on these numbers, it appears that he could fail to win any of the first three primaries, leaving him acutely vulnerable going into the Nevada caucus and Super Tuesday.","292","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Of course, these numbers will change over the next few months. But they are unlikely to move in Bush’s favor unless he hones his message and stops tripping over himself. What does he stand for? Going into the campaign, it seemed pretty straightforward: competence, conservative economics, and a shift toward the center on immigration and other social issues. But in none of these areas has he really delivered. His verbal clangers have made him look like a gentleman amateur, rather than a seasoned politician capable of taking down a Clinton or a Biden. Beyond some sunny rhetoric about boosting the G.D.P. growth rate to four per cent a year, his economic plan remains largely undefined.","293","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Perhaps most alarming of all, Bush seems unsure whether he truly represents a break with the xenophobic, homophobic, modernity-loathing wing of the Republican Party. He has allowed Kasich, in particular, to position himself as a plausible, electable alternative. (One telling example: while Bush is running away from the Common Core education standards, which he previously backed, and which many conservative Republican activists hate, Kasich is still supporting them.)","294","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Meanwhile, the gaffes keep coming. Every week, it seems, Bush or a member of his staff has to try to walk back one of his public comments. Most recently, he suggested, after using the term “anchor babies,” that he was referring not to children born in the United States to Hispanic parents but to those born to Asian parents. That hop from the frying pan into the fire allowed Trump, of all people, to accuse him of being offensive. And it’s not merely that Bush appears to have inherited the family weakness for malapropisms. He seems incapable of saying anything snappy or memorable. With Trump regularly tearing him to shreds in interviews and on Twitter, the best he can manage in response are statements like “Mr. Trump doesn’t have a proven conservative record.”","295","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"As long as Trump’s campaign seemed likely to fade quickly, staying above the fray was a defensible strategy. It jibed with the old edict “Never wrestle with a pig. You get dirty and, besides, the pig likes it.” But things have moved on, and it’s clear that Trump isn’t going away anytime soon. Moreover, Trump is a typical bully, and so, as long as he senses weakness on Bush’s part, he will continue to torment him with comments like “Jeb Bush is a low-energy person,” or, as he put it in Alabama last weekend, “a very, very low-energy person.”","296","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Surely, it is time for Bush to strike back—not merely to defend himself but to speak on behalf of his party, which, as George Will warned on Wednesday, in the Washington Post, sees its chances of winning the White House retreat with “every sulfurous belch from the molten interior of the volcanic Trump phenomenon.”","297","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"But wait, you may ask, hasn’t Bush already tried that? He has. On Monday, he went to Texas to denounce Trump’s heartless and impractical immigration plan. We saw how well that went; it was the site of his attempted clarification about “anchor babies.” The next morning, Judy Chu, the California representative who heads the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said that Bush’s comments demonstrated that he was “not fit for the Presidency.”","298","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"

Monday’s other poll, from Fox News, produced very similar numbers. It also showed Trump with twenty-six per cent of the vote; Bush had fifteen per cent, and Walker had nine per cent. The two polls released on Tuesday were in the same vein. A CBS News survey showed Trump with twenty-four per cent, Bush with thirteen per cent, and Walker with ten per cent.

"I’ll start with the new Monmouth University poll numbers, which suggest that Trump is drawing support from across the Republican spectrum. While some of his pitch, such as his comments critical of Mexican immigrants, appears designed to curry favor with Tea Party supporters and other right-wing ultras, he’s also saying something, or doing something, that appeals to Republicans who don’t think of themselves as staunch conservatives.","303","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Among Republicans who self-identify as “very conservative,” he’s leading his closest challenger, Walker, by twenty-seven per cent to sixteen per cent—an eleven-point gap. Among “somewhat conservative” G.O.P. supporters, he is leading Bush by twenty-two per cent to fourteen per cent—an eight-per-cent gap. And, among “moderate to liberal” Republicans, he is ahead of Bush by twenty-eight per cent to twenty per cent—also, an eight-per-cent lead.","304","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Trump’s appeal also extends across most major demographic groups, the Monmouth poll found. Among Republican voters aged fifty and up, he is leading Bush by eleven percentage points and Walker by fourteen points. Among G.O.P. voters under fifty, his lead is even bigger: sixteen percentage points over Bush and seventeen points over Walker. As might have been expected, he has a big lead among Republican men: about twenty percentage points. But he’s also picking up considerable support among Republican women: twenty per cent said that they supported him, compared to twelve per cent for Walker and eleven per cent for Bush.","305","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Numbers like these make it difficult to pigeonhole Trump as the right-wing protest candidate, or as the tribune of any particular group. “Republican support for Donald Trump just continues to grow with no clear sense of who his constituency really is,” Patrick Murray, who directs the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement accompanying the release of the poll results. “This makes it very difficult for his opponents to figure out how to take him on in the upcoming debate.”","306","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Obviously, that is good news for Trump, but the polling data also contain some less encouraging signs for him. According to the latest survey from Quinnipiac University’s polling unit, which came out late last week, fifty per cent of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Trump, and thirty-three per cent have a negative opinion. If you subtract the latter figure from the former one, you get get a “net positive” rating of seventeen per cent. Far from placing Trump at the front of the G.O.P. field, this figure suggests that he is in thirteenth place, sandwiched between John Kasich and Chris Christie.","307","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"According to this metric, Marco Rubio is leading the G.O.P. race, with a net positive rating of sixty-one per cent. Walker is in second place, with fifty-five per cent, and Bush is in third place, with fifty per cent. Of course, if Trump performs well in the debates and avoids any major slip-ups, his numbers could improve. But the reason that political professionals monitor this figure closely is that it often indicates the amount of upward (and downward) potential a candidate has. Once negative impressions get entrenched, they are tough to shift, and, relative to most of the other candidates, Trump already has fairly high negative ratings among Republican voters. (Among the electorate as a whole, his negatives are much higher—the highest of any candidate in either party—but that’s not the point here.)","308","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"As the campaign unfolds and scrutiny of Trump increases, historic precedent suggests that his negative ratings will rise further. That doesn’t mean that he can’t win the nomination or put up a strong showing. It does suggest that it might be worth recalling the fate of previous candidates who have surged to the front of the G.O.P. field in the summer before election year.","309","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"In early August of 2007, Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who is a friend of Trump, was leading in some of the G.O.P. polls, and one of his closest competitors was Fred Thompson, a former Republican senator from Tennessee, who hadn’t yet officially announced his candidacy. For example, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey of likely Republican voters showed Giuliani at the top, with thirty-three per cent, and Thompson in second place, with nineteen per cent. John McCain, who went on to win the primary, was in third place, with seventeen per cent. The prominent showings of Giuliani and Thompson both proved ephemeral. By January, 2008, when the primaries began, both had seen their poll ratings fall back. McCain and Mike Huckabee emerged as the leading candidates.","310","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"The 2012 G.O.P. primary also involved a lot of twists and turns. In July of 2011, a survey by the research firm Public Policy Polling showed Michele Bachmann, the conservative congresswoman from Minnesota, narrowly leading Mitt Romney, the favorite. In August, Bachmann went on to win the Ames Straw Poll, in Iowa, with 28.6 per cent of the vote, and Newsweek featured her on its cover. After that, Bachmann fell back steadily.","311","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"In August of 2011, Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, surged to the front of the field. In mid-September, he reached a peak of 31.7 per cent in the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, before falling back sharply. Shortly after that, Herman Cain, a businessman and syndicated columnist, replaced Perry as the front-runner. At the start of November, Cain, who was wielding a tax-cutting economic program he called his “9-9-9 plan,” hit twenty-five per cent in the R.C.P. poll average: some individual polls showed him with even more support. By the end of the year, he was back in single figures.","312","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Trump’s candidacy is sui generis. It shouldn’t necessarily be compared with any of its predecessors, each of which succumbed in a slightly different way. Giuliani and Cain were both hit by allegations of marital infidelity. Perry embarrassed himself in a televised debate. Thompson and Bachmann both committed a series of lesser blunders, which eventually took their toll. Trump, conceivably, could avoid these sorts of errors—although his latest statement, that he’d be willing to shut down the federal government to deprive Planned Parenthood of funding, suggests that he’ll continue to be embroiled in controversy. But my point here is a broader one about the G.O.P. primary electorate. History shows that it’s a volatile and disgruntled beast, which often responds well to candidates it perceives as outsiders. Often, however, the romance doesn’t last. Trump is the latest glamorous newcomer to have tickled the fancy of Republicans. By swallowing up the attention of the media, he’s already done a good deal of damage to other candidates, especially the mid-ranking ones, such as Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, who are now starved of attention.

"Not that anyone should expect an in-depth or illuminating discussion of the real issues facing the country, domestic and foreign. With ten candidates onstage, each of whom will probably speak for about ten minutes, it will have the theatricality of a casting call for the lead role in a new Broadway show. One called “Obama The Bad,” perhaps, or “Modern America Sucks.” Based upon what we saw in New Hampshire on Monday night, where fourteen of the Republican candidates appeared together, we can assume there will be frequent fulminations about undocumented immigrants, rote pledges to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and outraged attacks on Planned Parenthood.","331","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"What makes this debate different is that Trump, who skipped the New Hampshire event, and who is boasting a double-digit lead over his closest rivals, will be standing center stage, with Jeb Bush on one side of him and Scott Walker on the other. Questions abound. How combative will he be? Will any of the others try to take him down? And with so many candidates vying for attention, what tack will the moderators—Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly, and Chris Wallace, all of Fox News—take?","332","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"Interviewed by Fox’s Bill O’Reilly on Tuesday, the front-runner admitted he’s a bit apprehensive. “You don’t know what is going to come at you,” Trump said. “You don’t know where these other people are going to come. You don’t know whether or not the three folks that are asking the questions are trying to trick you up.” Although Fox is generally supportive of the Republican Party, Baier, Kelly, and Wallace are all experienced journalists who will probably be looking to force the candidates to deviate from their prepared messages. “I’ve got some doozies in there,” Wallace told the Washington Post’s Krissah Thompson, patting his pre-debate binder.","333","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"The debate will last two hours. Since each candidate will be allotted roughly equal time, the moderators won’t get many chances to interrogate Trump. If they confine their questions to his favorite subjects—immigration and the incompetence of career politicians—he will probably sail through. As he said to O’Reilly, he’s been talking about these things for years, and he’s amply prepared to do so again. But if he’s asked about less familiar topics, or is subjected to awkward questions about his own record, such as a history of associations with companies that filed for bankruptcy, or his unsubstantiated claims about President Obama’s birthplace, he might find things trickier.","334","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"One or more of the other candidates may also challenge Trump, knowing he is likely to hit back. The billionaire assured O’Reilly that he wasn’t out to hurt anyone, and that he wouldn’t initiate any personal attacks, but added that he would respond if provoked. Appearing on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” on Wednesday, he repeated this message, saying he was hoping for a “civil” debate. This suggests that Trump won’t repeat his criticisms of Jeb Bush—including that Bush can’t win, and describing him as “out of touch with the American people.” Plus, since former Texas governor Rick Perry has failed to make the cut for the prime-time debate, the target of some of Trump’s harshest comments will be absent.","335","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"

"Many political insiders think Bush and Walker would be ill-served by tackling Trump. Quoting George Bernard Shaw, one New Hampshire Republican told Politico, “The old maxim applies: Never wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it.” That seems like sound advice. If Trump’s candidacy endures, his principal rivals will eventually have to confront him head-on. But, for now, their primary aim should be to expound on their own platforms, appear to be plausible occupants of the Oval Office, and reinforce their position as the leading orthodox candidates.","337","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"More interesting is the calculus facing the other seven participants in the debate: Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, John Kasich, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio. None of these candidates is enjoying a great campaign, and a couple of them—Christie and Paul—are floundering in the polls. This gives them an incentive to lob a few grenades. Since Christie is friendly with Trump, however, it seems unlikely that he will seek to play the role of assassin. Paul has no such ties, and he’s already made dismissive remarks about Trump. Last week, he attributed Trump’s rise in the polls to a “loss of sanity,” adding, “We’re going to come back to our senses and look for someone serious to lead the country at some point.”","338","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"In addition to a possible set-to between Paul and Trump, political professionals will be monitoring the other second-tier candidates, to see if any of them shows signs of breaking out. Cruz and Huckabee, who are both accomplished public speakers, will be seeking to position themselves as conservative tribunes, as will Carson, the former surgeon, who will be making his début on the national political stage. Rubio, whose poll ratings don’t match his perceived status as one of the leading candidates, needs to make a good impression. Kasich, the governor of Ohio, will also be worth watching. Although he’s only been in the race for a few weeks, he has started out strongly, and some shrewd handicappers regard him as a dark horse.","339","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"For all of the candidates, Trump included, the first imperative is avoiding a terrible blunder that could upend their campaign, such as the one Perry made, in November, 2011, when he couldn’t remember the name of a federal agency he’d pledged to abolish. (It was the Department of Energy.) In normal circumstances, the possibility of witnessing such harrowing moments is one of things that prompts people to watch Presidential debates. On this occasion, thanks to Trump, the event promises to be compelling viewing regardless.","340","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"On consecutive days last week, two Republican senators, both of whom are hoping to be the next President, released videos in which they destroyed stuff. First, Rand Paul went at a pile of paper, which he said was the United States tax code, with fire, a wood chipper, and a chain saw. (He wore safety goggles—he may be against regulations, but he’s also an ophthalmologist.) The next day saw Lindsey Graham attacking his Samsung flip phone with a cleaver, a blender, and a golf club. He also dropped a concrete block on it, threw it off a roof, and doused it with lighter fluid and ignited it. These videos suggest that Fox News, which is co-hosting the first G.O.P. Presidential debate, in Cleveland, on August 6th, should have in place firm rules regarding props, and that, perhaps, extra fire marshals should be deployed. With sixteen declared candidates, there is already a crowd-control problem; now the campaign threatens to be defined by demolition.","341","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"The loose-haired agent of much of the chaos has been Donald J. Trump. About a week ago, John McCain, the Party’s nominee in 2008, told Ryan Lizza, a writer for this magazine, that Trump had “fired up the crazies” in the G.O.P. with his descriptions of undocumented immigrants as rapists. Trump demanded an apology, and said that, anyway, McCain is “not a war hero.” Graham then asked that Trump “stop being a jackass.” Any New Yorker, having witnessed decades of the Donald, could have told Graham that this wasn’t going to happen. On Tuesday, Trump gave out Graham’s personal cell-phone number at a televised event in South Carolina. “Let’s try it,” Trump told the crowd. That inspired Graham, who had complained that Trump was turning the race “into a circus,” to make his video.","342","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"Some other numbers that became public last week may cause the Republican Party more worry. A Washington Post/ABC News poll showed Trump in the lead among the candidates, with twenty-four per cent of the vote. Scott Walker had thirteen per cent, followed by Jeb Bush (twelve), Mike Huckabee (eight), and then, in order of diminishing returns, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, Chris Christie, John Kasich (who signed on last week), Bobby Jindal, George Pataki, Rick Santorum, Carly Fiorina, and Lindsey Graham—in last place but with a chance of moving up, now that Trump has made sure that everyone knows where to reach him, as soon as he gets a new phone.","343","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"The poll results matter, even now, more than a year before the election, because Fox and the Ohio Republican Party, which are co-hosting the first debate (with Facebook), have said that the final five national polls leading up to it will determine who takes part—just the top ten. If things keep going as they are, Trump will be front and center, and he may need to be restrained from slapping a gold-lettered nameplate on the lectern. Another reason that the stakes are so high is that other efforts to cull the field have failed. Jeb Bush, whose campaign and its associated super pac have raised more than a hundred million dollars, can’t shake off the insurgents. In an attempt to make the primaries less of a carnival than they were in 2012, Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, pushed to have only nine sanctioned debates. This creates a strong temptation for candidates to stage a scene while they can. The second debate, in September, hosted by CNN, will also use polls to limit the participants to ten. (CNN and Fox will both hold secondary events for any left-out candidates polling higher than one per cent.) For the hopefuls at the bottom of the list, this is the moment to make some noise.","344","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"It’s hard enough to be heard in a crowded room without having to compete with a man who ended the week in Laredo, Texas, so that he could inspect the border, professing, “They say it’s a great danger, but I have to do it.” (He added that, once he is elected, “the Hispanics” are “going to love Trump.”) It’s harder still when you’re trying not to offend his supporters. After Trump insulted Mexicans last month, Bush said that he was personally offended, but others were more cautious. Christie commented that although some of Trump’s remarks may be “inappropriate,” he is “a good guy.” Cruz said, “I think he speaks the truth.” But if Trump weren’t around would the other Republicans behave that much more responsibly?","345","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"There is a serious discussion to be had over the Iran deal, yet the G.O.P. contenders seem willing to shatter years of diplomacy in the name of grandstanding. Cruz announced that “the Obama Administration will become the leading financier of terrorism against America in the world,” and Graham thought that the deal looked like “a death sentence for the State of Israel.” Rubio, in a Trump-like move, said that Obama lacked “class.” Bush and Walker got into a fight about whether they’d renounce the deal and start planning military strikes on Inauguration Day or wait until the first Cabinet meeting. Saying it’s Trump who’s wrecking the Republican Party ignores the ways that he embodies it.","346","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"Trump is not going to be elected, but he is intent enough on staying in the race to have filed financial-disclosure paperwork with the F.E.C.—a step that many observers thought he would stop short of—and he promptly put out a press release stating his worth at “ten billion dollars.” (Forbes estimates four billion; the biggest discrepancy comes from Trump’s assertion that his name alone is worth three billion.) In this election, the post-Citizens United financing mechanisms have fully matured, effectively removing the limits and the disclosure requirements for individual donations to campaigns. The money may have to be laundered through a super pac, but that is just a formality. This distorts the process in both parties and might help explain the large assortment of candidates. Cruz may seem like a preening opportunist, unpopular among his colleagues, but, having attracted more than fifty million dollars in contributions, he is a credible candidate. The Times reported that a significant portion of his early money came from a single donor: Robert Mercer, a hedge-fund executive who is so private that one of the few traces of his personal life in the public record is a lawsuit that he brought against a toy company that installed a model train set in his home and, he felt, overcharged him—by two million dollars.","347","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"

Obviously somewhat taken aback, Trump tried to downplay his sexist remarks as “fun, it’s kidding,” and then complained, peevishly, that Kelly hadn’t been nice to him.","352","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Wallop. The sound of Wallace landing another haymaker on Trump’s comb-over, this time in the form of a question about four firms bearing his name that have filed for bankruptcy protection. Given a record like that, Wallace asked, why should we trust you with the nation’s finances? Trump replied that these were just four deals out of hundreds he’d done, and that, like many businessmen, he had only been using the bankruptcy laws to his advantage. And he personally had never gone bankrupt, he added. He should have stopped there, but he didn’t. When Wallace followed up with a question about the last bankruptcy, of the Atlantic City-based Trump Entertainment Resorts, in 2009, which cost nearly a thousand jobs, he couldn’t resist another tribute to his capitalist acumen: “I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City before it cratered,” he said. “I made a lot of money in Atlantic City, and I’m proud of it.”","353","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"There were more tricky questions—about his many political flip-flops, and about the lack of evidence that he has provided to back up his claim that Mexico is sending criminals across the border to the United States. If it had been a prize fight and the judges had been members of the political commentariat, they would probably have adjudged Trump a standing eight count, or even stopped the contest before he suffered more punishment, some of it self-inflicted.","354","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"But, of course, the judges are ordinary Republican voters, many of whom share Trump’s disdain for the political class, including political journalists. (“They are a very dishonest lot, generally,” he said at one point.) In the recent past, Trump’s run-ins with the media have only helped him, and we’ll have to wait for some post-debate polls to see whether this happens again. Although on the defensive for much of the time, he didn’t back down, and he came across, as he always does, as a man apart from the rest of the field. That, of course, is the key to his popularity.","355","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Perhaps the most bizarre moment was when Trump responded to yet another tough question, this one from Baier, about why, in the past, he had made financial contributions to Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton. Trump said that he had contributed to “everybody,” including several people on the stage, and explained that his donations were strictly transactional. “When they call, I give,” he said. “And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me.” His donations to the Clinton Foundation provided an example of how this worked, Trump went on. “Hillary Clinton: I said, ‘Be at my wedding,’ and she came to my wedding. She had no choice, because I gave to a foundation.”","356","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

(Paul was con, Christie was pro.)

Ben Carson, the neurosurgeon turned politician, spoke softly, rarely pausing to sully his presentation with actual policy details. “I’m the only one to separate Siamese twins,” he said in his closing statement. “The only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it.”","359","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

Then again, Rubio almost always gets good reviews from the professionals. It is the Republican voters who have left him languishing, with about five-per-cent support in the opinion polls. Kasich, cheered by the crowd, appeared to be positioning himself as a more proletarian, Midwestern version of Bush. Most of his policy positions are solidly right-wing; his record is solidly right-wing. But he has one issue on which he’s broken ranks with his party—Medicaid.

"On July 23rd, Donald Trump’s red-white-and-navy-blue Boeing 757 touched down in Laredo, Texas, where the temperature was climbing to a hundred and four degrees. In 1976, the Times introduced Trump, then a little-known builder, to readers as a “publicity shy” wunderkind who “looks ever so much like Robert Redford,” and quoted an admiring observation from the architect Der Scutt: “That Donald, he could sell sand to the Arabs.” Over the years, Trump honed a performer’s ear for the needs of his audience. He starred in “The Apprentice” for fourteen seasons, cultivating a lordly persona and a squint that combined Clint Eastwood on the high plains and Derek Zoolander on the runway. Once he emerged as the early front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, this summer, his airport comings and goings posed a delicate staging issue: a rogue wind off the tarmac could render his comb-over fully erect in front of the campaign paparazzi. So, in Laredo, Trump débuted a protective innovation: a baseball hat adorned with a campaign slogan that he recycled from Ronald Reagan’s 1980 run for the White House—“Make America Great Again!” The headwear, which had the rigid façade and the braided rope of a cruise-ship giveaway, added an expeditionary element to the day’s outfit, of blazer, pale slacks, golf shoes—well suited for a mission that he was describing as one of great personal risk. “I may never see you again, but we’re going to do it,” he told Fox News on the eve of the Texas visit.","364","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"When Trump announced his candidacy, on June 16th, he vowed to build a two-thousand-mile-long wall to stop Mexico from “sending people that have lots of problems.” He said, “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” Three of the statements had no basis in fact—the crime rate among first-generation immigrants is lower than that for native-born Americans—but Trump takes an expansive view of reality. “I play to people’s fantasies,” he writes in “The Art of the Deal,” his 1987 memoir. “I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration—and a very effective form of promotion.”","365","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s campaign announcement was mocked and condemned—and utterly successful. His favorability among Republicans leaped from sixteen per cent to fifty-seven per cent, a greater spike than that of any other candidate’s début. Immigration became the centerpiece of his campaign. “Donald Trump has changed the entire debate on immigration,” Rush Limbaugh told his listeners last month. As the climax of events in Las Vegas and Phoenix, Trump brought onstage Jamiel Shaw, Sr., whose seventeen-year-old son was killed, in 2008, by a man who was in the country illegally. Trump stood by while Shaw told the crowd how his son was shot.","366","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Before departing for Laredo, Trump said, “I’ve been invited by border patrols, and they want to honor me, actually, thousands and thousands of them, because I’m speaking up.” Though Trump said “border patrols,” the invitation had in fact come from a local branch of the border-patrol union, and the local, after consulting with headquarters, withdrew the invitation a few hours before Trump arrived, on the ground that it would not endorse political candidates. Descending the airplane stairs, Trump looked thrilled to be arriving amid a controversy; he waded into a crowd of reporters and described the change of plans as the handiwork of unspecified enemies. “They invited me, and then, all of a sudden, they were told, silencio! They want silence.” Asked why he felt unsafe in Laredo—which has a lower crime rate than New York City or Washington, D.C.—he invoked another “they”: “Well, they say it’s a great danger, but I have to do it. I love the country. There’s nothing more important than what I’m doing.”","367","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump was now going to meet with city officials instead of with the union. He disappeared into one of seven S.U.V.s, escorted by a dozen police vehicles—a larger motorcade than Mitt Romney merited as the Republican nominee. He passed shopping malls, churches, and ranch houses with satellite dishes in the front yard. Some drivers waved; others stared.

He said that a friend involved in the border patrol had called him and asked him “to take up the spaces.” He’d brought five relatives. I asked what he thought of Trump’s politics. He paused and said, “I like his hotels.” Trump told the group, “I don’t think that people understand the danger that you’re under and the talent that you have.

How did a real campaign emerge from a proposition so ludicrous that an episode of “The Simpsons” once used a Trump Presidency as the conceit for a dystopian future?

Other Republicans offer “canned bullshit,” Rice went on. “People have got so terribly annoyed and disenchanted and disenfranchised, really, by candidates who get up there, and all their stump speeches promise everything to everyone.” By the night’s end, Rice was sold. “I heard echoes of Ronald Reagan,” he told me, adding, “If I had to vote today, I would vote for Trump.”","388","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"To inhabit Trump’s landscape for a while, to chase his jet or stay behind with his fans in a half-dozen states, is to encounter a confederacy of the frustrated—less a constituency than a loose alliance of Americans who say they are betrayed by politicians, victimized by a changing world, and enticed by Trump’s insurgency. Dave Anderson, a New Hampshire Republican who retired from United Parcel Service, told me, “People say, ‘Well, it’d be nice to have another Bush.’ No, it wouldn’t be nice. We had two. They did their duty. That’s fine, but we don’t want this Bush following what his brother did. And he’s not coming across as very strong at all. He’s not saying what Trump is saying.

She worked at a furniture company, she said. “But the industry went down the tubes.” Her husband, Charlie, used to build household electricity meters at a General Electric plant, until the job moved to Mexico. Now he parks cars at a hospital. Trump, in his speech, promised to stop companies from sending jobs abroad, and the Merzes became Trump Republicans. They are churchgoers, but they don’t expect Trump to become one, and they forgive his unpriestly comments about women. “There are so many other things going on in this country that we’ve got be concerned about,” Nancy said. “I’ve seen a lot of our friends lose their houses.”","390","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s fans project onto him a vast range of imaginings—about toughness, business acumen, honesty—from a continuum that ranges from economic and libertarian conservatives to the far-right fringe. In partisan terms, his ideas are riven by contradiction—he calls for mass deportations but opposes cuts to Medicare and Social Security; he vows to expand the military but criticizes free trade—and yet that is a reflection of voters’ often incoherent sets of convictions. The biggest surprise in Trump’s following? He “made an incredible surge among the Tea Party supporters,” according to Patrick Murray, who runs polling for Monmouth University. Before Trump announced his candidacy, only twenty per cent of Tea Partiers had a favorable view of him; a month later, that figure had risen to fifty-six per cent. Trump became the top choice among Tea Party voters, supplanting (and opening a large lead over) Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Governor Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, both Tea Party stalwarts. According to a Washington Post /ABC News poll conducted last month, the “broad majority” of Trump’s supporters hailed from two groups: voters with no college degree, and voters who say that immigrants weaken America. By mid-August, Trump was even closing in on Hillary Clinton. CNN reported that, when voters were asked to choose between the two, Clinton was leading fifty-one per cent to forty-five.","391","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"When the Trump storm broke this summer, it touched off smaller tempests that stirred up American politics in ways that were easy to miss from afar. At the time, I happened to be reporting on extremist white-rights groups, and observed at first hand their reactions to his candidacy. Trump was advancing a dire portrait of immigration that partly overlapped with their own. On June 28th, twelve days after Trump’s announcement, the Daily Stormer, America’s most popular neo-Nazi news site, endorsed him for President: “Trump is willing to say what most Americans think: it’s time to deport these people.” The Daily Stormer urged white men to “vote for the first time in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests.”","393","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Ever since the Tea Party’s peak, in 2010, and its fade, citizens on the American far right—Patriot militias, border vigilantes, white supremacists—have searched for a standard-bearer, and now they’d found him. In the past, “white nationalists,” as they call themselves, had described Trump as a “Jew-lover,” but the new tone of his campaign was a revelation. Richard Spencer is a self-described “identitarian” who lives in Whitefish, Montana, and promotes “white racial consciousness.” At thirty-six, Spencer is trim and preppy, with degrees from the University of Virginia and the University of Chicago. He is the president and director of the National Policy Institute, a think tank, co-founded by William Regnery, a member of the conservative publishing family, that is “dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of European people in the United States and around the world.” The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Spencer “a suit-and-tie version of the white supremacists of old.” Spencer told me that he had expected the Presidential campaign to be an “amusing freak show,” but that Trump was “refreshing.” He went on, “Trump, on a gut level, kind of senses that this is about demographics, ultimately. We’re moving into a new America.” He said, “I don’t think Trump is a white nationalist,” but he did believe that Trump reflected “an unconscious vision that white people have—that their grandchildren might be a hated minority in their own country. I think that scares us. They probably aren’t able to articulate it. I think it’s there. I think that, to a great degree, explains the Trump phenomenon. I think he is the one person who can tap into it.”","394","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Jared Taylor, the editor of American Renaissance, a white-nationalist magazine and Web site based in Oakton, Virginia, told me, in regard to Trump, “I’m sure he would repudiate any association with people like me, but his support comes from people who are more like me than he might like to admit.”","395","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"From the beginning of the current race, the conservative establishment has been desperate for Trump to be finished. After he disparaged the war record of Senator John McCain, the New York Post gave him a front-page farewell—“DON VOYAGE”—and a Wall Street Journal editorial declared him a “catastrophe.” But Trump carried on—in part because he had activated segments of the electorate that other candidates could not, or would not. On July 20th, three days before his trip to Texas, Ann Coulter, whose most recent book is “¡Adios, America! The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole,” appeared on Sean Hannity’s show and urged fellow-Republicans to see Trump’s summer as a harbinger. “The new litmus test for real conservatives is immigration,” she said. “They used to say the same thing about the pro-life Republicans and the pro-gun Republicans, and, ‘Oh, they’re fringe and they’re tacky, and we’re so embarrassed to be associated with them.’ Now every one of them comes along and pretends they’d be Reagan.”","396","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"From the pantheon of great demagogues, Trump has plucked some best practices—William Jennings Bryan’s bombast, Huey Long’s wit, Father Charles Coughlin’s mastery of the airwaves—but historians are at pains to find the perfect analogue, because so much of Trump’s recipe is specific to the present. Celebrities had little place in American politics until the 1920 Presidential election, when Al Jolson and other stars from the fledgling film industry endorsed Warren Harding. Two decades ago, Americans were less focussed on paid-for politicians, so Ross Perot, a self-funded billionaire candidate, did not derive the same benefit as Trump from the perception of independence.","397","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"Trump’s admirers hear in his words multiple appeals. Michael Hill heads the Alabama-based League of the South, a secessionist group that envisions an independent Southern republic with an “Anglo-Celtic” leadership. In 1981, Hill began teaching history at Stillman College, a historically black college in Tuscaloosa. He applied for jobs at other schools, and was turned down, which he attributes to affirmative action. In 1994, he co-founded the League, which put him at odds, he said, with “civil-rights-age, older black faculty and administrators, looking down their nose at this uppity white boy coming out here, talking about the Confederate flag and all that kind of stuff.” In 1999, he left Stillman. He told me, “If academia is not for me, because of who I am—a white Southern male, Christian, straight, whatever—then I’m going to find something that is. I’m going to fight this battle for my people.” Hill was moved by Trump’s frequent references to Kathryn Steinle, a thirty-two-year-old woman who, on July 1st, was walking with her father on a pier in San Francisco when she was fatally wounded in what police described as a random shooting. When police arrested Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a repeat felon who had been deported from the United States five times, Trump adopted the story of “that beautiful woman” as “another example of why we must secure our border immediately.” Hill told me, “That struck such a nerve with people, because a lot of this political stuff is abstract, but, as a father, I’ve got a daughter as well, and I could just see myself holding my daughter, and her looking up at me and saying, ‘Help me, Daddy.’ ” Hill, who condemns immigration and interracial marriage and warns of the influence of “Jewry,” said, “I love to see somebody like Donald Trump come along. Not that I believe anything that he says. But he is stirring up chaos in the G.O.P., and for us that is good.”","400","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

It was the League’s annual conference, and there were about a hundred men and women; the older men were in courtly suits or jackets, and the younger set favored jeans, with handguns holstered in the waistband. The venders’ tables had books (“The True Selma Story,” “Authentic History of the Ku Klux Klan”), stickers (“The Federal Empire Is Killing the American Dream”), and raffle tickets.

"After years of decline, the League has recently acquired a number of younger members, including Brad Griffin, a thirty-four-year-old who writes an influential blog under the name Hunter Wallace. Short and genial, he wore Top-Siders, khaki shorts, and a polo shirt. As we talked, Griffin’s eyes wandered to his two-year-old son, who was roaming nearby. Griffin told me that he embraced white nationalism after reading Patrick Buchanan’s “Death of the West,” which argued, in Griffin’s words, that “all of the European peoples were dying out, their birthrates were low, and you had mass immigration and multiculturalism.” Griffin once had high hopes for the Tea Party. “They channelled all that rage into electing an impressive number of Republicans in the South, but then all they did was try to cut rich Republicans’ taxes and make life easier for billionaires!” he said. “It was all hijacked, and a classic example of how these right-wing movements emerge, and they’re misdirected into supporting the status quo.”","402","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Griffin had recently told his readers that his opinion of Donald Trump was “soaring.” He sees Trump’s surge as a “hostile takeover of the Republican Party. He’s blowing up their stage-managed dog-and-pony show.” Griffin is repelled by big-money politics, so I asked why he spoke highly of Trump. “He’s a billionaire, but all of these other little candidates are owned by their own little billionaires.” He mentioned Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers. “So I think Trump is independent.”","403","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

When Hill took the stage, he told his compatriots that the recent lowering of the Confederate flag was just the beginning. Soon, he warned, adopting the unspecified “they,” they will come for the “monuments, battlefields, parks, cemeteries, street names, even the dead themselves.” The crowd was on its feet, cheering him on. “This, my friends, is cultural genocide,” he said, adding, “Often, as history has shown, cultural genocide is merely a prelude to physical genocide.” I ducked out to catch a flight to Des Moines: Trump was speaking the next day in Iowa.","404","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"It must be stated clearly that (to the delight of the far-right extremists I spoke with) a great many Republicans are mortified by Trump—horrified by his campaign of fear, embarrassed that others in the Party are not, and desperate to move on. But Trump’s strategy has its logic. Gary Johnson, who as a Republican served two terms as the governor of New Mexico, before becoming the 2012 Libertarian Party Presidential candidate, told me that anyone who runs for office discovers that some portion of the electorate is available to be enraged and manipulated, if a candidate is willing to do it. “I ran across this constantly,” he said. “This eight per cent out there that bangs their fist on the table and says, ‘The biggest problem we’re facing is immigration!’ And I’m going, ‘No! No! This is not the case!’ ” Johnson cited a poll that at that point put Trump’s support among Republicans at eighteen per cent, and told me, “I don’t think there’s an eighteen-per-cent element of this country that is just outright racist. But there is a segment out there that is, and he has definitely appealed to that.” Most people, in Johnson’s view, are animated by other parts of Trump’s pitch—“that he’s going to get in and make the tough deals, and nobody’s going to screw with him, because he’ll drop bombs.” That coalition—the fearful and the frustrated—is powerful. “That’s how you begin to get to eighteen per cent,” Johnson said.","406","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"As people turned up in Oskaloosa, I encountered some of the fearful. A construction worker named Ron James, wearing a T-shirt that said “Every-Juan Illegal Go Home,” told me that the “invasion of illegals” is eroding American culture: “We’re getting flushed down the toilet.” But the vast majority of the room, as best I could tell, was more like Stephanie DeVolder, an elegant fiftysomething, with blond hair and bright-green eyes, who had worked as a sales rep for Dice, a job-search site. She was glad that Trump had “brought up the horrific treatment of the veterans,” and that “he is a foremost believer in the military,” and she admired his work on television. “I bought the videos of ‘The Apprentice,’ and watched the whole thing,” she said. “He is a phenomenal judge of character, and he actually does have a heart. He is absolutely amazing.” His fame had guided her to his political views, and, in time, she had concluded that he was “absolutely right about border security.”","407","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Emerging from the wings, in a navy suit, a white shirt, and a pink tie, Trump paused midway across the stage to spread his arms in a gesture of astonished, grateful embrace. For years, Trump has been compared to P. T. Barnum, but the comparison doesn’t capture his range; on the campaign trail, he is less the carnival barker than the full cast—the lion, the fire-eater, the clown with the seltzer—all trussed into a single-breasted Brioni suit. Music from the “Karate Kid” soundtrack blared—“You’re the best around! Nothing’s gonna ever keep you down!”—and, for a moment, Trump looked genuinely startled by the ardor of the stargazers in the crowd. At the lectern, he said, “It’s a terrific place, Iowa.” Then he monologued for an hour, off the cuff, on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server (“What she did is very criminal”); Scott Walker (“Finally, I can attack!”); the Veterans Administration (“the most corrupt group of people in all of Washington”).","408","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"As always, he created a powerful set piece about Mexican criminals who are allowed to “roam around, shooting people and killing people,” as he put it. He described this as a hidden scourge: “Such a big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it.” He reminded the crowd of his trip to Laredo: “I told the pilots, I said, ‘Fly a little bit away from the border, please. Fly a little bit inland.’ It’s a whole scary thing.” He said that when he returned to New York his wife had greeted him in tears. “You made it safely from the border!” she cried. As always, he spoke of Kathryn Steinle’s murder—“Kate, beautiful Kate”—and of the death of Jamiel Shaw’s son, “shot by an animal, an animal that shouldn’t have been in this country.” He urged Iowans to be afraid, even if they didn’t see the threat. “When you’re afraid to walk into your own country, it’s pretty bad,” he said. “Hard to believe. You don’t have that problem in Iowa, in all fairness. But it’s pretty rough out there.”","409","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Over the years, Trump has rejected the suggestion that he is a “belligerent, loudmouthed racist,” as Paul Krugman, the Times columnist, put it recently. “I have a great relationship with the blacks,” Trump said on the radio, in 2011.","410","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump has always weaved in and out of racially charged controversies. In 2000, he secretly ran ads opposing a Catskills casino backed by the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, because it would rival his businesses in Atlantic City. Beneath a picture of drug paraphernalia, the ad asked, “Are these the new neighbors we want?” Tribal leaders denounced the message as “racist and inflammatory,” and Trump and his associates were fined by New York State for concealing the true source of the ads. In March, 2011, Trump, who was considering a Presidential run, resurrected the crackpot theory that Barack Obama is not an American citizen, declaring, “I want him to show his birth certificate.” (It had already been publicly available for more than three years.) Trump’s declaration gave the issue new prominence. At the time, Trump’s on-again, off-again political adviser, the former Nixon aide Roger Stone, said that the decision to become a birther was “a brilliant base-building move.”","411","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s phantasmagorical visions of marauding immigrants are part of a genre in which immigration and race are intermingled. In recent years, hoaxes and theories that were once confined to the margins have been laundered through mainstream media outlets. In 2013, Fox News repeatedly broadcast warnings about the “knockout game,” based on a self-published book by the white nationalist Colin Flaherty, which described black men randomly attacking white pedestrians. In a study published in the journal Race & Class, Mike King, a sociologist at SUNY-Oneonta, searched for a single actual case of the knockout game and found none. The news reports were largely patched together from unrelated viral videos of street violence. Bureau of Justice statistics show, King wrote, a “marked decrease in random assaults, including black assaults on white strangers.”","412","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"When Trump started emphasizing the mortal threat posed by undocumented immigration, America’s white nationalists rejoiced. “Why are whites supposed to be happy about being reduced to a minority?” Jared Taylor, of American Renaissance, asked me. “It’s clear why Hispanics celebrate diversity: ‘More of us! More Spanish! More cucaracha!’ ”","413","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Taylor, who calls himself a “racial dissident,” was slim and decorous in gray trousers and a button-down when we met. For years, he and others have sensed an opportunity on the horizon to expand their ranks. When Obama was elected in 2008, Stormfront, the leading white-supremacist Web forum, crashed from heavy traffic. The Klan, weakened by lawsuits and infighting, barely exists anymore, but the Internet draws in young racists like Dylann Roof, who is accused of the June 17th massacre of nine people at a church in Charleston. The attack inspired a broad effort to remove the Confederate flag—from the state capitol and from the shelves of Amazon and of Walmart and a host of other retail stores. Defenders of the flag were galvanized, and they organized more than a hundred rallies around the South, interpreting the moment, months after racial unrest in Ferguson and Baltimore, as a sign of a backlash against political correctness and multiculturalism. Trump’s language landed just as American hate groups were more energized than at any time in years. Griffin, the blogger for the League of the South, told me that the removal of the flag had crystallized “fears that people have about what happens when we become a minority. What happens when we have no control over things? You’re seeing it play out right now.”","414","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Over sandwiches in the dining room of Taylor’s brick Colonial, with views of a spacious back yard, a half-hour from downtown Washington, D.C., five of his readers and friends shared their views on race and politics, on the condition that I not use their full names. They were white men, in white-collar jobs, and each had a story of radicalization: Chris, who wore a pink oxford shirt and a tie, and introduced himself as an employee of “Conservativism, Inc.,” the Republican establishment, said that he had graduated from a public high school where there were frequent shootings, but he felt he was supposed to “ignore the fact that we were not safe on a day-to-day basis because of all of these blacks and the other immigrants in our schools.”","415","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Jason, a muscle-bound commercial-real-estate broker in a polo shirt, said, “I’ve had personnel—in strict, frightened confidence—just tell me, ‘Hey, look, we’re just hiring minorities, so don’t appeal, don’t come back.’ ” This sense of “persecution,” as he called it, is widely held. In a study published in 2011, Michael Norton, a professor at Harvard Business School, and Samuel Sommers, a professor of psychology at Tufts, found that more than half of white Americans believe that whites have replaced blacks as “the primary victims of discrimination” today, even though, as Norton and Sommers write, “by nearly any metric—from employment to police treatment, loan rates to education—statistics continue to indicate drastically poorer outcomes for Black than White Americans.”","416","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

They uniformly predicted a violent future. Erick, who wore a Captain America T-shirt and unwittingly invoked one of Trump’s signature phrases, told me, “The American dream is dead, and the American nightmare is just beginning.

"In early August, the Republican candidates convened in Cleveland for their first debate. I watched it on television with Matthew Heimbach, the young white nationalist in Cincinnati, and some of his friends. Heimbach, whom anti-racist activists call “the Little Fuhrer,” for his tirades against “rampant multiculturalism,” founded the Traditionalist Youth Network, a far-right group that caters to high-school and college students and pushes for the separation of blacks and whites. Stocky and bearded, Heimbach is ambitious. He graduated, in 2013, from Towson University, in Maryland, where he attracted controversy for forming a “white student union.” He has met with European Fascists, including members of the Golden Dawn, in Greece.","419","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Heimbach rents part of a house on a placid side street and works as a landscaper. He and his wife recently had their first child, a boy named Nicholas. When I asked Heimbach how he got involved with Fascist politics, he laughed. “I was not raised like this,” he said. “I was raised to be a normal small-town Republican.” The son of teachers in Poolesville, Maryland, an hour from Washington, he, like Brad Griffin, credited Buchanan’s book “Death of the West” for seeding his conception of a desolate future. “Even if you play the game, even if you do everything right, then the future, when it comes to your income, when it comes to benefits, when it comes to everything, we are going to be the first generation in American history to be living worse than our parents.” He went on, “My own parents tell me, ‘Well, you should just shut up, you should go get a normal job, and get a two-car garage, and then you’ll be happy.’ ”","420","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"On the economics, Heimbach’s narrative is not wrong. During a half-century of change in the American labor market—the rise of technology and trade, the decline of manual labor—nobody has been hit harder than low-skilled, poorly educated men. Between 1979 and 2013, pay for men without a college degree fell by twenty-one per cent in real terms; for women with similar credentials, pay rose by three per cent, thanks partly to job opportunities in health care and education. Like many ultraconservatives, Heimbach had largely given up on the Republican Party. He said, “We need to get the white community to actually start speaking for the white community, instead of letting a bunch of Republicans that hate us anyway, and don’t speak for our values, be the unofficial spokespeople.”","421","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"During the debate, Mike Huckabee was asked how he might attract enough support from independents and Democrats to get elected, and Heimbach shouted at the TV, “You don’t need to!

"On a couch across from the television, Tony Hovater, who used to be a drummer in a band and now works as a welder, said that, from what he has heard from Trump, he suspects that Trump shares his fears about immigration but can’t say so openly. Hovater told me, “I think he’s, like, dog-whistling,” adding, “He’s saying we should probably favor more European immigration, or maybe more of just a meritocracy sort of system, but he’s not coming out and saying it, because people will literally stamp him: ‘Oh, you just hate Mexicans.’ ” Hovater hopes that Trump will find a way to be more forthright: “Why not just say it?”","423","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"For his part, Hovater hopes to get into politics. This fall, he’s running for City Council in New Carlisle, Ohio, representing what he and Heimbach have named the Traditional Workers Party. He is taking inspiration from Trump’s populist success. “Just like we’re seeing with Trump, if the people honestly feel like you’re fighting for them, they’ll rally behind you,” he said. He knows that his views are “extreme,” but Trump’s success tells him that people support tone over substance. “People will be, like, ‘Well, I’ll take the fighter, even though I might disagree with him on some things,’ ” he said.","424","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"As the debate wound down, Trump, in his final statement, recited his mantra of despair. “Our country is in serious trouble. We don’t win anymore,” he said. “We can’t do anything right.” Matthew Parrott, a Web developer who was sipping coffee from a cup adorned with a swastika, said, “He was sassy without being comical. He struck exactly the tone he needed to give the people supporting him exactly what they want more of.” He went on, “The political system hasn’t been providing an outlet for social-conservative populism. You had this Ron Paul revolution, and all the stuff about cutting taxes, small government, and that’s just not the electrifying issue that they were expecting it to be. Simple folks, they want the border secure. They want what Donald Trump is mirroring at them. I think he’s an intelligent businessman who identified what the people want to hear. He’s made a living finding these sorts of opportunities.”","425","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump emerged from the debate on a wrathful tear. When Megyn Kelly, the Fox News host, asked him to explain why he called some women “fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals,” Trump replied, “What I say is what I say.” In an interview the next day, he said that Kelly had “blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.” In the attendant uproar, Trump played dumb, declaring that only a “deviant” would think he was referring to menstruation, when he was thinking only of her nose.","426","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"The Republican commentariat celebrated what finally seemed to be Trump’s immolation.

"The polls did not follow suit, though. Trump not only remained the front-runner—ahead of Bush and Cruz and the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, depending on the poll—but broadened his lead.

"On August 16th, with the media in full summer frenzy, Trump made his first detailed proposal, a six-page immigration plan that outlined an unprecedented crackdown. Presented as the remedy for a victimized nation—“We will not be taken advantage of anymore”—Trump’s plan called for the government to deport large segments of the undocumented population, seize money that these immigrants attempt to send home, and, contravening the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, deny citizenship to their U.S.-born children.","429","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"The Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington-based organization that seeks to reduce immigration (it is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center), hailed Trump’s plan as the “American Workers’ Bill of Rights.” Mark Meckler, the co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, described it as a new standard “that all the other candidates will now have to meet,” and Scott Walker immediately echoed Trump’s call for building a wall and ending birthright citizenship. Other Republicans recoiled, convinced that Trump’s nativist turn would taint the Party’s image as ruinously as Mitt Romney’s “self-deportation” comments in his race against Barack Obama. At the time, Trump himself disapproved of Romney’s approach, saying, in November, 2012, “He had a crazy policy of ‘self- deportation,’ which was maniacal. It sounded as bad as it was, and he lost all of the Latino vote. He lost the Asian vote. He lost everybody who is inspired to come into this country.” Trump now faced the risk that his new stance could eventually undo him.","430","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

The police said that, after the men were arrested, one of them, Scott Leader, justified the assault by saying, “Donald Trump was right—all these illegals need to be deported.” (Both men pleaded not guilty.) When Trump was asked at a press conference about the case, and about threats of other violence, he replied, “I think that would be a shame, but I haven’t heard about that. I will say that people that are following me are very passionate. They love this country, and they want this country to be great again, and they are very passionate, I will say that.” (Two days later, Trump, under fire, tweeted, “Boston incident is terrible. . . . I would never condone violence.”)","432","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"When Trump leaped to the head of the Republican field, he delivered the appearance of legitimacy to a moral vision once confined to the fevered fringe, elevating fantasies from the message boards and campgrounds to the center stage of American life. In doing so, he pulled America into a current that is coursing through other Western democracies—Britain, France, Spain, Greece, Scandinavia—where xenophobic, nationalist parties have emerged since the 2008 economic crisis to besiege middle-ground politicians. In country after country, voters beset by inequality and scarcity have reached past the sober promises of the center-left and the center-right to the spectre of a transcendent solution, no matter how cruel. “The more complicated the problem, the simpler the demands become,” Samuel Popkin, a political scientist at the University of California in San Diego, told me. “When people get frustrated and irritated, they want to cut the Gordian knot.”","433","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump has succeeded in unleashing an old gene in American politics—the crude tribalism that Richard Hofstadter named “the paranoid style”—and, over the summer, it replicated like a runaway mutation. Whenever Americans have confronted the reshuffling of status and influence—the Great Migration, the end of Jim Crow, the end of a white majority—we succumb to the anti-democratic politics of absolutism, of a “conflict between absolute good and absolute evil,” in which, Hofstadter wrote, “the quality needed is not a willingness to compromise but the will to fight things out to a finish. Nothing but complete victory will do.” Trump was born to the part. “I’ll do nearly anything within legal bounds to win,” he wrote, in “The Art of the Deal.” “Sometimes, part of making a deal is denigrating your competition.” Trump, who long ago mastered the behavioral nudges that could herd the public into his casinos and onto his golf courses, looked so playful when he gave out Lindsey Graham’s cell-phone number that it was easy to miss just how malicious a gesture it truly was. It expressed the knowledge that, with a single utterance, he could subject an enemy to that most savage weapon of all: us.","434","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Trump has bequeathed a concoction of celebrity, wealth, and alienation that is more potent than any we’ve seen before. If, as the Republican establishment hopes, the stargazers eventually defect, Trump will be left with the hardest core—the portion of the electorate that is drifting deeper into unreality, with no reconciliation in sight. ♦","435","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"Fouad Ben Ahmed never paid much attention to Charlie Hebdo. He found the satirical magazine to be vulgar and not funny, and to him it seemed fixated on Islam, but he didn’t think that its contributors did real harm. One of its cartoonists, Stéphane Charbonnier, also drew for Le Petit Quotidien, a children’s paper to which Ben Ahmed subscribed for his two kids. On January 7th, upon hearing that two French brothers with Algerian names, Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, had executed twelve people at the Charlie Hebdo offices—including Charbonnier—in revenge for covers caricaturing Muhammad, Ben Ahmed wrote on Facebook, “My French heart bleeds, my Muslim soul weeps. Nothing, absolutely nothing, can justify these barbaric acts. Don’t talk to me about media or politicians who would play such-and-such a game, because there’s no excuse for barbarism. #JeSuisCharlie.”","450","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"That night, Ben Ahmed left his house, in the suburbs outside Paris, and went into the city to join tens of thousands of people at a vigil. He is of Algerian and Tunisian descent, with dark skin, and a few white extremists spat threats at him, but Ben Ahmed ignored them—France was his country, too. On January 11th, he joined the one and a half million citizens who marched in unity from the Place de la République.","451","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Ben Ahmed’s Facebook page became a forum for others, mostly French Muslims, to discuss the attacks. Many expressed simple grief and outrage; a few aired conspiracy theories, suggesting a plot to stigmatize Muslims. “Let the investigators shed light on this massacre,” Ben Ahmed advised. One woman wrote, “I fear for the Muslims of France. The narrow-minded or frightened are going to dig in their heels and make an amalgame”—conflate terrorists with all Muslims. Ben Ahmed agreed: “Our country is going to be more divided.” He defended his use of #JeSuisCharlie, arguing that critiques of Charlie’s content, however legitimate before the attack, had no place afterward. “If we have a debate on the editorial line, it’s like saying, ‘Yes—but,’ ” he later told me. “In these conditions, that is unthinkable.”","452","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Ben Ahmed, who is thirty-nine, works as a liaison between residents and the local government in Bondy—a suburb, northeast of Paris, in an area called Department 93. For decades a bastion of the old working class and the Communist Party, the 93 is now known for its residents of Arab and African origin. To many Parisians, the 93 signifies decayed housing projects, crime, unemployment, and Muslims. France has all kinds of suburbs, but the word for them, banlieues, has become pejorative, meaning slums dominated by immigrants. Inside the banlieues are the cités: colossal concrete housing projects built during the postwar decades, in the Brutalist style of Le Corbusier. Conceived as utopias for workers, they have become concentrations of poverty and social isolation. The cités and their occupants are the subject of anxious and angry discussion in France. Two recent books by the eminent political scientist Gilles Kepel, “Banlieue de la République” and “Quatre-vingt-treize” (“Ninety-three”), are studies in industrial decline and growing segregation by group identity. There’s a French pejorative for that, too: communautarisme.","453","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"After the Charlie massacre—and after a third terrorist, Amedy Coulibaly, gunned down a black policewoman outside a Jewish school and four Jews at a kosher supermarket—there was a widespread feeling, in France and elsewhere, that the killings were somehow related to the banlieues. But an exact connection is not easy to establish. Although these alienated communities are increasingly prone to anti-Semitism, the profiles of French jihadists don’t track closely with class; many have come from bourgeois families. The sense of exclusion in the banlieues is an acute problem that the republic has neglected for decades, but more jobs and better housing won’t put an end to French jihadism.","454","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Ben Ahmed has lived in the 93 his entire life. A few years ago, he and his wife, Carolina, and their two children moved into a small house near Charles de Gaulle Airport. They wanted to be near a private school that the children attend, because most public schools in the 93 are overcrowded and chaotic, and staffed by younger, less qualified teachers. Ben Ahmed spent his teens in one of the toughest suburbs, Bobigny, in a notorious cité called l’Abreuvoir. During his twenties and early thirties, Ben Ahmed was employed by the Bobigny government as a community organizer, working with troubled youth—some of them his friends and neighbors, many just out of prison or headed there. His authority on life in the cités exceeds that of any scholar.","455","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"After the attacks, Ben Ahmed wrote an open letter to President François Hollande titled “All Partly Responsible, but Not Guilty.” He identified himself as a banlieue resident who had often “seen death a few metres from me.” He wrote about the problems of joblessness, discrimination, and collective withdrawal from society. He recalled that, in October, 2001, a soccer game in Paris between France and Algeria—the first such match since Algerian independence, in 1962—had to be called off when thousands of French youths of North African origin booed the “Marseillaise” and invaded the field, some chanting, “Bin Laden, bin Laden!” The French public responded with righteous revulsion. “The problem was before our eyes,” Ben Ahmed wrote. “But instead of asking good questions, we chose stigmatization, refusal of the other.” He went on, “The split was born on that day, the feeling of rejection expressed by the political class, when we could have asked other questions: What’s wrong? What’s the problem?”","456","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Ben Ahmed wears sharp dark suits, even on weekends, as if such formality were the only way for an Arab from the 93 to be taken seriously. When I met him, soon after the attacks, he told me, “In French, we say, ‘Clothes don’t make the monk’—but they do, unfortunately.” For the same reason, he always speaks proper French, not the accented slang of the banlieues. He shaves his head close, the black stubble of his hairline descending to a widow’s peak. He has a broad, boyish face and a disarming smile; as he shuttles around the 93, with quick, lock-kneed strides, he seems to know everyone by name. But as a youth in l’Abreuvoir he had to learn to fight—he trained at boxe française, a form of kickboxing—and his eyes can turn hooded and flat under stress. Two years ago, upon entering a cinema with his children, Ben Ahmed noticed that a patron was carrying a shotgun. (The man was out to settle scores with his wife and her lover.) Ben Ahmed told his children to lie down, stalked the gunman for thirty feet, then grabbed him from behind and took him to the floor in a Brazilian-jujitsu chokehold. After security guards arrived, Ben Ahmed escorted his children into a screening of “Man of Steel.”","457","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Ben Ahmed had been nurturing political ambitions, and the incident made him a neighborhood hero. He decided to run for local office. “I have an ability to talk with everyone, because I respect the other,” he told me. “I think there’s always some good at the bottom of everyone.” Ben Ahmed’s wife and friends consider him a little naïve, but naïveté is almost a requirement for a banlieue Muslim entering French politics during a national-identity crisis.","458","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"The highway that encircles Paris is known as the Périphérique. Entering or leaving the suburbs is often called “crossing the Périphérique,” as if it were a frontier. Banlieue residents joke that going into Paris requires a visa and a vaccination card. Mehdi Meklat, a young writer at Bondy Blog, which reports on the banlieues, told me, “There are two parallel worlds.” He called the dynamic between Paris and the suburbs “schizophrenic.”","459","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"The R.E.R., the rail network linking Paris to its suburbs, takes you from the Gare du Nord to Ben Ahmed’s station in just nineteen minutes. The trip begins in a tunnel, and when the train emerges the boulevards lined with bistro awnings are gone. Even the weather seems different—damp and murky, with a wind blowing from the southwest. (The suburbs of the 93 grew around factories that had been situated northeast of Paris in order to allow industrial smells to drift away from the City of Light.) The rail tracks cut through a disordered landscape of graffiti-covered walls, glass office buildings, soccer fields, trash fires, abandoned industrial lots, modest houses with red tile roofs, and clusters of twenty-story monoliths—the cités.","460","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"The banlieues are far more diverse than the ghettos of American cities. On the R.E.R., I saw a man speaking Tamil on his cell phone; an Asian woman watching her two boys; North African women in every variety of hijab, or in none; an elderly white man; a black man in a blazer reading the sports section; an Arab begging in the aisle with a child in his arms. Wealthy neighborhoods stand next door to poor ones, privately owned houses are interspersed with housing projects, and people of every color and religion shop in the commercial centers. In a dingy little restaurant in Montreuil, on an empty street near a cité, Arab men were served by a white waitress. The banlieues have housed generations of immigrants, and the older tide of Portuguese, Italians, and Poles hasn’t completely gone out with the more recent waves of Arabs, Africans, and Chinese. The suburbs are thought to remain majority white, though no one knows for sure because, in France, collecting statistics by ethnicity or religion is illegal. (A precise count isn’t necessary for the cités: they are overwhelmingly Arab and black.)","461","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"For all their vitality, the banlieues feel isolated from the city, and from France itself. Parisians and tourists rarely visit them, and residents complain that journalists drop in only to report on car burnings and drug shootings. The suburb Clichy-sous-Bois—the scene, in 2005, of youth riots that spread across the country—has tried to raise revenue by offering a tour de banlieue for curious outsiders. Many suburban residents, meanwhile, never even think of going to Paris. Compared with American slums, the banlieues have relatively decent standards of housing and safety, but the psychological distance between the 93 and the Champs-Elysées can feel insuperable—much greater than that between the Bronx and Times Square. The apartment blocks in the cités, often arranged around a pharmacy, a convenience store, and a fast-food joint, look inward. Many have no street addresses, obvious points of entry, or places to park. The sense of separation is heightened by the names of the surrounding streets and schools, preserved from a historical France that has little connection to residents’ lives. The roads around Gros Saule—a drug-ridden cité where the police dare not enter—include Rue Henri Matisse and Rue Claude Debussy.","462","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"

It’s also about having relationships at your disposal, a network.” Meklat and Abdallah, who are in their twenties, told me about weeklong internships required of French ninth graders. Most of their classmates ended up in lousy little bakeries or pharmacies, or with nothing, because corporations wouldn’t answer queries from the children of immigrants in the 93.","463","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Being from the banlieues is a serious impediment to employability, and nearly every resident I met had a story about discrimination. Fanta Ba, the daughter of Senegalese immigrants, has taken to sending out job applications using her middle name, France, and Frenchifying her last name to Bas, but she remains out of work. Whenever she hears of a terrorist attack in France, she prays, “Don’t let it be an Arab, a black, a Muslim.” On January 7th, she turned off the TV and avoided Facebook for two days. She couldn’t bear to rewatch the violent images or hear that all Muslims bore some responsibility. “To have to say, ‘I am Charlie’ or ‘I am a Muslim and I condemn this’—it’s too much,” she said. “It wasn’t me.

To receive state benefits, he had to meet with a job counsellor. Aniba told me that the counsellor, wanting to help, said, “You don’t have an aunt who lives in Paris or somewhere else? Because Bobigny—really? Cité Grémillon?” This was the French equivalent of Shitsville. The counsellor advised, “If you have an address in Paris, a post-office box, just to receive mail, it’s better.

"Simply defining who is French can make small talk tricky. When people ask Widad Ketfi, a thirty-year-old journalist, where she’s from, she replies, “Bondy,” but that never ends the conversation. “Of what origin?” “French.” “Where are your parents from?” “France!” Even citizens of immigrant descent often identify whites with the term Français de souche—“French from the roots.” The implication is that people with darker skin are not fully French.","467","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Fanta Ba said, “You do everything for France, to be accepted, but you feel you’re not welcome.” This is especially true for Muslims. In a poll taken by Le Monde after the attacks, a majority of respondents agreed that Islam is incompatible with French values. In a cité like Trappes, where Ba grew up, some Muslims have separated from French society: women are disappearing under the black abaya; men are dropping out of school to sell Islamic clothing online. Ba doesn’t cover her hair, but she has become more observant as she struggles with being jobless and alone. Withdrawal, she said, was often a reaction to exclusion.","468","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"In the 2012 elections, nine of the five hundred and seventy-seven seats in France’s National Assembly were won by nonwhite candidates—an increase of eight seats. France remains a caste society where social capital is king. It’s ruled by les énarques—graduates of the prestigious École Nationale d’Administration, in Strasbourg. According to Laurent Bouvet, a political scientist, an élite degree is the only guarantee of finding a good job in a country that’s mired in economic torpor. This is increasingly true in America, too, but the U.S. absorbs immigrants far more easily than France. What the two countries have in common—and what makes them unique—is a national identity based not just on history, blood, soil, and culture but on the idea of popular sovereignty. In France, this is called republicanism, and in theory the idea is universal. In practice, being part of the French republic has to do not just with democracy and secularism but also with what you wear, what you eat, and what you name your children.","469","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"In 2007, a national immigration museum opened in the Porte Dorée, an Art Deco palace in eastern Paris which was built for a colonial exposition in 1931. Tradition requires French Presidents to inaugurate national museums, but Nicolas Sarkozy, who had used immigration as a wedge issue in his election campaign, refused to attend. The Musée de l’Histoire de l’Immigration opened without official ceremony. (Last December, after seven years, Hollande, a Socialist, finally inaugurated it.) When I went to the museum, in February, there were few visitors, and many Parisians remain unaware of its existence.","470","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"That struck me as a missed opportunity, for the exhibitions tell a rich story, going back to the mid-nineteenth century, when France was receiving new immigrants while the rest of Europe was creating them. As recently as the nineteen-thirties, France had the world’s highest number of immigrants per capita. The museum’s placards offer historical reassurance: “The figure of the unassimilable foreigner accompanies every wave of immigrants. From the Italians at the end of the nineteenth century to the Africans of today, the stereotypes hardly change: immigrants are too numerous, carriers of disease, potential criminals, aliens in the body of the nation. This xenophobia, recurring in times of crisis, is often paired with anti-Semitism and fed by racism.”","471","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"The least digestible aspect of France’s colonial past is Algeria. When Algeria was settled by Europeans, in the early nineteenth century, it became part of greater France, and remained so until 1962, when independence was achieved, after an eight-year war in which seven hundred thousand people died. It’s hard to overstate how heavily this intimate, sad history has been repressed. “The Battle of Algiers,” the filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo’s neo-realist masterpiece about insurgency, counterinsurgency, terrorism, and torture in Algiers, was banned in France for five years after its release, in 1966, and it remains taboo there. On October 17, 1961, during demonstrations by pro-independence Algerians in Paris and its suburbs, the French police killed some two hundred people, throwing many bodies off bridges into the Seine. It took forty years for France to acknowledge that this massacre had occurred, and the incident remains barely mentioned in schools. Young people in the banlieues told me that colonial history is cursorily taught, and literature from former colonies hardly read.","472","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Andrew Hussey, a British scholar at the University of London School of Advanced Study in Paris, believes that the turmoil in the banlieues—periodic riots, car burnings, brawls with cops—is one more front in the long war between France and its Arabs, especially Algerians. The aim of the violence isn’t reform or revolution but revenge. “The kids in the banlieues live in this perpetual present of weed, girls, gangsters, Islam,” he said. “They have no sense of history, no sense of where they come from in North Africa, other than localized bits of Arabic that they don’t understand, bits of Islam that don’t really make sense.”","473","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Hussey’s recent book, “The French Intifada,” describes the conflict in such dire terms that his French publisher refused to release a translation. His banlieue research is less nuanced than that of Kepel (the phrase “French intifada” drew laughs of disbelief when I mentioned it to some banlieue residents), but it’s vivid and firsthand. The book opens with an eyewitness account of an eight-hour battle, in the Gare du Nord in 2007, between cops and banlieue kids who shout, in Arabic, “Fuck France!” Hussey writes, “This slogan—it is in fact more of a curse—has nothing to do with any French tradition of revolt.” But his portrait leaves out all the banlieue residents who are trying to be both Muslim and French—people like Fouad Ben Ahmed.","474","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"One night, at a Thai restaurant in the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, Ben Ahmed said, “I barely know my history. It’s not taught, and because it’s painful my mother and my grandfather never told me.” Still, he knew the basics of the French-Algerian War, and he spoke about the pieds-noirs—French settlers in Algeria who, after independence, fled what they considered their homeland—and the Harkis, Algerian Muslims who supported French rule and were demonized by other Algerians. At the end of the war, neither country made a place for citizens with conflicting allegiances and identities: Algeria became an Arab state, and France cauterized its wounds by pretending that the conflict hadn’t happened. Among the pieds-noirs, Harkis, and Algerians who immigrated to France for economic reasons, guilt and recrimination have impeded a candid reckoning with their shared pasts. Ben Ahmed said, “And since neither our parents nor the state tells us this history, other people come along to tell us lies in order to justify things that are unjustifiable.” He meant jihadists.","475","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Ben Ahmed’s grandfather was an Algerian who enlisted in the French Army and immigrated to the Paris banlieues in 1958. Most immigrants of that period entered France as laborers—factory hands, street-cleaners—and lived in shantytowns. Their presence was expected to be temporary. When it became clear that most of the immigrants weren’t returning home, the shantytowns were cleared and the workers were moved into the cités. Ben Ahmed’s grandfather, with his military pay, was able to afford a small house in the 93. Ben Ahmed’s mother was a secretary in a metallurgical factory; his father disappeared when Fouad was two. He grew up in relative ease in his grandparents’ house until 1989, when they sold it. Ben Ahmed was thirteen.","476","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"

L’Abreuvoir had been considered innovative when it was built, in the sixties, with undulating rows of four-story low-rises and green circular towers. But by the nineties it had become a center of heroin trafficking. Once, Ben Ahmed walked into the lobby of his building and saw a man holding a bag of drugs and a wad of cash. “Get out of here, or I’ll take care of you,” the man said.

Some of his friends were drug dealers, and Ben Ahmed might have become a criminal, too, had he not met Carolina, the daughter of political refugees from Chile. When they were eighteen, she told Ben Ahmed to choose between his crowd and her.

(“Bobigny is like a village,” J.-P. said.) J.-P. was a métis: Arab father, white mother. His grandfather had emigrated from Algeria in 1954, and became a street-cleaner. His father belonged to what J.-P. called “an uprooted generation, with their ass on two chairs”—unwanted by both the old country and the new. J.-P.’s father is still alive, but most of his father’s friends died young, from violence, drugs, or AIDS. J.-P. grew up a tattooed devotee of “Scarface” and Tupac Shakur. At fourteen, he was expelled from school and began selling drugs and stealing. “When people lay down the law with violence, to get the last word you have to be the most violent,” J.-P. said. He didn’t see himself as a victim. “I was a little asshole. I chose to get into it. I should’ve tried not to go down that path.

The legislation affirmed the century-old French concept of laïcité, or secularism, which enshrines state neutrality toward religion and prevents religion from intruding into the civic space. (In America, the intent of secularism was nearly the reverse, prohibiting state interference in religion.) But many French Muslims interpreted the ban as an act of gratuitous hostility.

Kuhnmunch turned the discussion to the history of secularism. In the banlieues, laïcité has become synonymous with atheism and Islamophobia. Kuhnmunch told her students about the Edict of Nantes, in 1598, when King Henry IV granted rights to French Protestants for the first time. The class discussed laws, passed in the eighteen-eighties, which eliminated religious education in public schools.

J.-P. agreed, but his politics were heavily inflected with a sense of Muslim oppression. If Muslims wanted to go fight in Syria or Iraq, that was their business. France was different. If someone hurt France, he hurt J.-P., too.","505","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"“France is our mother,” J.-P. said as he ate. His own mother was a white Frenchwoman. “Your father, he gives you more—Islam. But your mother is still your mother. And, whatever happens, you’ll love her your whole life. Even if she didn’t cherish you.”","506","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Other Muslims had described themselves as unloved children of the republic. Widad Ketfi, the journalist, said, “If you have children you don’t take care of, a day will come when you tell them, ‘Do this,’ and they’ll say, ‘I don’t give a damn. You’re not my father.’ ” Sometimes French Muslims compete for their father’s love with his other, more favored children—the Jews. Or else they search for another father.","507","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"

"When I met J.-P., he was looking for work. Eventually, Ben Ahmed helped him find a job as a housepainter, with the city of Bondy. But J.-P.’s life was hardly stable. He had a court date pending—he had been charged with armed assault. He told me that he wasn’t too worried about returning to jail, because he was “four hundred per cent innocent.” The first of his prison terms, he told me, had been in Villepinte, near the airport. Among the inmates was Amedy Coulibaly.","509","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Coulibaly, the French son of Malian parents, grew up in a cité south of Paris. At fifteen, he began a career in armed robbery, and during one of his imprisonments, in 2006, he met a newly converted Islamist named Chérif Kouachi. Both twenty-three, they found a mentor in a veteran jihadist named Djamel Beghal, who had been born in Algeria and had brought radical Islamist views with him when he moved to France, in 1987. Beghal visited Afghanistan and became an Al Qaeda operative in 2000; the following year, he was charged in France with plotting to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Paris. From an isolation cell in prison, he managed to communicate with Coulibaly and Kouachi. At one point, Coulibaly used a smuggled camera to shoot video of the prison’s dismal conditions. The footage aired on French TV.","510","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"The leading authority on jihadism in French prisons is an Iranian sociologist in Paris named Farhad Khosrokhavar. For his book “Radicalisation,” published just before the January attacks, he spent three days a week in French prisons for three years, developing a theory of inmate conversion. It happens in stages. Most of the recruits grow up without fathers and without any religious knowledge—only anger and alienation in the banlieues. They fall into crime and end up in prison. J.-P. described the mind-set of some of his fellow-inmates: “I’m in prison, the state is to blame—it pushed me to live this life.” Prisoners watch a lot of TV news, and see war and death in Muslim countries. Someone like Coulibaly, J.-P. said, starts to “mix all this together” and create his own ideology, then “runs across a bad person who influences him.” One former prisoner I met in the 93 explained that Islamists target the fragiles, psychologically weak inmates who never receive visits. They are offered solace, a new identity, and a political vision inverting the social order that places them at the bottom.","511","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"As Khosrokhavar analyzes it, prisoners are “born again”: “Through jihadism, they transform the contempt of the others. . . . Once they become jihadists, people fear them. One of them told me, ‘Once they fear you, they cannot be contemptuous toward you anymore.’ ” After converts are released, they go on an “initiation journey” to the Middle East or North Africa, where they become capable of extreme violence. They come to think “that they belong elsewhere, to the Islamic community, and not to the French society.”","512","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Khosrokhavar estimates that, of France’s sixty-four thousand prisoners, up to sixty per cent are Muslim. (Muslims are thought to compose only eight per cent of the population.) These inmates are served by fewer than two hundred prison imams, many of whom are older immigrants and unable to understand life in the banlieues. France once had many Islamist mosques, but its internal intelligence service rooted out radical imams, and the country’s mosques are now pointedly apolitical. Recruitment, therefore, happens outside the mosque, in prisons or on the Internet. The conversion process rarely involves more than three people, to thwart infiltration. French intelligence estimates the number of suspected jihadists to be three thousand, in a country of sixty-five million people.","513","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Radicalization, then, is not a mass phenomenon in the banlieues. “There are no jihadi pools,” Jean-Pierre Filiu, an Arabist at the élite Paris Institute of Political Studies, said. Becoming a jihadist is a quantum leap requiring self-isolation, a break with one’s upbringing, and dehumanization of non-Muslims.","514","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"In 2007, after Coulibaly was released, he appeared to go straight. He got a short-term job at a Coca-Cola bottling plant, married his girlfriend, Hayat Boumeddiene, in an Islamic ceremony, and met President Sarkozy, at a 2009 event promoting youth employment. But Coulibaly led a double life. He cut himself off from his parents, whom he considered infidels. He stayed in touch with Beghal and Kouachi after their release, meeting in the South of France and supplying them with weapons and money. “When jihadis go on the run, they don’t go to the banlieues,” Filiu said. “They go to the countryside, to a place where you don’t have a Muslim for ten kilometres.”","515","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"In 2010, French police arrested Coulibaly again, finding a stash of ammunition in his apartment. He was convicted of plotting to spring from prison an Islamist who had organized bombings around France in 1995, killing eight people. Coulibaly was sent to Villepinte prison, where J.-P. was serving time. They watched TV and competed on a PlayStation. “He was nice, smiling, pleasant,” J.-P. recalled. “I never saw him bother anyone. He never preached. If someone told me this person was capable of doing what happened, I wouldn’t have bet on that horse.” Coulibaly was released early, in March, 2014. He slipped off the police radar, before surfacing just after the Charlie massacre as the Kouachis’ accomplice and a self-proclaimed soldier of the Islamic State.","516","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"More than the Kouachi brothers, Coulibaly, who was killed by French police during the standoff at the kosher market, became a subject of fascination in the banlieues. The Kouachis were raised as orphans in a provincial institution, and were radicalized in their early twenties, after the invasion of Iraq, by recruiters in the northeast corner of Paris. For the Kouachis, a jihadist destiny seemed overdetermined. Coulibaly was the son of a factory worker, and was raised by both parents in a cité south of Paris. And he was black. France’s high-profile jihadists had been Arabs, from Zacarias Moussaoui, the thwarted “twentieth hijacker” of September 11th, to Mohammed Merah, who murdered three Jewish schoolchildren, a rabbi, and three paratroopers in the Toulouse area, in 2012. A young man of Malian origin told me that, when Coulibaly’s face appeared on French TV, in front of a homemade Islamic State banner, a friend of his mother’s cried out, “Oh, no—now they’ll accuse us. That’s why I tell you not to hang out with Arabs!”","517","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Mehdi Meklat and Badroudine Abdallah, of Bondy Blog, found Coulibaly such an enigma that they considered writing a novel about him. “He could be someone we know,” Meklat said. And yet Coulibaly had cast himself in the role of a great man. At the kosher supermarket, after killing three customers and an employee, he calmly introduced himself to his fifteen hostages, saying, “Je suis Amedy Coulibaly. I am Malian and Muslim. I belong to the Islamic State.” (Abdallah noted the eerie echo of “Je suis Charlie.”)","518","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"In videos made just before the attack and posted after his death, Coulibaly keeps changing costume, as if to emphasize his transformation. He wears a gangbanger’s leather jacket in one, a military flak vest in another, a turban and the white robe of a martyr in a third. Always, an automatic is at his side. “It was as if, for him, he didn’t exist enough,” Abdallah said. “It wasn’t enough to be a normal guy.”","519","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"From the supermarket, Coulibaly contacted the media, asking to speak with the police and pledging allegiance to the Islamic State. During the siege, he angrily justified his actions to his hostages, citing the incarceration of Muslims, hostility toward women wearing the hijab, Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, and French military action in Mali and Syria. He demanded to know why, if French citizens could rally together after the Charlie massacre, they had never demonstrated on behalf of persecuted Muslims. “I was born in France,” he declared.","520","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Abdallah and Meklat noted that, in 2000, during an armed robbery, the police had shot and killed a close friend of Coulibaly’s right in front of him. Coulibaly, in other words, was a fragile. It wasn’t hard to get him to “go against French society,” Abdallah said, because France had already rejected him. In this explanation, a fairly direct line could be drawn between Coulibaly’s life in the Paris suburbs and terrorism. But this didn’t account for why almost no other banlieusards—including criminals who had been subject to worse indignities—had committed mass murder against schoolchildren, Jews, and cartoonists. The social explanation, used commonly on the left in France and the U.S., oddly mirrors the right’s tendency to make an amalgame—to mix up terrorists with all Muslims. Both views suggest that an evil deed can be attributed largely to a perpetrator’s social or religious identity. In addition to insulting the vast majority of French Muslims, this analysis fails to treat Coulibaly as an individual. And it ignores the fact that he had adopted a set of beliefs. In one of Coulibaly’s videos, he describes his motives in the stark terms of ideology: “What we’re doing is totally legitimate given what you’re doing. It’s vengeance. You attack the caliphate, you attack the Islamic State? We attack you. You’re the ones killing. Why—because we uphold Sharia? Even in our own land we can’t uphold Sharia. You get to decide what happens on earth?”","521","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Another youth whom Ben Ahmed tried to help was named Stéphane. He came from a Catholic Haitian family and grew up near his friend J.-P., in a cité in Bobigny. When Stéphane was thirteen, his father died and he became so disruptive at school that he was expelled. He turned to petty crime, and he and his friends regularly drank themselves into a stupor.","522","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"At sixteen, Stéphane heard someone reciting a verse of the Koran and felt tears come to his eyes. He didn’t understand the words, but the sounds moved him. Most of his friends were Muslims, and he decided to convert. He stopped drinking, and quit a restaurant training program that required him to prepare pork. But he wasn’t ready to go completely straight, and at nineteen he was arrested and sentenced to eighteen months in prison. Inside, he began praying five times a day, and when he got out he vowed to reform his life. He started a business that rented inflatable castles and other equipment for children’s parties, and made a point of hiring unemployed locals. He formed a group that organized excursions for youths in the cités. He married J.-P.’s cousin, and with his earnings he moved to a small house not far from Ben Ahmed’s.","523","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"I met Stéphane there one day in February. We sat at the kitchen table while his wife, who was pregnant, watched TV.

"“The neighborhoods and the environment don’t create it—it’s the people themselves,” he said. Men like Coulibaly “think everything here in this lower world is useless, it’s just a passage. And this ideology that they have—it’s not the fact that you live in a banlieue that gives it to you. It’s your faith.” Stéphane could see that Coulibaly was “fed up” with “the injustice we have here in France.” But even if Coulibaly’s milieu was the context for his actions, it wasn’t the cause. “He reacted—and a lot of people react, you know. But most don’t have such a strong faith to do those acts that he did.”","525","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"

"Stéphane leaned forward, his eyes fixed on mine. He hadn’t said that he admired Coulibaly’s actions, but he hadn’t issued the immediate condemnation made by nearly everyone else I’d met in the 93. Stéphane seemed to be saying that what separated Coulibaly from all the other pissed-off Muslims in the banlieues was the intensity of his convictions.","528","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Andrew Hussey, the British scholar in Paris, described the intoxicating, mystical quality of jihadism. “It’s not an ideology of social conditions,” he said. “This is not about poverty, this is not about improving people’s conditions. It’s about hatred, to some extent. Purification.” He likened it to the Fascism of the nineteen-thirties. Jihadism doesn’t have the contours of ordinary politics. “This will turn you from ‘I am nothing’ to ‘I should be everything,’ ” Hussey said. Jihadism attracted both wealthy insiders like bin Laden and poor outsiders like Coulibaly. It was “a floating ideology, like the cloud—you’ve just got to lock onto it.”","529","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"

"Injustice toward Muslims led Stéphane straight to the Jews. They were, he believed, a privileged community in France. They exploited their historical tragedy and French guilt to acquire power. He pointed out that in Drancy, another banlieue in the 93, a memorial museum stands across from the cité that had been France’s main transit center for Jews destined for concentration camps. “But they don’t recognize the slavery that there was in Haiti, in Africa, everywhere,” he said. The Shoah was a crime. “But why recognize one and not another? You have to be equal. We say ‘égalité, fraternité.’ ”","532","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"The crime of slavery couldn’t be acknowledged, because of the vast fortunes made from it. France had given money to Israel as compensation for the French role in the Holocaust—imagine what it would cost to make reparations for slavery! Coulibaly had chosen his target carefully, Stéphane said: “It’s a symbol, to say that, with all the injustice here, stop focussing on the threats to one religion.”","533","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"I asked why Coulibaly hadn’t directed his anger at a church, given that most of France’s citizens are Catholic. “Because France isn’t controlled by the Christians,” Stéphane said. He claimed that France’s tiny population of Jews controls the National Assembly, the media, and the banks. The Prime Minister, Manuel Valls, is married to a Jew, and, according to Stéphane, that was why he went on TV after the attacks and said, “France without Jews is not France.” Valls didn’t say, “France isn’t France without Muslims.”","534","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Stéphane had only praise for Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front. “The real French, Français de souche, they see that France is now controlled by the Jews,” he said. I asked if Le Pen, who is known for having anti-immigrant views, posed a threat to French Muslims. “When I see Valls, I think Islamophobe,” Stéphane said. “Marine Le Pen, I think pure French who wants to give everything to the French. Understand?”","535","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"“Does that include you?”","536","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"“Me?

"Ben Ahmed had known Stéphane for years, and had admired that he cared enough about kids in the cités to volunteer his time and help. His successful business also offered inspiration to banlieue residents. But after the January attacks they argued.

"Ben Ahmed was being too sanguine. If there were only around three thousand potential jihadists in France, there were far more anti-Semites—many of them Français de souche. A generation ago, Muslims and Jews lived together in the banlieues with the sociability of immigrant neighbors. Today, few Jews remain in the banlieues, and those who do downplay their identity.

"The old anti-Semitism of the French right and the newer immigrant strain were united in 2008, when Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the National Front, became godfather to the third child of Dieudonné M’bala M’bala, the French-Cameroonian comedian, who turns Jew-baiting into lucrative entertainment. Dieudonné has an avid following in the banlieues—Stéphane’s views about Jews could have been lifted from a Dieudonné monologue. Unless you’re already on his team, Dieudonné is distinctly unfunny. His 2012 film, “The Anti-Semite,” begins with a mock silent movie, with jaunty piano accompaniment, in which Dieudonné plays an American soldier who’s just liberated Auschwitz. (If only historical ignorance were the movie’s main failing.) A grovelling prisoner shows him around the camp. Inside a gas chamber, Dieudonné dabs his neck with Zyklon B, as if it were cologne; in the crematorium, he mistakes children’s remains for chicken bones. When he sits in a leather armchair, the prisoner tells him, “Careful, you’re sitting on my grandma!”","547","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Dieudonné has spread anti-Semitism beyond extremist circles into popular culture. In Montreuil, I met a restaurant health inspector, Saïd Allam, who is a fan. “Dieudonné is the same as Charlie Hebdo—it’s satire,” Allam said. “He does sketches to make people laugh at Jews, Charlie Hebdo does cartoons of the Prophet to make people laugh—it’s the same thing.” After the massacres, Dieudonné wrote on his Facebook page, with typical slyness, “I feel I’m Charlie Coulibaly.” In response, the authorities prosecuted him for supporting terrorism, and he’s been convicted several times for inciting racial hatred; this has led his admirers to accuse the government of a double standard. “People say, ‘In killing Charlie Hebdo you killed freedom of expression,’ ” Allam said. “But you already killed freedom of expression in sending Dieudonné to court.” Complaints about double standards displaced the horror of the killings with a more comfortable sense of victimization. The argument that Charlie attacks religious politics, whereas Dieudonné goes after Jews, was far too subtle for the fraught atmosphere that prevailed after January 7th. So was the notion that hate-speech laws are inherently problematic, not least because they’re bound to inspire charges of selective application.","548","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Ben Ahmed detested Dieudonné. “He’s the only comedian who could gather in one room Islamophobes, anti-Semites, and anti-élites, and make them all laugh,” he said. “Not because it’s funny, but out of hatred.”","549","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"In 2006, a multiracial gang led by Youssouf Fofana, a criminal of Ivorian descent, kidnapped a Jewish cell-phone salesman named Ilan Halimi and took him to a cité south of Paris. The gang wanted ransom money. According to an associate of the gang, Fofana believed that the state considered him a slave, and that “Jews were kings, because they ate the state’s money.” Fofana, assuming that all Jews were rich, demanded four hundred and fifty thousand euros. But Halimi’s family couldn’t afford this, and the kidnappers tortured Halimi—with punches, lit cigarettes, acid, and, finally, knives.","550","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"After twenty-four days, Halimi was found, naked and mutilated, tied to a tree in a park south of Paris. He died en route to the hospital. During his long agony, at least fifty people in the cité—from gang members to neighbors—knew that something was going on, but no one called the police.","551","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"In a sense, the Halimi case was even more troubling than the January attacks. Because so many residents had sanctioned the violence, it suggested that lawlessness and hate had become endemic in the banlieues. Marc Weitzmann, a novelist who is writing a book about French anti-Semitism, said that, in the banlieues, a hatred of Jews “is in the background of the values they grow up with—it’s ready to be activated as soon as they move from nihilistic delinquency to the search for meaning.” For some residents, anti-Semitism can be the path toward radicalism.","552","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Ben Ahmed said that he had two jobs in the 93: “to correct bad ideas in religion, and to end the stigmatization of that religion.” It was a difficult balancing act. What if correcting bad ideas led to more stigmatization of Islam?

"Allam, the restaurant health inspector from Montreuil, lamented the fact that the killings were labelled “an Islamist act.” He added, “It’s very, very serious to say that, because it implicates a religion in murderous acts.” If a blond man killed cartoonists for caricaturing blonds, he argued, people would call him crazy. “And a guy who kills people in the name of religion is a crazy man.”","554","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"But the words “Islamic” and “Islamist” are not the same, and allow a crucial political distinction to be made between ordinary believers and ideologues—a distinction that protects Muslims from being equated with jihadists.

"More than fifteen hundred French citizens have left to join the Islamic State—a quarter of the European total. Around two hundred of them have returned to France. A growing number of these new recruits have no connection to the banlieues. According to Farhad Khosrokhavar, the majority of French Muslims going to Syria are now middle-class youths, some of them white converts to Islam, and an increasing percentage of them female. They come from big cities and small towns. “They do not belong to broken families,” Khosrokhavar said. Their radicalization can happen in a very short time, a matter of weeks, usually through social media. They go to the Middle East because they’re moved by the plight of fellow-Muslims. Once there, some are shocked by the Islamic State’s violence and try to return home; others are seduced by it.","575","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"A few days before the January attacks, Hayat Boumeddiene, Coulibaly’s wife, flew from Madrid to Turkey, then crossed into Syria. A security camera at the Istanbul airport captured her entry into Turkey, alongside a young man with a thin beard, his long black hair tied back in a bun. He was a twenty-three-year-old from the 93 named Mehdi Belhoucine. His older brother, Mohamed, had become radicalized through the Internet around 2009, and afterward relayed messages for a network of French jihadists headed for central Asia. Mohamed and Mehdi were now believed to be in Syria. The brothers had been excellent students—Mohamed had done advanced studies in mine engineering, Mehdi in electronic mechanics—and were from a middle-class family who lived in a private house. Ben Ahmed knew their mother, who worked with him at Bondy’s city hall. “Very nice lady,” he said. “It’s too, too sad.”","576","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Sylvine Thomassin, the mayor of Bondy, told me, “I had a clear view of jihadism before January—families with educational deficiencies, parents who hadn’t done well, kids failing at school.” It was, she said, a weirdly “reassuring diagram,” because it made the pathway of radicalism seem predictable. Then came the stunning news of the Belhoucine brothers’ connection to the authors of the Paris attacks. The mayor, who knew the Belhoucines well, now found it impossible to come up with a profile. “Our Muslim fellow-citizens live overwhelmingly in public housing, and the majority are confronted with the same problems as those who are radicalized, and yet they aren’t radicalized,” she said. “So the problem definitely isn’t the banlieues. Perhaps it’s the hypersensitivity of a very small number to this discourse around them.”","577","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Xavier Nogueras, a defense lawyer in Paris, represents twenty French citizens accused of jihadism. A few of his clients are violent and dangerous, he said, but many went to Syria out of idealism, wanting to defend other Muslims against the Assad regime and build an Islamic state. He argued that such people pose no threat to France and that the state shouldn’t permanently embitter them with years of detention. Nogueras resisted tracing his clients’ motives to social conditions in the banlieues. Few have criminal backgrounds; some had well-paid jobs in large French companies. “The most surprising thing to me is their immense humanity,” Nogueras said. He finds jihadists more interesting than the drug dealers and robbers he’s represented. “They have more to say—many more ideas. Their sacred book demands the application of Sharia, which tells them to cover their wives, not to live in secularism. And we are in a country that inevitably stigmatizes them, because it’s secular. They don’t feel at home here.”","578","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"I found the lawyer’s distinction between jihadism at home and abroad less than reassuring. Coulibaly’s faith could have led him to kill people in Paris or in Syria; violence driven by ideology could happen anywhere. The “idealism” of clients motivated to make Sharia universal law is, in some ways, more worrying than simple thuggery: even if France dedicates itself urgently to making its Muslims full-fledged children of the republic, a small minority of them will remain, on principle, irreconcilable.","579","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"On a commercial street in the 93, in a sparsely furnished apartment with no name on the buzzer, Sonia Imloul, a social worker of Algerian origin, meets with families of radicalized young people. Cases come to her through police departments or through government agencies that have been contacted by the families, on a hot line. Sitting down at the kitchen table, Imloul lit a cigarette and said, “I’ve had children of doctors, journalists, generals. I’d say it’s almost a national epidemic.” She remains “super-vigilant” about her fourteen-year-old son.","580","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Imloul’s method is to maintain a young person’s ties to his or her family before an “initiation journey” occurs. “The family often has the answer, without knowing it,” she said. Radicalization has been a phenomenon in France for thirty years; devising a proper solution may take another thirty. The problem is acute in France, Imloul said, partly because the republic’s rigid secularism leaves no room for serious discussions of religious identity. “With a radical, if you don’t talk to him about religion, you can’t talk about anything,” she said. France has taken an entirely punitive approach to the problem. Imloul’s “prevention cell” is the only such program in the country.","581","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"The January attacks created a genuine sense of crisis, and Prime Minister Valls made passionate speeches condemning the “geographic, social, ethnic apartheid” that denies French citizens in places like the 93 full entry into the republic. Thomassin, the mayor of Bondy (and Ben Ahmed’s boss), showed me a map to pinpoint where high-rise cités are being torn down and replaced by smaller buildings surrounded by green space. The goal was to encourage a new spirit of neighborliness. The mayor of Le Blanc-Mesnil, another banlieue in the 93, described a similar plan, along New Urbanist lines, that allowed public-housing renters to become homeowners. I got the feeling that, after decades of denial, France was now playing catch-up.","582","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"“We’re at war, but not against a religion,” Valls said. France was “at war to defend our values, which are universal.” He urged French Muslims to see it as their struggle, too. “It is a war against terrorism and radical Islamism, against everything that aims to break our solidarity, liberty, fraternity.”","583","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"For two or three decades, a soft multiculturalism has been the default politics of the governing left, while France’s silent majority, more and more culturally insecure, has moved rightward, and the banlieues have been allowed to rot. The National Front voter and the radicalized Muslim feel equally abandoned. According to the political scientist Laurent Bouvet, the January attacks, like an underwater bomb, brought all these trends to the surface. “Secularism is our common good,” Bouvet said. “If there is a common French identity, it’s not an identity of roots, it’s not a Christian identity, it’s not cathedrals, it’s not the white race. It’s a political project.” He went on, “If we let the National Front define French identity, it’s going to be by race, by blood, by religion.”","584","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"France has an official “rapporteur général” for secularism, and currently it is an earnest young Socialist politician named Nicolas Cadène. He told me that France had failed to create a national story that included all its citizens. The shock of the attacks and the divisive fallout made a new approach imperative, and he sketched a program of reform starting with the schools: explain the meaning of secularism while teaching “impartial, neutral” facts about different religions as a way to make students more tolerant and critical-minded; integrate more colonial history into the curriculum; encourage the teaching of Arabic in public schools, so that this wasn’t left to madrassas. Some of these changes will be instituted this fall.","585","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Jean-Pierre Filiu, the Arabist, told me that, for more than a decade, Sciences Po—the social-science institution where he teaches—has been admitting a portion of each new class on the basis of slightly different entrance criteria. French law forbids discrimination by ethnicity or religion, so Sciences Po uses geography instead. “We want to bring in students from the 93,” Filiu said. “I’ve been sitting on those juries, and the banlieues are among the best, because you have la niaque”—heart, a fighting instinct. I thought of what such a chance would have meant to Ben Ahmed.","586","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"
"Elections in France’s hundred departments were scheduled for late March. Ben Ahmed decided to run as a Socialist to represent Bobigny. When his campaign posters were defaced with swastikas and racist graffiti—“Dirty Arab”—he ignored it. He spent nights and weekends leafletting and shaking hands in his old hangouts. The residents greeted him as one of them, but many thought that voting was pointless. He told his most resistant neighbors—the old women in full hijab, the jobless men at the corner bar, J.-P. and his gang—that they couldn’t abstain if they wanted to be equal citizens.","587","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france"

"Until last night, according to my local CBS affiliate’s nightly news broadcast, the most-watched episode of “Late Show with David Letterman” was a 1994 episode featuring Michael J. Fox, the Spin Doctors, and Roger Daltrey. The newscast played a clip of Daltrey talking about “yobs,” and then the anchors thanked Letterman, threw their cards at the screen, and clapped. It was a sendoff as folksy and humble as one Letterman might have designed for himself. Then his final show began—his six thousand and twenty-eighth, after thirty-three years—and he one-upped it. “Our long national nightmare is over,” Gerald Ford said, in the clip from his inauguration speech. Then George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama said it too, with game Presidential solemnity. (Where was Jimmy Carter, you wonder, who seems like the most fun of the whole gang?) “Letterman is retiring,” Obama said, gravely. The camera pulled back to show Letterman beside him, wincing, and then a voice-over introduced the show: “From a magical place not found on any map!” it began. It was all delightfully Letterman.","May 21, 2015","589","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/goodbye-dave"
"When Letterman was announced, and we watched the stage, there was a long pause. Was he backstage, doing some kind of ceremonial thing with the crew? Was he having a moment? When he came out, it would be the beginning of the end. When he did come out, not surprisingly, the standing ovation and crazed cheering didn’t stop for a long time. Another characteristic moment: after saying “thank you” over and over, Letterman seemed uncomfortable, because he couldn’t start the show. He started saying, “I don’t know what to do!”","590","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/goodbye-dave"
"When the applause subsided, he said, “Now we don’t have time for the giving-gifts-to-the audience segment.” I’ll miss this attitude—the huge TV star who dryly made fun of what TV was to begin with and what it had become. Then, the line of the night: “I’ll be honest with you—it’s beginning to look like I’m not going to get ‘The Tonight Show.’ ” One of the pleasures of the past few weeks has been the increasingly freewheeling Leno mockery, the “Tonight Show”-great-injustice stuff, and the praise of Johnny Carson, stated or understood. Not only that: despite everything—all the drama with Leno in all directions (the Carson-successor episode that stung Letterman and sent him to CBS; the Conan absurdities; the ratings)—it seems that, in many ways, Letterman won. In old clips, he talks about Carson’s longevity as a host, in admiring, uncomprehending tones; now he’s been on longer than Carson, and Leno is just a memory, a zillionaire waxing his dozens of fancy cars. The actual “Tonight Show,” a big success with Jimmy Fallon, isn’t exactly “The Tonight Show” anymore. Letterman was the true inheritor of what Carson’s show meant to people who care about it. His departure is the end of that TV era.","591","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/goodbye-dave"
"“You know what I’m going to do now that I’m retired?” he asked, in his monologue. “By God, I hope to become the new face of Scientology.” I’m going to miss his saying “By God,” the stodgy Midwesternness that seemed both genuine and intentional. He said that in the future, “When I screw up, and lord knows I’ll be screwin’ up, I’ll have to go on somebody else’s show to apologize.” (Memories of his 2009 sex scandal hovered around, unmentioned, as did memories of his 2000 quintuple bypass, mentioned. That was the first time we thought we’d lost him.) He said, “When we started this show, the hottest show on TV was ‘Keeping Up with the Gabors.’ ” It seemed audacious to even make a Gabor joke in 2015, and I appreciate that kind of audacity. He went to commercial with a clip of a “Wheel of Fortune” guest correctly guessing, with only three letters to go on, the phrase “GOOD RIDDANCE TO DAVID LETTERMAN.”","592","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/goodbye-dave"
"After the weeks of wild and tender sendoffs from fellow-comedians and hosts, and guests ranging from Julia Roberts and Norm McDonald to Bob Dylan and Bill Murray, who jumped out of a cake and covered Letterman and half the studio with frosting, the final show was a reasonable, professional affair. He wished “nothing but success” to his successor, Stephen Colbert, who will begin in September; he played clips of himself in some “Kids Say the Darndest Things”-inspired segments, in which one kid referred to a place to buy turkeys as “an upholstery farm”; he played historic clips of Andy Kaufman, Larry (Bud) Melman, and others, many from the NBC years; he did one last Top Ten list, full of celebrities, who came out and saluted him: Alec Baldwin, Barbara Walters, Steve Martin, Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Carrey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Murray again, Tina Fey, and, most excitingly to Letterman, Peyton Manning. No. 5 was Chris Rock, who said, “I’m just glad your show is being given to another white guy.” “You know I had nothing to do with that!” Letterman called out.","593","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/goodbye-dave"
"He played some more clips and a behind-the scenes reel, and then said of his weeks of sendoffs and praise, “I can’t tell you how flattering, embarrassing, and gratifying it has all been.” Of his thousands of episodes, he said, “I was here for most of them, and I can tell you that a pretty high percentage of those shows just absolutely sucked.” He thanked his band and his crew (they “take great care and put up with my nonsense”), Les Moonves, who has been “more than patient with me” (another hint of 2009), his “researchers, who work in some sort of subterranean pit”; the control room; the writers (“men and women who are smarter than I am and funnier than I am”)—historically, not many women, but O.K.—his longtime announcer, Alan Kalter; the famous Biff Henderson; the band members; his mom; and his wife, Regina, and son, Harry. They were in the audience, which I found startling. Even on that night, I imagined them being in Connecticut, somehow. Harry looked as uncomfortable with applause as his father tends to. “Thank you for being my family,” Letterman said. This moment felt strangely intimate, a glimpse into his world that we never see. There was another kid next to Harry. “And before the show, Harry wanted me to introduce his buddy Tommy Robano,” he said, laughing. It cut back to the boys, and both were all smiles as the audience clapped for Tommy Robano.","594","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/goodbye-dave"
"Then there was nothing left but for Letterman, curmudgeonly late-night king, to tell us about his love of the Foo Fighters, who had in 2000 cancelled a tour date in South America so they could play for Letterman, at his request, when he came back from heart surgery. “My favorite band playing my favorite song,” he’d said then. Now they would play “Everlong” again, over a montage of clips. Letterman said, “For the last time ever on a television program, thank you and good night.” The Foo Fighters played over an amazing array of images, the earliest ones looking as ancient as “Serpico.” Boxy taxis, old police cars from early opening credits. The famous image of Crispin Glover kicking toward Dave’s head. Paul Shaffer, young and less bald. Young Bill Murray. The mini trampoline and the Velcro suit. Sandra Bernhard. Father Guido Sarducci. George Burns. Gilda Radner. Carson. Oprah. James Brown. Jerry Garcia. Just Bulbs. Just Shades. The Alka-Seltzer suit and the dunk tank. The Late Night Monkey-Cam. The CBS years: Beavis and Butthead. Drew Barrymore flashing him atop his desk. Paul Shaffer in a Carson swami hat. Dave driving a giant cupcake into a Christmas tree. Lou Reed. Warren Zevon. Letterman mayhem, inside and out: explosions, fire, fireworks. And then back to now: a shot of him waving to the audience, and a freeze-frame. As I had many times in recent weeks, I felt a mild sense of disbelief. What would he do now, without all this? And what will we do without him?","595","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/goodbye-dave"
"On May 7th, two weeks before the end of “Late Show with David Letterman,” on CBS, the host delivered one of his final lists, “Top Ten Surprising Facts About Sesame Street.” The entries, every one a harsh gem, riffed on a documentary about the actor who played Big Bird, but they also satirized the way that the media had recently been strip-mining Letterman’s decades on television, seeking revealing nuggets. No. 9: “The earliest Muppets were made from hollowed-out animal carcasses.” No. 2 got a huge, rolling, in-on-it laugh from the audience: “Oscar the Grouch slightly nicer since announcing May 20th retirement.” The No. 1 fact about “Sesame Street”? “There’s also a guy working the puppeteer.”","596","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/25/good-night-on-television-emily-nussbaum"
"For more than thirty years, David Letterman has been the guy working the talk-show host. But he’s never hidden how tricky it is to move those levers, which has been his appeal to fans: in a job made for smoothies, he’s kept showing us his flaws, those spikes of anger and anxiety, almost despite himself. Now that Letterman’s a flinty codger, an establishment figure, it’s become difficult to recall just how revolutionary his style of meta-comedy once felt. But back when I was sixteen, trapped in the snoozy early eighties and desperate for something rude and wild, Letterman seemed like an anarchist. His manner suggested that TV could puncture the culture, rather than prop it up. My friends, particularly the guys, became his acolytes, quoting his catchphrases (“They pelted us with rocks and garbage”) and copying his deadpan affect. All of us imprinted like ducklings on his persona, the nice guy with the mean streak, making the world safe for smart comedy.","597","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/25/good-night-on-television-emily-nussbaum"
"The truth is, the show that Letterman oversaw in those early years was a far lighter, freer, more strange and cerebral and surreal project than it eventually became. It began as the brainchild of Dave and his girlfriend at the time, the comedy writer Merrill Markoe, who was the show’s first head writer. She invented one-offs, like Dog Poetry, and perennial segments, like Stupid Pet Tricks. (They considered doing Stupid Baby Tricks, but worried about the legal implications.) The pair, who were together for a decade, met at the Comedy Store, in Los Angeles. Their aesthetics were different—Markoe was a Berkeley art-school graduate, while Letterman was an Indiana frat boy who had majored in television and radio—but they shared an ironic mind-set, a suspicion of show-biz sycophancy, and a desire to break formulas, during a period when the medium had hardened, and taken on a Vegas-y, old-Hollywood heaviness. In 1980, pulling from earlier experimentalists, like Ernie Kovacs and Steve Allen, they built a daytime talk show on NBC, full of oddball pranks, which bored housewives but won over college kids. When it flopped, the network was nevertheless eager to keep Dave on the schedule, so it bumped Tom Snyder and gave him Snyder’s slot, at 12:30 a.m.—this was before TiVo and Hulu, when you had to stay up late to catch the funky stuff. Within two years, he was a hero to wiseacres everywhere.","598","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/25/good-night-on-television-emily-nussbaum"
"On the surface, the early Letterman resembled his mentor, the icy superstar Johnny Carson: he was apolitical, he was Midwestern, he had a repressive manner and lanky college-boy looks. (Don’t let the gap-toothed grin fool you. Squint, and Letterman is Harrison Ford.) But he vibrated with a contradictory charisma: he had a discomfort with back-patting and schmoozing, an odd characteristic for a man whose longtime dream job was TV host.","599","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/25/good-night-on-television-emily-nussbaum"
"In a sense, Letterman was a bridge between two eras of male superstars. Like the white-guy comedians of the seventies, Bill Murray and Chevy Chase and Steve Martin, he was a smart-ass, a trickster. And yet, even in 1982, when “Late Night with David Letterman” premièred, he presaged something else, an obsession with what was authentic, the kind of preoccupation that would dominate the nineties, inflecting figures like David Foster Wallace and Kurt Cobain, famous men who were desperate for rock-star fame and then flamboyantly and publicly hated the stuff once they got it. Like Holden Caulfield, Letterman was on the defense against looking like (or being) a phony, looking like (or being) a sellout, and curdling into a Hollywood jerk. In 1984, in a Playboy interview, Letterman talked about what a drag it was to meet Andy Rooney and realize that his act wasn’t an act: Rooney “doesn’t just appear to be a nasty curmudgeon, he is a nasty curmudgeon.” Already, Letterman had a melancholy vision of what fame could turn you into, if you let your guard down: “I hate the notion that celebrities deserve to be treated with some kind of deference.”","600","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/25/good-night-on-television-emily-nussbaum"
"The early “Late Night” included stars, but they were never the point. The charge came from the bits, the “remotes,” the pranks—a circus of eccentricity, from the monkey-cam to Chris Elliott climbing out from beneath the bleachers. Regulars included Larry (Bud) Melman, an elderly character actor who was both mocked and adored. One episode was filmed, for no reason, with a camera that rotated three hundred and sixty degrees. The goal was surprise, which often involved Letterman doing slapstick with a proto-“Jackass” bent. My primal memory of the show is of Dave, in a Velcro suit, getting tossed up onto a wall from a catapult—although, when I looked at a clip recently, I saw that my fond memories had exaggerated a mere mini-trampoline. The suit wasn’t the joke, though. The joke was Letterman, who isn’t zany but polite, asking the Velcro representative questions about this revolutionary substance. On the wall, immobilized, he quietly deadpans, “There’s very little I can do from this position.”","601","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/25/good-night-on-television-emily-nussbaum"
"It was a prescient zinger. Once Letterman became truly famous, the captain of a giant machine that demanded ratings, it was harder to stay nimble. Over the decades—through the bruising “late-night wars” with Jay Leno, past a sex scandal (handled with refreshing bluntness) and a heart attack, and into his late-curmudgeon era on CBS—Letterman has occasionally seemed at risk of dissolving, Cheshire Cat style, into his grin, glasses, and cigar. His influence spread so wide that his innovations became clichés. Once the Internet arrived, he never mastered the viral clip. Pop culture often seemed to bore him. He stayed inside more. Fame made it harder to play games with strangers, the way that a niche cable host, like the latter-day Lettermans Billy Eichner and Eric Andre, might. But, even as his teen acolytes grew up to become his cable competition, Letterman retained an itchy, mercurial self-consciousness, and an inability to fake it with strangers—in a genre devoted to snake-oil synergy, he remained a lousy salesman.","602","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/25/good-night-on-television-emily-nussbaum"
"Long before Letterman labelled himself Oscar the Grouch, Cher famously called him an “asshole,” sensing, not incorrectly, his bias against her kind of glitz. But when you watch the whole interview, which aired in 1986, Cher is the one who comes off like a jerk, jabbing the host before he’s done anything wrong. Then Letterman reacts beautifully. He shifts his jaw, he grins, he runs his hand over his forehead. He rattles his page of questions, saying, “No, we’ve got a lot of great stuff here”—rattle, rattle—“really good stuff here. A lot of really interesting, provocative kind of things.” He continues, “What do you mean, ‘Is this as good as it gets?’? Like, what would have been a better thing to say to you?” Cher doubles down: if Letterman doesn’t like a guest, it shows, she says. What flares up between them feels like chemistry, something amazing—and this was the quality he had with many of his more eccentric guests, from Andy Kaufman and Pee-wee Herman to the funny women whom he clearly appreciated, like Amy Sedaris. Even with Cher, Letterman doesn’t get ruder; instead, his voice softens, as he tries to bond over their age (both were around forty). Somewhere in there, he proves her wrong: there’s value, and there’s dynamism, in a host who can’t quite hide what he hates and what he loves.","603","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/25/good-night-on-television-emily-nussbaum"
"Most television shows—even dark or cynical ones—find a way to go out warmly. But in the final weeks of “Late Show with David Letterman” the approach was to resist, at every turn, any hint of sentiment. The show featured a cavalcade of wry, dry introverts and cerebral performers, from Steve Martin to Barack Obama; outrageous types, like Martin Short and Nathan Lane, satirizing Hollywood smarm; and Don Rickles and Howard Stern, lobbing put-downs. Letterman remarked to Martin that their friendship dated back to the daytime show. “I was on the show,” Martin responded. “But that doesn’t make us friends.” The conversation went on like that, a knife fight with icicles, the insults indistinguishable from parodies of insults.

"Ben Carson had wanted to be a doctor since he was a child in Detroit in the early nineteen-sixties, but he had the first inkling of what kind of doctor he might be when, as an undergraduate at Yale, he was introduced to Foosball. He played the game “with speed and ease,” he writes in his memoir, “Gifted Hands.” He had “an unusual ability—a divine gift, I believe—of extraordinary eye and hand coordination.” Even after he graduated and went on to medical school at the University of Michigan, a Yale student who made a great Foosball play was said to have scored a “Carson shot.” In the movie version of “Gifted Hands,” broadcast on TNT, in 2009, Cuba Gooding, Jr., as Carson, works the levers with a Jedi-like air—reprised in a later scene in which, during a twenty-two-hour procedure, Dr. Carson separates twin infants conjoined at the head. They were the first ever to survive such surgery.","607","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Carson mentioned that operation in the first Republican Presidential debate, last month. “I’m the only one to separate Siamese twins,” he said. “The only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it.” It was a Carson shot. Last week, a Monmouth University poll had him in second place among Republicans, with eighteen per cent, behind Donald Trump’s thirty per cent—meaning that the choice of nearly half the respondents was someone who has never held political office.","608","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"There have been attempts to explain Carson’s rise as being simply of a piece with this disjointed election season. Sunny and unflappable, he has been seen as the refined Trump (Rich Lowry, of National Review, called him the “superior outsider”), or the Trump that not even Trump can hate (the Donald says that he’s “a wonderful guy”). The standard narrative is that Carson first appeared on the political scene in 2013, when, at the National Prayer Breakfast, he told his life story in a speech that, as the Fox News world heard it, was a rebuke to the President, who was sitting on the dais. In fact, Carson has been out telling that story for twenty-five years.","609","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"His mother, Sonya, married his father when she was thirteen and he was twenty-eight. He turned out to be a bigamist and, once he was gone, Sonya supported Ben and his older brother by cleaning houses. When the boys struggled in school, she made them turn off the TV, read two library books a week, and write reports on them. She was functionally illiterate, but, as Carson said at the Prayer Breakfast, “we didn’t know that—she put check marks and highlights and stuff.” He went from the bottom of the class to near the top. His mother’s motto, which informs Carson’s conservatism, was: “If you don’t succeed, you have only yourself to blame.” But Carson grew up a devout Seventh-Day Adventist, and “Gifted Hands,” like his campaign, is also about grace. When he was in ninth grade, after a friend teased him, he pulled out a knife and thrust it at the friend’s stomach. The boy could have died; Carson could have gone to jail. Instead, the blade hit his friend’s belt buckle and broke. Carson ran home, locked himself in the bathroom with the Book of Proverbs, and prayed to God to take away his temper. He says that he walked out a different person.","610","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"In 1977, when Carson began his residency, at Johns Hopkins, he was sometimes assumed to be an orderly, but he regarded that as “a natural mistake”—what other black men did people see in hospitals? “I got a real kick out of watching them try to contain their expression of surprise,” he writes. He became an outstanding and innovative surgeon and, in 1984, at the age of thirty-three, the youngest head of a pediatric-neurosurgery department in the country. His joke about taking out half a brain was a reference to his pioneering work on hemispherectomies; the breakthrough case involved a four-year-old girl who had been racked by a hundred seizures a day.","611","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"“Gifted Hands” was published by the Christian imprint Zondervan in 1990, after the surgery on the twins, and it has sold more than a million and a half copies. It is often assigned in schools, and a condensed version is being sold to fund Carson’s campaign. (According to the Times, as of July he had raised eighty per cent of his money from small donors, a higher proportion than any candidate except Bernie Sanders.) Carson has since written more books, started an educational nonprofit with his wife, Candy (they met at Yale, and have three sons), and gone on speaking tours. There is a parallel between his political emergence and that of Ronald Reagan, whose Prayer Breakfast moment was a televised speech in support of Barry Goldwater in 1964. The speech, titled “A Time for Choosing,” had been honed by Reagan during the decade he spent as a spokesman for General Electric, making appearances at company events in towns across the country.","612","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Then, as now, the Republican Party was shifting in ways that were only peripherally visible to its ostensible leaders. Carson’s venues have been schools, churches, and gatherings of conservative activists, many of whom deeply distrust both their government and the larger institutions of their party. Their discontent, joined with what Carson sees as the lessons of his mother’s rejection of dependency, seems to have been a crucible for his own views. Eventually, he moved from offering himself as a role model to being a prescriber of policy.","613","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Carson speaks to an unnerved America in terms that are themselves unnerving. He describes how our “pinnacle nation” is about to be driven down by moral decay. In his most recent book, “One Nation,” he writes that agents working against this country’s greatness include the political-correctness police, who use “faux hypersensitivity” to take power away from the majority of Americans. He regularly traces that strategy to Saul Alinsky, the mid-century community organizer whose name is a byword for conservative suspicions about Barack Obama. Political correctness, Carson says, is used to keep conservatives from invoking slavery or Nazism, both of which he cites freely. (“Obamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery”; “We live in a Gestapo age.”) He wonders if Obama will cause the elections to be cancelled: “He’s sitting there saying, ‘These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything.’ ” Trump, the businessman, tells Americans how the financial system is rigged against them. Carson, the brain surgeon, tells them how they are being denied knowledge. It doesn’t seem to matter that he is a man of science who does not believe in evolution and has called climate change “irrelevant”: he is an ideologue with the trappings of a technocrat.","614","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Insofar as Carson has a political platform, it involves a low flat tax, modelled on the Biblical tithe; an end to Obamacare and to welfare for able-bodied adults; and the removal of restraints on our military in the Middle East. In lieu of specifics, Carson tends to say that as a surgeon he has experience “doing complex things” and making snap life-or-death decisions. His success in the polls may be best understood as desperation on the part of voters who have rejected political experience as a test of competence. But it should take more than a Carson shot to navigate this Presidential campaign, which has been played, so far, with all the reckless abandon of a Foosball game, and with little of the joy. ♦","615","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"In 2013, Ben Carson gave a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast that launched his political career. According to the rapturous response on the Internet, Carson’s remarks were a rebuke of President Obama—people saw Carson as an authentic black counterpoint to the President—but they were just as clearly a rejection of what he called the culture of “political correctness.” “The P.C. police are out in force,” he warned from the podium. “We’ve reached a point where people are afraid to say what they think because someone might be offended.

When, this past Sunday, on “Meet the Press,” Carson voiced his opposition to the idea of a Muslim being elected President, he did so in the same calm, measured tones that attend almost all of his pronouncements. He spoke with the quiet confidence of a man convinced of the rectitude of his own position.

"Carson’s position within the paranormal wing of the G.O.P. is perplexing for a number of reasons. Unlike Donald Trump, who is capable of making equally inflammatory and nativist comments, Carson’s intellectual accomplishments are indisputable.* He is a product of the most respected educational institutions in the United States and was once a foremost practitioner in a highly complex field of medicine. Yet his virtuoso abilities coexist with a loosely tethered relationship to other types of rational thought. Carson is a scientist who disavows evolution, a citizen who professes to be deeply concerned about democracy yet supports a religious litmus test for public office, and a physician who devoted himself to saving the lives of children but indulges the hypertensive claims of the anti-vaccine element. His bifurcated thinking calls to mind James Watson, the Nobel winning co-discoverer of DNA, who spent years mouthing racist and sexist theories of human intelligence. On the stump, Carson seems like an object lesson in what happens when STEM majors don’t take enough courses in the humanities and social sciences.","620","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"For reasons connected to his race, his education, and his exceptional talent, Carson at first carried an imprimatur of Serious Thought that the others in the crowded G.O.P. field did not. (Building a real-estate empire, winning a Senate seat, and serving as a corporate C.E.O. are impressive accomplishments, but they are literally not brain surgery.) But Carson’s duelling intellect and paranoia have led him to support untenable positions with minor qualifications. He panders by faint dissent. By stating that he believes that Islam is inconsistent with American democracy and that President Obama is a Christian born in the United States, he validates the substance of birtherism, just not this specific instance of it. When Carson was confronted, during the last Republican debate, with the question of whether vaccines cause autism, he stated that they did not but offered paranoiacs the nebulous chaser that we are giving children too many immunizations. The suggestion that vaccines have some nebulous danger essentially nullified the statement that preceded it.","621","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"That the party responsible for the Southern strategy, the racist populism of the Reagan era, and the current age of voter suppression can count a black neurosurgeon among its most popular Presidential candidate is in itself a form of vaccination against charges of racism. It means one thing when a white billionaire taps into whites’ anxieties about cultural and economic displacement, and something else entirely when a black man from Detroit validates their conspiratorial fears about the Affordable Care Act. Or when, in an oblivious echo of the Dred Scott decision, an African-American states that entire segments of the population are irreconcilable with the Constitution. Carson’s is not a novel act. Five years ago, Juan Williams, a black journalist who covered civil rights and wrote a biography of Thurgood Marshall, stated that he felt fearful when boarding a plane with Muslims. The ensuing outcry was, predictably, denounced as political correctness.","622","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"The enduring legacy of Carson’s candidacy, however it ends, is likely to be the recognition that, under certain circumstances, cynicism is less of a problem than sincerity. Would that such detached thinking, from so talented a figure, came with a wink and a nod—that it were simply a matter of demagogic competition in a crowded political field. But Carson appears to mean what he says, and there is a consistent market for his brand of exonerating racism, for bigotries so valid that even a brilliant black man endorses them. His certainty that the din of outrage is merely the yelping dog of political correctness prohibits him from fulfilling one of the primary responsibilities of a scientist: the honest evaluation of contrary data.

"Since the start of October, half a dozen polls have shown Carson leading in Iowa, where evangelical Christians, who are flocking to his candidacy, make up about half of the Republican electorate. But the CBS/Times poll is the first major survey to indicate that Carson is ahead at the national level. Coming as it does the day before the third Republican debate, which will be held on Wednesday night in Boulder, Colorado, the numbers are sure to inspire headlines about whether Carson can win the nomination, and whether the long-predicted Trump slump is finally upon us.","626","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Such speculation is probably premature. While the Democratic race appears to have settled into a predictable pattern—centrist favorite versus progressive underdog—the Republican race is still a freak show, to borrow a term popular with political operatives. Carson is now enjoying his moment, but more ups and downs can be expected, with other candidates rising and falling. As for Trump, strange as it would have sounded a couple of months ago, his presence at the top of the polls has become the one fixture in the race.","627","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Arguably, the most important finding in the new poll isn’t the four-point gap that Carson has opened up over Trump—which, in any case, is within the survey’s margin of error. The key number is twenty-eight per cent. That’s the proportion of respondents who said that they had already made their minds up about which candidate to vote for: fewer than one in three. As a Times story about the poll put it, “Seven in 10 of those who expressed support for a candidate said it was too early to say for sure who they would support.”","628","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"These figures aren’t too surprising. The Iowa caucus is still more than three months away, and the primary is proving to be quite a spectacle. If you were a potential G.O.P. voter, wouldn’t you sit back and enjoy the show for a while before deciding whom to vote for? Wouldn’t you be tempted to flirt with one or two of the candidates, especially the ones who seem new and different? It’s not as if we haven’t seen this sort of behavior before. In the last week of October, 2011, Herman Cain, the “9-9-9” man, was leading in the G.O.P. polls. A couple of weeks later, his campaign went into a free fall, and in December he dropped out of the race.","629","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"I am not suggesting that Carson is another Cain, who was hit with allegations that he had made unwanted sexual advances toward women, and that he had been involved in at least one long-term extramarital affair. From what we know about Carson, his personal life and professional life are above reproach: that’s one reason why many Republicans are warming to him. (Another reason is that he has adopted ultra-conservative positions on abortion, gun control, and other social issues.) My point is simply that, at this stage in the campaign, the G.O.P. electorate is volatile, and much of Carson’s support is provisional. The CBS/Times poll explicitly confirms this. Four out of five of Carson’s supporters say that it’s too early to say for certain that they will vote for him.","630","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"As for Trump, his impending demise has been announced many times before. This is just one poll. Another survey, released on Monday by the firm Morning Consult, showed him leading Carson by thirty-five per cent to twenty per cent. Since that poll was conducted over the Internet, it was probably less reliable than the CBS/Times survey, which was a telephone poll that relied on both landlines and cell phones. But the rule with polls is to look at the averages of multiple surveys, rather than at individual results. And, according to the Real Clear Politics poll average, Trump is still leading Carson by almost five percentage points—26.8 per cent to twenty-two per cent—nationwide.","631","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"To be sure, Trump’s advantage has narrowed sharply since the end of August, when he was way ahead. But the fact is that he has been leading the race for more than three months. After a lacklustre performance at the second Republican debate, on September 16th, his numbers fell back. Since then, though—at least, prior to the CBS/Times poll—they appeared to have rebounded to the high twenties. This persistence suggests that Trump, in defiance of the general pattern of volatility, has established a base of support that amounts to somewhere between a fifth and a third of the Republican electorate. Unlike Carson’s supporters, a majority of Trump’s backers—fifty-five per cent of them, according to the CBS/Times poll—seem to have made up their minds about their choice.","632","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Of course, winning over a quarter of the primary electorate won’t be sufficient to carry Trump to the nomination. With up to half of potential Republican voters telling pollsters that they won’t back him under any circumstances, he faces serious obstacles to expanding his support. Still, unless something dramatic and unexpected happens, his presence in the race seems likely to remain its defining feature for at least a while.

Carson, radiating calm and exploiting his status as a non-politician politician, has fared much better. Now, however, he will be in the spotlight, with higher expectations, more media attention, and more potshots coming at him from Trump and others. “It really is like a cleansing action,” Trump said Tuesday, on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “A lot of things will come out now, and we’ll see how he holds up to the scrutiny.” Beginning tomorrow night in Colorado, we certainly will.","634","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"

In this one, Trump’s lead was down to just four points, which isn’t even statistically significant.

On Tuesday, the Club for Growth, a right-wing pressure group that has received funding from a number of conservative billionaires, announced that it was launching an anti-Trump advertising campaign in Iowa and other states. “We’ll continue doing it until people realize that Donald Trump is not an economic conservative,” the organization’s president, David M.

A supporter of a balanced-budget amendment, a skeptic about most government programs, and a harsh critic of Obamacare (last year, he said it has done more damage to the United States than the 9/11 attacks), he is singing a tune that conservatives want to hear. On the basis of what we’ve seen so far, he may well have the calmness and self-confidence to stand up to Trump’s jibes without being rattled.

"It is hard to find a single detailed claim in his diatribe that is physically sensible or that reflects accurate knowledge about science. His central claim—that the second law of thermodynamics rules out order forming in the universe after the Big Bang—is a frequent misstatement made by creationists who want to appear scientifically literate. In reality, it is completely false. Local order in parts of the universe is always possible at the expense of heat and disorder dissipated to the external environment. The human body is one example: we take in energy from our environment to build up complex molecules that help power our bodies, and, in doing so, we release heat to the world around us. A snowflake is another beautifully ordered example of what simple natural meteorological processes can produce. Stars form by gravity, collapsing into spherically ordered structures that can remain in this form only if they release tremendous heat energy into the environment. Carson elides these physical realities by creating a straw man: he says that scientists believe that, after the Big Bang, the universe was “perfectly ordered.” But no such claim has been made by scientists; instead, we describe how local order, including galaxies, stars, planets, and life, developed over time.","648","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"When Carson says that scientists rely on “probability theory” to explain how multiple Big Bangs, taking place over “billions of years,” have resulted in our “perfectly ordered” universe, he’s profoundly misstating the theory of the Big Bang. (In fact, he seems to have gotten his ignorant arguments confused—his metaphor about a hurricane creating a 747 in a junkyard is often used to deride evolution, to which it is equally inapplicable.) No one suggests that other Big Bangs have happened or are happening in our universe. Instead, all evidence implies that our universe originated from a single Big Bang approximately 13.7 billion years ago. Perhaps Carson was referring to the possibility of other universes outside of our universe, and to the so-called anthropic principle, which suggests that, if there are many universes, the fact that our universe supports life could be a probabilistic phenomenon. But those ideas, whether they’re true or not, have nothing to do with the reality of the Big Bang. We conclude the Big Bang happened because every piece of observational evidence we have about the universe is precisely consistent with predictions based on this possibility and none other. Speculations about other possible universes are irrelevant.","649","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"Perhaps his silliest statements have to do with our own solar system. Carson claims that our solar system is perfectly ordered—but, in fact, the motion of the planets is chaotic in the long term, and, although we can predict the motion of comets over the seventy-year period he discusses, for longer time horizons, such as millions or billions of years, the complexity of our solar system makes that practically impossible. Even more problematically, he points to the fact that some moons orbit in different directions from their planets and argues that those orbits would be impossible if there had been a Big Bang, because angular momentum would forbid it:","650","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"This is akin to saying that, if there really had been a Big Bang billions of years ago, skaters today should be able to spin in only one direction. Local systems can exchange angular momentum with their surroundings by collisions, and many forms of chaotic motion are, therefore, possible. Bathwater rotates around the drain, sometimes clockwise and sometimes counterclockwise, happily independent of the Big Bang. The questions that Carson goes on to ask about the “debris” from the Big Bang—“What about all the debris from the billions and billions of explosions that were not perfect? Where’s that? I mean, we should be bombarded constantly by all this debris coming down; we’re not seeing it”—are meaningless if our entire visible universe arose from a single Big Bang, which is what the evidence suggests.","651","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"Carson’s wild delusions aren’t confined to physics, either. In the same event, in a more surprising and perhaps more worrisome statement, Carson claimed that evolution, as explained by Darwin, was actually the work of the devil. (“I personally believe that this theory that Darwin came up with was something that was encouraged by the adversary, and it has become what is scientifically, politically correct.”) As if invoking Satan weren’t bad enough, Carson resorted to bad puns to sidestep his scientific ignorance: he went on to say that he was planning a book called “The Organ of Species,” which he said would “talk about the organs of the body and how they completely refute evolution”—an amazing claim that would require a rewriting of most biology texts. At another point in the speech, he uses a long stream of medical terminology to argue against the biochemical origins of life—something he doesn’t seem to realize has nothing to do with Darwinian evolution itself. Elsewhere, he claims that plants couldn’t have evolved before bees and that sexual reproduction shouldn’t have evolved at all, and suggests that geological formations provide evidence of a great flood, not an old Earth.","652","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"It is one thing to simply assert that you don’t choose to believe the science, in spite of a mountain of data supporting it. It’s another to mask your ignorance in such a disingenuous way, by using pseudo-scientific, emotion-laden arguments and trading on your professional credentials. Surely this quality, which reflects either self-delusion or, worse still, a willingness to intentionally deceive others, is of great concern when someone is vying for control of the nuclear red button.","653","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"Last week, when he was confronted, during a speech at Cedarville University, about his failure to understand basic and fundamental scientific concepts, Carson responded, “I’m not going to denigrate you because of your faith, and you shouldn’t denigrate me for mine.” What Carson doesn’t seem to recognize is that there is a fundamental difference between facts and faith. An inability to separate religious beliefs from an assessment of physical reality runs counter to the very basis of our society—the separation of church and state.","654","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"By his own admission, Carson’s remarkable hand-eye coördination allowed him to soar as a surgeon, and he used that success to build a lucrative reputation as a purveyor of advice for young and old. His book for young people is titled “You Have a Brain.” As numerous religious scientists have quipped, God wouldn’t have given us a brain if he hadn’t intended for us to use it. While many may debate whether his lack of public-service experience disqualifies him from serious consideration in this race, Carson’s ideas about religion, science, and public office, as revealed in the past week, suggest that there are far deeper reasons to be concerned about his candidacy for the highest office in the land.","655","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"“‘What’s going on?’ I asked,” Ben Carson wrote in “Gifted Hands,” a memoir he published in 1990. “ ‘A hoax,’ the teacher said.” This was the climax of a scene at Yale, where he enrolled as an undergraduate in 1969, in which Carson described having seen a notice that the exam papers for Perceptions 310, a psychology class he was taking, had been accidentally burned, and that there would be a makeup. When the makeup proved to be impossibly—almost comically—hard, every student but Carson walked out. (He heard some students saying that they’d claim they never saw the notice about the makeup.) Then, when Carson was alone, an instructor and a photographer for the Yale Daily News, who snapped his picture, told him that he’d been tricked—but he had also demonstrated that he was the most honest student in the class. Then, Carson remembered, they handed him a ten-dollar bill.","November 10, 2015","656","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"Last week, the Wall Street Journal cited this episode as a problem with Carson’s biography, one that went to his credibility and—because he is largely running on his inspirational life story—to the heart of his campaign. Reporters at the Journal couldn’t find a photo of him in the Yale Daily News; they couldn’t find a course with the name Perceptions 310. But there was, in fact, a problem with the exposé itself, which became clear in the next few days: Carson’s story held up a lot better than the Journal had implied.","657","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"There may not have been a captioned photo in the Daily News, but there was an article that described just such a prank having been pulled off by the Yale Record, a humor publication, in January, 1970. It involved a parody edition of the News. The title of the class was Psychology 10, a mistake that Carson blamed on his ghostwriter—not the most gracious move but fair enough. It’s hardly material, and he was writing decades after the fact. BuzzFeed found a Record staff member who recalled helping with the prank, and was “99% certain the way Carson remembers it is correct,” including the difficulty of the makeup questions and how, “at the end, what few students remained — it may have just been one or two, I wasn’t there — received a small cash prize.” Some of the commentary that followed suggested that the story still reflected poorly on Carson, because he couldn’t tell the difference between the Record and the Daily News, and because he fell for the stunt, as, presumably, no sophisticated Eli should. This line of attack, with its undertones of élitism, is not likely to do him any damage with his supporters.","658","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"Another exposé, by Politico, about whether Carson was offered admission to West Point—he never seems to have formally applied—fell flat for what are, at root, similar reasons. “Gifted Hands” can be a confusing book, because the narrative jumps back and forth in the timeline. Carson presents a series of vignettes related to his high-school career, during which he was active in R.O.T.C., and to his college-admissions decisions. There is a Memorial Day parade “at the end of my twelfth grade,” which would have been May, 1969, in Detroit, which he marched in; “afterward,” an encounter with General William Westmoreland at a banquet that celebrated Medal of Honor winners; and, “later,” an offer of “a full scholarship to West Point,” which he “didn’t refuse … outright,” and is mainly presented as important because it gives him confidence going into the college-admissions process—which happens at the beginning of twelfth grade, not the end—and the faith, in “the fall of 1968,” to apply only to a single college, Yale.","659","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"The jumbled way that the book is written can suggest that we are in a time loop. This happens a lot when Carson tells stories or lays out plans, and it is a real point of criticism. (Similarly, if you diagram the hoax-exam story, it sounds like it happened when he was a junior, not a freshman.) But the individual parts are not only plausible but have some real backup. Politico notes that Westmoreland was not in Detroit that Memorial Day, but he was in Detroit in February, 1969, for a banquet a lot like the one Carson describes. Much has been made of Carson’s saying that he was offered a West Point scholarship, given that there is no cost for attending, but in that sense everybody who goes gets a scholarship. And it is more than likely that an Army general would have explained it in those terms to a teen-ager from inner-city Detroit whom he wanted to recruit. The nomination process for West Point does work in a more personal way than, say, the common app. As my colleague Hendrik Hertzberg wrote on Twitter, “If it’s true that Westmoreland told Carson he could have a West Point appointment for the asking, Carson’s garbled version is forgivable.” Again, the fact that Carson doesn’t talk about it in the way that someone more savvy might is not going to hurt him.","660","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"Besides—and this may be the real reason that the West Point story is weak—it hasn’t been disputed that Carson grew up the child of an impoverished, functionally illiterate single mother. Nevertheless, he was accepted to Yale and succeeded there. He went on to the University of Michigan Medical School and became first a resident, then a distinguished surgeon, at Johns Hopkins. There is every reason to believe that he could have gone to West Point if he had pursued it. These facts also point to a weakness in another line of debunking, about whether Carson was really as angry as he remembered being as a fourteen-year-old; he had plenty of things to be angry about. Saying that he was actually always happy-go-lucky, and never needed, as he writes, a religious experience to put aside his hostility and his violent tendencies is also not likely to be a campaign killer, though it does point to how very strange this political season has been. It clearly plays into evangelical Christians’ love of a redemption story—but arguing that people shouldn’t be moved by it because it feels saccharine is, in the absence of real evidence that he has fabricated the basic narrative, more of an aesthetic response than a political one. Ben Carson was a fine student and an exceptional doctor. He is just a very bad candidate for President.","661","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"The odd thing is that the Carson campaign is what might be called a target-rich environment for journalists—or it should be. He has been utterly dismissive of climate change, and he has fostered the idea that vaccines cause autism. The numbers for his tax plan, insofar as there are any, don’t add up. He has said that Joseph, of the coat of many colors, built the pyramids in order to store the grain of the seven fat years—a statement that, as I’ve written, was troubling not because we expect our Presidents to be up on the distinction between Early and Middle Kingdom dynasties but because Carson presented it as an example of why one should reject the theories of experts and scientists and turn, instead, to the Bible. Similarly, his claim that none of the signers of the Declaration of Independence had experience in elective office, when a great number of them did, is significant not only because it is false but because it speaks to a particular view of history and politics. (Carson later amended the statement to say that none had federal experience. Of course, they couldn’t have, because there was no federal government when the Declaration was signed.) He has suggested that President Obama might declare martial law, and that the 2016 elections might be cancelled amid scenes of untenable civil disorder. He has compared Obamacare to slavery and to Nazism. He has also made what PolitiFact judged to be outright false statements in the last Republican debate about his ties to a nutritional-supplement company. (In contrast, PolitiFact rated Carson’s description of West Point’s “scholarships” as mostly true.)","662","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"Perhaps the problem isn’t that the media is too partisan but that, in looking at Carson, there was a hope that there might be a non-partisan way to address a campaign whose success is hard for observers of American politics to understand. There is a sense that we are going to wake up one day and Carson and Donald Trump will have departed, and then we can get back to differentiating among the traditional politicians. But what is the mechanism for that? If Carson were onstage only because of his life story, and Trump only because of his celebrity, the two of them would not, together, be getting half of the support of Republicans in every poll. This campaign is not actually a prank being pulled on the public, which will have a moment when the photographer comes out and explains the joke. Would that it were.","663","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"

"Carson, Trump explained, had “said terrible things about himself,” a habit entirely alien to Trump. Specifically, Carson has said that, between the ages of thirteen and fifteen, when he was growing up in Detroit, he was prone to violence; he tried to attack his mother with a hammer, hit a friend in the face with a padlock, and stabbed another friend in the stomach with a knife—which, in what Carson has presented as a moment of grace, hit the friend’s belt buckle and snapped. “He defined it as disease,” Trump said, and, indeed, in “Gifted Hands,” Carson writes, “I had what I can only label a pathological temper—a disease—and this sickness controlled me, making me totally irrational. . . . Totally without thinking, when my anger was aroused, I grabbed the nearest brick, rock, or stick to bash someone.” Carson also writes that even though he knew, from reading articles in Psychology Today, that a personality trait like that was generally immutable, he prayed to God to change him, and God did. To which Trump, in Iowa, said, “Give me a break!”","694","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"“And the people of Iowa believe him?” Trump went on. “It doesn’t happen that way. . . . Don’t be fools. Don’t be fools, O.K.?” He moved away from the lectern, pulled back his jacket, and twisted his own belt up and down to demonstrate, like a latter-day Johnnie Cochran, what would really happen if someone was stabbed in the stomach—if blade and buckle don’t bump, you must vote Trump, so to speak. He then laid out the Trumpized version of the pop-psychology analysis: “Now, if you’re pathological, there’s no cure for that. . . . If you’re a child molester—a sick puppy—if you’re a child molester, there’s no cure for that. There’s only one cure—we don’t want to talk about that cure. That’s the ultimate cure. Well, there’s two, there’s death and the other thing.”","695","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"This speech in Iowa was so freewheeling (ninety minutes), Trump’s language so crass (“How stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap?”), his impressions of his rivals so close to outright burlesque (on Marco Rubio: “If he was playing poker with me, I’d say, Ah! I know what. The water would start pouring off his body. I’d say AAAAHHHH.”), that it was hard to do more with that diagnosis than pause and wonder at a Presidential campaign in which the front-runner for a major party’s nomination regales audiences in Iowa with his belief in the efficacy of castrating criminals. (He also called reporters “scum.”) But, since he is the front-runner, there are two other points worth exploring: Trump’s view of people with less luck than he’s had and Trump’s view of Trump. These overlap, but there are distinctions. One is suggested by the option he mentioned besides castration: the death penalty.","696","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"What does Donald Trump think the fate of an angry, black fourteen-year-old from a poor neighborhood, who has acted in a violent way, should, or possibly could, be? In 1989, he took out an ad in the Daily News calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, a group of fourteen-, fifteen-, and sixteen-year-olds who had been accused of raping and beating a jogger in the park. As I wrote in a piece about the case last year, he did not back away from that position even when the boys, now men, were exonerated, after serving years in prison—they were not, he said, “angels.” As a candidate for the 2016 G.O.P. Presidential nomination, what does he think about the possible effect on a child of education, support, rehabilitation, or even, in Carson’s terms, redemption? Not much, it would seem. Trump doesn’t particularly believe in working with what’s broken—this is the same impulse that caused him to say, in insulting John McCain, that he didn’t like people who had been taken prisoner. He likes what’s never been touched. Even more telling than “pathological” was another term he used about Carson: “Damaged . . . lot of damage.”","697","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"The other striking thing about the Iowa speech is Trump’s—Trump’s!—dismay that voters would go for someone with no political experience who tells inflated stories about himself. But as the Daily News ad suggests, Trump has been thinking about politics for a long time—longer, it may turn out, than is good for America. Similarly, Jon Meacham’s new biography of George H. W. Bush, about Trump letting Lee Atwater, the Republican operative, know during the 1988 race that he was available for the Vice-Presidency, is not an anomalous data point in this regard. His ideology is not particularly coherent—a medley in his Iowa speech about immigration and foreign policy concluded with this memorable sentence: “If you’ve got to cross a border, if you have your choice between North Korea, Afghanistan, or Iran, I’d take Canada every single time.” (The events in Paris are unlikely to make his ideas more sensible or kind.) But he hasn’t only recently wandered into the arena, making it harder to count on him getting bored and wandering off. In Iowa, Trump also mentioned that he owned a single store that was worth more than Mitt Romney’s entire fortune. Apparently, this is true. The store is the Gucci flagship, in Trump Tower—“Fifth Avenue real estate, it’s amazing,” Trump said. Just when you think Trump has said something entirely delusional, or outright crazy, you realize that New York real-estate prices are crazier still.

He lamented the secularization of American society, asserting that religious faith was no longer acceptable in political discourse. “If it’s in our Constitution, it’s in our Pledge, it’s in our courts, and it’s on our money, but we’re not supposed to talk about it, what is that?” he asked. “That’s schizophrenia!” But he also delivered a black-history lesson, enumerating a long list of African-American inventors who were, he said, absent from school textbooks, thereby depriving young black men of role models. Midway through his talk, he issued a whimsical—and bipartisan—call to action. “What if everybody in this room, with all your influence, wrote a letter to Kellogg’s and General Mills and said, ‘Put on your cereal boxes Nobel Prize winners and people of intellect, instead of just people who use sports and entertainment,’ ” he said. “Those kinds of things, I think, will make a big difference.” When he was finished, Bill and Hillary Clinton stood up to applaud, and they pumped his hand as he returned to his seat.","700","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Perhaps President Obama was expecting a similar performance when he settled in for Carson’s encore appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast, in February, 2013. But by then Carson’s political vision had come into sharper focus. The political pundit and entrepreneur Armstrong Williams, a longtime friend and adviser of Carson’s who is currently his business manager, remembers watching Carson “agonizing” in the greenroom, as he tried to decide whether, and how much, he should criticize the President. In the end, Carson decided not to single out Obama, but he offered a strongly divergent view of America’s problems and potential solutions: he sounded an alarm about the national debt; he called for a strictly proportional income tax, based on the Biblical principle of tithing; and he laid out a health-care reform plan, which he said would reduce “bureaucracy”—a veiled reference, perhaps, to Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The speech became an online sensation, partly thanks to its unnamed target, who stopped smiling about halfway through and skipped an opportunity for a post-speech handshake. Clips have amassed millions of views on YouTube: “Obama Destroyed by Dr. Benjamin Carson’s Amazing Speech”; “Dr. Benjamin Carson Wipes the Smile off Obama’s Face.” (Among Carson’s fans, his honorific often serves as a term of affection.) And the speech inspired the Wall Street Journal to issue the first major endorsement of the 2016 campaign cycle: “Ben Carson for President.”","701","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The Journal editorial wasn’t actually intended as a Presidential endorsement; it was a jocular salute to a newly minted folk hero, and a mischievous suggestion that even this political layman was more sensible than Obama. But the cult of Carson grew, aided by the formation of the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee, and by tacit encouragement from Carson, who seemed to enjoy the speculation. Soon after the speech, he announced that he was retiring from neurosurgery and hinted that he was considering public office. This May, after two years of contemplation, he declared that he was running. He recalled praying for guidance. “Lord, I don’t want to do this,” he said. “But if you’re going to open the doors I will go through with it.”","702","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"During a recent appearance at a retirement community in Exeter, New Hampshire, Carson, who is sixty-four, was interrupted by residents making a common complaint: he was speaking too softly. He adjusted the microphone and leaned into it. “I can’t get it any higher,” he said. “It would be in my mouth.” And then he returned to his subject, which was the dire prospect of a country in which citizens were afraid to criticize their government. “Back in Nazi Germany, a lot of those people did not believe in what Hitler was doing,” he said. “They kept their mouths shut and they kept their heads down. And look at what happened.” Carson has an ability—honed, no doubt, during his previous career—to deliver alarming statements in a soothing manner. “Some people say, ‘Oh, nothing like that could ever happen in America,’ ” he said. “I beg to differ.” When he speaks, Carson sometimes blinks slowly, or closes his eyes in thought, and he uttered this last phrase in the same tone of voice that you might use to recount a pleasant dream.","703","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson announced his candidacy, he was overshadowed by Jeb Bush, who was viewed as the favorite, and then by Donald Trump, whose groundswell began a few weeks later. But Carson kept speaking, quietly. Ryan Rhodes, Carson’s Iowa state director, says that the candidate’s “soft touch” is particularly effective among women voters and Evangelicals. By this fall, national polls showed Carson catching Trump, and even overtaking him. In some ways, this is not a particularly meaningful achievement: national polls, conducted long before the primary season has begun, have little predictive power. (At this point four years ago, Newt Gingrich was the front-runner.) And Carson’s big numbers have had little effect on the skepticism of political experts, who continue to believe that the next President will be a professional politician; Marco Rubio emerged as the betting favorite for the nomination, despite polling about half as well as Carson. Even so, it’s hard to think about the crowded cluster of Republican candidates for President without considering the startling fact that, for months, none were able to command much more support than a former surgeon whose campaign platform is barely more granular than the speech that made him a conservative hero three years ago.","704","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Like most popular political candidates, Carson promises to deliver his audiences from politics. At campaign rallies, he gets a warm ovation when he inveighs against the nameless forces of division. (“They want Democrats to believe that Republicans are evil,” he says. “Or Republicans to believe that Democrats are evil.”) But that doesn’t make him a moderate. In Exeter, he condemned Planned Parenthood, saying that he would rather direct federal funding to “organizations that don’t engage in killing babies.” A few hours later, at the Durham campus of the University of New Hampshire, he warned about the peril of “global jihadists” and said, “There are many of them, already, within our nation.” That evening, he travelled to a boathouse on Goat Island, off the Portsmouth coast, where a group of local doctors had gathered to slurp milky clam chowder and listen to a former colleague share his belief that physicians should use their “healing instinct” to revive the country. Carson was in his element, joking about the hassles of dunning insurance companies and mentioning, briefly, his interest in trigeminal neuralgia. But even there he stayed on message: when a man in the audience asked about the rising cost of medical school, Carson suggested making colleges pay the interest on student loans, to help keep down tuition, yet firmly rejected the idea of universal government-funded college education. “Anything that we do to add to the debt right now is almost like treason,” he said.","705","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"During the Obama years, there has been no shortage of conservative leaders eager to squeeze the words “debt” and “treason” into the same sentence. And there are moments when Carson seems almost retro, thrilling audiences with an anti-deficit, anti-Obamacare message that had already started to lose its freshness when he delivered that famous speech. What distinguishes Carson from his Tea Party predecessors is his biography, which also distinguishes him from the rest of the Republican field: he has been telling and retelling his life story for nearly thirty years, hewing to a narrative that emphasizes the Biblical virtues of grace and humility. Other candidates in the race, with the notable exception of Trump, have been reluctant to criticize someone so well loved, perhaps because they don’t view Carson as a long-term threat. In the most recent Republican debate, the other candidates not only refrained from trying to hurt Carson but seemed eager to help him. After he gave a meandering soliloquy in response to a question about banks, Rubio took it upon himself to implement a Troubled Assertion Relief Program, exclaiming, “He’s right on point, there.”","706","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Journalists haven’t been quite so supportive: BuzzFeed recently posted an old video of Carson suggesting, in defiance of archeological scholarship, that the Egyptian pyramids were actually grain-storage units, built by the Biblical patriarch Joseph. During an excruciating Fox News interview after the Paris attacks, Chris Wallace tried and failed to get Carson to tell him which countries he would recruit to help fight ISIS. (Carson promised to involve “all of the Arab states—and even the non-Arab states.”) Last week, on an Iowa television station, Carson called his foreign-policy education “an ongoing process.” Two days later, he talked about the importance of screening refugees, using an infelicitous analogy: “If there’s a rabid dog running around your neighborhood, you’re probably not going to assume something good about that dog.”","707","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"At times, the scrutiny has led Carson to engage in atypically peevish exchanges with the media. Williams, his adviser, has been heartened by Carson’s willingness to fight back. “Somebody’s attacking your good name, your word,” he says. “He needs to get emotional. He needs to get fire in his belly.” It would make sense for any other politician to react this way, but Carson’s appeal is based largely on his seeming to be above the fray: a Baptist youth minister in Florida told me that he admired Carson because he was humble, and not “bombastic and adversarial”; a volunteer in Iowa cited his pledge to work for “all the people,” including the ones who wouldn’t vote for him. The most suspenseful thing about his surreal campaign is seeing how long he can stay in the fight without looking too much like a fighter.","708","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson certainly seemed serene on a recent Tuesday afternoon in Florida, sitting in his temporary living room aboard a chartered bus emblazoned with his face; his head was framed by a backward “D” on the window behind him, the last letter of “BEN CARSON, M.D.” His wife, Candy, emerged from a private room in the back to show Carson a message on her mobile phone, and then disappeared. Carson pointed out that he is used to travelling a lot, and that he has been contending with big crowds for years. “When people would come to the clinic, they always would come with their cameras and their books to be autographed,” he told me. “The magnitude has just increased exponentially.” His campaign has followed an astonishing trajectory, but so has his life; he published his autobiography, “Gifted Hands,” in 1990, and it reads like an extended parable. He writes that his mother, Sonya, was a domestic worker, and sometimes left Ben and his older brother, Curtis, with neighbors while she sought clinical help for “confusion and depression”; his father, an autoworker and part-time preacher, left the family when Carson was eight.","709","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson was raised in the Seventh-Day Adventist Church—he was baptized at eight and again, for good measure, at twelve—and he has remained a member. His surgical skill seems, in his telling, like a compensatory gift from God: afflicted with poor eyesight, he discovered that he had a knack for spatial visualization, making him well suited to navigate the delicate tangle of a child’s brain. Like many Adventists, Carson is a vegetarian, though he downplays any differences between Adventists and other Christians. Decades ago, in an interview in Vegetarian Times, he expressed certainty that meat eating would fade away by 2010, and that animals would “breathe a sigh of relief.” But, on the bus in Florida, he was eager to explain that his diet is merely a personal choice, and that he has nothing against meat eaters or hunters. He offered a brief explanation of his church’s best-known tenet. “There’s no place in the Bible that says the Sabbath was changed from Saturday to Sunday, so we worship on Saturday, that’s all,” he said. “Does that mean that people who worship on Sunday are evil? No! Of course not.”","710","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” Carson recalls the two years that he and his brother spent in Boston, living with his mother’s sister: he remembered “winos and drunks,” as well as “squad cars racing up the street.” At the retirement community in Exeter, he added grislier details, saying, “I saw people lying on the street with bullet holes and stab wounds.” The Boston Globe talked to longtime residents of the neighborhoods where Carson lived, who remembered a less menacing atmosphere; one called the claim of bodies in the streets a “vast exaggeration.” Of course, Carson’s exaggeration, if that’s what it is, surely wouldn’t seem so vast if he were not a Presidential candidate; one suspects that few motivational speakers would emerge unscathed from an encounter with a pack of investigative reporters.","711","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"A number of Carson’s favorite anecdotes seem impervious to research. When he tells his life story, he rarely omits the moment when, at the age of fourteen, he tried to stab another boy with a camping knife; he struck the boy’s belt buckle, the blade “snapped and dropped to the ground,” and Carson retreated to a bathroom, where he begged God to rid him of his violent temper. In Carson’s telling, the prayer worked. “Since that day,” he wrote, “I have never had a problem with my temper.” It says something about Carson’s reputation that reporters have grown suspicious not of his redemption but of his original sin: CNN talked to former friends and classmates and noted, solemnly, that “the violent, impulsive person Carson has described himself as is unrecognizable to them.” Similarly, Carson often talks about a moment of rage when he attacked his mother with a hammer, but, in 1988, the Detroit Free Press published an article in which Carson’s mother recalled the altercation differently. In her version, it was she who wielded the hammer, and might have used it, if Curtis had not intervened.","712","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The most damaging potential debunking is also the least clear-cut. Carson was part of the R.O.T.C. program in high school, and in “Gifted Hands” he remembers being “offered a full scholarship to West Point.” But, earlier this month, Politico reported that Carson’s campaign had “admitted” that “a central point in his inspirational personal story was fabricated”: he had never applied to West Point, let alone been accepted, and the school does not charge tuition. But Carson had never mentioned applying, and so Politico, under pressure, softened its language, saying only that Carson “conceded that he never applied nor was granted admission.” Since then, the controversy has grown more obscure—it is now an argument over what “offered” means, and whether a West Point representative might have made some encouraging remarks that Carson misinterpreted. In a press conference, he called the reports a “witch hunt.” Raising his voice (possibly for the first time all year), he claimed that Obama had not faced similar scrutiny. “There is a desperation, on behalf of some, to try to find a way to tarnish me,” he said, dejectedly—unlike Trump, Carson takes no visible pleasure in tangling with the media. “It’s just ridiculous!”","713","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"For Carson, being attacked is a relatively new experience. In the years after “Gifted Hands” was published, he turned his autobiography into an industry. He embarked upon a never-ending speaking tour and founded a charity, the Carson Scholars Fund, which has recognized more than six thousand students for their “academic achievement and humanitarian qualities.” His book spawned nine sequels, and also two documentaries, a cable-television feature film (starring Cuba Gooding, Jr.), and a long-running play in Baltimore, which was often performed for schoolchildren judged to be in need of supplementary edification. The legend of Dr. Carson was ubiquitous in the predominantly African-American schools of Baltimore. (The essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates, who grew up there, wrote, of Carson, “I saw him speak so many times that I began to have that ‘This guy again?’ feeling.”) It was ubiquitous, too, in many churches around the country, where Carson’s story served as proof that faith could conquer all. Many of the people who wait in line to hear his stump speech think of him primarily as a religious figure, which is part of the reason that the media skepticism hasn’t harmed him. Like his policy positions, which are often vague or confusing, the precise details of his biography matter less to voters than the opportunity he offers them to become characters in his uplifting story.","714","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” politics rarely intrudes. Carson joined his high school R.O.T.C. program in 1967, a few months before the Detroit riots, but the book makes no mention of them, or of the uproar over the Vietnam War, or of Martin Luther King, Jr. (Carson recently told the Wall Street Journal that, during the riots inspired by King’s assassination, he sheltered some white students in the high-school biology lab, although the Journal could not find anyone to corroborate this story.) Carson says that he was brought up to be “a fairly partisan Democrat,” but he evidently wasn’t much interested in activism. He attended Yale during a tumultuous period: in 1970, near the end of his freshman year, the campus was overtaken by protests that accompanied the trials of members of the Black Panther Party, who were accused of murder. (Hillary Clinton, then studying at Yale Law School, served as a liaison to the group that planned the protests.) But his campus life seems to have revolved mainly around Candy, his wife, a fellow-student who was also from Detroit. She is the author of a forthcoming book about their marriage, the co-author of his last three books, the leader of the Carson family string quartet (they have three grown sons, who fill out the lineup), and, he often says, the only woman he has ever been with. One of the black student leaders in those days at Yale, Kurt Schmoke, says that Carson was not among the rabble-rousers. “The Ben Carson I knew in college was a very studious person—focussed like a laser beam on going to medical school,” he says.","715","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson got his medical degree from the University of Michigan and, in 1977, arrived at Johns Hopkins, where he became known as a precise but imaginative surgeon. Readers who have heard about his life-saving feats might be surprised to learn, in “Gifted Hands,” how many of his best-known surgeries ended in disaster, or in a more equivocal result. Benjamin and Patrick Binder, the German twins who played such a large role in Carson’s career, were seven months old when the operation took place: Carson and his team had to temporarily induce hypothermic arrest so that they could disentangle the interlaced blood vessels before the babies bled out. Both survived the operation, but they suffered brain damage, and one has since died. One of the things Carson learned is how not to become paralyzed by self-doubt. He likes to say that he has performed fifteen thousand surgeries, which would mean an average of more than one a day, for more than three decades.","716","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In Baltimore, Carson was a friend and ally of Schmoke, the former student leader, who transformed his activism into a career in elected politics: from 1987 until 1999, he served as the Democratic mayor of Baltimore, and he and Carson often talked about ways to support young people in the city. At one point, when a Democratic gubernatorial candidate sought Carson’s endorsement, Schmoke urged him to decline, so as not to damage his spotless reputation. “I guess I thought that his story was above partisan politics,” Schmoke says now, chuckling. Back then, Carson liked being politically uncategorizable. In his book “The Big Picture,” published in 1999, he noted with satisfaction that he had once heard hosts on a radio show arguing over whether or not he supported Louis Farrakhan’s Million Man March. Carson conspicuously declined to settle the question. Elsewhere in the book, he preëmptively defended himself against the suggestion that he was a conservative Republican. “I’m not,” he wrote, adding that he would accept no political label more restrictive than “independent.”","717","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Schmoke remembers the day, some years ago, when Carson casually mentioned that he was skeptical of the scientific consensus on evolution. Schmoke thought he was joking, but Carson made clear that he wasn’t. “I said to myself, ‘Gosh, there must be a lot of things that Ben believes that I’ve never talked to him about,’ ” Schmoke recalls. Carson now says that his political outlook began to shift in the nineteen-eighties, when he found himself captivated by President Reagan’s message of “self-empowerment.” That became Carson’s message, too, although for many years he delivered it in nonpolitical terms. “Gifted Hands” begins with a letter from Carson’s mother, who reprises one of her favorite phrases: “If you don’t succeed, you have only yourself to blame.” In one passage, Carson declares that it is time for “minorities” to “stand on our own feet and refuse to look to anybody else to save us.” But later, in a discussion of “disadvantaged kids,” he suggests that there is “a system precluding these people from achieving.” Of course, self-help and systemic change need not be mutually exclusive. And, anyway, as a surgeon and motivational speaker Carson didn’t have to choose.","718","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson registered as a Republican only a year ago, as he considered running for President. By all accounts, it was the battle over health care that pushed him to finally embrace a political party. In 2004, President George W. Bush appointed Carson to his Council on Bioethics, and Carson began thinking more seriously about how the federal government might rein in the insurance industry, which seemed to him to consume too much of the nation’s medical spending. At a town-hall meeting in 2005, organized by the Congressional Black Caucus, he suggested a health-care system modelled on “something that already works”: the food-stamp program. (He liked the idea that recipients could shop for medical care, just as food-stamp recipients shop for groceries.) Two years later, at a council meeting, Carson suggested that, if insurance could be made more affordable, universal coverage could be achieved by fiat. He said, “There is where the government perhaps comes in and makes it mandatory, just like it’s mandatory for you to have automobile insurance.”","719","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"These ideas don’t seem radically at odds with the reform bill that President Obama eventually passed. But as the debate over the Affordable Care Act began, in 2009, Carson was dismayed to find himself shut out of the process: Obama disbanded Bush’s Council on Bioethics, and Carson tried in vain to secure a Presidential meeting. “It left him very disappointed, and devastated,” Williams says. The 2013 Prayer Breakfast speech was an expression of frustration, and also a final attempt to get through to a President who seemed intent on ignoring Carson’s expertise. On the campaign trail, Carson rarely fails to mention his idea for “health savings accounts,” which would be personal and shareable: family members could contribute to each other’s medical bills, and seniors might pass on leftover funds to their descendants. He hasn’t fully explained how these accounts would be set up, or what would happen to patients who depleted theirs. Even more than the competition, he is devout in his belief that systemic problems can be solved by topical applications of common sense.","720","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"By the time Carson launched his campaign, he had completed his evolution from Democrat to independent to eager exponent of movement conservatism. He evinced a newfound passion for gun rights. And although the Adventist Church suggests that in some “exceptional circumstances” a woman might justifiably choose to terminate a pregnancy, Carson is now “unabashedly and entirely pro-life.” Like any successful speaker, Carson knows how to read a room, and he admits that his transformation has been aided by his recent immersion in politics, and by the receptive audience that he has found among conservatives. He has emerged, for instance, as an advocate of tightened immigration laws, arguing that children born in the U.S. to unauthorized immigrants shouldn’t be given citizenship. “In talking to a lot of Americans, I realized how strongly they feel about people who come here illegally, and I think that probably has influenced me,” he says. “Because if you want to be a representative of the people, in a republic-type government, then obviously you have to represent what they feel.”","721","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson’s bus arrives at an event, his supporters often break into applause, although some find other ways to express themselves. In Waterloo, Iowa, a woman hopped in place, in anticipation of being in his presence; more than one fan, after shaking his hand, bent over and wept. In Florida, the crowds included eager teen-agers and shuffling seniors but only a small number of African-Americans. Carson occasionally acknowledges that his ideological journey has put him at odds with black voters, who play a vanishingly small role in the modern Republican Party. On the bus, which was trundling from his hotel, in Clearwater, to a Barnes & Noble in Tampa, Carson thought about how, exactly, Democrats manage to win so many African-American votes. “Don’t you think Lyndon Johnson had it right?” he said. “I’m sure you’ve heard his quote where he said, ‘Give those N-words a few goodies and we’ll have their vote for the next two hundred years.’ ” The quote comes, lightly paraphrased, from a book by Ronald Kessler, who attributes it to a former Air Force One steward, who said that he overheard a conversation between Johnson and “two governors.” The line is meant to illuminate the cynicism of Democratic politicians, although, by crediting it, Carson can’t help but belittle the intelligence of African-American voters, too. This tactic is common in politics, where leaders often devise patronizing explanations for the otherwise unaccountable fact that people sometimes vote for their opponents. (Think of Obama’s claim, during the 2008 campaign, that inhabitants of depressed towns “cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them.”) But the notion of black voters as dupes for white politicians has a particularly nettlesome history in the U.S., stretching back to Reconstruction; nowadays, some Republican politicians prefer to simply say, instead, that their party needs to get better at reaching out.","722","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Because Carson is African-American, he need not be so circumspect—one of his advantages is his willingness to talk about race in language that his rivals would be wise to avoid. He has called Obamacare “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,” and has said, of abortion, “I think it’s a moral issue—just like slavery was a moral issue.” While blasting Planned Parenthood, he asserted that its founder, Margaret Sanger, “believed that people like me should be eliminated or kept under control.” (Sanger did suggest preventing “feeble-minded” people from having children, but there is no evidence that she supported sterilization on the basis of race.) Some of his gentler formulations, too, convey a coded racial appeal: Carson often excites largely white audiences by sketching a vision of racial harmony, just as Obama once did. When he tells crowds that “our unity is what provides our strength,” he could be echoing Obama’s famous claim, from the 2004 speech that made him a national figure, that “there’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America.”","723","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Some of Carson’s biggest supporters see race as an important part of his appeal. Unlike Obama—and, for that matter, Herman Cain, the African-American businessman who briefly captivated Republican voters during the 2012 campaign—Carson entered this race as a figure well known and widely admired in African-American communities. John Philip Sousa IV, the leader of an unaffiliated pro-Carson political-action committee, is the author of “Ben Carson: Rx for America,” a slim paperback that is given out free at Carson events. (The front cover announces, “Over 1,000,000 in Print!”) Sousa, a great-grandson of the composer, argues that Carson could attract a significant minority of the African-American vote, enough to make a Democratic victory mathematically impossible; a Carson Presidency, he argues, would “forever destroy” the “false narrative that conservatives and Republicans are racists.”","724","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"There is something paradoxical about Sousa’s argument, which urges Republican voters to agree that race matters in order to demonstrate that it really doesn’t. As Carson’s audience has changed, he has modified how he talks about race, in ways that make him more acceptable to the party he recently joined. Writing in 1999, he affirmed his belief that “our justice system metes out different treatment to blacks and whites,” and declared that police in a Detroit suburb had recently arrested his mother and impounded her car, because she matched the description of a suspect. Now he suggests that African-American frustration with the criminal justice system is misdirected. “I just don’t agree that that’s where the emphasis needs to be,” he says.","725","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"At times, there are signs of tension between Carson’s old life, as a community-minded motivator, and his new life, as a Republican favorite. During one recent appearance, his customary reminiscences of boyhood gave way to a memorable digression about the joys of throwing rocks at cars. “Everybody did it, because it was so much fun,” he said, and he chuckled at the thought of police officers scrambling to catch him and his friends. “Of course, that was back in the days before they would shoot you,” he said. He stopped himself. “I’m just kidding,” he said, adding that he had “a tremendous amount of respect for the police.” He paused to accept the crowd’s applause, and, back on safe ground, added that the police were “the very last people that we should be targeting.”","726","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson mentions racial uplift, he often adds a quick disclaimer, noting that his policies are meant “not only for African-Americans but for everybody.” Sitting on the bus, though, he advocated a kind of economic separatism. “If we would learn how to turn our dollars over in our own community, two or three times, before you send it out—that’s how you generate wealth,” he told me. “That’s how the Jews did it. That’s how the Koreans did it.” Half a century earlier, Malcolm X made a strikingly similar argument, saying, “If we try and establish some industry in our own community, then we’re developing to the position where we are creating employment for our own kind.” Of course, Malcolm X’s entreaty was accompanied by a caustic corollary that probably would not impress the Republican electorate. “Once you gain control of the economy of your own community,” he added, “then you don’t have to picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for a job in his business.”","727","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"If Carson has a specific pitch to African-American voters, it is indistinguishable from his general economic pitch. He wants to lower taxes for everyone in order to spur economic activity and raise interest rates, so that poor and middle-class families can earn more interest in their savings accounts. And he wants to allow corporations to repatriate overseas money, tax free, if they use ten per cent of it to “create jobs for unemployed people and people on welfare.” His campaign’s outreach to African-Americans has consisted largely of a radio advertisement featuring a hip-hop track that not even Carson seemed to enjoy. (“I probably would have taken a little different approach,” he said after it was released.) Maybe it doesn’t much matter, given the racially polarized state of American politics. Florida, for instance, is about seventeen per cent African-American, but exit polls conducted there in 2012 suggest that only about one in a hundred Mitt Romney voters was African-American. Sometime in the future, black voters might help Republicans win the Presidency. But in this cycle it’s highly doubtful that they will help a Republican win the nomination.","728","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Earlier this fall, Carson startled the press corps—and some of his own advisers—by cutting back on his campaign schedule so that he could promote his latest book, “A More Perfect Union,” in which his political platform takes the form of a constitutional exegesis. (Carson’s ten books all cover pretty much the same territory, and so some conceptual ingenuity is required to keep his bibliography growing.) The plan, which Carson explained by saying that he wanted to fulfill his obligations to his publisher, puzzled many observers; National Review posted a blog item under the headline “this isn’t normal.” And yet the book tour helped him—or, at any rate, didn’t hurt. During October, when he was mainly off the campaign trail, his popularity increased. National polls showed him in a virtual tie for first place, with Trump; in Iowa polls, for the first time, he was the front-runner. At book signings, hundreds and even thousands of fans lined up to buy a copy of “A More Perfect Union,” have it signed, and maybe get a quick handshake. Carson apparently hasn’t lost his surgical dexterity, because often he executed the handshake while holding an uncapped Sharpie in the same hand. At a Books-A-Million in Kissimmee, Florida, employees made sure that customers didn’t linger for more than a few seconds, but one man brought the line to a halt. Bob Santos, a fellow-Adventist who had first heard about Carson through his church, had spent more than five hundred dollars on a basketful of Carson books, which he planned to distribute to friends and relatives. Once Carson had worked his way through the basket, Santos seemed exhilarated, even though he hadn’t quite got everything he wanted. “I thought he was going to personalize one of them,” Santos said. “He said he can’t.”","729","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Before Carson’s Presidential campaign was a campaign, it was a business—one largely independent of Carson himself. The Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision allows political-action committees to be more or less unregulated, so long as they don’t coördinate their activities with official campaigns. In December, 2013, Carson told potential supporters that none of the groups soliciting on his behalf had his blessing, but the pro-Carson groups didn’t need it. They kept making money and plowing it back into fund-raising, creating a virtuous and potentially lucrative cycle. The following year, as the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee—run by Sousa and Vernon Robinson, a political entrepreneur—was raising millions, Armstrong Williams suggested that the organization was dishonest. “People giving money think it’s going to Dr. Carson, and it’s not,” he said, adding, “I don’t like misleading people.”","730","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Once Carson announced his candidacy—yielding, he said, to the people who had been “clamoring” for him to run—he had to make peace with the Carson industry. Williams now believes that the unaffiliated PACs are “not as exploitative” as he had thought, and concedes that they have played an important role in boosting Carson. Williams says that he is careful not to communicate with the Super PACs. (He suffered a scandal of his own, a decade ago: he was working as a syndicated columnist, and it was revealed that the Bush Administration had paid him to promote its No Child Left Behind Act.) This must require special vigilance, because his brother, Alvin Williams, runs Black America’s Political Action Committee, which solicits donations in order to “push Dr. Carson to victory.”","731","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The official campaign has proved adept at fund-raising, too, using expensive telephone and direct-mail solicitations to reach small donors. Last month, the Federal Election Commission reported that Carson’s campaign had raised nearly twenty million dollars from donors who had given two hundred dollars or less—vastly more than any other Republican. Bush, Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Chris Christie have all attracted much more Super-PAC money than Carson, while Trump has attracted about as much as he seems to need, which is none. But, if individual donations were votes, Carson would be the people’s choice.","732","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"This is partly a matter of strategy: Carson’s campaign devotes an unusually large portion of its spending—more than fifty per cent—to fund-raising. It is also a result of Carson’s status as a kind of conservative eminence, the kind of figure who makes people excited to put a check in the mail. At the Barnes & Noble in Tampa, Sousa’s Super pac was outside in the parking lot, selling T-shirts and giving away copies of his book. An independent vender was there, too, hawking buttons. One showed Carson with hands clasped in prayer; another said, “Vote Republican—we can’t ALL be on welfare!” An elderly man wandered through the store, gawking at the line of customers that snaked around the bookcases and outside into the muggy afternoon sun. “Is Ben Carson here?” he asked a store manager. “I’ll probably vote for him—but I hate those annoying phone calls.”","733","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson’s determination to do right by his publisher, Penguin, has fuelled speculation that he is more interested in making money than in becoming President. Indeed, Carson seems as proud of his business acumen as of his surgical skill—he often reminds voters that he has served on the board of both Kellogg and Costco, and promises to reinvigorate government by bringing in people he knows from “the business world.” One of Carson’s connections has caused him some trouble during the campaign: Mannatech, a multilevel-marketing company that sells nutritional supplements it calls “glyconutrients.” In 2009, the company agreed to pay six million dollars to settle a suit, brought by the Texas attorney general, which accused it of claiming that its products “cured, treated, or mitigated” a list of ailments that included cancer, autism, asthma, toxic-shock syndrome, and attention-deficit disorder. Carson has given speeches at Mannatech events, and he appeared in a regional public-television program about brain health, sponsored by Mannatech distributors, in which he stressed the importance of glyconutrients. When I asked about Mannatech, he said the company had behaved in a way that was “a little bit dishonest,” by uploading a promotional video he appeared in that was supposed to be available only to sales associates. But even now, when discussing the company’s product, Carson can’t help but offer a sales pitch. “I use it every day,” he told me. “Since I’ve been taking it, the incidence of me getting sick has dramatically declined.”","734","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Many of Carson’s supporters are true believers: they earnestly explain how he and no other candidate could pull the country together. It can be harder to detect what Carson himself wants. Throughout the campaign, he has shown relatively little interest in the specifics of policy. His tax plan is more like a statement of general principles—he wants everyone to pay the same rate, but he hasn’t specified what that rate would be. And his foreign policy can seem like one long improvisation. During a recent debate, he responded to a question about Syria and Afghanistan with a confusing claim that “the Chinese” were active in the region; in the days afterward, the campaign clarified that Carson hadn’t meant to suggest that Chinese troops were present in Syria. At times like this, Carson’s insistence that he is a reluctant candidate can seem all too convincing—a few months before he officially announced, he told a medical journal, possibly in jest, that he would be relieved if he didn’t win. Williams remembers Carson saying, of the people urging him to run, “Maybe they see something in me that I don’t see.”","735","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Most Republican strategists maintain that voters will eventually settle on a more conventional choice, chastened by the prospect of President Carson or, more likely, of another President Clinton. But the rise of unaccountable PACs has weakened the party élites, which means that no one seems to have the credibility to tell the Republican base that nominating Carson might be a bad idea. The increasing messiness of the modern political primary has been, so far, a Republican story; this is in large part an accident of history. In Obama, the Democrats have had a leader who inspires loyalty. But in the next election cycle, or the one after it, the Democratic Party, too, may confront a base of voters eager for a candidate who has as little affection for politics as they do. Perhaps sober, élite-approved Presidential candidates, seasoned by decades of political experience, will come to seem as old-fashioned as network news anchors, and for some of the same reasons.","736","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson is, even more than Trump, the ultimate 2016 outsider. In the years since the Prayer Breakfast, he has often played the role of soft-spoken firebrand, standing up for the core principles of conservatism. But one sometimes gets the sense that his ideological conversion is incomplete. The Club for Growth, a small-government think tank, often criticizes the timorousness of the Republican establishment, and it has been critical, too, of this year’s insurgents. The group’s Super PAC spent half a million dollars on a television ad to tell Iowa voters that Trump “supports higher taxes.” (The claim relied heavily on a Trump tax proposal from 1999; the Trump campaign responded with a cease-and-desist letter.) David McIntosh, the group’s president, says that he was alarmed by Carson’s suggestion, in a 2012 book, that it was possible to “extract socialism’s positive aspects and actually implement them within capitalism.” (Carson was referring to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps.) McIntosh is not reassured by Carson’s frequent paeans to liberty. “In the Republican primary, ‘free market’ and ‘less government’ are the buzzwords,” he says. “I think he may be using those, but they don’t really reflect a well-thought-out philosophy of the role of government.” The group says it is “unable to conclude that Ben Carson would be a pro-growth president,” but its Super pac has not spent money attacking him, because it does not view him as a serious threat. “As he gets closer to the election,” McIntosh says, “people will say, ‘I’m not sure he’s ready, yet, to be President.’ ”","737","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson believes that readiness is overrated. “There’s no one person who knows everything,” he says, and he is confident in his ability to learn as he goes. But his struggles with difficult questions about governance have made that confidence harder to credit. There are signs that his popularity in Iowa is beginning to ebb—some polls suggest that Trump has regained a narrow lead there. Carson became a front-runner by deploying his motivational skills on his own behalf: he inspired Republican voters to believe that they could have any kind of President they wanted and that they did not need to settle for a mere politician. Now some of them may be realizing that there is no alternative to politics—no way for a retired neurosurgeon to become a Presidential candidate without becoming a politician, too.","738","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” Carson admitted, “I don’t handle failure well,” although he added a humblebragging clarification: “I guess the Lord knows that, so He keeps it from happening to me often.” It’s not clear that he would regard an inability to win the Presidency as a failure. If the media interrogations grow too withering, or the polls too discouraging, Carson might happily return to a new version of his old life, talking and speaking a bit more about his journey out of Detroit, and a bit less about tax rates or military movements in Syria. In the meantime, he is enjoying the crowds and the adulation. At a recent book event in Lakeland, Florida, fans filled the parking lot, and a book-tour staffer climbed onto Carson’s tour bus to photograph the scene. A small media pen had been set up near the portable lectern where Carson was signing books, and he strolled over to take questions. One reporter wanted to know how he had been preparing for the next debate. “By listening to your questions,” Carson said.","739","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"

"There are theories, out there, that the pyramids of Egypt are really giant batteries, or even electric generators. Think about it: their granite blocks were originally encased in limestone, almost as if they had been insulated, as a power conductor is, with rubber. They once had golden capstones, a bit like the copper-tops on Duracells. All that granite piled up creates a magnetic field or a radioactive one, depending on which engineering schematics one favors—this reading of the pyramids takes a number of forms—and has a profound effect on negative ions. The King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid contains what may look like a sepulchre but is really where all the gold wiring that ran through the pyramid met—a pharaonic circuit board. The pyramid is a cross between the Tower of Babel and the Tesla Tower: a massive source of wireless power, which explains why the torches that figures carry in Egyptian wall paintings aren’t plugged into anything. Delve too deeply, and the question seems less whether the pyramids are big and intricate machines built by ordinary hardworking Egyptians than whether they were built (perhaps, originally, upside down) by extraterrestrials, who might someday return to activate their force fields or laser beams. But that might be a bit much, as Ben Carson, who is running for President, would be the first to tell you.","November 5, 2015","753","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"“Various scientists have said, ‘Well, you know there were alien beings that came down and they have special knowledge and that’s how they were,” Carson said, at a graduation speech at Andrews University, in 1998. (BuzzFeed found the video.) “You know, it doesn’t require an alien being when God is with you.” The explanation for the pyramids was not only divine but laid out in one of the best-known Bible stories, which tells how Joseph, after his brothers had sold him into slavery in Egypt, had interpreted a dream of the Pharaoh’s to mean that Egypt would have seven fat years followed by seven years of famine. The Pharaoh then assigned him to do some emergency planning. (Genesis 41: “Lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.”) “My own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain. Now all the archeologists”—here, Carson waves his hand dismissively—“think that they were made for the pharaohs’ graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big if you stop and think about it. And I don’t think it’d just disappear over the course of time, to store that much grain.” Carson had his own take on the engineering: “When you look at the way that the pyramids are made, with many chambers that are hermetically sealed, they’d have to be that way for a reason.” The King’s Chamber, as he saw it, was not an instrument panel or a power substation, but a big Tupperware container.","754","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"“It’s still my belief, yes,” Carson said, on Wednesday, when CBS News asked him if he still held to this theory. Then, with an almost pitying smile, Carson explained again, as if to a child, that “the pyramids were made in a way that they had hermetically sealed compartments. You wouldn’t need hermetically sealed compartments for a sepulchre. You would need that if you were trying to preserve grain for a long period of time.”","755","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"“That was a strange deal,” Donald Trump said, when asked about Carson and the pyramids. This time, the Donald is right. There are problems with Carson’s theory. For one thing, there is very good archeological and historical evidence that the pyramids were built as monumental tombs with a religious function; they were first built among complexes of tombs. There is also pretty good evidence of an extensive network of granaries, often associated with local temples. It’s odd that Carson, a critic of big government, would assume that the only way to manage the storage job was with a giant four-faced bubble—but since the pyramids are not actually hollow, and don’t have all that much storage space relative to their size, perhaps they would be an example of statist inefficiency. (Putting aside the question of whether those chambers were ever “hermetically” sealed, the dry climate of Egypt did mean that such sealing would not have been necessary.) A pyramid also takes longer than seven years to build. Also, the pyramid-building dynasties—the Third Dynasty (c. 2700–2600 B.C.), with its step-pyramids, and the Fourth Dynasty (c. 2600–2500 B.C.), with the great pyramids at Giza—do not match many of the guesses for when a historical Joseph might have lived, which range to the Eighteenth Dynasty. The counter-argument to that might be that, since we know almost nothing about Joseph, we might as well place him anywhere. Why not treat all of Egyptian and Biblical history as collapsible, and shuffle their incidents and artifacts as much as we like, under the general rubric of ancientness?","756","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"There are mysteries about the pyramids—they were built, after all, nearly five thousand years ago—and we don’t know everything about how workers (free or not) were deployed, or what the geometry of the layout symbolized. Archeologists and engineers are still learning things from, for example, the found remnants of nearby construction camps. But that sort of study is not Carson’s project. In the 1998 commencement address, he moved quickly from the pyramids to doubts about the Big Bang theory, saying, “That’s the wonderful thing about having a relationship with God. You know, God has already told us what happened, so we don’t have to come up with fanciful theories about things.”","757","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"When Carson speaks about pyramids, he does so with the same pretense of practicality that he brings to many topics. He is a doctor, and a bearer of knowledge, including the news that the standard stories Americans are told, whether about economics, history, or science, don’t add up. Joseph was a better model, a slave who “ended up as the Prime Minister of the most powerful nation in the world at the time”; because he persisted and listened to God, he “was basically able to save the entire world with his big thinking.” Does Carson think that there is someone else who might do that? (It might interest him that the historical figure actually credited with managing the work on the earliest pyramids, a civil servant named Imhotep, was also thought to be a medical doctor.)","758","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"Thursday, the day after his CBS News interview, was a busy one for Carson, who is leading or close to Donald Trump in many polls—between them, they’ve got half of the Republican-primary electorate covered. His campaign released a radio ad with a rap beat (“Go and support Ben Car-son/For our next President and be awe-some”) and was working to counter a CNN report that suggested that, despite what Carson wrote in his autobiography, he might not have been a violent teen-ager who once almost killed his friend. It seems strange for a candidate to be offended by the idea that he had actually been a nice kid—Romney had to answer to the opposite charge—and a little like being puzzled that an ancient torch has no wires attached. But, in the context of this campaign, in which Carson has made a point of how God changed his character, there is a rationale for both the exposé and for his response. The whole business stopped making sense some time ago. A certain number of Republicans turned to Carson because the other candidates seemed even less plausible to them. As the granary theory is to the idea of the pyramids as a giant battery or the work of alien architects, so is Carson to Trump—although, some days, it seems like the other way around.","759","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"

"Republican candidates for President seem unable to shake the habit of making wildly reckless comments about science and public health. Michele Bachmann remains responsible for perhaps the most remarkable of these statements, when, in opposition to all known facts, she told Fox News, after a 2011 debate, about a girl who had “suffered mental retardation” as a result of receiving the HPV vaccine. Last week, though, Donald Trump solidified his place in the circle of scientific ignorance when he drew his own connection between vaccines and autism. “We’ve had so many instances, people that work for me,” he said, and described a “beautiful child” who, according to Trump, had recently been vaccinated, fallen ill, and “now is autistic.” Trump claimed that if vaccines were spread out, “I think you’re going to see a big impact on autism.” Trump has repeatedly expressed his view that vaccines cause autism. In 2012, he tweeted that “massive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for big increase in autism.”","September 22, 2015","769","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"I have written many times that possible links between vaccinations and autism have been researched widely and have never been found to exist, and that words like Trump’s are dangerous—and even deadly. And I am far from alone. The comments came at a particularly bad time, because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had just begun its annual attempt to convince Americans to get flu vaccines, which, while not always perfectly effective, are safe and far better for both individual and public health than not getting vaccinated. (It has always been hard to know precisely how many people die of the flu in this country each year, but the number is in the thousands.) Federal officials say that this year’s vaccine is almost certainly going to be more effective than last year’s. But, thanks to our nationally televised lunacy, the job of convincing people to get them just got harder.","770","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"Trump is terrifyingly popular, but we have come to expect dangerous inanities from him. Ben Carson, however, is another story. As a world-renowned pediatric neurosurgeon who retired after many years at Johns Hopkins, his sins against science during the debate were perhaps even more outrageous than Trump’s.","771","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"Carson’s first comment on the subject made him sound like a responsible, educated physician: “There have been numerous studies and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism.” One cheer. Then things went south: “Vaccines are very important, certain ones—the ones that would prevent death or crippling,” he said. “There are others, a multitude of vaccines, which probably don’t fit in that category, and there should be some discretion in those cases.” And: “A lot of this is … is … is pushed by big government.”","772","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"What on earth was he talking about? Today, the C.D.C. advises that American children be vaccinated for fourteen diseases before age six—and each of those diseases can, in Carson’s infelicitous words, cause “death or crippling.” “The only one you could reasonably say does not kill is mumps,” Paul Offit, a physician in the division of infectious diseases at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told the Times last week. Offit, who is among the nation’s most outspoken vaccine advocates, added that mumps can, however, cause permanent deafness and sterility in men after puberty. “Tetanus kills, rubella kills unborn children, measles kills, hepatitis B virus kills,” Offit said.","773","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"But Carson was just warming up, because what he said later was even worse: “It is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time.” With that, Carson added his voice to the rallying cry of “too many too soon,” uttered reflexively by the anti-vaccine crowd. This notion, that the vaccine schedule for children has become so crowded that it puts extra pressure on their immune systems, is immensely popular among American parents—and, increasingly, pediatricians are yielding to their requests to delay vaccines.","774","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"This, too, is dangerous. As Tara Haelle pointed out in a particularly useful post at Forbes.com, delaying vaccines just prolongs a child’s risk for preventable diseases. The data could not be clearer. And, despite the increase in scheduled vaccines, children are exposed to far fewer antigens than ever before. As many people (including me) have written, the smallpox vaccine—which we stopped administering after the disease was eradicated, in the nineteen-seventies—contained two hundred proteins. When counted all together, the fourteen vaccines that children receive today contain no more than a hundred and fifty.","775","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"The only other trained medical professional on the stage also failed his biology (and public-service) tests last week. Rand Paul, an ophthalmologist, said, “I’m all for vaccines. But I’m also for freedom.” He seemed to care more about repeating that political conceit than about the lives of his constituents. He agreed with Carson that vaccines were “too bunched up.”","776","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"It is sad to have to write this, when it should be clear by now, but here it is: vaccines are the most successful medical intervention in the history of humanity. They have prevented millions of deaths. They are a triumph of human ingenuity and of our desire to alleviate suffering.","777","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"There are not too many. They are not administered too soon. They do not cause autism or allergies or cancer. The only thing “too bunched up” about vaccines, as a matter of fact, are the falsehoods and deliberate misconceptions spread by demagogues and then endorsed by people like Carson and Paul, both of whom should—and almost certainly do—know better.","778","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"

"Evidently, President Obama felt the same frustration and hopelessness that many others did. But rather than resigning himself to the situation, he went down to the White House briefing room and issued one of the most powerful statements that he has delivered since taking office. We should be grateful that he did. Even if it doesn’t do much immediate good, it will be there in the record, to remind historians where the primary blame lies for this ongoing national disgrace.","804","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The President started out by saying some words about the victims and their families, and said, “America will wrap everyone who’s grieving with our prayers and our love.” Then he said, “It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America—next week, or a couple of months from now…. We are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.”","805","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Earlier this year, the President recalled, he made this point in an interview, noting that the country persists with lax gun laws despite repeated mass killings. “And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day! Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to this.”","806","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Obama’s emotion—his anger—was palpable. He went on: “We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out. We need more guns, they’ll argue. Fewer gun-safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?”","807","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Whether they believe it or not, supporters of the gun lobby were already out there making this argument—on cable shows, on conservative Web sites, and on social media. Some of them argued that the shooter targeted Umpqua Community College because it was a “gun-free zone,” a claim that has been disputed. Others accused President Obama of playing politics—apparently ignorant of, or oblivious to, the fact that he had already addressed this very criticism.","808","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"“What’s also routine is that somebody, somewhere, will comment and say, ‘Obama politicized this issue,’ ” the President said. “Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.” He challenged news organizations to “tally up the number of Americans who’ve been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who’ve been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports.” He went on: “We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?”","809","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"We all know the answer.","810","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The Republican Party has long exercised a veto on any meaningful addition to the gun laws. And among its current crop of Presidential candidates, there is no sign of anybody breaking ranks. Reaction to the shooting ranged from nonexistent to predictably depressing. As far as I could see, Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina, the third- and fourth-place candidates in the polls, didn’t say anything on Thursday about what had happened in Oregon. In a message on Twitter, Jeb Bush called the massacre a “senseless tragedy.” Donald Trump, in an interview with the Washington Post, referred to it as a “terrible tragedy.” He also said, “It sounds like another mental-health problem. So many of these people, they’re coming out of the woodwork.” Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, took a similar line. “Obviously, there are those who are going to be calling for gun control,” he said on “The Hugh Hewitt Show.” “Obviously, that’s not the issue. The issue is the mentality of these people.”","811","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"That is a familiar trope, of course: it’s not the guns that are the problem, it’s the shooters. There was no suggestion from anybody on the Republican side that what had happened might justify a reconsideration of gun laws, let alone a significant recasting of them. Even those G.O.P. candidates who have previously expressed support for some forms of gun control, such as Chris Christie and George Pataki, didn’t have anything to say on that subject.","812","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The Democratic candidates, by contrast, were united in calling for action. Speaking to reporters in Massachusetts, Hillary Clinton said, “We have got to get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe.” She suggested that it wasn’t a hopeless task: “I know there is a way to have sensible gun-control measures that help prevent violence, prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands, and save lives. And I am committed to doing everything I can to achieve that.” Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, said in a tweet, “Tweets won’t stop this. Thoughts and prayers won’t either. Only real gun reforms will stop mass shootings from occurring nearly every day.” Bernie Sanders, who has been accused by Clinton allies of shifting his positions on gun control, called for “sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them.”","813","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"But Democrats aren’t entirely blameless. After experiencing a political backlash during the nineteen-nineties, when the Clinton Administration pushed through gun-control measures that included a ban on assault weapons, too many members of the Party adopted a craven approach as, during the Bush years, Republicans in Congress rolled back some of the reforms. Even President Obama, who urged for stricter gun control during his 2008 campaign, can’t entirely escape criticism. During his first term, when for two years the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, his Administration didn’t propose any actual gun-control legislation. It wasn’t until 2013, after the massacre in Newtown, that the White House made a serious effort to persuade Congress to act—one that failed in the face of implacable Republican opposition.","814","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"If you listened closely to Obama on Thursday, you would have noticed that, in his words of anger and despair, he didn’t entirely spare himself, or the rest of us, from responsibility. “This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America,” he said. “We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.”","815","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"That is true. But it is also true, as Obama pointed out, that “this is not something I can do by myself.” To break through the politics of hopelessness, it will evidently take something more than blood—the blood of women, men, children, teachers, pastors, janitors, pensioners, first responders, anybody who happens to be in the way—being shed. “I hope and pray that I don’t have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances,” Obama said. “But based on my experience as President, I can’t guarantee that.”","816","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Fifteen years ago, as Philip Roth was reading the galleys of a memoir by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., he came to a passage about the political fevers of 1939-40, when reactionaries like Father Charles Coughlin, Henry Ford, and Charles Lindbergh brandished the twin banners of nativism and isolation. Moderate Republicans, including Wendell Willkie, a corporate lawyer who eventually won the Party’s Presidential nomination, were never likely to topple F.D.R., and some Party grandees wanted Lindbergh to run. Lindbergh was known by then not only as the daring aviator who crossed the Atlantic in the Spirit of St. Louis but also as a bigot so vile that F.D.R., upon reading one of his speeches, remarked that “it could not have been better put if it had been written by Goebbels himself.”","817","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Next to a passage where Schlesinger raised the question of whether Republicans would put Lindbergh forward at the head of a new Know-Nothing Party, Roth wrote, “What if they had?” That marginal note became the germ for “The Plot Against America,” a counter-factual novel in which Lindbergh is elected President. “Fear presides over these memories,” Roth’s novel begins, “perpetual fear.” Anyone who dares to look past the comedy of Donald Trump’s surreal tweets and Ben Carson’s end-times ruminations will notice that the politics of perpetual fear is, in our times, the stuff of nonfiction.","818","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Last week, the Democrats held their first debate, a five-candidate affair in Las Vegas—an unlikely place to hear denunciations of “the casino-capitalist process.” Still, it was a relatively civil and sober discussion compared with the Republican rodeos. After a year of floundering, Hillary Clinton, cool, well-schooled, forensically skilled, had her best hours as a candidate. Her performance provided relief for her supporters and a potential lure for the undecided. She was, contrary to previous reports, conspicuously human-seeming—funny, passionate, even, at times, rueful of past mistakes—a development that might have robbed her potential rival, Vice-President Joe Biden, of the rationale he needed to make a run. Bernie Sanders, the seventy-four-year-old junior senator from Vermont and unapologetic democratic socialist, spoke in a voice that suggested Larry David, on “Seinfeld,” imitating George Steinbrenner. And yet although Clinton handily won the debate, Sanders largely set the terms, pushing her toward a more full-throated progressive view of income inequality and other issues. (From offstage, the Black Lives Matter movement had an equally serious influence on the discussion of race.)","819","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Sanders also paused for an act of clever generosity, declaring, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails!” Beaming and extending her hand, Clinton thanked him but did not reciprocate the kindness, swatting him on his weak record on gun control, citing his multiple votes against the Brady bill. And while Clinton totted up her own list of Scandinavian-style domestic goals, such as paid parental leave, she raised a brow at Sanders when he talked of “revolution” and the systemic rot of late capitalism. In case we hadn’t figured it out, Hillary Clinton wants to win.","820","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"History may look back on the Las Vegas debate as the event that elevated Clinton the way that Barack Obama’s eloquent victory speech after the Iowa caucuses elevated him, nearly eight years ago. It might even be regarded as the moment when she boxed out Biden, raked away the underbrush of Mssrs. Chafee, Webb, and O’Malley, and made Sanders look less like a plausible contender than like a protest candidate who forced his opponent to grapple with a political system poisoned by the outsized influence of an American oligarchy comprising, as the Times has reported, a hundred and fifty-eight families.","821","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"One debate will not erase all of what many voters see as Clinton’s complications: the lingering perception of her sense of moneyed entitlement, her lawyerly slipperiness under questioning, the walled garden of her political circle, her interventionist reflexes, her belatedness on gay marriage, comprehensive immigration, and Wall Street reforms. But if Clinton was not flawless she and her debating partners managed one distinct achievement: they accentuated the chaos, the intellectual barrenness, and the general collapse of their rivals in the Republican Party.","822","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Consider the political spectacle on Capitol Hill, in which Speaker John Boehner, hardly a Rockefeller Republican, could no longer deal with his caucus and, with little more than a chorus of “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah,” announced his early retirement. Members of the caucus stepped forward to admit that the hearings on Benghazi were aimed less at uncovering the truth than at burying Hillary Clinton. An ambitious Party loyalist, Paul Ryan, is reluctant to run for Boehner’s chair because the House Republicans are the new Wild Bunch and, as a friend of Ryan’s put it to Politico, “he’s not a f—ing moron.”","823","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Consider, too, the G.O.P. candidates for the White House. Donald Trump and Ben Carson, the only Republicans polling in double digits, daily clear their throats with that ritual preface of modern self-satisfaction—“I am not politically correct”—and then unleash statements, positions, and postures so willfully detached from fact that they embarrass the political culture that harbors them. Trump is willing to say anything—anything racist, anything false, anything “funny”—to terrify voters, or rile them, or amuse them, depending on the moment. The worst of his demagogic arousals are reminiscent of Lindbergh’s speeches at America First rallies and his fear, as he wrote in Reader’s Digest, of a “pressing sea of Yellow, Black and Brown.” Carson, who seems as historically confused as he is surgically skilled, has said that Obamacare is worse than 9/11, “because 9/11 is an isolated incident.” What’s more, the two men’s rivals either fall into line or lack the persuasive powers and the courage to marginalize candidates they know to be dangerous.","824","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"In electoral terms, Democrats had to view the week’s events with confidence. But there is pathos and foreboding here for the republic. In the debate, Clinton was clear who her enemies were: “the Republicans.” Reports of the death of the radical right are premature. In 2016, the G.O.P. is likely, at a minimum, to hold its majority in the House. If there is a campaign promise in 2016 that is almost sure to be fulfilled, it is that obstructionism and political war will continue, for within the G.O.P. the politics of perpetual fear goes on corroding not just a party but a nation. ♦","825","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Over the past few days, as family members of the nine people killed by a gunman at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, prepared to bury their loved ones, many of the G.O.P. candidates for President have been offering their thoughts on what to do—or, rather, what not to do—about gun violence.","October 7, 2015","826","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Let’s start with Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who is currently running second, behind Donald Trump, in the G.O.P. polls. Participating in an exchange on Facebook on Monday night, Carson recalled removing bullets from gunshot victims, and added, “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” On Tuesday morning, Carson went on Fox News and said, “It’s the person behind the gun. Guns don’t kill people.” He didn’t stop there. Asked what he would do if a gunman walked up to him, put a gun to his head, and asked him what his religion was, Carson replied, “I’m glad you asked that question. Because not only would I probably not coöperate with them, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’ ”","827","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"It’s hard to believe that anybody, let alone a politician running for national office, would insult the victims of a massacre by suggesting that their response had been inadequate. About the most that can be said for Carson is that he isn’t a professional politician: he’s a novice. So is Trump, who, on Tuesday, described himself as a “very big Second Amendment person,” and suggested that the problem in Umpqua was that no one on the scene, apart from the twenty-six-year-old shooter, was armed. (At least one student, an Army veteran, was carrying a gun, a few buildings away.) Trump also said that he opposed a ban on assault weapons—a proposal that he expressed support for in 2000.","828","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"But, surely, the serious candidates—the Jeb Bushes and Marco Rubios—must have said something more consequential. Not exactly.","829","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Bush’s “stuff happens” line, which he uttered in South Carolina on Friday, has already entered the political lexicon and provided a gift to the Democrats. Rather than rehashing the debate about whether the remark was taken out of context (it wasn’t), let’s examine what Bush has said since then. After all, he’s had five more days to clarify how he would tackle gun violence. On Monday, he released a new campaign video, which said nothing about what happened in Oregon. On Tuesday, he published an op-ed in the Des Moines Register, which also didn’t bring up the massacre or its aftermath. Then, on Tuesday night, Bush delivered a long speech at a Republican dinner in Iowa. Once again, he made no mention of Umpqua or guns.","830","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Perhaps that is not surprising. The recipient of an “A+” rating from the National Rifle Association, Bush, during his time as governor of Florida, vigorously opposed efforts to expand gun control, and signed into law the notorious “Stand Your Ground” law. Marco Rubio, who is now leading Bush in most polls, is perhaps a more interesting case. Back in 2000, when he was running for a seat in Florida’s House of Representatives, Rubio said that he supported “reasonable restrictions” on gun sales. And after the Sandy Hook massacre, in December, 2012, Rubio’s spokesman said that Rubio would support measures to keep guns out of the hands of felons and the mentally ill.","831","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Since then, though, Rubio has backtracked and cozied up to the N.R.A. While campaigning in Iowa on Friday, he said, “Criminals don’t follow gun laws. Only law-abiding people follow gun laws.” On Tuesday, appearing on NBC’s “Today” show, he said, “The laws that many are proposing would have done nothing to prevent these attacks.” Rather than focussing on measures like expanding background checks for gun purchases, “the country should examine mental illness.”","832","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Many of the other G.O.P. candidates took a similar line. “The problem is mental illness and not necessarily gun registration or gun ownership,” Rand Paul said in a radio interview. Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” Chris Christie told George Stephanopoulos, “I’m very concerned about the mental-health side of this.” On CNN’s “At This Hour,” Mike Huckabee said, “Do we need to do a better job in mental health? You bet we do.”","833","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"What about Carly Fiorina, who promotes herself as a can-do, problem-solving leader? Couldn’t she say something different and less predictable? No. Fiorina, too, is a loyal supporter of the N.R.A., whose annual meeting she addressed earlier this year in a campaign-style video, boasting about her husband’s concealed-carry permits and saying, “When government takes away our guns, we are headed down a dangerous path.” On Friday, Fiorina criticized President Obama’s impassioned call for action, describing it as “premature, at best,” and “at worst, a really unfortunate politicization of this tragedy.”","834","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"That was the pretty much the same thing Fiorina said in June, after Obama reacted to the mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. In fact, this is now the standard Republican/N.R.A. line. Each one of these massacres is regrettable and demands further study. But anybody who states the blatantly obvious—that countries with strict guns laws don’t have this problem—is politicizing the issue; they should either zip it, or confine themselves to expressing concern over mental illness.","835","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Of course, as HBO’s John Oliver pointed out over the weekend, talking about mental illness is largely a diversion, which distorts the facts about gun violence and serves to preserve the status quo. In 2013, during the Obama Administration’s effort to get some relatively minor gun-control laws through Congress, the White House proposed increasing the funding for mental-health programs and other initiatives designed to identify and help people who are potentially dangerous. Republicans in the Senate blocked the gun-control measures anyway, and no doubt they’d do the same this year if Obama were to send over a similar bill. On this issue, elected G.O.P. officials aren’t interested in reason or compromise. They are interested, primarily, in avoiding a challenge in the next election from an N.R.A.-backed candidate.","836","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"In a sense, there’s nothing new here. For decades now, the N.R.A. and the rest of the gun lobby have had a grip on the Republican Party. But as the number of gun massacres has increased the consequences of this political capture have become harder to ignore. Now, in the full glare of a Presidential election, they cannot be avoided. Rather than engaging in an honest effort to address gun violence and prevent more senseless carnage, practically every G.O.P. candidate has been reduced to repeating a mantra that many of them, surely, cannot fully believe.","837","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"

"Behind the brash, self-aggrandizing, and occasionally obnoxious exterior that Donald Trump presents to the world lurks a not entirely inconsequential level of intelligence and self-awareness. “I play to people’s fantasies,” he has said in explaining his business success, which is based, to a large extent, on the often blatantly false idea that anything with his name on it is bigger, better, more exclusive, and more glamorous than rival products. “I call it truthful hyperbole.”","September 11, 2015","839","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"When Trump entered Republican politics, which, increasingly, is the politics of reaction and resentment, he quickly grasped that making outlandish statements served a purpose in that arena, too, especially if his remarks were laced with vinegar. Indeed, he found that the bigger, badder, and meaner the persona he adopted was, the better he did in the polls.","840","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Doubtless, this was welcome news to him. As anyone who has followed Trump’s career knows, he has always had very thin skin, which naturally inclines him to lash out at critics in the media and elsewhere who dare to question his claims. Now, it seemed, he could give vent to his inner nature and also do himself some good. Thus was born Trump the serial insulter, a political phenom who, for the past six weeks or so, has been sitting dandy atop the G.O.P. primary polls. Indeed, a new CNN poll shows that his level of support among likely Republican voters has crossed the thirty-per-cent mark. Apart from Ben Carson, another political neophyte, who was at nineteen per cent, the rest of the Republican candidates are all stuck in single figures.","841","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"The CNN poll was released shortly after Rolling Stone reported that Trump had said, in remarks directed at Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and the only woman running in the G.O.P. primary, “Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?”","842","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Trump’s comments about Mexican immigrants, John McCain, and Megyn Kelly, among others, have accustomed us to his outrageous and misogynistic statements. (He has twice retweeted someone who called Kelly, the star of Fox’s news division, a “bimbo.”) In the political world, indeed, there has been growing acceptance that Trump can get away with saying things that other candidates can’t; in some quarters, there was even reluctant admiration for how adeptly he was exploiting this advantage.","843","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Until now, that is.","844","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"On Thursday, with very good reason, he was subjected to criticism from virtually every quarter, including from some Republican rivals who, earlier in the summer, had tried to ignore him. Jeb Bush called Trump’s remarks about Fiorina “small and inappropriate,” and said that he seemed intent on insulting his way to the Presidency. Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, called Trump an “egomaniacal madman who has no principles,” and said that it was time for him to return to reality television. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton said that Trump “seems to delight in insulting women every chance he gets.” Fiorina refused to respond directly, stating merely that, with her recent (if modest) rise in the polls, she seemed to be getting under Trump’s skin.","845","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Trump, for once, seemed to be knocked off balance by all this. Initially, in an interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, he had suggested that Jann Wenner, the liberal publisher of Rolling Stone, had altered the article to make him look bad. “The writer actually called me and said, ‘I’m so upset, I wrote this great story and Jann Wenner screwed it up . . . because they added a lot of stuff, a lot of garish stuff, that I think is disgusting,’ ” Trump claimed.","846","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Perhaps realizing that this story might not go over well, he provided an alternative explanation to Fox News, arguing that he had been talking about Fiorina’s “persona” rather than her physical appearance. “I say that about a lot of people,” he said. “I say, Look at that . . . . That’s not going to be our President!” Unfortunately for Trump, a quick glance at the article confirms that his remarks were surely directed at Fiorina’s appearance. The writer, Paul Solotaroff, was hanging out with Trump and some of his staffers on his private plane. They were watching the news and joshing around. This is Solotaroff’s description of the scene:","847","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Later on Thursday, Trump tried out yet another line. Appearing once again on Fox News, he was confronted by a skeptical Greta Van Susteren, who said to him, “I don’t think you’re a first-time offender making a personal crack at a woman . . . the remark was about her face, and not about her persona.” This time, Trump suggested that he had been speaking not as a Presidential candidate but as an entertainer. “I did ‘The Apprentice’ and it was one of the top shows on television,” Trump said, adding, “Some comments are made as an entertainer and, as everybody said, as an entertainer is a much different ballgame.”","848","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"That it is, and the issue now is whether Trump will finally suffer some adverse consequences for breaking the rules of his adopted sport. One theory, expostulated in this week’s edition of The Economist, suggests that he won’t. “He says things that no politician would, so people think he is not a politician,” an article in the magazine said. “His supporters . . . think his boorishness is a sign of authenticity—of a leader who can channel the rage of those who feel betrayed by the elite or left behind by social change.”","849","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Surely, there is something in this argument. Even angry Republicans, however, demand a certain level of civility in their Presidential candidates. Or, at least, Trump’s frantic efforts to divert attention from what he actually said about Fiorina suggest that they do. So does the rise in the polls of Ben Carson, who is civil to a fault. Trump, by contrast, just can’t seem to quit. Like a gambler on a lucky streak, he keeps doubling down. Unlike normal gamblers, however, he has appeared during his campaign to be playing with the odds loaded in his favor.","850","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Maybe, just maybe, that is changing. When Trump made his remarks about Megyn Kelly having “blood coming out of her whatever,” there was at least some ambiguity about what he really meant. This time, there is none. Still, Trump won’t apologize. “What can I say, I’m leading with the evangelicals, I’m leading with women,” he said to Van Susteren. “I’m leading with African-Americans, with a very high number, and I’m leading with Hispanics, which is very interesting and I’m not surprised, because I’m gonna bring jobs back to our country.”","851","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"

"“President Obama and Hillary Clinton’s idea that we should bring tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America—it is nothing less than lunacy,” Ted Cruz said on Fox News, the day after the attacks on Paris. If there are Syrian Muslims who are really being persecuted, he said, they should be sent to “majority-Muslim countries.” Then he reset his eyebrows, which had been angled in a peak of concern, as if he had something pious to say. And he did: “On the other hand,” he added, “Christians who are being targeted for genocide, for persecution, Christians who are being beheaded or crucified, we should be providing safe haven to them. But President Obama refuses to do that.”","November 16, 2015","881","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"The next day, at a middle school in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Cruz spoke even more openly about those whom he considers to be the good people in the world. He told reporters that we should accept Christians from Syria, and only Christians, because, he said, “There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror.” This will come as a profound surprise to the people of Oklahoma City and Charleston, to all parties in Ireland, and to the families of the teen-agers whom Anders Breivik killed in Norway, among many others. The Washington Post noted that Cruz “did not say how he would determine that refugees were Christian or Muslim.” Would he accept baptismal certificates, or notes from pastors? Does he just want to hear the refugees pray?","882","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"On Monday, President Barack Obama reacted to this suggestion with some anger. “When I hear folks say that, well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims, when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which person who’s fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefitted from protection when they were fleeing political persecution, that’s shameful,” Obama said. (That last bit, about “families who’ve benefitted” when fleeing persecution, was an unmistakable reference to Cruz and Marco Rubio.) Obama continued, “That’s not who we are. We don’t have religious tests to our compassion.” The question is whether Obama can put that compassion to use, in this precipitous moment after Paris, when so many bad choices will seem appealing, including attacks on our fellow-citizens. (On Monday, Donald Trump said that, though he’d “hate to do it,” as President he would “seriously consider” closing mosques that were viewed as centers of radicalism.) The real criticism is that the United States has taken so few Syrian refugees of any religion—just about fifteen hundred, all of whom have been screened by a process that can take up to two years.","883","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"Cruz is cruder than some, but he is not alone among Republicans. On Sunday, Jeb Bush also said that, although he isn’t entirely opposed to helping refugees who’d been screened, “I think our focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore.” (Christians were ten per cent of Syria’s population when the civil war broke out.) On Monday morning, Bush spoke about how “we should focus on creating safe havens for refugees in Syria rather than bringing them all the way across the United States”—a life in no-fly zones, while, according to a vision Bush also laid out over the weekend, a major land war involving U.S. troops was launched around them. He quickly added, “But I do think there is a special, important need to make sure that Syrians are being protected, because they are being slaughtered in the country and, but for us, who—who would take care of the number of Christians that right now are completely displaced?” Others, like Rubio, have avoided the Christian question by saying that they don’t think we should take refugees at all. Ben Carson, speaking to Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday,” said that taking in refugees “from that area of the world, I think, is a huge mistake. … To bring them over here, under these circumstances, is a suspension of intellect,” and would ignore “the reason the human brain has these big frontal lobes, as opposed to other animals.” (He then talked at greater length about “brain stems.”) Trump, in the past, has claimed that Syrian Muslim refugees can get into America “easily” (they cannot), while “if you’re from Syria and you’re Christian you cannot come into this country” (again, not the case). But, mostly, Trump doesn’t want to let anybody in, at least not anybody of the tempest-tossed type. Indeed, it’s not clear that the talk of Christian refugees is meant, even by the loudest Republicans, to translate into the appearance of Syrian Christians in America, as opposed to being an acknowledgment that some of the crowds that cheer when they hear anti-immigrant rhetoric might have qualms of conscience. The problem, they can be told, is just that our Muslim-sympathizing, cowardly leaders would bring in the wrong refugees.","884","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"Christians are in danger in Syria. Their danger is distinct but not unique. The Yazidis, an even more isolated religious minority, have been a particular target of ISIS. Shiites and Alawites have been targeted, too. Refugee policies have at times rightly recognized the urgent danger that certain religious or otherwise distinct groups are in, and have properly responded. This is something quite different than saying, as Cruz does, that being a Muslim should be a basis for exclusion. Would he let in atheists, for that matter? It seems strange, when moderate Muslims are trying to distance themselves from a milieu of terror, that we would insist that such a thing is impossible. There are international and American laws that recognize people who need protection. There are principles of common decency which do the same. What they do not do is use faith, or the lack of it, as a basis for rejection. (America should have let in more Jewish refugees during the Second World War; that wouldn’t have meant turning away Thomas Mann.) And it is a brutal insult to Syrians who have gone through four and half years of carnage to say that the fact that they are Sunnis gives them some sort of immunity from ISIS or from the Assad regime. There are four million Syrian refugees outside of the country now, and many more inside it. There will likely be some bad people among them. That fact does not obviate their suffering. Taking more of them in can be an unpopular position at a moment when the news is full of speculation that one of the Paris attackers had passed through a refugee camp in Greece with a Syrian passport. But their desperation will not disappear if we lose interest in it; it may just take a different and more destructive form. We have a role in deciding where they will go next.","885","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"One of the more dishonest aspects of Cruz’s comments on Fox was his characterization of who the Syrian refugees are. He mentioned an estimate that, in the “early waves” of refugees entering Europe, “seventy-seven per cent of those refugees were young men. That is a very odd demographic for a refugee wave.” Perhaps it would be, if the number were accurate. A bare majority of the Syrian refugees are women, as FactCheck.org noted in September, when Ben Carson and Scott Walker raised similar alarms. About twenty-two per cent are men between the ages of eighteen and fifty-nine—a broad definition of “young.” Cruz is smart enough to know this. He may be referring to a number given for migrants who arrived in Europe, from nine different countries, by taking a specific, dangerous Mediterranean sea route in 2014 (seventy-two per cent). Among the two million Syrian refugees the United Nations has registered in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon, a full thirty-eight per cent are under the age of twelve.","886","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"For that matter, why shouldn’t there be young men among the refugees? In stories about why people emigrate, like the one told by Nicholas Schmidle last month in The New Yorker, one reason young men give as a motivating factor for leaving their countries is the fear of being conscripted by one side or the other. They don’t want to be killed, and they don’t want to be killers. Is it Cruz’s view that a nineteen-year-old, just out of high school, should head for the hills, looking for the moderate Syrian opposition that even the C.I.A. has been unable to find? Or should he languish in a camp, with no prospects of really settling anywhere, as a target for the wrong type of tutor? That is not going to make Europe or the United States any safer. What Cruz and the others are saying is that the threat people are living under, which has been enough to drive them from their homes, should not matter. What does matter is whether we feel threatened by them.","887","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"The other insinuation that Cruz and others are making is that Obama doesn’t like Christians, and refuses to acknowledge the Islamic character of terrorism—maybe, they suggest, because of his character, or because of who he is. “I recognize that Barack Obama does not wish to defend this country,” Cruz said. And saying that was shameful, too.","888","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"

"In the wake of the massacre at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, Hillary Clinton promised that if she is elected President she will use executive power to make it harder for people to buy guns without background checks. Meanwhile, Ben Carson, one of the Republican Presidential candidates, said, “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” The two responses could hardly have been more different, but both were testaments to the power of a single organization: the National Rifle Association. Clinton invoked executive action because the N.R.A. has made it unthinkable that a Republican-controlled Congress could pass meaningful gun-control legislation. Carson found it expedient to make his comment because the N.R.A. has shaped the public discourse around guns, in one of the most successful P.R. (or propaganda, depending on your perspective) campaigns of all time.","891","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"In many accounts, the power of the N.R.A. comes down to money. The organization has an annual operating budget of some quarter of a billion dollars, and between 2000 and 2010 it spent fifteen times as much on campaign contributions as gun-control advocates did. But money is less crucial than you’d think. The N.R.A.’s annual lobbying budget is around three million dollars, which is about a fifteenth of what, say, the National Association of Realtors spends. The N.R.A.’s biggest asset isn’t cash but the devotion of its members. Adam Winkler, a law professor at U.C.L.A. and the author of the 2011 book “Gunfight,” told me, “N.R.A. members are politically engaged and politically active. They call and write elected officials, they show up to vote, and they vote based on the gun issue.” In one revealing study, people who were in favor of permits for gun owners described themselves as more invested in the issue than gun-rights supporters did. Yet people in the latter group were four times as likely to have donated money and written a politician about the issue.","892","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"The N.R.A.’s ability to mobilize is a classic example of what the advertising guru David Ogilvy called the power of one “big idea.” Beginning in the nineteen-seventies, the N.R.A. relentlessly promoted the view that the right to own a gun is sacrosanct. Playing on fear of rising crime rates and distrust of government, it transformed the terms of the debate. As Ladd Everitt, of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, told me, “Gun-control people were rattling off public-health statistics to make their case, while the N.R.A. was connecting gun rights to core American values like individualism and personal liberty.” The success of this strategy explains things that otherwise look anomalous, such as the refusal to be conciliatory even after killings that you’d think would be P.R. disasters. After the massacre of schoolchildren in Newtown, Connecticut, the N.R.A.’s C.E.O. sent a series of e-mails to his members warning them that anti-gun forces were going to use it to “ban your guns” and “destroy the Second Amendment.”","893","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"The idea that gun rights are perpetually under threat has been a staple of the N.R.A.’s message for the past four decades. Yet, for most of that period, the gun-control movement was disorganized and ineffective. Today, the landscape is changing. “Newtown really marked a major turning point in America’s gun debate,” Winkler said. “We’ve seen a completely new, reinvigorated gun-control movement, one that has much more grassroots support, and that’s now being backed by real money.” Michael Bloomberg’s Super PAC, Independence USA, has spent millions backing gun-control candidates, and he’s pledged fifty million dollars to the cause. Campaigners have become more effective in pushing for gun-control measures, particularly at the local and state level: in Washington State last year, a referendum to expand background checks got almost sixty per cent of the vote. There are even signs that the N.R.A.’s ability to make or break politicians could be waning; senators it has given F ratings have been reëlected in purple states. Indeed, Hillary Clinton’s embrace of gun control is telling: previously, Democratic Presidential candidates tended to shy away from the issue.","894","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"These shifts, plus the fact that demographics are not in the N.R.A.’s favor (Latino and urban voters mostly support gun control), might make it seem that the N.R.A.’s dominance is ebbing. But, if so, that has yet to show up in the numbers. A Pew survey last December found that a majority of Americans thought protecting gun rights was more important than gun control. Fifteen years before, the same poll found that sixty-six per cent of Americans thought that gun control mattered more. And last year, despite all the new money and the grassroots campaigns, states passed more laws expanding gun rights than restricting them.","895","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"What is true is that the N.R.A. at last has worthy opponents. The gun-control movement is far more pragmatic than it once was. When the N.R.A. took up the banner of gun rights, in the seventies, gun-control advocates were openly prohibitionist. (The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence was originally called the National Coalition to Ban Handguns.) Today, they’re respectful of gun owners and focussed on screening and background checks. That’s a sensible strategy. It’s also an accommodation to the political reality that the N.R.A. created. ♦","896","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"It is a well-known rule of prime-time television that you don’t give away the plot or run the celebrity interview early in the show, so that people won’t tune out and go to bed. Ideally, you keep viewers on the hook until the last minute.

"Evidently, the folks at CNN decided that an hour was about as long as they could keep people hanging. That was the point in the debate, which was held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, in Simi Valley, California, when the host, Jake Tapper, asked Carly Fiorina to comment on Donald Trump’s recent offensive remarks about her appearance. (According to Rolling Stone, Trump said, after seeing Fiorina on television, “Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next President?”)","898","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Until that point, the debate had gone pretty much as expected, with various candidates taking their shots at knocking Trump off his perch, and the seemingly indestructible New York businessman bluffing his way through without suffering much apparent injury. Tapper raised Rand Paul’s concern, expressed on CNN earlier in the week, about a man of Trump’s temperament having his finger on the nuclear button. (Trump replied, “My temperament is very good, very calm.”) Jeb Bush had accused Trump of using political donations to lobby for Florida to legalize casino gambling, and claimed that he had rebuffed Trump’s attempt. (“Jeb, don’t make things up. Come on,” Trump said, rebutting the notion that he’d wanted casino gambling there.) And Scott Walker, evidently unaware of Trump’s actual role on his long-running reality-TV show, said that we don’t need another apprentice in the White House. (Trump didn’t bother responding to that.)","899","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Fiorina, though, bided her time. Offered an early opportunity to comment on Trump’s putative role as commander of America’s nuclear arsenal, she demurred, noting merely that he was “a wonderful entertainer.” The question of his fitness to be Commander-in-Chief would be one for the voters to answer, she said. A bit later, she made it clear that she had no doubt of her own C-in-C chops. Rather than negotiating with Vladimir Putin (as Trump has suggested he would), Fiorina said that she would rebuild the Sixth Fleet, reconstruct the American missile-defense system in Eastern Europe, and send thousands more troops to Germany. Russia was “a bad actor,” she averred, and Putin was “someone we should not talk to.”","900","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"That comment earned Fiorina some applause from an audience that appeared to have been drawn from the Hoover Institution/Cold War wing of conservatism, more than the Tea Party. But she didn’t receive nearly as much applause for that as for the response she gave to Tapper’s question about the Rolling Stone article, following another exchange between Trump and Bush, during which Trump emphasized that he’d heard something Bush had said. Looking levelly into the camera, Fiorina, the only female in the G.O.P. race, said calmly but forcefully, “Mr. Trump said that he heard Mr. Bush very clearly and what Mr. Bush said. I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.”","901","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Doubtless, it was a line that Fiorina had rehearsed, but she delivered it beautifully, and it generated by far the biggest cheers of the night. Trump, for once, seemed somewhat at a loss for words, and his face, which was red all night—it was very hot onstage, and many other candidates were sweating, too—seemed to blush a little deeper. “I think she’s got a beautiful face,” he said, finally, “and I think she’s a beautiful woman.” It wasn’t an apology (Trump doesn’t do those), and it was greeted with near silence.","902","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"A bit later on, Tapper afforded Trump the opportunity to win back some points of his own, bringing up Fiorina’s record as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. “The company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster,” Trump said, citing a study by a Yale professor that described Fiorina’s tenure at H.P. as one of the worst in corporate history. Fiorina stayed calm, though, and showed that she possesses political talents that appeared sadly lacking in her previous venture into electoral politics, an abortive 2010 run in California for the U.S. Senate. In particular, she demonstrated the invaluable ability to deliver whoppers with apparent sincerity. Dismissing the Yale study as the work of a Clintonite, she described her troubled time at H.P., which ended when the company’s board fired her, as a period of revenue growth, innovation, and desperate measures taken in desperate times. She even managed to slip in the fact that, on the day she was fired, Steve Jobs called her to commiserate. All Trump could manage was “I only say this. She can’t run any of my companies.”","903","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"After that, Trump seemed a bit deflated. (Admittedly, it could have been the heat.) And Fiorina, evidently seeking to portray herself as just as hawkish as any of the men surrounding her, laid it on a bit thick during a discussion of ISIS, saying that she would make sure that the U.S. military had fifty Army brigades, thirty-six Marine battalions, more than three hundred naval ships, and enough nuclear weapons to blow up the entire solar system. (I made up the last bit, but you get the idea: Jeane Kirkpatrick meets Dr. Strangelove.) By that stage, though, it probably didn’t matter. The television audience had dwindled, and the online pundits were already declaring Fiorina the winner—which, until the post-debate polls arrive, means she was the winner.","904","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"For many of the other candidates, it was a mixed night. Jeb Bush was more forceful than in the previous G.O.P. debate, but the most memorable things he said were that he smoked pot in college, would choose Margaret Thatcher if he had to select a woman to appear on the ten-dollar bill, and would make his Secret Service name Eveready, because, as he explained to Trump, who has accused him of listlessness, “It’s very high energy.” (This comment came in garbage time, and it earned him an ironic low five from the front-runner.) Ben Carson, who is the closest candidate in the polls to Trump, once again disappeared for long stretches, but in a debate that most voters, even Republican voters, will only watch via soundbites, this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing for him. He had a couple of strong moments, such as when he revealed that he had advised George W. Bush not to invade Iraq (earning him a high five from Trump, who also opposed the war), and when he affirmed, twice, that there is no evidence that vaccinations cause autism. (Carson even had the temerity, in front of a Republican audience, to suggest that there are moments when it makes more sense to rely on intellect than military force.)","905","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Marco Rubio, once again, had some good moments, although probably not enough to dislodge him from the position of everybody’s second-favorite candidate. John Kasich, to his credit and, almost certainly, his own detriment, followed a rote assertion that the Iranian nuclear deal was a “bad agreement” with an attempt to defend the virtues of a multilateral approach to foreign policy. Chris Christie, the forgotten man of Trenton, sought to position himself as the adult in the room, admonishing Trump and Fiorina to stop quibbling about their business records and concentrate on the concerns of construction workers who don’t give a fig about their careers. (It must be noted, however, that Christie’s efforts to look serious weren’t helped when he said that his Secret Service security name would be True Heart. Evidently, he was unaware that True Heart is one of the Care Bears.)","906","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Those were sidebars, though. The big story was Fiorina’s attempted takedown of Trump. “I think she’s a very nice person,” Trump said in an interview after the debate.

But it would be a mistake to conclude that Ryan is “running,” or ever truly “ran,” for Speaker. He said often enough and feelingly enough that he didn’t want the job. What he did do, eventually, was to express a tentative, reluctant willingness to be Speaker: he allowed that, if certain conditions were met, he would condescend to accept. He didn’t run for Speaker; he invited the Speakership to run for him. It did, and now he must be wondering if it will run him over.

"The story, by Jennifer Steinhauer, reported that “far-right media figures,” with encouragement from Tea Party extremists in the House, were on a “furious Internet expedition” to cover Ryan in “political silt” on account of his history of being “traitorous to conservatism.” To be sure, Ryan is on board with outlawing gay weddings and nearly all abortions, privatizing Social Security, voucherizing Medicare, abolishing Medicaid and replacing it with ever-diminishing block grants to the states, and ignoring global warming. His famously wonky budget proposals would shrink food stamps and college aid while cutting rich people’s taxes, in many cases by half. He requires his interns to read “Atlas Shrugged.” His treason consists solely of what Steinhauer calls “flashes of pragmatism,” such as questioning the wisdom of shutting down the government and/or forcing the Treasury to default on its obligations.","912","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"After his announcement of availability, Ryan found himself facing an unappetizing choice. He could compromise (i.e., surrender) on some of his demands, such as his unrealistic insistence on getting the formal endorsement of every single House Republican faction—thus suggesting that he buckles under pressure. Or he could stick to his guns (as is his right under the Second Amendment), withdraw, and be blamed for consigning his party to endless chaos, failing to step up in the hour of Republican need, etc. He chose the former.","913","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"

"Let’s go to the Constitution. “The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker,” Article I, Section 2 says—without adding “from among its Members” or something to that effect. This was almost certainly a drafting error, an inadvertent omission. But its undisputed effect is to leave the House free to “chuse” anyone it chooses.","915","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"

But Watts has a fatal taint: he has held public office. In the government. The federal government.","916","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"

"Donald Trump fulfills the constitutional requirements for the Speakership, because there are none. Also, Speakers speak, and Trump is very good at speaking, as he has regularly proved on television, not only as a budding politician but also as a “reality” star—and reality, with or without scare quotes, is something of which the Republican Party is sorely in need.","918","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Another thing Speakers are supposed to do—according to good-government types, bipartisanship junkies, and even the unknown but not insubstantial number of Republicans who suspect that it may be politically advantageous to at least show an interest in “governing” and “getting things done”—is make deals, as long as said deals are struck by a “tough negotiator.” Sound like someone you know? Someone like, maybe, the best-selling author of “The Art of the Deal”?

"A Trump Speakership would be a win-win for all concerned. For the rest of the Republican Presidential field, “establishment” (Bush, Rubio, Kasich, etc.) and “insurgent” (Cruz, Huckabee, etc.) alike, it would eliminate a dangerously unpredictable, ideologically inscrutable, incomprehensibly popular rival who makes the others look like flop-sweat-covered, low-energy professional politicians hopelessly in hock to rich contributors and corporations. (The Ben Carson problem would persist for a while, of course, but, sooner or later, the doctor’s profound weirdness, among other problems, may be relied upon to dispose of that one.)","920","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"As for Ryan, the deal would spare him the doom that very likely will be his fate if he becomes Speaker. Nothing about the terms under which he has agreed to accept the post changes the fact that, absurd as the notion may be, he is still “too far left.” For a small but procedurally decisive segment of his Republican colleagues in the House, governmental dysfunction, gridlock, paralysis, and chaos are features, not bugs. These features of the status quo are not about to go away. Ryan’s political business plan called for him to spend the next four years as the respected (among conservatives) chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, followed by eight triumphant years in the White House, followed by a comfortable retirement at the Ryan Presidential Library and Foundation. The prospect for him now is a short, harrowing, career-ending interval of misery on Capitol Hill followed by a lucrative but soul-killing job as a K Street lobbyist.","921","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"For Trump himself, the deal is just as good. Let’s start with an assumption: notwithstanding the current hysteria, Trump is not going to be the Republican nominee. He can go down in the annals of politics and entertainment as a curiosity, a footnote: the flamboyant mogul who ran for President on a lark, threw a scare into the regulars for a while, got bored and/or boring, and went back to his perch at Trump Tower and the tabloids. Or he can be the first and only non-member of the House of Representatives to be its Speaker in the two hundred and twenty-six years since its founding. He probably wouldn’t last long in the job, and he probably wouldn’t want to, and, anyway, he wouldn’t have to. No matter what, he will have become a truly historic figure, and he can spend the rest of his life preening as such.","922","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Not only that: Speaker Trump could continue to nurse his White House fantasies. It’s true that, for a conventional politician, the Speakership has always been a too-slippery steppingstone to the Presidency. Being a governor, a senator, or a victorious general has always been a better route. Ex-Speakers Henry Clay and James G. Blaine managed to make it as far as winning their respective parties’ nominations, but they got creamed in November. Of the sixty-one Speakers so far, only one has ever actually become President: James K. Polk—and he had quit the House six years earlier to take the governorship of Tennessee. But, for a conventional Republican politician like Ryan, given the nihilistic ungovernability of today’s G.O.P. caucus, the Speakership is a gravestone. Hence the man’s reluctance.","923","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Trump, however, is not a conventional politician. A few months as Speaker would be just the dollop of “government experience” he needs to fill out his résumé for next time.

"In November, 1954, Dwight D. Eisenhower was mulling a matter that he mulled with some frequency: the effects of age on someone in a stressful, non-stop job like his. He’d been President for nearly two years and, in his diary, wrote down some of the reasons why seeking a second term might be a bad idea: “The greater likelihood that a man of 70 will break down under a load than a man of 50,” a need for “younger men in positions of the highest responsibility so as to symbolize the youth, vigor and virility of the Republican Party,” and, perhaps above all, the “growing severity and complexity of problems that rest upon the President for solution.” As far as he knew, he was in good shape, but intimations of mortality shadowed him, and he thought a lot about the next political generation. At a White House political dinner a few days before Christmas, he said, “We have got to begin right now, at the state level and at the precinct level, to see to it that the Party puts up the right kind of young man to run in ’56. All the programs in the world, and all the Eisenhower prestige, cannot elect some revolting old Republican hack against a youthful, able, and personable Democrat.”","September 23, 2015","925","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"Modern readers will note a certain gender bias in phrases like “a man of 70,” “the right kind of young man,” and “virility,” and should know that these somewhat depressed observations came soon after the midterms, in which Democrats took control of the Senate and House, by majorities that the party would keep for decades. Eisenhower’s worries became far more intense several months later, in late September, 1955, when he suffered a major heart attack.","926","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"This is a roundabout way of getting to the sensitive, impolite subject of when, if ever, a candidate might be too old for the Presidency. It is a question whose premise, in an era when the word “ageism” is embedded in the language, many are inclined to reject, in part because the motives for asking it tend to be suspect. The thuggish wing of the talk-radio community uses the age question to undermine Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, who will be sixty-eight in October. That makes her more than a year younger than Donald Trump, although age is the least of many concerns about him. Age should certainly count a lot less than the goofy ideas and inexperience demonstrated by too many Republicans. But the curious absence of a new political generation should concern Democrats, and a party whose other poll-leading 2016 candidates, declared and not, are Bernie Sanders, who is seventy-four, and Joe Biden, who will be seventy-three in November. (Barely registering in the polls are Jim Webb, who is sixty-nine, and Martin O’Malley, a relative teen at fifty-two.) Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Mike Huckabee are in their early sixties, but, for better or worse, Republicans also have half a dozen contenders in their forties and fifties. The distinct problem for the Democrats isn’t the presence of elders; it’s the absence of young women and men with the potential to be credible national candidates.","927","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"Apart from Ronald Reagan, who at sixty-nine was the oldest President ever to be elected, Americans have tended to choose younger men for the office. Franklin D. Roosevelt was fifty when he won his first term; John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama were in their forties. Even Eisenhower, grandfatherly affect and all, was only sixty-two when he won the White House for the first time.","928","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"In the early winter of 1956, as the next Presidential cycle began and Eisenhower recovered from his heart attack, he wrote to his childhood friend Edward E. (Swede) Hazlett to say, “We all know that when advancing years and diminishing energy begin to take their toll, the last one that ever appreciates such a situation is the victim himself.” In another letter, to a doctor who’d recently examined him and thought that he was healthy enough to run again, Ike expressed still more doubts. In “contemplating my own future duty,” he compared his job to that of a quarterback: “He may have all of the wisdom to be derived from years of experience in the game. But when the need arises, he has to throw himself unreservedly into the play…. If we merely needed a brain on the field, a quarterback could play if he had to be in a wheelchair; but that isn’t true in his case, nor is it in the Presidency.”","929","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"At the end of February, 1956, a month after sending that letter, Eisenhower announced that he would indeed seek a second term, though he planned to let Vice-President Richard Nixon do most of the campaigning. Ike went on to win reëlection in a landslide. But his health was shakier than his doctors were willing to say, and he suffered two more serious medical alarms—ileitis, an intestinal condition, in the summer of 1956, and a minor stroke, in the fall of 1957. In October, 1960, he marked his seventieth birthday, which, until the Reagan era, made him the oldest President ever to serve.","930","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"The country fifty-five years ago was lucky that it all turned out as it did. It was also another reminder, just ten years after Roosevelt’s death, that choosing a Vice-President is a serious matter. During the 1956 campaign, the Democratic candidate, Adlai Stevenson, made an issue of Eisenhower’s health—and the possibility that Nixon, deeply hated by Democrats, might become President. Democrats, without a successor generation in clear view, may get lucky in 2016, especially facing a Republican field whose contenders include people who say, inexplicably, as they did in last week’s debate, that George W. Bush left the country safer (Jeb Bush), or that vaccines may cause autism (Trump), or that it’s worth shutting down the government to defund Planned Parenthood (Ted Cruz, Chris Christie). Sixty years ago, Eisenhower was willing to consider the nation’s welfare ahead of personal ambition. That was an impulse rarely glimpsed in last week’s Republican debate.","931","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"With about fifteen minutes to go in the G.O.P. Presidential debate last night, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, it looked as if it might be hard to pick a low point. The candidates had, after all, been squabbling for almost three hours, long enough to foster fantasies of using Reagan’s Air Force One, which was onstage, as an emergency-escape vehicle. Then Jake Tapper, the moderator, asked Ben Carson about vaccines—or, more specifically, what he, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, thought of Donald Trump’s statements linking childhood vaccines to autism, “which, as you know, the medical community adamantly disputes.” Perhaps Tapper thought that he was setting up a confrontation between rationality and Trumpism, a moment when the doctor would calmly dismantle the Donald. If so, he was disappointed. Carson, after allowing that studies “have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism,” and that some inoculations saved lives, added that “a multitude” of them probably weren’t important—“and there should be some discretion in those cases. But, you know, a lot of this is—is—is pushed by big government.”","September 17, 2015","932","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"“Should he stop saying that vaccines cause autism?” Tapper asked.","933","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Trump, Carson replied, was “an intelligent man and will make the correct decision after getting the real facts.”","934","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Trump proceeded to demonstrate his decision-making qualities with a digressive rant about how he knew “a beautiful child” who “went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.” He’d had his own regimen for his children, he said, spreading things out; if people followed his advice, “I think you’re going to see a big impact on autism.”","935","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"You’re not: the science is very clear that vaccines do not cause autism, and that all the deniers have accomplished is to provoke outbreaks of diseases, like measles, that were once almost forgotten in America. (My colleague Michael Specter has written about this extensively.) A lot of what Trump says—diplomacy by yelling, for example—would be dangerous if put into practice. But most of it, assuming he doesn’t actually get elected, won’t be put into practice. The refusal to inoculate children, though, is something that his admirers can try at home. No other candidate was willing to anger the ideologues by standing up for something as suspicious as science. Given a final chance by Tapper, Carson smiled and said that Trump was “an O.K. doctor”—a reference to Trump’s dismissal of Carson’s surgical skills. Rand Paul, who is also a doctor, added that though he was for vaccines, “I’m also for freedom”—namely the freedom to reschedule shots, “even if science doesn’t say” that there’s a problem.","936","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"The exchange was of a piece with the rest of the debate and with the state of the Republican Party: fervid, claustrophobic, recklessly insinuating, and, at the same time, utterly timid when it comes to extremism in its own ranks. The discussion about vaccines was immediately preceded by one about climate change: Tapper—citing George Shultz, Reagan’s Secretary of State, who said that his boss had urged industry leaders to come up with a plan to move away from chemicals destroying the ozone layer “as an insurance policy in case the scientists are right”—asked Marco Rubio why we shouldn’t now do the same, just in case there was something to the overwhelming evidence of climate change, rising sea levels, and retreating glaciers all around us.","937","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"“Because we’re not going to destroy our economy the way the left-wing government that we are under now wants to do,” Rubio said. “Single parents already struggling,” he added, couldn’t afford to do things that, in his view, wouldn’t affect the climate. And anyway, “America is not a planet.”","938","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Tapper turned to Chris Christie, apparently on the theory that he had previously been more willing than other Republicans to recognize the reality of climate change. He didn’t have much better luck than he did with Carson. “I agree with Marco. We shouldn’t be destroying our economy in order to chase some wild left-wing idea that somehow us by ourselves is going to fix the climate,” Christie said. Not that he was interested in working with others: he bragged that, while making the air cleaner in New Jersey, he’d pulled the state out of regional cap-and-trade agreements. America may not be a planet, but New Jersey is. Scott Walker then jumped in to say that he wouldn’t listen to the E.P.A. Tapper managed to move on, despite Paul’s clamoring to be heard “if you want a skeptic” about climate change. No one tried to break in on behalf of the planet—the one that America is on.","939","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"The flaw in the debate, evident in both of these exchanges, may have been a structural one. In the interests of mixing it up, CNN’s moderators—Tapper was joined by Dana Bash, the network’s political correspondent, and Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio host—repeatedly quoted criticisms that one candidate had made of the others. The most blunt example may have been when Carly Fiorina was asked what she thought of Trump’s comments, to Rolling Stone, about the unelectability of her face. In lieu of an apology last night, Trump said, “she’s a beautiful woman.” (He also said that he’d heard that Jeb Bush’s wife was “lovely.”) Fiorina declined to simper; throughout, she played her designated role of Trump teller-offer, mixing in references to “my good friend Bibi Netanyahu” and lurid (and inaccurate) descriptions of secretly taped videos of Planned Parenthood employees. Later, she and Trump sniped about their respective business records, prompting Christie, of all people, to tell them to “stop playing” and being so “childish.” “And Carly—Carly, listen,” he said. “You can interrupt everybody else on this stage, you’re not going to interrupt me, O.K.?” He sounded like a first grader striking a pose for the kindergartners.","940","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"But rather than really pushing the candidates on their positions, CNN’s did-you-hear-what-he-called-you approach served to keep the debate within the tinny echo chamber of the G.O.P. For example, Bash asked Jeb Bush, “After Chief Justice John Roberts voted to uphold Obamacare twice, Senator Cruz criticized your brother for appointing John Roberts to the Supreme Court. Looking back on it, did your brother make a mistake?” What followed was a somewhat bizarre exchange in which Bush offered a tepid defense of Roberts while saying that Cruz had supported him, too. Cruz replied by comparing Roberts—who, Obamacare aside, has led the court to achingly conservative decisions in Citizens United and Hobby Lobby, has helped to roll back voting rights, and has written bitter dissents on marriage equality—to the far more liberal David Souter. Mike Huckabee, who had earlier said that Kim Davis, the county clerk in Kentucky who is violating the Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision by refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, had been afforded less respect for her religious beliefs than “the detainees at Gitmo,” jumped in to expostulate about litmus tests. Only in the Republican primaries would any of this make sense.","941","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"The Roberts exchange was one of several in which Jeb Bush couldn’t shake a certain air of petulance. “That’s—that’s my brother,” he said at one point, wiggling his arms a little. He had been trying to finish an evocative line about George W. Bush embracing a firefighter in the rubble of Ground Zero, but, since he’d been interrupted with interjections from, in sequence, Trump, Paul, and Walker, it was hard to figure out just what he was saying, or even parse it grammatically. He certainly didn’t command the foreign-policy discussion, amid a general clamor about renouncing the Iran agreement and Trump dismissing the need to learn “name after name, Arab name, Arab name.” Both Rubio and Carson had stronger moments in explaining why they might, if only occasionally, think before bombing, but both still came across as flagrantly hawkish. Paul, meanwhile, communicated the anti-interventionism that has set him apart. (His most effective moment, though, came when he talked about decriminalizing drug offenses, prompting Bush to talk about smoking marijuana as a teen-ager and Fiorina to speak, movingly, about her step-daughter who lost her life to addiction.) Bush said that he had chosen the same foreign-policy advisers that his brother and father had because, if you wanted a Republican, those were the only people available, “just by definition.” Near the end of the debate, Tapper asked each candidate to pick his or her Secret Service code name. (Paul: “Justice Never Sleeps”; Cruz: “Cohiba”; Walker: “Harley. I love riding Harley’s.”) Bush went with “Eveready—it’s very high energy, Donald.” Suddenly, it became hard to shake the image of Jeb as a giant Energizer Bunny. It also made him sound like a sulker, fixated on Trump’s description of him as “low-energy.” Trump, for his part, offered Eveready a hand-slap and then proposed his own name: “Humble.”","942","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Tapper had another “light question”: What woman should, in accordance with a Treasury Department plan, replace Alexander Hamilton on the ten-dollar bill? Fiorina wouldn’t give a name, saying that she wasn’t in favor of that kind of “gesture.” Others nominated four American historical figures: Clara Barton, Susan B. Anthony, Rosa Parks, and Abigail Adams. The rest of the answers were divided between family members (Huckabee’s wife, Carson’s mother) and foreigners (Bush: Margaret Thatcher; Kasich: Mother Teresa). Really, Miss Oklahoma did a better job with this one than the Presidential contenders. (The correct answer, by the way, is to keep Hamilton on the ten, and put Harriet Tubman on the twenty.)","943","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Trump went with both Parks and his daughter Ivanka—“because she’s been sitting for three hours.” Do we all get a bill, then? The debate was crowded, bloated, sour, and long. Far from adding order to the race, it is likely to have made it even more unpredictable. As was the case last time, each candidate probably did enough to satisfy his or her narrow faction, or at least to convince a couple of big donors to keep paying. Some (Carson, Fiorina, Rubio) likely did more than that. The question is who will lose the support they gain. Trump’s core supporters may not mind his performance, even though, at times, he seemed to be insulting people just to stay awake, like a truck driver lighting another cigarette. He was missing what he would call his usual “braggadocious” verve. It’s going to be a strange and pot-holed road on the way to 2016. But all we watched, on Wednesday night, were a bunch of bumper cars colliding in front of an old Air Force One.","944","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"On Friday, October 2nd, Jeb Bush was onstage at a college auditorium in Greenville, South Carolina, for a public interview with Alan Wilson, the state’s attorney general and a prominent figure in the right-wing firmament. Bush is sixty-two, but, thanks to a low-carb Paleo diet, he looks younger than he did when he left the Florida governor’s office eight years ago for a life in the business world. A trim physique, however, hasn’t boosted his appeal to potential voters. A new national poll showed that Bush’s support had sunk to four per cent; South Carolina, which has one of the most conservative Republican electorates in the country, and will hold its primary early next year, just after Iowa and New Hampshire, is crucial to winning the nomination. Once considered the front-runner, Bush is trailing a clutch of candidates, among them Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who have never held public office and encourage comparison to buffoons.","945","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Jeb has presented himself as the most electable Republican candidate: willing to break with Republican orthodoxy on domestic issues such as immigration and education, and committed to breaking, if vaguely, with his brother’s legacy on foreign policy and to being, as he has said, his “own man.” Before Bush officially entered the 2016 campaign, he remarked to a group of C.E.O.s at a conference in Washington, D.C., that a successful candidate had to be willing to “lose the primary to win the general,” and should campaign “without violating your principles.” He meant that one must avoid the perennial trap of party primaries, in which “base voters,” the hard-core conservatives, force politicians to take extreme positions that will prove unpopular in a general election and, when later disavowed, expose the candidate as a phony. “It’s not an easy task, to be honest with you,” he noted. (Hillary Clinton faces a similar problem in her race for the Democratic nomination.)","946","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But in his conversation with Wilson, and in a subsequent interview with me and other reporters, Bush veered toward the right. On domestic affairs, his view was neatly summarized by his answer to a question about gun control. It was the day after the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, and yet Bush rejected any calls for new legislation. He noted that he had confronted similar pressure for government action after tragedies while he was governor: “Look, stuff happens. There’s always a crisis, and the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.”","947","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush was pilloried by Democrats for his “stuff happens” remark, but he defended it, telling me that the government doesn’t have a solution to every problem, and that sometimes government action makes matters worse. Some variety of a laissez-faire philosophy is standard for modern Republicans, at least on most domestic issues. But, increasingly in recent months, Bush, like a number of his colleagues, has been making the case for aggressive intervention abroad. Two days earlier, Russia had carried out its first air strikes in Syria. When I asked Bush how he would respond if he were President, he said that it was the lack of American action that had created the dire situation in Iraq and Syria, and invited the Russian military to bolster the Assad regime.","948","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I think we need to stand up to Putin, not just as it relates to Syria,” Bush told me. “This sends a signal all around the world of the United States pulling back, not being serious. Our allies don’t believe that we’re going to have their back. And this emboldens our enemies.” Bush offered no details on how to “stand up to Putin” or what, exactly, he would do to pacify the killing floor of the Middle East and South Asia and reconcile the tangled rivalries and interests there. But his message to the base was clear: We must do something. And we must do it now.","949","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush’s view represents a return to a simplistic interventionism that seemed discredited in the wake of the Iraq debacle. For decades, the G.O.P. has been split into two camps. The realists, who dominated the Presidency of Bush’s father, George H. W. Bush, emphasized diplomacy and coalitions over go-it-alone displays of force, and a skepticism about America’s ability to shape the internal dynamics of foreign countries. They also expressed a willingness to tolerate tyrannical regimes that advance U.S. interests or create greater stability in volatile regions of the world. The other camp—variously described as idealists, hawks, and neoconservatives—dominated the Presidency of Bush’s brother. They have more often called for the overthrow rather than the containment of hostile regimes, and they remain committed to exporting American-style democracy to places where it has never flourished.","950","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"The hyper-interventionist foreign policy of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney was widely blamed for the Republican Party’s loss of Congress in 2006 and of the Presidency in 2008. But many hawks, once more in full voice, now believe that the Obama years—the emergence of ISIS, the crisis in Syria and Iraq, Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, the rise of Putin at a time of Russian isolation and economic weakness—have vindicated Bush. “Any Presidential candidate, the first thing he or she needs to do is put up a map of the Middle East in 2009 and one today,” John McCain, a leading hawk in the Senate, told me, as we discussed foreign policy in his office. “And point out that it is this President’s failures.

"Obama thinks that intractable foreign-policy crises should be guided by the physician’s maxim of “first, do no harm”—or, as his aides have said privately, “Don’t do stupid shit.” To Republican hawks, this sounds like a willful and dangerous abdication of American power and influence. Lindsey Graham, who is one of the long-shot Presidential candidates and McCain’s closest ally in the Senate, has called for ten thousand American troops to be sent back to Iraq. Last week, Chris Christie said that he would set up a no-fly zone in the Syrian airspace in which the Russians are now operating, and shoot down any planes that entered it.","952","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But of all the Republican candidates vying to reform the world of foreign affairs only one belongs to a family of Presidents that, for better or worse, did so much to give that world its present shape. When Jeb Bush began his campaign, he enlisted as advisers some of the realists from his father’s camp, including the former Secretary of State James Baker. But the heaviest contingent consisted of his brother’s liege men: Paul Wolfowitz, the Defense Department official who made the ideological case for invading Iraq; John Hannah, who had been an adviser to Dick Cheney and pushed bad intelligence into Colin Powell’s famous speech at the U.N. making the case for war; Porter Goss, the former C.I.A. director who condoned waterboarding as an interrogation technique; and Stephen Hadley, the former national-security adviser, who took the blame for false assertions that President Bush made about nuclear yellowcake allegedly sought by Saddam Hussein from Niger.","953","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

(Reich denies that he or the U.S. played any role in the coup.) In May, Jeb Bush, after providing a series of confusing responses on the issue, said that, given what is now known about the condition of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear-, biological-, and chemical-weapons program in 2003, he would not have invaded Iraq. Not all of his advisers share this sentiment.","954","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

It caused all of the people who would’ve otherwise come and attacked us and killed Americans on our soil—it caused them to go to Iraq and die there. That may sound very brutal, or whatever, but we have seen what has happened when you have an Administration like the current one, that did not realize what Bush had done; sent the troops home from Iraq; created a vacuum that was filled by ISIS. And they’re killing Americans and everyone else—they’re mostly killing Muslims. I lay that at the feet of the Obama Administration.”","955","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

"The American public’s appetite for military interventions runs in cycles. After the triumph of the Second World War, policymakers were emboldened to roll back Communism, but the miasma of Vietnam instilled a wariness of major overseas military entanglements that spanned the Carter and Reagan Presidencies. In 1991, the relatively quick and successful Gulf War sparked a new bipartisan consensus that American force could again be deployed wisely if it was undertaken with overwhelming strength and with the benefit of an international coalition. The lack of intervention in Rwanda was widely seen as a moral calamity for which politicians, including Bill Clinton, have apologized.","957","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"That uneasy consensus lasted through the 2001 toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan. But the invasion of Iraq in 2003 came to be seen as such a catastrophic mistake that even its progenitor could not avoid casting blame on his own circle. George W. Bush, during his last two years in office, forced out Donald Rumsfeld and marginalized Dick Cheney. It was too late to save his own popularity. When voters went to the polls in November, 2008, Bush’s job-approval rating dipped to twenty per cent, the lowest of any outgoing President in the history of polling.","958","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

Other politicians of his generation, including Marco Rubio, also forty-four, were strongly influenced by 9/11, but Cruz told me that he draws more lessons from Reagan’s fight against Communism than from Bush’s and Obama’s fight against terrorism. “The foreign-policy events that shaped my world view the most did not occur in the past two Presidencies,” he said. “I believe in peace through strength.

I would describe my views as a third point on the triangle.” He believes that “America should always be a clarion voice of liberty, and that the bully pulpit of the Presidency has enormous power. There is power to speaking the truth on a global stage.” He added, “However, speaking for freedom is not the same thing as using U.S. military force.

Soon after Hezbollah attacked the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, in 1983, killing two hundred and forty-one Americans, Reagan said that a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon would send a “signal to terrorists everywhere: they can gain by waging war against innocent people.” But then he did it anyway, after concluding that the troops’ mission was unclear and that their presence offered too inviting a target to extremists.","964","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

It’s the job of our military to protect the safety and security of three hundred and thirty million Americans.” He said that although “Assad is a monster” who “has used poison gas” and “killed hundreds of thousands of his own citizens,” he worries about what might happen “if the attack succeeds and you topple Assad, and the weapons then fall into the hands of Al Qaeda or Al Nusra or ISIS or any of the other radical Islamic terrorists.” (Donald Trump has said that he’s happy to have Russia in Syria fighting ISIS, though he failed to note that, so far, Russia has been mainly targeting U.S.-trained rebels, not ISIS.)","966","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz added that the military commanders he has consulted insist that “the most potent tool to use against ISIS is overwhelming airpower.” He maintained that arming the Kurds in northern Iraq was a better alternative to sending U.S. troops. “We need boots on the ground, but they don’t necessarily need to be American boots,” he said. “The Kurds are our boots on the ground.”","967","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But Cruz’s prescription may be more like Reagan’s supply-side tax cuts than like Reagan’s foreign policy: it promises enormous benefits with very little sacrifice. Graham, who wants American troops to lead the fight, scoffed at Cruz’s argument. “The Kurds don’t have any offensive capability,” he said, pointing out that Shiites and non-Kurdish Sunnis in Iraq and Syria would be as concerned about Kurdish advances as they are about ISIS. “They’re not gonna go down to Ramadi! Go ask the Kurds, ‘Would you help us liberate Syria?’ And they’d say, ‘Thank you, but no thank you.’ If you want to create a war to end all wars, have a marauding band of Kurds going through the Middle East.”","968","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz has calculated that, despite the rise of ISIS, Republican voters are still hungover from the costly interventions of the Bush years, and that they share his skepticism about the ability of American troops to accomplish much in Iraq and Syria. “There are some politicians in Washington who approach foreign military action as if they’re playing Risk,” he said. “They want to deploy troops and command them in battle.” He added, “A number of politicians treat American boots on the ground as a talisman to demonstrate that they’re really tough.”","969","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Obama, who has said that he was elected to end wars, not start them, has bombed more countries than George W. Bush did. But in fighting terrorism he has chosen to use drones and other forms of airpower, Special Forces, and proxy armies. Obama was skeptical about intervening to stop Muammar Qaddafi’s forces as they marched on a helpless population in Benghazi, Libya. He had to be talked into the operation by, among others, Hillary Clinton, and the result—a failed state in Libya that has created a haven for terrorists—shaped his skepticism about intervening in Syria.","970","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Early on, key Republicans seemed to endorse Obama’s cautious approach. When Marco Rubio ran for the Senate in 2010, he supported Obama’s drawdown of troops in Iraq. As a former city commissioner in West Miami and then a state legislator, Rubio knew the foreign-policy issues that important Florida constituencies care about, such as the Jewish community’s staunchly pro-Israel views and the Cuban-American community’s fierce opposition to Castro. He had little experience with broader foreign-policy questions. In his early months in Congress, he supported attempts at diplomacy with Iran. During the 2013 fight over budget cuts, Rubio advocated for government-spending reform. He has since grown less cautionary, arguing for an increase in military spending and calling it the “most important obligation of the federal government.”","971","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio, who was a leader in the Florida House while Jeb Bush was governor and is now his nearest opponent in the race, though they are both well behind Trump and Carson in most national polls, has recently positioned himself as one of the most hawkish Republicans running for President. McCain noted that Rubio, like others, had shifted into his camp after the emergence of ISIS, and he joked that Rubio has a history of switching positions, which McCain gently mocked by licking his finger and holding it in the air.","972","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Recently, Rubio told me that he no longer believes that Obama’s drawdown was wise. “We are retreating from Afghanistan and Iraq, not anticipating the vacuum that would be left behind and the potential that creates for radicalism,” he said. His shift might seem political, but he suggested that it was the result of becoming immersed in issues, as a senator, to which, as a candidate, he had given little thought. He noted that some of his opponents, including Jeb Bush, have never held federal office. “I’m a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee,” Rubio said. “I spend a significant amount of time working on these issues on a daily basis. So most certainly I’m going to have more insight than someone reading briefings from the staffers.”","973","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio’s foreign policy is a clear response to Obama’s alleged retreat from the world. The President’s biggest mistakes, in this view, were all failures to intervene more aggressively. Rubio has said that he would have forcefully taken the side of demonstrators in Iran during the 2009 Green Revolution. “The President was so intent on negotiating with Iran’s tyrants that he did little to help its people,” he remarked in a speech in Washington in 2011.","974","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But the key issue for many emerging Republican hawks was Obama’s failure to attack Assad when he used chemical weapons. Obama had drawn a “red line,” but then retreated. Instead, he accepted a deal negotiated with Putin to place the weapons under international control. “Everyone heard him,” Reich said. “He said, ‘I didn’t draw the red line, the world drew a red line.’ No, Mr. President, the world didn’t stand before the cameras in the White House and say that it was drawing a red line; you did. . . . It’s very dangerous.”","975","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"George Shultz, who is ninety-four and is also a Bush adviser, was Reagan’s Secretary of State. He said that the red line was one of the biggest mistakes of Obama’s Presidency. “I don’t think the President realizes how much damage was done,” he said. “I remember when I was in marine boot camp, at the start of World War Two, and the sergeant hands me this rifle and says, ‘Take good care of this rifle—this is your best friend. Remember one thing: never point this rifle at anybody unless you’re willing to pull the trigger.’ No empty threats. That’s boot-camp wisdom. With Obama there are empty threats lying all over the place, and they undermine his credibility.”","976","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"This outlook relies on some revisionist history. When Obama asked Congress for authorization to bomb Syria in 2013, several Republicans, Rubio among them, voted against the resolution in the Foreign Relations Committee, and many others announced that they would oppose it on the Senate floor. It never came to a vote. Rubio said that the Administration’s proposed attack was not sufficiently robust; now he cites the failure to use force as the reason for much of the current chaos, including Putin’s recent involvement.","977","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio told me that years ago he warned that the power vacuums in the Middle East were being filled by Islamic extremists, and he noted ISIS’s growing role in Afghanistan, where it had previously had little presence. “If they continue unabated a year from now, we could live in a world where ISIS is now operating in vacated spaces in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya,” he said. Rubio is a favorite of G.O.P. hawks. Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas billionaire who spent some $100 million in the 2012 election and is wooed by almost every Republican candidate, is reportedly also a fan. But Rubio sounds more cautious when asked for details about how to defeat ISIS.","978","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“Intervening doesn’t mean ground troops,” he said. “Intervening can be a lot of things.” He went on, “A full-scale invasion, sending a hundred thousand troops to Iraq right now, is probably not the best way to defeat ISIS. Because it very well may be what they hope will happen, because it will allow them to point to radicals around the world and attract more recruits and more funding. I think that the better approach is to empower Sunni tribes to defeat them. And they need a lot of help from us, including air strikes and special-op forces.”","979","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"What Rubio laid out wasn’t very different from Obama’s current plan. When pressed, he conceded that many more American troops might be necessary. “There’s no magic number,” he said. “I don’t know if nine thousand is worse than eleven thousand. What matters is: first you have to establish a mission—what are you trying to achieve? Then you have to allow the military to come up with operations and how to achieve that mission. And that will determine the number in the mission, not the other way around.”","980","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio, Graham, and many other Republicans believe that the nation’s foreign policy suffers from timidity, not from overexertion. The problem is in the execution, not the intervention itself. “Here’s what I’ve learned,” Graham told me. “If you don’t have a plan after you take Afghanistan down, after you take Iraq down, after you take Libya down, after you take Syria down, you’re going to regret it.”","981","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Given the failed states and the civil wars gripping Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, I asked Graham for an example of a successful intervention that would bolster his case for a more hawkish foreign policy. We were sitting outside, in Manchester, New Hampshire, and he was eating nachos. He looked at me excitedly, racing to swallow so that he could get to his answer: “How about Germany and Japan?”","982","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Even as Bush watches his opponents solidify their foreign-policy positions, he has struggled to come to terms with his brother’s ideology. His opponents criticize him for being vague or unengaged. Graham told me, “I think he’s a work-in-progress. I think he’s been out of the game for ten years. . . . He’s gotta convince people that three Bushes are not one too many.”","983","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Jeb Bush’s troubles began almost as soon as he declared his candidacy and included the eighty-five-year-old James Baker on his list. As Communism began to collapse, in 1989, Bush and Baker helped engineer a soft landing for the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the gradual reorientation of Europe’s Eastern Bloc countries toward the West. Hawks pilloried them for not asserting themselves strongly enough. When Bush went to Kiev, Ukraine, for instance, and warned Ukrainians not to secede from the Soviet Union, the address was mocked as the “chicken Kiev” speech. In 1991, after assembling a United Nations-backed coalition to push Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, Bush and Baker ignored the pleas of American neoconservatives who wanted U.S. forces to march on Baghdad and overthrow Saddam following the uprisings against his rule. They were again demonized. Wolfowitz said that it was as if America were “idly watching a mugging.” In 2006, Baker co-chaired the Iraq Study Group, which recommended a dramatic change in Bush’s policy in the Middle East, including the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Iraq and diplomatic engagement with Iran and Syria, policies that Bush rejected.","984","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"When Baker appeared on Jeb Bush’s list, neoconservatives expressed alarm. His foreign-policy views—diplomacy, stability, and serious doubts about interventions requiring large numbers of U.S. troops—are closer to Obama’s than to George W. Bush’s. Jeb Bush faced a revolt from donors and excoriation in neoconservative publications. A few weeks after Jeb’s announcement, Baker was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at a Washington gala dinner for J Street, the liberal-leaning pro-Israel group founded in 2008 to act as a counterweight to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Commentary published an article about “Jeb Bush’s James Baker Problem” and warned that Jeb may be Baker’s “kindred spirit.” Mark Levin, an influential talk-radio host, wrote that “Jeb Bush turns to Israel-hater, Jim Baker, for foreign policy advice.” Adelson reportedly sent word to Bush that he should pressure Baker to cancel the speech. Bush declined, and Adelson’s allies leaked that Adelson wouldn’t support Bush.","985","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"At the J Street dinner, Baker criticized Benjamin Netanyahu for “diplomatic missteps and political gamesmanship,” and spoke about his own role in the first Bush Administration’s withholding of loan guarantees to Israel in order to pressure the government to halt settlement construction. William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, called Baker “anti-Israel,” and tweeted, “Thankfully, James Baker doesn’t speak for today’s Republican Party.” Morton Klein, the president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America, told Bloomberg that Bush’s association with Baker would cost the candidate: “There are many mega-donors who will not be with him because of that.”","986","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In May, Bush appeared in New York, at the Metropolitan Club, before an audience of financiers organized by Paul Singer, a hedge-fund manager and the kind of Republican mega-donor Klein had warned about. Someone asked Bush to explain Baker’s influence on his policymaking. According to the Washington Post, Jeb “said that he respected Baker, but maintained that he is not part of his foreign-policy team.” CNN, which cited four sources and the notes of someone present, quotes Bush as saying, “What you need to know is that who I listen to when I need advice on the Middle East is George W. Bush.” The Bush campaign later insisted that Jeb was speaking narrowly about Israeli policy. Either way, the message was clear: the hawks were back in control of Republican foreign policy.","987","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Lately, in his effort to be his “own man,” Bush has displayed a willingness to move even further to the right than his brother. At the October 2nd interview in South Carolina, Wilson asked him about the U.S. prison at Guantánamo Bay. During George W. Bush’s tenure, the prison became such a source of shame for America that even Bush, who was loath to acknowledge mistakes or to bow to international pressure, said in 2007, “It should be a goal of the nation to shut down Guantánamo.” Jeb disagrees. Wilson asked if Guantánamo prisoners should be moved to maximum-security facilities in the U.S. “No,” Jeb said. “There is no option for these folks. They should stay where they are. Even if it’s—it’s expensive. It’s the nicest prison you’ll ever want to be in, by the way. And the rights of these terrorists are way beyond what a lot of people get in a lot of different circumstances. They’re not being mistreated at all. But there is no other option.”","988","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"If the economy improves, and Democrats continue to maintain an advantage on domestic issues, the Republican candidates will increasingly highlight foreign policy, an area of perceived vulnerability for Obama and Clinton. McCain, who lost to Obama in 2008, said, perhaps hopefully, “National security, foreign policy, and terrorism will play a greater role in the decision-making of the American people than at any time since 1980.” He insisted that although Bush’s record on foreign policy contributed to his own defeat, “it has gone from a significant negative” at the start of the Obama Administration “to what has become more and more of a positive.”","989","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In August, Bush travelled to Simi Valley, California, to give a speech on foreign policy at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Bush called Reagan “a leader of clarity and resolve, not given to idle words,” someone “who took command of events, rebuilt America’s strength, and moved the world toward peace.” But when he shifted from Reagan’s Cold War successes to more recent events his speech sounded more like a tribute to the Administration of George W. Bush.","990","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“No leader or policymaker involved will claim to have gotten everything right in the region, Iraq especially,” he said. But he argued that, whatever mistakes were made, it was the surge of troops in 2007 that “turned events toward victory.” The surge “was a success—brilliant, heroic, and costly.” It was Obama who lost Iraq, not his brother. The “premature withdrawal was the fatal error,” Jeb said, referring to Obama’s gradual drawdown, “creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill—and that Iran has exploited to the full as well.”","991","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He then turned this logic against the Democrats’ most likely nominee. “ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat,” he said. “And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the President himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away. In all her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly one time.”","992","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Clinton herself has tried to create some distance from Obama’s record. Since leaving the Administration, she has repeatedly said that as Secretary of State she urged Obama to do more in the early days of the Syrian uprising against Assad, when moderates could still be found in that country and American intervention could, arguably, have made a difference. Obama has dismissed that view as “a fantasy.” But, whatever Clinton actually believes about the correct course in the Middle East, she has already shown that she will adopt the campaign position that best suits her politically. In early October, facing a challenge from the left from Bernie Sanders, she reversed her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that she championed as Secretary of State.","993","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"It’s easy to attack Obama as feckless in the face of the chaos in Libya, Syria, and Iraq. Less apparent is how to translate vague campaign promises to do something into a plan that won’t put more American lives at risk. After Jeb Bush spoke with Wilson in South Carolina, he met with reporters backstage. His aides were scrambling to contain any fallout from the “stuff happens” remark, which had immediately elicited a response from President Obama, and echoed one of the most notorious statements of the Bush Administration: Rumsfeld’s declaration during the chaos in Iraq that “stuff happens.” After defending his remark, Jeb Bush then took some questions about Syria, Iraq, and Putin.","994","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He has called for a no-fly zone over Syria that would help a Sunni-led army fight a two-front war against Assad and ISIS, but it’s unclear who would make up the forces. He told reporters that American airpower in Syria is “restricted by lawyers kind of imposing all sorts of conditions.” He would change the rules, he said, so “that it would be there to fight to win.” He didn’t specify which rules he would lift, but, as Graham noted, almost every military expert dismisses the idea that airpower alone can defeat ISIS. “The only way you destroy a big ground opponent is with another big ground opponent,” Graham told me. “You’re not going to bomb ISIL into submission. You gotta go tear the caliphate up by the roots. That means going into Syria on the ground.”","995","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"To fight ISIS in Iraq, Bush made the familiar argument that America should arm the Kurds and “embed with the Iraqi military,” both of which Obama is effectively doing. When asked whether he would send more troops, Bush said that the U.S. already has thirty-five hundred troops in Iraq and that the real issue was how to better integrate them into Iraqi forces. Pressed further, he conceded, in a roundabout way, that he would be willing to send more American troops back to Iraq.","996","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I would listen to the military commanders and I would create a strategy,” he said, a phrase that politicians revert to whenever they want to avoid details. “If it required more supportive troops, fine.” The statement was a reminder of Bush’s continuing dilemma: can he get the nomination without violating his principles? In the months since the start of his campaign, he has only clouded the matter of what, precisely, he stands for.","997","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"At one point, someone asked Bush a churlish question about his father’s 1991 statement regarding the possibility of “a new world order” after the Cold War ended. Bush used it as an opportunity to talk about Obama’s alleged retreat from the world.","998","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I don’t even know what that means anymore,” he said. “In 1992, it meant the end of Communism, and that the United States needed to play a constructive role in forging peace and security, and we still have that role to play. We have threats that are created by our absence. Just look at what’s going on in Syria as an example of that, where we have no strategy, where Putin, agile as he is, ends up injecting himself into something that makes it harder for me to imagine that this brutal Assad regime will depart.” He thought for a moment and added, “American leadership matters.” ♦","999","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

"A teaser for the new “Daily Show”—“The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” which made its début last night—ran immediately before the broadcast began. It featured, over a shot of Noah opening his eyes and looking up at the camera almost sleepily, a snippet of Kanye West’s “Power”: “No one man should have all that power.” That song, one of the sly anthems at the beginning of “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” feels like something you’d play when a new leader takes the stage. But the single line they used felt like a subliminal message, or an overt one. “Daily Show” fans love and need what Jon Stewart made “The Daily Show”; since he announced his departure and Noah was chosen to succeed him, we’ve lived in a state of game apprehension, at best.","September 29, 2015","1018","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"At first, it was because American audiences barely knew Noah: we knew that he was young (thirty-one), handsome, biracial, hugely popular in South Africa. His three appearances on “The Daily Show” were awkward, but so are many guest appearances on “The Daily Show.” Then, after several of his dumb, awful, not-that-old tweets were discovered and publicized, our game apprehension turned to something like hopeful dread. It was hard to imagine someone who made lame jokes about Jews and “fat chicks” becoming what Stewart had been. Stewart, who loved to be silly and vulgar as much as anybody, was also deeply respectful, humble, kind—he mocked the powerful and the malevolent and instinctively defended everybody else. But had we made too big a deal about Stewart? Probably. You could sense that Stewart had perhaps had enough of our worship. No one man should have all that power.","1019","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"“This is ‘The Daily Show with Trevor Noah’!” an announcer’s voice said. Then came the familiar fanfare and intro with new, slicker-looking graphics, which now include, as Neil DeGrasse Tyson pointed out, “the Earth rotating in the correct direction.” Trevor Noah looked happy—so far, so good. “Welcome to ‘The Daily Show’! Welcome to ‘The Daily Show’!” He flapped his hands, already Jon Stewart-level annoyed-humble. “I’m Trevor Noah! Thank you so much for joining us!” He launched right in, almost as if he’d been doing it all along, and said that Kevin Hart would be joining us. Then he took a step back.","1020","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"“Before we get started, I just want to say a few things,” he said. “This is surreal for me. Growing up in the dusty streets of South Africa, I never dreamed that I would one day have—well, two things, really. An indoor toilet, and a job as host of ‘The Daily Show.’ And now I have both. And I’m quite comfortable with one of them.”","1021","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"Ha! It was reassuring to start off with a toilet joke, somehow. But I was wondering: Is he mocking himself and South African poverty, or are the other writers doing it? And when we laugh, what are we laughing at? “Now I’m in the chair and I can only assume it is as strange for you as it is for me. Jon Stewart was more than just a late-night host. He was often our voice, our refuge. And in many ways, our political dad. And it’s weird. Because Dad has left.” He looked grave. This was excellent—the studio audience laughed its head off. “And now it feels like the family has a new stepdad. And he’s black.” We were back in topnotch “Daily Show” territory here, and it felt good. He was teasing us, acknowledging the truth of our love and expectations and his newness and difference. The crowd went wild. “Which, ah, which is not ideal.” What? Not ideal that he’s black? What do we do with that?","1022","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"Noah went on to explain, warmly enough, that “Comedy Central did ask women to host, and the women they asked turned the job down, because they all had better things to do, and clearly knew something I didn’t.” American hosts had also turned the job down. “So, once more, a job Americans rejected is now being done by an immigrant,” he said. He thanked Jon Stewart: “I’m not quite sure what you saw in me, but I’ll work hard every day to find it, and I’ll make you not look like the crazy old dude who left his inheritance to some random kid from Africa.” He thanked us, the viewers, and pledged to “continue the war on bullshit.” This was a great start, and we were with him, all in this together.","1023","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"Then, the news, or what I tend to consider, on “The Daily Show,” the fun part. Noah did an able job with the fun part, and seemed to be enjoying himself. “Now, seeing as this is my first show, we wanted to start it off with something a little light, so here we go: Syria. Just kidding—it’s the Pope! YEAGHHHHHHHH!” he yelled. He put his arms in the air. There was a fine bit about Pope-themed emojis: Popemojis. “For when you want to inject just the right amount of confusion into your late-night sexting. Sup, girl! You up? Because eggplant winky face cartoon Pope likes cheesesteaks! Good luck figuring that one out.” It was great to have “The Daily Show” back, and the jokes about the Pope’s tiny Fiat (“Somebody’s undercompensating!”) and the Boehner resignation (“No! Why leave now? I have a fancy suit and a new set and I learned how to pronounce your name! Boehner!”—wink) were fun. But there’s a bad-feeling flip side of some of this. Some of the jokes were mean or weird: a good joke about Club Congress was undermined by “and everyone has aides.” Any joke about people having AIDS feels like the eighties, in the worst way. The crowd audibly recoiled. A joke about crack and meth and Whitney Houston, delivered hammily, was upsetting. The crowd recoiled again. “Too soon?” Noah said.","1024","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"Later, Kevin Hart came onstage. In the new setup, they seemed to sit very close together, and Hart, a live-wire who kept turning away from Noah and toward the audience, looked like he was going to spin off like a top, perhaps to start his own talk show. Noah said that he loved Hart’s series “Real Husbands of Hollywood,” and, perhaps to keep things rolling when the audience didn’t applaud, asked if he was still a mitch.","1025","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"Hart said, “For those of you who don’t know, mitch is a male term for a bitch. Yes, I am very much a male bitch.”","1026","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"“I don’t know if that’s true anymore,” Noah said. “You are very much a comedic rock star.” He cited some reasons: pushups, muscles, action-movie star.","1027","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"What is a male bitch?, people might be wondering. Which bad stereotype of a woman inspired it? A crazy female jerk? Somebody who’s been bitch-slapped? A kind of “making you my bitch” thing? And why did Noah lead with that?","1028","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"This exchange left me feeling like a female mitch. There had been several such moments: ha ha ha—hey! We’re all laughing together—oof! Wait, are they laughing at me? People with AIDS? The death of Whitney Houston? What the hell? Are we bullies? Are they?","1029","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"We want to love and trust our new comedy stepdad. But in part because of Noah’s tweets, we don’t yet have reason to trust who’s making the jokes, and what he’s laughing at. He and the writers should work extra hard to earn our trust. That means, basically, be funny, but don’t be an asshole. Don’t say it’s “not ideal” to have a black stepdad. Err on the side of kindness. You can be funny and still do this. Lay off the bitches and the mitches.","1030","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"At the end of the show, the feeling of game apprehension and hopeful dread remained. But our mood was given a boost by Larry Wilmore, at 11:30. “New ‘Daily Show’ viewers, don’t be confused!” Wilmore said. “I’m a different light-skinned brother late-night host. That’s right! It’s the first time late night’s gone black to black!” This was a thrilling moment. And Wilmore, who has our trust—he’s had it from the beginning, when he was so good on “The Daily Show”—launched right in. “Also: Ben Carson continues talking shit about Muslims! And I continue not giving a shit about Ben Carson!” Then he cited a recent Jeb Bush remark about Democrats luring black voters with “free stuff.” “Hey Jeb! Here’s something for free!” He reached into his pocket and gave Jeb! the finger. This felt deeply satisfying, and he later followed it up with a smart, sobering analysis of a passage from Jeb’s 1996 book “Profiles in Character.” O.K., Comedy Central: I like where this is going. Take us into 2016.","1031","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"Ben Carson had wanted to be a doctor since he was a child in Detroit in the early nineteen-sixties, but he had the first inkling of what kind of doctor he might be when, as an undergraduate at Yale, he was introduced to Foosball. He played the game “with speed and ease,” he writes in his memoir, “Gifted Hands.” He had “an unusual ability—a divine gift, I believe—of extraordinary eye and hand coordination.” Even after he graduated and went on to medical school at the University of Michigan, a Yale student who made a great Foosball play was said to have scored a “Carson shot.” In the movie version of “Gifted Hands,” broadcast on TNT, in 2009, Cuba Gooding, Jr., as Carson, works the levers with a Jedi-like air—reprised in a later scene in which, during a twenty-two-hour procedure, Dr. Carson separates twin infants conjoined at the head. They were the first ever to survive such surgery.","1032","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Carson mentioned that operation in the first Republican Presidential debate, last month. “I’m the only one to separate Siamese twins,” he said. “The only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it.” It was a Carson shot. Last week, a Monmouth University poll had him in second place among Republicans, with eighteen per cent, behind Donald Trump’s thirty per cent—meaning that the choice of nearly half the respondents was someone who has never held political office.","1033","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"There have been attempts to explain Carson’s rise as being simply of a piece with this disjointed election season. Sunny and unflappable, he has been seen as the refined Trump (Rich Lowry, of National Review, called him the “superior outsider”), or the Trump that not even Trump can hate (the Donald says that he’s “a wonderful guy”). The standard narrative is that Carson first appeared on the political scene in 2013, when, at the National Prayer Breakfast, he told his life story in a speech that, as the Fox News world heard it, was a rebuke to the President, who was sitting on the dais. In fact, Carson has been out telling that story for twenty-five years.","1034","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"His mother, Sonya, married his father when she was thirteen and he was twenty-eight. He turned out to be a bigamist and, once he was gone, Sonya supported Ben and his older brother by cleaning houses. When the boys struggled in school, she made them turn off the TV, read two library books a week, and write reports on them. She was functionally illiterate, but, as Carson said at the Prayer Breakfast, “we didn’t know that—she put check marks and highlights and stuff.” He went from the bottom of the class to near the top. His mother’s motto, which informs Carson’s conservatism, was: “If you don’t succeed, you have only yourself to blame.” But Carson grew up a devout Seventh-Day Adventist, and “Gifted Hands,” like his campaign, is also about grace. When he was in ninth grade, after a friend teased him, he pulled out a knife and thrust it at the friend’s stomach. The boy could have died; Carson could have gone to jail. Instead, the blade hit his friend’s belt buckle and broke. Carson ran home, locked himself in the bathroom with the Book of Proverbs, and prayed to God to take away his temper. He says that he walked out a different person.","1035","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"In 1977, when Carson began his residency, at Johns Hopkins, he was sometimes assumed to be an orderly, but he regarded that as “a natural mistake”—what other black men did people see in hospitals? “I got a real kick out of watching them try to contain their expression of surprise,” he writes. He became an outstanding and innovative surgeon and, in 1984, at the age of thirty-three, the youngest head of a pediatric-neurosurgery department in the country. His joke about taking out half a brain was a reference to his pioneering work on hemispherectomies; the breakthrough case involved a four-year-old girl who had been racked by a hundred seizures a day.","1036","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"“Gifted Hands” was published by the Christian imprint Zondervan in 1990, after the surgery on the twins, and it has sold more than a million and a half copies. It is often assigned in schools, and a condensed version is being sold to fund Carson’s campaign. (According to the Times, as of July he had raised eighty per cent of his money from small donors, a higher proportion than any candidate except Bernie Sanders.) Carson has since written more books, started an educational nonprofit with his wife, Candy (they met at Yale, and have three sons), and gone on speaking tours. There is a parallel between his political emergence and that of Ronald Reagan, whose Prayer Breakfast moment was a televised speech in support of Barry Goldwater in 1964. The speech, titled “A Time for Choosing,” had been honed by Reagan during the decade he spent as a spokesman for General Electric, making appearances at company events in towns across the country.","1037","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Then, as now, the Republican Party was shifting in ways that were only peripherally visible to its ostensible leaders. Carson’s venues have been schools, churches, and gatherings of conservative activists, many of whom deeply distrust both their government and the larger institutions of their party. Their discontent, joined with what Carson sees as the lessons of his mother’s rejection of dependency, seems to have been a crucible for his own views. Eventually, he moved from offering himself as a role model to being a prescriber of policy.","1038","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Carson speaks to an unnerved America in terms that are themselves unnerving. He describes how our “pinnacle nation” is about to be driven down by moral decay. In his most recent book, “One Nation,” he writes that agents working against this country’s greatness include the political-correctness police, who use “faux hypersensitivity” to take power away from the majority of Americans. He regularly traces that strategy to Saul Alinsky, the mid-century community organizer whose name is a byword for conservative suspicions about Barack Obama. Political correctness, Carson says, is used to keep conservatives from invoking slavery or Nazism, both of which he cites freely. (“Obamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery”; “We live in a Gestapo age.”) He wonders if Obama will cause the elections to be cancelled: “He’s sitting there saying, ‘These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything.’ ” Trump, the businessman, tells Americans how the financial system is rigged against them. Carson, the brain surgeon, tells them how they are being denied knowledge. It doesn’t seem to matter that he is a man of science who does not believe in evolution and has called climate change “irrelevant”: he is an ideologue with the trappings of a technocrat.","1039","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Insofar as Carson has a political platform, it involves a low flat tax, modelled on the Biblical tithe; an end to Obamacare and to welfare for able-bodied adults; and the removal of restraints on our military in the Middle East. In lieu of specifics, Carson tends to say that as a surgeon he has experience “doing complex things” and making snap life-or-death decisions. His success in the polls may be best understood as desperation on the part of voters who have rejected political experience as a test of competence. But it should take more than a Carson shot to navigate this Presidential campaign, which has been played, so far, with all the reckless abandon of a Foosball game, and with little of the joy. ♦","1040","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"In 2013, Ben Carson gave a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast that launched his political career. According to the rapturous response on the Internet, Carson’s remarks were a rebuke of President Obama—people saw Carson as an authentic black counterpoint to the President—but they were just as clearly a rejection of what he called the culture of “political correctness.” “The P.C. police are out in force,” he warned from the podium. “We’ve reached a point where people are afraid to say what they think because someone might be offended. People are afraid to say ‘Merry Christmas’ at Christmastime.”","September 22, 2015","1041","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"The concern among the burgeoning numbers of political-correctness critics—on both the left and right—is that the parameters of polite (or at least non-bigoted) discussion get in the way of truth-telling, leaving us with good feelings and palliative falsehoods. There is, however, a logical fallacy at play among many of these opponents, in their presumption that the validity of a statement exists in direct proportion to its capacity to offend.","1042","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"There are few anodyne truths in Ben Carson’s worldview. The decibel of the objections is evidence that he’s struck upon truth. A hit dog hollers, as Southerners say. When, this past Sunday, on “Meet the Press,” Carson voiced his opposition to the idea of a Muslim being elected President, he did so in the same calm, measured tones that attend almost all of his pronouncements. He spoke with the quiet confidence of a man convinced of the rectitude of his own position. Here is Carson responding to a question about whether voters should consider a candidate’s faith:","1043","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"

"Carson’s position within the paranormal wing of the G.O.P. is perplexing for a number of reasons. Unlike Donald Trump, who is capable of making equally inflammatory and nativist comments, Carson’s intellectual accomplishments are indisputable.* He is a product of the most respected educational institutions in the United States and was once a foremost practitioner in a highly complex field of medicine. Yet his virtuoso abilities coexist with a loosely tethered relationship to other types of rational thought. Carson is a scientist who disavows evolution, a citizen who professes to be deeply concerned about democracy yet supports a religious litmus test for public office, and a physician who devoted himself to saving the lives of children but indulges the hypertensive claims of the anti-vaccine element. His bifurcated thinking calls to mind James Watson, the Nobel winning co-discoverer of DNA, who spent years mouthing racist and sexist theories of human intelligence. On the stump, Carson seems like an object lesson in what happens when STEM majors don’t take enough courses in the humanities and social sciences.","1045","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"For reasons connected to his race, his education, and his exceptional talent, Carson at first carried an imprimatur of Serious Thought that the others in the crowded G.O.P. field did not. (Building a real-estate empire, winning a Senate seat, and serving as a corporate C.E.O. are impressive accomplishments, but they are literally not brain surgery.) But Carson’s duelling intellect and paranoia have led him to support untenable positions with minor qualifications. He panders by faint dissent. By stating that he believes that Islam is inconsistent with American democracy and that President Obama is a Christian born in the United States, he validates the substance of birtherism, just not this specific instance of it. When Carson was confronted, during the last Republican debate, with the question of whether vaccines cause autism, he stated that they did not but offered paranoiacs the nebulous chaser that we are giving children too many immunizations. The suggestion that vaccines have some nebulous danger essentially nullified the statement that preceded it.","1046","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"That the party responsible for the Southern strategy, the racist populism of the Reagan era, and the current age of voter suppression can count a black neurosurgeon among its most popular Presidential candidate is in itself a form of vaccination against charges of racism. It means one thing when a white billionaire taps into whites’ anxieties about cultural and economic displacement, and something else entirely when a black man from Detroit validates their conspiratorial fears about the Affordable Care Act. Or when, in an oblivious echo of the Dred Scott decision, an African-American states that entire segments of the population are irreconcilable with the Constitution. Carson’s is not a novel act. Five years ago, Juan Williams, a black journalist who covered civil rights and wrote a biography of Thurgood Marshall, stated that he felt fearful when boarding a plane with Muslims. The ensuing outcry was, predictably, denounced as political correctness.","1047","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"The enduring legacy of Carson’s candidacy, however it ends, is likely to be the recognition that, under certain circumstances, cynicism is less of a problem than sincerity. Would that such detached thinking, from so talented a figure, came with a wink and a nod—that it were simply a matter of demagogic competition in a crowded political field. But Carson appears to mean what he says, and there is a consistent market for his brand of exonerating racism, for bigotries so valid that even a brilliant black man endorses them. His certainty that the din of outrage is merely the yelping dog of political correctness prohibits him from fulfilling one of the primary responsibilities of a scientist: the honest evaluation of contrary data. It also blinds him to the widely apparent truth that his politics are not simply incorrect—they’re also wrong.","1048","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"

"Tuesday’s headline in the world of U.S. politics is that Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, has moved ahead of Donald Trump in a CBS News/New York Times poll of likely Republican-primary voters. The survey shows Carson with twenty-six per cent of the vote, and Trump with twenty-two per cent. The rest of the candidates are lagging far behind, in the single figures.","October 27, 2015","1050","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Since the start of October, half a dozen polls have shown Carson leading in Iowa, where evangelical Christians, who are flocking to his candidacy, make up about half of the Republican electorate. But the CBS/Times poll is the first major survey to indicate that Carson is ahead at the national level. Coming as it does the day before the third Republican debate, which will be held on Wednesday night in Boulder, Colorado, the numbers are sure to inspire headlines about whether Carson can win the nomination, and whether the long-predicted Trump slump is finally upon us.","1051","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Such speculation is probably premature. While the Democratic race appears to have settled into a predictable pattern—centrist favorite versus progressive underdog—the Republican race is still a freak show, to borrow a term popular with political operatives. Carson is now enjoying his moment, but more ups and downs can be expected, with other candidates rising and falling. As for Trump, strange as it would have sounded a couple of months ago, his presence at the top of the polls has become the one fixture in the race.","1052","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Arguably, the most important finding in the new poll isn’t the four-point gap that Carson has opened up over Trump—which, in any case, is within the survey’s margin of error. The key number is twenty-eight per cent. That’s the proportion of respondents who said that they had already made their minds up about which candidate to vote for: fewer than one in three. As a Times story about the poll put it, “Seven in 10 of those who expressed support for a candidate said it was too early to say for sure who they would support.”","1053","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"These figures aren’t too surprising. The Iowa caucus is still more than three months away, and the primary is proving to be quite a spectacle. If you were a potential G.O.P. voter, wouldn’t you sit back and enjoy the show for a while before deciding whom to vote for? Wouldn’t you be tempted to flirt with one or two of the candidates, especially the ones who seem new and different? It’s not as if we haven’t seen this sort of behavior before. In the last week of October, 2011, Herman Cain, the “9-9-9” man, was leading in the G.O.P. polls. A couple of weeks later, his campaign went into a free fall, and in December he dropped out of the race.","1054","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"I am not suggesting that Carson is another Cain, who was hit with allegations that he had made unwanted sexual advances toward women, and that he had been involved in at least one long-term extramarital affair. From what we know about Carson, his personal life and professional life are above reproach: that’s one reason why many Republicans are warming to him. (Another reason is that he has adopted ultra-conservative positions on abortion, gun control, and other social issues.) My point is simply that, at this stage in the campaign, the G.O.P. electorate is volatile, and much of Carson’s support is provisional. The CBS/Times poll explicitly confirms this. Four out of five of Carson’s supporters say that it’s too early to say for certain that they will vote for him.","1055","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"As for Trump, his impending demise has been announced many times before. This is just one poll. Another survey, released on Monday by the firm Morning Consult, showed him leading Carson by thirty-five per cent to twenty per cent. Since that poll was conducted over the Internet, it was probably less reliable than the CBS/Times survey, which was a telephone poll that relied on both landlines and cell phones. But the rule with polls is to look at the averages of multiple surveys, rather than at individual results. And, according to the Real Clear Politics poll average, Trump is still leading Carson by almost five percentage points—26.8 per cent to twenty-two per cent—nationwide.","1056","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"To be sure, Trump’s advantage has narrowed sharply since the end of August, when he was way ahead. But the fact is that he has been leading the race for more than three months. After a lacklustre performance at the second Republican debate, on September 16th, his numbers fell back. Since then, though—at least, prior to the CBS/Times poll—they appeared to have rebounded to the high twenties. This persistence suggests that Trump, in defiance of the general pattern of volatility, has established a base of support that amounts to somewhere between a fifth and a third of the Republican electorate. Unlike Carson’s supporters, a majority of Trump’s backers—fifty-five per cent of them, according to the CBS/Times poll—seem to have made up their minds about their choice.","1057","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Of course, winning over a quarter of the primary electorate won’t be sufficient to carry Trump to the nomination. With up to half of potential Republican voters telling pollsters that they won’t back him under any circumstances, he faces serious obstacles to expanding his support. Still, unless something dramatic and unexpected happens, his presence in the race seems likely to remain its defining feature for at least a while. And that, in turn, means that the main task facing the other candidates is to navigate a way around him.","1058","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"So far, most of the traditional politicians in the field have struggled mightily to do this, especially Jeb Bush (whose troubles I considered a couple of days ago) and the now-departed Scott Walker. Carson, radiating calm and exploiting his status as a non-politician politician, has fared much better. Now, however, he will be in the spotlight, with higher expectations, more media attention, and more potshots coming at him from Trump and others. “It really is like a cleansing action,” Trump said Tuesday, on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “A lot of things will come out now, and we’ll see how he holds up to the scrutiny.” Beginning tomorrow night in Colorado, we certainly will.","1059","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"

This is the latest in a series of surveys that has shown Carson moving up, but the previous surveys still had Trump ahead by double digits. In this one, Trump’s lead was down to just four points, which isn’t even statistically significant. Twenty-seven per cent of likely G.O.P. voters said that they would support Trump, and twenty-three per cent said that they would support Carson.","September 15, 2015","1060","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"Yes, it is just one poll, and the usual caveats about sampling error and outliers apply.

"The poll raises the stakes for tomorrow night’s Republican debate, which will be shown on CNN.

"At this stage, anyway, the polling data suggests that Carson is the only electorally viable alternative to Trump in the G.O.P. primary. In the new survey, as in a number of previous ones, all of the candidates except Trump and Carson scored in the single figures. Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, and Marco Rubio each got six per cent. Ted Cruz got five per cent. Fiorina got four per cent. The rest of the pack got three per cent or less.","1063","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"Backers of more orthodox Republican politicians will no doubt be hoping that these candidates do well in Wednesday’s debate and subsequently pick themselves up off the floor. But how long can the party hierarchy and its financial backers afford to wait? With Trump parading around the country, saying C.E.O. pay levels are disgraceful and promising to abolish some tax breaks enjoyed by the rich, some of his fellow plutocrats are already eager to take him down. On Tuesday, the Club for Growth, a right-wing pressure group that has received funding from a number of conservative billionaires, announced that it was launching an anti-Trump advertising campaign in Iowa and other states. “We’ll continue doing it until people realize that Donald Trump is not an economic conservative,” the organization’s president, David M. McIntosh, said at a press conference in Washington.","1064","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"As the old saying goes, though, you can’t beat something with nothing, and, right now, Carson looks like he might be the something that worried Republicans need. A world-renowned surgeon who was brought up in Detroit by his mother, after his parents divorced, Carson has an inspirational life story to relate. A supporter of a balanced-budget amendment, a skeptic about most government programs, and a harsh critic of Obamacare (last year, he said it has done more damage to the United States than the 9/11 attacks), he is singing a tune that conservatives want to hear. On the basis of what we’ve seen so far, he may well have the calmness and self-confidence to stand up to Trump’s jibes without being rattled. Last week, after Trump questioned Carson’s energy level and called him just an “O.K. doctor” —a laughably inaccurate description—Carson responded gracefully.","1065","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"For Carson, a lot depends on Wednesday night’s debate. CNN has been promoting the event as “Round two of a heavyweight bout,” and much of the attention will be focussed on how Trump and Fiorina interact, following Trump’s offensive remarks about Fiorina’s appearance. But Carson, who was largely overlooked at last month’s Fox News debate, will also be a big part of the story. If he holds his own, or does better than that, it would confirm his position as the main rival to Trump.","1066","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"Until now, the Republican establishment, for want of a better strategy, has been largely waiting for the Trump phenomenon to blow over. Recently, some of the candidates, Jeb Bush included, have started to criticize Trump, but that hasn’t done them much good, either. In a year when much of the Republican electorate appears to have soured on all politicians, only Carson has made much of a dent on Trump’s lead. If you were a mega-rich Republican, or a Karl Rove type, why wouldn’t you take that as a cue to throw some serious money and organizational might in the direction of Carson’s campaign, which, until now, has largely relied on small donations? If nothing else, it could serve as an insurance policy.","1067","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"It has been widely reported that many Republican bigwigs and strategists have serious doubts about Carson’s political skills, and his ability to withstand all of the attention and craziness that comes with being a serious contender. That’s understandable. He’s a doctor, not a politician, and he has made some gaffes in the past, such as suggesting that the prevalence of homosexuality in prisons shows that being gay is a choice.

"For a man with an impressive educational C.V., Ben Carson makes a lot of intellectual missteps. In his September 16th debate performance, he displayed a profound lack of foreign-policy knowledge; last Sunday, when he said, on “Meet the Press,” that he “would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation,” he may have seriously crippled his campaign. Still, there’s one area in which Carson’s credentials have seemed unimpeachable. Many people assume that, as a successful surgeon, he has a solid knowledge of technical, medical, and scientific issues.","September 28, 2015","1070","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"With the wide release of video from a speech that Carson made to his fellow Seventh-Day Adventists in 2012, however, it’s becoming clear that there are significant gaps. In the speech, he made statements on subjects ranging from evolution to the Big Bang that suggest he never learned or chooses to ignore basic, well-tested scientific concepts. In attempting to refute the Big Bang, for example—which he characterized as a “ridiculous” idea—Carson said:","1071","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"He continued, “It’s even more ridiculous than that, because our solar system, not to mention the universe outside of that, is extraordinarily well organized, to the point where we can predict seventy years away when a comet is coming. Now, [for] that type of organization to just come out of an explosion? I mean, you want to talk about fairy tales, that is amazing.” Finally, he argued that the observed motion of the planets in our solar system would be impossible if there had been a Big Bang.","1072","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"It is hard to find a single detailed claim in his diatribe that is physically sensible or that reflects accurate knowledge about science. His central claim—that the second law of thermodynamics rules out order forming in the universe after the Big Bang—is a frequent misstatement made by creationists who want to appear scientifically literate. In reality, it is completely false. Local order in parts of the universe is always possible at the expense of heat and disorder dissipated to the external environment. The human body is one example: we take in energy from our environment to build up complex molecules that help power our bodies, and, in doing so, we release heat to the world around us. A snowflake is another beautifully ordered example of what simple natural meteorological processes can produce. Stars form by gravity, collapsing into spherically ordered structures that can remain in this form only if they release tremendous heat energy into the environment. Carson elides these physical realities by creating a straw man: he says that scientists believe that, after the Big Bang, the universe was “perfectly ordered.” But no such claim has been made by scientists; instead, we describe how local order, including galaxies, stars, planets, and life, developed over time.","1073","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"When Carson says that scientists rely on “probability theory” to explain how multiple Big Bangs, taking place over “billions of years,” have resulted in our “perfectly ordered” universe, he’s profoundly misstating the theory of the Big Bang. (In fact, he seems to have gotten his ignorant arguments confused—his metaphor about a hurricane creating a 747 in a junkyard is often used to deride evolution, to which it is equally inapplicable.) No one suggests that other Big Bangs have happened or are happening in our universe. Instead, all evidence implies that our universe originated from a single Big Bang approximately 13.7 billion years ago. Perhaps Carson was referring to the possibility of other universes outside of our universe, and to the so-called anthropic principle, which suggests that, if there are many universes, the fact that our universe supports life could be a probabilistic phenomenon. But those ideas, whether they’re true or not, have nothing to do with the reality of the Big Bang. We conclude the Big Bang happened because every piece of observational evidence we have about the universe is precisely consistent with predictions based on this possibility and none other. Speculations about other possible universes are irrelevant.","1074","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"Perhaps his silliest statements have to do with our own solar system. Carson claims that our solar system is perfectly ordered—but, in fact, the motion of the planets is chaotic in the long term, and, although we can predict the motion of comets over the seventy-year period he discusses, for longer time horizons, such as millions or billions of years, the complexity of our solar system makes that practically impossible. Even more problematically, he points to the fact that some moons orbit in different directions from their planets and argues that those orbits would be impossible if there had been a Big Bang, because angular momentum would forbid it:","1075","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"This is akin to saying that, if there really had been a Big Bang billions of years ago, skaters today should be able to spin in only one direction. Local systems can exchange angular momentum with their surroundings by collisions, and many forms of chaotic motion are, therefore, possible. Bathwater rotates around the drain, sometimes clockwise and sometimes counterclockwise, happily independent of the Big Bang. The questions that Carson goes on to ask about the “debris” from the Big Bang—“What about all the debris from the billions and billions of explosions that were not perfect? Where’s that? I mean, we should be bombarded constantly by all this debris coming down; we’re not seeing it”—are meaningless if our entire visible universe arose from a single Big Bang, which is what the evidence suggests.","1076","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"Carson’s wild delusions aren’t confined to physics, either. In the same event, in a more surprising and perhaps more worrisome statement, Carson claimed that evolution, as explained by Darwin, was actually the work of the devil. (“I personally believe that this theory that Darwin came up with was something that was encouraged by the adversary, and it has become what is scientifically, politically correct.”) As if invoking Satan weren’t bad enough, Carson resorted to bad puns to sidestep his scientific ignorance: he went on to say that he was planning a book called “The Organ of Species,” which he said would “talk about the organs of the body and how they completely refute evolution”—an amazing claim that would require a rewriting of most biology texts. At another point in the speech, he uses a long stream of medical terminology to argue against the biochemical origins of life—something he doesn’t seem to realize has nothing to do with Darwinian evolution itself. Elsewhere, he claims that plants couldn’t have evolved before bees and that sexual reproduction shouldn’t have evolved at all, and suggests that geological formations provide evidence of a great flood, not an old Earth.","1077","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"It is one thing to simply assert that you don’t choose to believe the science, in spite of a mountain of data supporting it. It’s another to mask your ignorance in such a disingenuous way, by using pseudo-scientific, emotion-laden arguments and trading on your professional credentials. Surely this quality, which reflects either self-delusion or, worse still, a willingness to intentionally deceive others, is of great concern when someone is vying for control of the nuclear red button.","1078","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"Last week, when he was confronted, during a speech at Cedarville University, about his failure to understand basic and fundamental scientific concepts, Carson responded, “I’m not going to denigrate you because of your faith, and you shouldn’t denigrate me for mine.” What Carson doesn’t seem to recognize is that there is a fundamental difference between facts and faith. An inability to separate religious beliefs from an assessment of physical reality runs counter to the very basis of our society—the separation of church and state.","1079","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"By his own admission, Carson’s remarkable hand-eye coördination allowed him to soar as a surgeon, and he used that success to build a lucrative reputation as a purveyor of advice for young and old. His book for young people is titled “You Have a Brain.” As numerous religious scientists have quipped, God wouldn’t have given us a brain if he hadn’t intended for us to use it. While many may debate whether his lack of public-service experience disqualifies him from serious consideration in this race, Carson’s ideas about religion, science, and public office, as revealed in the past week, suggest that there are far deeper reasons to be concerned about his candidacy for the highest office in the land.","1080","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance"
"“‘What’s going on?’ I asked,” Ben Carson wrote in “Gifted Hands,” a memoir he published in 1990. “ ‘A hoax,’ the teacher said.” This was the climax of a scene at Yale, where he enrolled as an undergraduate in 1969, in which Carson described having seen a notice that the exam papers for Perceptions 310, a psychology class he was taking, had been accidentally burned, and that there would be a makeup. When the makeup proved to be impossibly—almost comically—hard, every student but Carson walked out. (He heard some students saying that they’d claim they never saw the notice about the makeup.) Then, when Carson was alone, an instructor and a photographer for the Yale Daily News, who snapped his picture, told him that he’d been tricked—but he had also demonstrated that he was the most honest student in the class. Then, Carson remembered, they handed him a ten-dollar bill.","November 10, 2015","1081","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"Last week, the Wall Street Journal cited this episode as a problem with Carson’s biography, one that went to his credibility and—because he is largely running on his inspirational life story—to the heart of his campaign. Reporters at the Journal couldn’t find a photo of him in the Yale Daily News; they couldn’t find a course with the name Perceptions 310. But there was, in fact, a problem with the exposé itself, which became clear in the next few days: Carson’s story held up a lot better than the Journal had implied.","1082","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"There may not have been a captioned photo in the Daily News, but there was an article that described just such a prank having been pulled off by the Yale Record, a humor publication, in January, 1970. It involved a parody edition of the News. The title of the class was Psychology 10, a mistake that Carson blamed on his ghostwriter—not the most gracious move but fair enough. It’s hardly material, and he was writing decades after the fact. BuzzFeed found a Record staff member who recalled helping with the prank, and was “99% certain the way Carson remembers it is correct,” including the difficulty of the makeup questions and how, “at the end, what few students remained — it may have just been one or two, I wasn’t there — received a small cash prize.” Some of the commentary that followed suggested that the story still reflected poorly on Carson, because he couldn’t tell the difference between the Record and the Daily News, and because he fell for the stunt, as, presumably, no sophisticated Eli should. This line of attack, with its undertones of élitism, is not likely to do him any damage with his supporters.","1083","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"Another exposé, by Politico, about whether Carson was offered admission to West Point—he never seems to have formally applied—fell flat for what are, at root, similar reasons. “Gifted Hands” can be a confusing book, because the narrative jumps back and forth in the timeline. Carson presents a series of vignettes related to his high-school career, during which he was active in R.O.T.C., and to his college-admissions decisions. There is a Memorial Day parade “at the end of my twelfth grade,” which would have been May, 1969, in Detroit, which he marched in; “afterward,” an encounter with General William Westmoreland at a banquet that celebrated Medal of Honor winners; and, “later,” an offer of “a full scholarship to West Point,” which he “didn’t refuse … outright,” and is mainly presented as important because it gives him confidence going into the college-admissions process—which happens at the beginning of twelfth grade, not the end—and the faith, in “the fall of 1968,” to apply only to a single college, Yale.","1084","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"The jumbled way that the book is written can suggest that we are in a time loop. This happens a lot when Carson tells stories or lays out plans, and it is a real point of criticism. (Similarly, if you diagram the hoax-exam story, it sounds like it happened when he was a junior, not a freshman.) But the individual parts are not only plausible but have some real backup. Politico notes that Westmoreland was not in Detroit that Memorial Day, but he was in Detroit in February, 1969, for a banquet a lot like the one Carson describes. Much has been made of Carson’s saying that he was offered a West Point scholarship, given that there is no cost for attending, but in that sense everybody who goes gets a scholarship. And it is more than likely that an Army general would have explained it in those terms to a teen-ager from inner-city Detroit whom he wanted to recruit. The nomination process for West Point does work in a more personal way than, say, the common app. As my colleague Hendrik Hertzberg wrote on Twitter, “If it’s true that Westmoreland told Carson he could have a West Point appointment for the asking, Carson’s garbled version is forgivable.” Again, the fact that Carson doesn’t talk about it in the way that someone more savvy might is not going to hurt him.","1085","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"Besides—and this may be the real reason that the West Point story is weak—it hasn’t been disputed that Carson grew up the child of an impoverished, functionally illiterate single mother. Nevertheless, he was accepted to Yale and succeeded there. He went on to the University of Michigan Medical School and became first a resident, then a distinguished surgeon, at Johns Hopkins. There is every reason to believe that he could have gone to West Point if he had pursued it. These facts also point to a weakness in another line of debunking, about whether Carson was really as angry as he remembered being as a fourteen-year-old; he had plenty of things to be angry about. Saying that he was actually always happy-go-lucky, and never needed, as he writes, a religious experience to put aside his hostility and his violent tendencies is also not likely to be a campaign killer, though it does point to how very strange this political season has been. It clearly plays into evangelical Christians’ love of a redemption story—but arguing that people shouldn’t be moved by it because it feels saccharine is, in the absence of real evidence that he has fabricated the basic narrative, more of an aesthetic response than a political one. Ben Carson was a fine student and an exceptional doctor. He is just a very bad candidate for President.","1086","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"The odd thing is that the Carson campaign is what might be called a target-rich environment for journalists—or it should be. He has been utterly dismissive of climate change, and he has fostered the idea that vaccines cause autism. The numbers for his tax plan, insofar as there are any, don’t add up. He has said that Joseph, of the coat of many colors, built the pyramids in order to store the grain of the seven fat years—a statement that, as I’ve written, was troubling not because we expect our Presidents to be up on the distinction between Early and Middle Kingdom dynasties but because Carson presented it as an example of why one should reject the theories of experts and scientists and turn, instead, to the Bible. Similarly, his claim that none of the signers of the Declaration of Independence had experience in elective office, when a great number of them did, is significant not only because it is false but because it speaks to a particular view of history and politics. (Carson later amended the statement to say that none had federal experience. Of course, they couldn’t have, because there was no federal government when the Declaration was signed.) He has suggested that President Obama might declare martial law, and that the 2016 elections might be cancelled amid scenes of untenable civil disorder. He has compared Obamacare to slavery and to Nazism. He has also made what PolitiFact judged to be outright false statements in the last Republican debate about his ties to a nutritional-supplement company. (In contrast, PolitiFact rated Carson’s description of West Point’s “scholarships” as mostly true.)","1087","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"
"Perhaps the problem isn’t that the media is too partisan but that, in looking at Carson, there was a hope that there might be a non-partisan way to address a campaign whose success is hard for observers of American politics to understand. There is a sense that we are going to wake up one day and Carson and Donald Trump will have departed, and then we can get back to differentiating among the traditional politicians. But what is the mechanism for that? If Carson were onstage only because of his life story, and Trump only because of his celebrity, the two of them would not, together, be getting half of the support of Republicans in every poll. This campaign is not actually a prank being pulled on the public, which will have a moment when the photographer comes out and explains the joke. Would that it were.","1088","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-ben-carson-stories"

"“So, I say, what the hell have we come to?” Donald Trump said in Fort Dodge, Iowa, on Thursday night. “What have we come to? When we have to believe this kind of stuff. And we’re going to put someone in office who considers himself to have pathological disease?” He was talking, in case one paused to sort through the various candidates, about Ben Carson. “Read the definition in the dictionary of pathological disease!” Trump continued. “And I’m not saying it. He said it about himself before he knew he was gonna run for office.”","November 14, 2015","1118","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"Carson, Trump explained, had “said terrible things about himself,” a habit entirely alien to Trump. Specifically, Carson has said that, between the ages of thirteen and fifteen, when he was growing up in Detroit, he was prone to violence; he tried to attack his mother with a hammer, hit a friend in the face with a padlock, and stabbed another friend in the stomach with a knife—which, in what Carson has presented as a moment of grace, hit the friend’s belt buckle and snapped. “He defined it as disease,” Trump said, and, indeed, in “Gifted Hands,” Carson writes, “I had what I can only label a pathological temper—a disease—and this sickness controlled me, making me totally irrational. . . . Totally without thinking, when my anger was aroused, I grabbed the nearest brick, rock, or stick to bash someone.” Carson also writes that even though he knew, from reading articles in Psychology Today, that a personality trait like that was generally immutable, he prayed to God to change him, and God did. To which Trump, in Iowa, said, “Give me a break!”","1119","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"“And the people of Iowa believe him?” Trump went on. “It doesn’t happen that way. . . . Don’t be fools. Don’t be fools, O.K.?” He moved away from the lectern, pulled back his jacket, and twisted his own belt up and down to demonstrate, like a latter-day Johnnie Cochran, what would really happen if someone was stabbed in the stomach—if blade and buckle don’t bump, you must vote Trump, so to speak. He then laid out the Trumpized version of the pop-psychology analysis: “Now, if you’re pathological, there’s no cure for that. . . . If you’re a child molester—a sick puppy—if you’re a child molester, there’s no cure for that. There’s only one cure—we don’t want to talk about that cure. That’s the ultimate cure. Well, there’s two, there’s death and the other thing.”","1120","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"This speech in Iowa was so freewheeling (ninety minutes), Trump’s language so crass (“How stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap?”), his impressions of his rivals so close to outright burlesque (on Marco Rubio: “If he was playing poker with me, I’d say, Ah! I know what. The water would start pouring off his body. I’d say AAAAHHHH.”), that it was hard to do more with that diagnosis than pause and wonder at a Presidential campaign in which the front-runner for a major party’s nomination regales audiences in Iowa with his belief in the efficacy of castrating criminals. (He also called reporters “scum.”) But, since he is the front-runner, there are two other points worth exploring: Trump’s view of people with less luck than he’s had and Trump’s view of Trump. These overlap, but there are distinctions. One is suggested by the option he mentioned besides castration: the death penalty.","1121","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"What does Donald Trump think the fate of an angry, black fourteen-year-old from a poor neighborhood, who has acted in a violent way, should, or possibly could, be? In 1989, he took out an ad in the Daily News calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, a group of fourteen-, fifteen-, and sixteen-year-olds who had been accused of raping and beating a jogger in the park. As I wrote in a piece about the case last year, he did not back away from that position even when the boys, now men, were exonerated, after serving years in prison—they were not, he said, “angels.” As a candidate for the 2016 G.O.P. Presidential nomination, what does he think about the possible effect on a child of education, support, rehabilitation, or even, in Carson’s terms, redemption? Not much, it would seem. Trump doesn’t particularly believe in working with what’s broken—this is the same impulse that caused him to say, in insulting John McCain, that he didn’t like people who had been taken prisoner. He likes what’s never been touched. Even more telling than “pathological” was another term he used about Carson: “Damaged . . . lot of damage.”","1122","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"The other striking thing about the Iowa speech is Trump’s—Trump’s!—dismay that voters would go for someone with no political experience who tells inflated stories about himself. But as the Daily News ad suggests, Trump has been thinking about politics for a long time—longer, it may turn out, than is good for America. Similarly, Jon Meacham’s new biography of George H. W. Bush, about Trump letting Lee Atwater, the Republican operative, know during the 1988 race that he was available for the Vice-Presidency, is not an anomalous data point in this regard. His ideology is not particularly coherent—a medley in his Iowa speech about immigration and foreign policy concluded with this memorable sentence: “If you’ve got to cross a border, if you have your choice between North Korea, Afghanistan, or Iran, I’d take Canada every single time.” (The events in Paris are unlikely to make his ideas more sensible or kind.) But he hasn’t only recently wandered into the arena, making it harder to count on him getting bored and wandering off. In Iowa, Trump also mentioned that he owned a single store that was worth more than Mitt Romney’s entire fortune. Apparently, this is true. The store is the Gucci flagship, in Trump Tower—“Fifth Avenue real estate, it’s amazing,” Trump said. Just when you think Trump has said something entirely delusional, or outright crazy, you realize that New York real-estate prices are crazier still. And so is this Presidential race.","1123","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"The keynote speaker at the annual National Prayer Breakfast, in Washington, D.C., is expected to be an agile performer: a preacher, but a nondenominational one; an orator, but a nonpartisan one. In 1997, the speaker was Benjamin Solomon Carson, who was both an accomplished pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins University and, unlike most pediatric neurosurgeons, something of a celebrity. Ten years before, he had separated twins who were joined at the head, and he used the attention that followed to establish himself as a writer and inspirational figure. He grew up poor and black in Detroit, the son of a single mother who, he likes to remind audiences, could barely read. And he has a knack, common to great motivators, for making his accomplishments seem both extraordinary and achievable.","1124","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"“I don’t feel that I really belong here,” Carson said, when he took the lectern, but his casual posture and gentle smile suggested that he knew he did. The anecdotes he dispensed had been polished smooth over the decades, and they helped him administer a carefully calibrated dose of political and spiritual incitement. He lamented the secularization of American society, asserting that religious faith was no longer acceptable in political discourse. “If it’s in our Constitution, it’s in our Pledge, it’s in our courts, and it’s on our money, but we’re not supposed to talk about it, what is that?” he asked. “That’s schizophrenia!” But he also delivered a black-history lesson, enumerating a long list of African-American inventors who were, he said, absent from school textbooks, thereby depriving young black men of role models. Midway through his talk, he issued a whimsical—and bipartisan—call to action. “What if everybody in this room, with all your influence, wrote a letter to Kellogg’s and General Mills and said, ‘Put on your cereal boxes Nobel Prize winners and people of intellect, instead of just people who use sports and entertainment,’ ” he said. “Those kinds of things, I think, will make a big difference.” When he was finished, Bill and Hillary Clinton stood up to applaud, and they pumped his hand as he returned to his seat.","1125","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Perhaps President Obama was expecting a similar performance when he settled in for Carson’s encore appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast, in February, 2013. But by then Carson’s political vision had come into sharper focus. The political pundit and entrepreneur Armstrong Williams, a longtime friend and adviser of Carson’s who is currently his business manager, remembers watching Carson “agonizing” in the greenroom, as he tried to decide whether, and how much, he should criticize the President. In the end, Carson decided not to single out Obama, but he offered a strongly divergent view of America’s problems and potential solutions: he sounded an alarm about the national debt; he called for a strictly proportional income tax, based on the Biblical principle of tithing; and he laid out a health-care reform plan, which he said would reduce “bureaucracy”—a veiled reference, perhaps, to Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The speech became an online sensation, partly thanks to its unnamed target, who stopped smiling about halfway through and skipped an opportunity for a post-speech handshake. Clips have amassed millions of views on YouTube: “Obama Destroyed by Dr. Benjamin Carson’s Amazing Speech”; “Dr. Benjamin Carson Wipes the Smile off Obama’s Face.” (Among Carson’s fans, his honorific often serves as a term of affection.) And the speech inspired the Wall Street Journal to issue the first major endorsement of the 2016 campaign cycle: “Ben Carson for President.”","1126","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The Journal editorial wasn’t actually intended as a Presidential endorsement; it was a jocular salute to a newly minted folk hero, and a mischievous suggestion that even this political layman was more sensible than Obama. But the cult of Carson grew, aided by the formation of the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee, and by tacit encouragement from Carson, who seemed to enjoy the speculation. Soon after the speech, he announced that he was retiring from neurosurgery and hinted that he was considering public office. This May, after two years of contemplation, he declared that he was running. He recalled praying for guidance. “Lord, I don’t want to do this,” he said. “But if you’re going to open the doors I will go through with it.”","1127","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"During a recent appearance at a retirement community in Exeter, New Hampshire, Carson, who is sixty-four, was interrupted by residents making a common complaint: he was speaking too softly. He adjusted the microphone and leaned into it. “I can’t get it any higher,” he said. “It would be in my mouth.” And then he returned to his subject, which was the dire prospect of a country in which citizens were afraid to criticize their government. “Back in Nazi Germany, a lot of those people did not believe in what Hitler was doing,” he said. “They kept their mouths shut and they kept their heads down. And look at what happened.” Carson has an ability—honed, no doubt, during his previous career—to deliver alarming statements in a soothing manner. “Some people say, ‘Oh, nothing like that could ever happen in America,’ ” he said. “I beg to differ.” When he speaks, Carson sometimes blinks slowly, or closes his eyes in thought, and he uttered this last phrase in the same tone of voice that you might use to recount a pleasant dream.","1128","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson announced his candidacy, he was overshadowed by Jeb Bush, who was viewed as the favorite, and then by Donald Trump, whose groundswell began a few weeks later. But Carson kept speaking, quietly. Ryan Rhodes, Carson’s Iowa state director, says that the candidate’s “soft touch” is particularly effective among women voters and Evangelicals. By this fall, national polls showed Carson catching Trump, and even overtaking him. In some ways, this is not a particularly meaningful achievement: national polls, conducted long before the primary season has begun, have little predictive power. (At this point four years ago, Newt Gingrich was the front-runner.) And Carson’s big numbers have had little effect on the skepticism of political experts, who continue to believe that the next President will be a professional politician; Marco Rubio emerged as the betting favorite for the nomination, despite polling about half as well as Carson. Even so, it’s hard to think about the crowded cluster of Republican candidates for President without considering the startling fact that, for months, none were able to command much more support than a former surgeon whose campaign platform is barely more granular than the speech that made him a conservative hero three years ago.","1129","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Like most popular political candidates, Carson promises to deliver his audiences from politics. At campaign rallies, he gets a warm ovation when he inveighs against the nameless forces of division. (“They want Democrats to believe that Republicans are evil,” he says. “Or Republicans to believe that Democrats are evil.”) But that doesn’t make him a moderate. In Exeter, he condemned Planned Parenthood, saying that he would rather direct federal funding to “organizations that don’t engage in killing babies.” A few hours later, at the Durham campus of the University of New Hampshire, he warned about the peril of “global jihadists” and said, “There are many of them, already, within our nation.” That evening, he travelled to a boathouse on Goat Island, off the Portsmouth coast, where a group of local doctors had gathered to slurp milky clam chowder and listen to a former colleague share his belief that physicians should use their “healing instinct” to revive the country. Carson was in his element, joking about the hassles of dunning insurance companies and mentioning, briefly, his interest in trigeminal neuralgia. But even there he stayed on message: when a man in the audience asked about the rising cost of medical school, Carson suggested making colleges pay the interest on student loans, to help keep down tuition, yet firmly rejected the idea of universal government-funded college education. “Anything that we do to add to the debt right now is almost like treason,” he said.","1130","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"During the Obama years, there has been no shortage of conservative leaders eager to squeeze the words “debt” and “treason” into the same sentence. And there are moments when Carson seems almost retro, thrilling audiences with an anti-deficit, anti-Obamacare message that had already started to lose its freshness when he delivered that famous speech. What distinguishes Carson from his Tea Party predecessors is his biography, which also distinguishes him from the rest of the Republican field: he has been telling and retelling his life story for nearly thirty years, hewing to a narrative that emphasizes the Biblical virtues of grace and humility. Other candidates in the race, with the notable exception of Trump, have been reluctant to criticize someone so well loved, perhaps because they don’t view Carson as a long-term threat. In the most recent Republican debate, the other candidates not only refrained from trying to hurt Carson but seemed eager to help him. After he gave a meandering soliloquy in response to a question about banks, Rubio took it upon himself to implement a Troubled Assertion Relief Program, exclaiming, “He’s right on point, there.”","1131","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Journalists haven’t been quite so supportive: BuzzFeed recently posted an old video of Carson suggesting, in defiance of archeological scholarship, that the Egyptian pyramids were actually grain-storage units, built by the Biblical patriarch Joseph. During an excruciating Fox News interview after the Paris attacks, Chris Wallace tried and failed to get Carson to tell him which countries he would recruit to help fight ISIS. (Carson promised to involve “all of the Arab states—and even the non-Arab states.”) Last week, on an Iowa television station, Carson called his foreign-policy education “an ongoing process.” Two days later, he talked about the importance of screening refugees, using an infelicitous analogy: “If there’s a rabid dog running around your neighborhood, you’re probably not going to assume something good about that dog.”","1132","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"At times, the scrutiny has led Carson to engage in atypically peevish exchanges with the media. Williams, his adviser, has been heartened by Carson’s willingness to fight back. “Somebody’s attacking your good name, your word,” he says. “He needs to get emotional. He needs to get fire in his belly.” It would make sense for any other politician to react this way, but Carson’s appeal is based largely on his seeming to be above the fray: a Baptist youth minister in Florida told me that he admired Carson because he was humble, and not “bombastic and adversarial”; a volunteer in Iowa cited his pledge to work for “all the people,” including the ones who wouldn’t vote for him. The most suspenseful thing about his surreal campaign is seeing how long he can stay in the fight without looking too much like a fighter.","1133","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson certainly seemed serene on a recent Tuesday afternoon in Florida, sitting in his temporary living room aboard a chartered bus emblazoned with his face; his head was framed by a backward “D” on the window behind him, the last letter of “BEN CARSON, M.D.” His wife, Candy, emerged from a private room in the back to show Carson a message on her mobile phone, and then disappeared. Carson pointed out that he is used to travelling a lot, and that he has been contending with big crowds for years. “When people would come to the clinic, they always would come with their cameras and their books to be autographed,” he told me. “The magnitude has just increased exponentially.” His campaign has followed an astonishing trajectory, but so has his life; he published his autobiography, “Gifted Hands,” in 1990, and it reads like an extended parable. He writes that his mother, Sonya, was a domestic worker, and sometimes left Ben and his older brother, Curtis, with neighbors while she sought clinical help for “confusion and depression”; his father, an autoworker and part-time preacher, left the family when Carson was eight.","1134","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson was raised in the Seventh-Day Adventist Church—he was baptized at eight and again, for good measure, at twelve—and he has remained a member. His surgical skill seems, in his telling, like a compensatory gift from God: afflicted with poor eyesight, he discovered that he had a knack for spatial visualization, making him well suited to navigate the delicate tangle of a child’s brain. Like many Adventists, Carson is a vegetarian, though he downplays any differences between Adventists and other Christians. Decades ago, in an interview in Vegetarian Times, he expressed certainty that meat eating would fade away by 2010, and that animals would “breathe a sigh of relief.” But, on the bus in Florida, he was eager to explain that his diet is merely a personal choice, and that he has nothing against meat eaters or hunters. He offered a brief explanation of his church’s best-known tenet. “There’s no place in the Bible that says the Sabbath was changed from Saturday to Sunday, so we worship on Saturday, that’s all,” he said. “Does that mean that people who worship on Sunday are evil? No! Of course not.”","1135","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” Carson recalls the two years that he and his brother spent in Boston, living with his mother’s sister: he remembered “winos and drunks,” as well as “squad cars racing up the street.” At the retirement community in Exeter, he added grislier details, saying, “I saw people lying on the street with bullet holes and stab wounds.” The Boston Globe talked to longtime residents of the neighborhoods where Carson lived, who remembered a less menacing atmosphere; one called the claim of bodies in the streets a “vast exaggeration.” Of course, Carson’s exaggeration, if that’s what it is, surely wouldn’t seem so vast if he were not a Presidential candidate; one suspects that few motivational speakers would emerge unscathed from an encounter with a pack of investigative reporters.","1136","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"A number of Carson’s favorite anecdotes seem impervious to research. When he tells his life story, he rarely omits the moment when, at the age of fourteen, he tried to stab another boy with a camping knife; he struck the boy’s belt buckle, the blade “snapped and dropped to the ground,” and Carson retreated to a bathroom, where he begged God to rid him of his violent temper. In Carson’s telling, the prayer worked. “Since that day,” he wrote, “I have never had a problem with my temper.” It says something about Carson’s reputation that reporters have grown suspicious not of his redemption but of his original sin: CNN talked to former friends and classmates and noted, solemnly, that “the violent, impulsive person Carson has described himself as is unrecognizable to them.” Similarly, Carson often talks about a moment of rage when he attacked his mother with a hammer, but, in 1988, the Detroit Free Press published an article in which Carson’s mother recalled the altercation differently. In her version, it was she who wielded the hammer, and might have used it, if Curtis had not intervened.","1137","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The most damaging potential debunking is also the least clear-cut. Carson was part of the R.O.T.C. program in high school, and in “Gifted Hands” he remembers being “offered a full scholarship to West Point.” But, earlier this month, Politico reported that Carson’s campaign had “admitted” that “a central point in his inspirational personal story was fabricated”: he had never applied to West Point, let alone been accepted, and the school does not charge tuition. But Carson had never mentioned applying, and so Politico, under pressure, softened its language, saying only that Carson “conceded that he never applied nor was granted admission.” Since then, the controversy has grown more obscure—it is now an argument over what “offered” means, and whether a West Point representative might have made some encouraging remarks that Carson misinterpreted. In a press conference, he called the reports a “witch hunt.” Raising his voice (possibly for the first time all year), he claimed that Obama had not faced similar scrutiny. “There is a desperation, on behalf of some, to try to find a way to tarnish me,” he said, dejectedly—unlike Trump, Carson takes no visible pleasure in tangling with the media. “It’s just ridiculous!”","1138","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"For Carson, being attacked is a relatively new experience. In the years after “Gifted Hands” was published, he turned his autobiography into an industry. He embarked upon a never-ending speaking tour and founded a charity, the Carson Scholars Fund, which has recognized more than six thousand students for their “academic achievement and humanitarian qualities.” His book spawned nine sequels, and also two documentaries, a cable-television feature film (starring Cuba Gooding, Jr.), and a long-running play in Baltimore, which was often performed for schoolchildren judged to be in need of supplementary edification. The legend of Dr. Carson was ubiquitous in the predominantly African-American schools of Baltimore. (The essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates, who grew up there, wrote, of Carson, “I saw him speak so many times that I began to have that ‘This guy again?’ feeling.”) It was ubiquitous, too, in many churches around the country, where Carson’s story served as proof that faith could conquer all. Many of the people who wait in line to hear his stump speech think of him primarily as a religious figure, which is part of the reason that the media skepticism hasn’t harmed him. Like his policy positions, which are often vague or confusing, the precise details of his biography matter less to voters than the opportunity he offers them to become characters in his uplifting story.","1139","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” politics rarely intrudes. Carson joined his high school R.O.T.C. program in 1967, a few months before the Detroit riots, but the book makes no mention of them, or of the uproar over the Vietnam War, or of Martin Luther King, Jr. (Carson recently told the Wall Street Journal that, during the riots inspired by King’s assassination, he sheltered some white students in the high-school biology lab, although the Journal could not find anyone to corroborate this story.) Carson says that he was brought up to be “a fairly partisan Democrat,” but he evidently wasn’t much interested in activism. He attended Yale during a tumultuous period: in 1970, near the end of his freshman year, the campus was overtaken by protests that accompanied the trials of members of the Black Panther Party, who were accused of murder. (Hillary Clinton, then studying at Yale Law School, served as a liaison to the group that planned the protests.) But his campus life seems to have revolved mainly around Candy, his wife, a fellow-student who was also from Detroit. She is the author of a forthcoming book about their marriage, the co-author of his last three books, the leader of the Carson family string quartet (they have three grown sons, who fill out the lineup), and, he often says, the only woman he has ever been with. One of the black student leaders in those days at Yale, Kurt Schmoke, says that Carson was not among the rabble-rousers. “The Ben Carson I knew in college was a very studious person—focussed like a laser beam on going to medical school,” he says.","1140","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson got his medical degree from the University of Michigan and, in 1977, arrived at Johns Hopkins, where he became known as a precise but imaginative surgeon. Readers who have heard about his life-saving feats might be surprised to learn, in “Gifted Hands,” how many of his best-known surgeries ended in disaster, or in a more equivocal result. Benjamin and Patrick Binder, the German twins who played such a large role in Carson’s career, were seven months old when the operation took place: Carson and his team had to temporarily induce hypothermic arrest so that they could disentangle the interlaced blood vessels before the babies bled out. Both survived the operation, but they suffered brain damage, and one has since died. One of the things Carson learned is how not to become paralyzed by self-doubt. He likes to say that he has performed fifteen thousand surgeries, which would mean an average of more than one a day, for more than three decades.","1141","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In Baltimore, Carson was a friend and ally of Schmoke, the former student leader, who transformed his activism into a career in elected politics: from 1987 until 1999, he served as the Democratic mayor of Baltimore, and he and Carson often talked about ways to support young people in the city. At one point, when a Democratic gubernatorial candidate sought Carson’s endorsement, Schmoke urged him to decline, so as not to damage his spotless reputation. “I guess I thought that his story was above partisan politics,” Schmoke says now, chuckling. Back then, Carson liked being politically uncategorizable. In his book “The Big Picture,” published in 1999, he noted with satisfaction that he had once heard hosts on a radio show arguing over whether or not he supported Louis Farrakhan’s Million Man March. Carson conspicuously declined to settle the question. Elsewhere in the book, he preëmptively defended himself against the suggestion that he was a conservative Republican. “I’m not,” he wrote, adding that he would accept no political label more restrictive than “independent.”","1142","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Schmoke remembers the day, some years ago, when Carson casually mentioned that he was skeptical of the scientific consensus on evolution. Schmoke thought he was joking, but Carson made clear that he wasn’t. “I said to myself, ‘Gosh, there must be a lot of things that Ben believes that I’ve never talked to him about,’ ” Schmoke recalls. Carson now says that his political outlook began to shift in the nineteen-eighties, when he found himself captivated by President Reagan’s message of “self-empowerment.” That became Carson’s message, too, although for many years he delivered it in nonpolitical terms. “Gifted Hands” begins with a letter from Carson’s mother, who reprises one of her favorite phrases: “If you don’t succeed, you have only yourself to blame.” In one passage, Carson declares that it is time for “minorities” to “stand on our own feet and refuse to look to anybody else to save us.” But later, in a discussion of “disadvantaged kids,” he suggests that there is “a system precluding these people from achieving.” Of course, self-help and systemic change need not be mutually exclusive. And, anyway, as a surgeon and motivational speaker Carson didn’t have to choose.","1143","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson registered as a Republican only a year ago, as he considered running for President. By all accounts, it was the battle over health care that pushed him to finally embrace a political party. In 2004, President George W. Bush appointed Carson to his Council on Bioethics, and Carson began thinking more seriously about how the federal government might rein in the insurance industry, which seemed to him to consume too much of the nation’s medical spending. At a town-hall meeting in 2005, organized by the Congressional Black Caucus, he suggested a health-care system modelled on “something that already works”: the food-stamp program. (He liked the idea that recipients could shop for medical care, just as food-stamp recipients shop for groceries.) Two years later, at a council meeting, Carson suggested that, if insurance could be made more affordable, universal coverage could be achieved by fiat. He said, “There is where the government perhaps comes in and makes it mandatory, just like it’s mandatory for you to have automobile insurance.”","1144","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"These ideas don’t seem radically at odds with the reform bill that President Obama eventually passed. But as the debate over the Affordable Care Act began, in 2009, Carson was dismayed to find himself shut out of the process: Obama disbanded Bush’s Council on Bioethics, and Carson tried in vain to secure a Presidential meeting. “It left him very disappointed, and devastated,” Williams says. The 2013 Prayer Breakfast speech was an expression of frustration, and also a final attempt to get through to a President who seemed intent on ignoring Carson’s expertise. On the campaign trail, Carson rarely fails to mention his idea for “health savings accounts,” which would be personal and shareable: family members could contribute to each other’s medical bills, and seniors might pass on leftover funds to their descendants. He hasn’t fully explained how these accounts would be set up, or what would happen to patients who depleted theirs. Even more than the competition, he is devout in his belief that systemic problems can be solved by topical applications of common sense.","1145","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"By the time Carson launched his campaign, he had completed his evolution from Democrat to independent to eager exponent of movement conservatism. He evinced a newfound passion for gun rights. And although the Adventist Church suggests that in some “exceptional circumstances” a woman might justifiably choose to terminate a pregnancy, Carson is now “unabashedly and entirely pro-life.” Like any successful speaker, Carson knows how to read a room, and he admits that his transformation has been aided by his recent immersion in politics, and by the receptive audience that he has found among conservatives. He has emerged, for instance, as an advocate of tightened immigration laws, arguing that children born in the U.S. to unauthorized immigrants shouldn’t be given citizenship. “In talking to a lot of Americans, I realized how strongly they feel about people who come here illegally, and I think that probably has influenced me,” he says. “Because if you want to be a representative of the people, in a republic-type government, then obviously you have to represent what they feel.”","1146","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson’s bus arrives at an event, his supporters often break into applause, although some find other ways to express themselves. In Waterloo, Iowa, a woman hopped in place, in anticipation of being in his presence; more than one fan, after shaking his hand, bent over and wept. In Florida, the crowds included eager teen-agers and shuffling seniors but only a small number of African-Americans. Carson occasionally acknowledges that his ideological journey has put him at odds with black voters, who play a vanishingly small role in the modern Republican Party. On the bus, which was trundling from his hotel, in Clearwater, to a Barnes & Noble in Tampa, Carson thought about how, exactly, Democrats manage to win so many African-American votes. “Don’t you think Lyndon Johnson had it right?” he said. “I’m sure you’ve heard his quote where he said, ‘Give those N-words a few goodies and we’ll have their vote for the next two hundred years.’ ” The quote comes, lightly paraphrased, from a book by Ronald Kessler, who attributes it to a former Air Force One steward, who said that he overheard a conversation between Johnson and “two governors.” The line is meant to illuminate the cynicism of Democratic politicians, although, by crediting it, Carson can’t help but belittle the intelligence of African-American voters, too. This tactic is common in politics, where leaders often devise patronizing explanations for the otherwise unaccountable fact that people sometimes vote for their opponents. (Think of Obama’s claim, during the 2008 campaign, that inhabitants of depressed towns “cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them.”) But the notion of black voters as dupes for white politicians has a particularly nettlesome history in the U.S., stretching back to Reconstruction; nowadays, some Republican politicians prefer to simply say, instead, that their party needs to get better at reaching out.","1147","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Because Carson is African-American, he need not be so circumspect—one of his advantages is his willingness to talk about race in language that his rivals would be wise to avoid. He has called Obamacare “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,” and has said, of abortion, “I think it’s a moral issue—just like slavery was a moral issue.” While blasting Planned Parenthood, he asserted that its founder, Margaret Sanger, “believed that people like me should be eliminated or kept under control.” (Sanger did suggest preventing “feeble-minded” people from having children, but there is no evidence that she supported sterilization on the basis of race.) Some of his gentler formulations, too, convey a coded racial appeal: Carson often excites largely white audiences by sketching a vision of racial harmony, just as Obama once did. When he tells crowds that “our unity is what provides our strength,” he could be echoing Obama’s famous claim, from the 2004 speech that made him a national figure, that “there’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America.”","1148","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Some of Carson’s biggest supporters see race as an important part of his appeal. Unlike Obama—and, for that matter, Herman Cain, the African-American businessman who briefly captivated Republican voters during the 2012 campaign—Carson entered this race as a figure well known and widely admired in African-American communities. John Philip Sousa IV, the leader of an unaffiliated pro-Carson political-action committee, is the author of “Ben Carson: Rx for America,” a slim paperback that is given out free at Carson events. (The front cover announces, “Over 1,000,000 in Print!”) Sousa, a great-grandson of the composer, argues that Carson could attract a significant minority of the African-American vote, enough to make a Democratic victory mathematically impossible; a Carson Presidency, he argues, would “forever destroy” the “false narrative that conservatives and Republicans are racists.”","1149","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"There is something paradoxical about Sousa’s argument, which urges Republican voters to agree that race matters in order to demonstrate that it really doesn’t. As Carson’s audience has changed, he has modified how he talks about race, in ways that make him more acceptable to the party he recently joined. Writing in 1999, he affirmed his belief that “our justice system metes out different treatment to blacks and whites,” and declared that police in a Detroit suburb had recently arrested his mother and impounded her car, because she matched the description of a suspect. Now he suggests that African-American frustration with the criminal justice system is misdirected. “I just don’t agree that that’s where the emphasis needs to be,” he says.","1150","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"At times, there are signs of tension between Carson’s old life, as a community-minded motivator, and his new life, as a Republican favorite. During one recent appearance, his customary reminiscences of boyhood gave way to a memorable digression about the joys of throwing rocks at cars. “Everybody did it, because it was so much fun,” he said, and he chuckled at the thought of police officers scrambling to catch him and his friends. “Of course, that was back in the days before they would shoot you,” he said. He stopped himself. “I’m just kidding,” he said, adding that he had “a tremendous amount of respect for the police.” He paused to accept the crowd’s applause, and, back on safe ground, added that the police were “the very last people that we should be targeting.”","1151","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson mentions racial uplift, he often adds a quick disclaimer, noting that his policies are meant “not only for African-Americans but for everybody.” Sitting on the bus, though, he advocated a kind of economic separatism. “If we would learn how to turn our dollars over in our own community, two or three times, before you send it out—that’s how you generate wealth,” he told me. “That’s how the Jews did it. That’s how the Koreans did it.” Half a century earlier, Malcolm X made a strikingly similar argument, saying, “If we try and establish some industry in our own community, then we’re developing to the position where we are creating employment for our own kind.” Of course, Malcolm X’s entreaty was accompanied by a caustic corollary that probably would not impress the Republican electorate. “Once you gain control of the economy of your own community,” he added, “then you don’t have to picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for a job in his business.”","1152","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"If Carson has a specific pitch to African-American voters, it is indistinguishable from his general economic pitch. He wants to lower taxes for everyone in order to spur economic activity and raise interest rates, so that poor and middle-class families can earn more interest in their savings accounts. And he wants to allow corporations to repatriate overseas money, tax free, if they use ten per cent of it to “create jobs for unemployed people and people on welfare.” His campaign’s outreach to African-Americans has consisted largely of a radio advertisement featuring a hip-hop track that not even Carson seemed to enjoy. (“I probably would have taken a little different approach,” he said after it was released.) Maybe it doesn’t much matter, given the racially polarized state of American politics. Florida, for instance, is about seventeen per cent African-American, but exit polls conducted there in 2012 suggest that only about one in a hundred Mitt Romney voters was African-American. Sometime in the future, black voters might help Republicans win the Presidency. But in this cycle it’s highly doubtful that they will help a Republican win the nomination.","1153","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Earlier this fall, Carson startled the press corps—and some of his own advisers—by cutting back on his campaign schedule so that he could promote his latest book, “A More Perfect Union,” in which his political platform takes the form of a constitutional exegesis. (Carson’s ten books all cover pretty much the same territory, and so some conceptual ingenuity is required to keep his bibliography growing.) The plan, which Carson explained by saying that he wanted to fulfill his obligations to his publisher, puzzled many observers; National Review posted a blog item under the headline “this isn’t normal.” And yet the book tour helped him—or, at any rate, didn’t hurt. During October, when he was mainly off the campaign trail, his popularity increased. National polls showed him in a virtual tie for first place, with Trump; in Iowa polls, for the first time, he was the front-runner. At book signings, hundreds and even thousands of fans lined up to buy a copy of “A More Perfect Union,” have it signed, and maybe get a quick handshake. Carson apparently hasn’t lost his surgical dexterity, because often he executed the handshake while holding an uncapped Sharpie in the same hand. At a Books-A-Million in Kissimmee, Florida, employees made sure that customers didn’t linger for more than a few seconds, but one man brought the line to a halt. Bob Santos, a fellow-Adventist who had first heard about Carson through his church, had spent more than five hundred dollars on a basketful of Carson books, which he planned to distribute to friends and relatives. Once Carson had worked his way through the basket, Santos seemed exhilarated, even though he hadn’t quite got everything he wanted. “I thought he was going to personalize one of them,” Santos said. “He said he can’t.”","1154","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Before Carson’s Presidential campaign was a campaign, it was a business—one largely independent of Carson himself. The Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision allows political-action committees to be more or less unregulated, so long as they don’t coördinate their activities with official campaigns. In December, 2013, Carson told potential supporters that none of the groups soliciting on his behalf had his blessing, but the pro-Carson groups didn’t need it. They kept making money and plowing it back into fund-raising, creating a virtuous and potentially lucrative cycle. The following year, as the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee—run by Sousa and Vernon Robinson, a political entrepreneur—was raising millions, Armstrong Williams suggested that the organization was dishonest. “People giving money think it’s going to Dr. Carson, and it’s not,” he said, adding, “I don’t like misleading people.”","1155","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Once Carson announced his candidacy—yielding, he said, to the people who had been “clamoring” for him to run—he had to make peace with the Carson industry. Williams now believes that the unaffiliated PACs are “not as exploitative” as he had thought, and concedes that they have played an important role in boosting Carson. Williams says that he is careful not to communicate with the Super PACs. (He suffered a scandal of his own, a decade ago: he was working as a syndicated columnist, and it was revealed that the Bush Administration had paid him to promote its No Child Left Behind Act.) This must require special vigilance, because his brother, Alvin Williams, runs Black America’s Political Action Committee, which solicits donations in order to “push Dr. Carson to victory.”","1156","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The official campaign has proved adept at fund-raising, too, using expensive telephone and direct-mail solicitations to reach small donors. Last month, the Federal Election Commission reported that Carson’s campaign had raised nearly twenty million dollars from donors who had given two hundred dollars or less—vastly more than any other Republican. Bush, Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Chris Christie have all attracted much more Super-PAC money than Carson, while Trump has attracted about as much as he seems to need, which is none. But, if individual donations were votes, Carson would be the people’s choice.","1157","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"This is partly a matter of strategy: Carson’s campaign devotes an unusually large portion of its spending—more than fifty per cent—to fund-raising. It is also a result of Carson’s status as a kind of conservative eminence, the kind of figure who makes people excited to put a check in the mail. At the Barnes & Noble in Tampa, Sousa’s Super pac was outside in the parking lot, selling T-shirts and giving away copies of his book. An independent vender was there, too, hawking buttons. One showed Carson with hands clasped in prayer; another said, “Vote Republican—we can’t ALL be on welfare!” An elderly man wandered through the store, gawking at the line of customers that snaked around the bookcases and outside into the muggy afternoon sun. “Is Ben Carson here?” he asked a store manager. “I’ll probably vote for him—but I hate those annoying phone calls.”","1158","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson’s determination to do right by his publisher, Penguin, has fuelled speculation that he is more interested in making money than in becoming President. Indeed, Carson seems as proud of his business acumen as of his surgical skill—he often reminds voters that he has served on the board of both Kellogg and Costco, and promises to reinvigorate government by bringing in people he knows from “the business world.” One of Carson’s connections has caused him some trouble during the campaign: Mannatech, a multilevel-marketing company that sells nutritional supplements it calls “glyconutrients.” In 2009, the company agreed to pay six million dollars to settle a suit, brought by the Texas attorney general, which accused it of claiming that its products “cured, treated, or mitigated” a list of ailments that included cancer, autism, asthma, toxic-shock syndrome, and attention-deficit disorder. Carson has given speeches at Mannatech events, and he appeared in a regional public-television program about brain health, sponsored by Mannatech distributors, in which he stressed the importance of glyconutrients. When I asked about Mannatech, he said the company had behaved in a way that was “a little bit dishonest,” by uploading a promotional video he appeared in that was supposed to be available only to sales associates. But even now, when discussing the company’s product, Carson can’t help but offer a sales pitch. “I use it every day,” he told me. “Since I’ve been taking it, the incidence of me getting sick has dramatically declined.”","1159","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Many of Carson’s supporters are true believers: they earnestly explain how he and no other candidate could pull the country together. It can be harder to detect what Carson himself wants. Throughout the campaign, he has shown relatively little interest in the specifics of policy. His tax plan is more like a statement of general principles—he wants everyone to pay the same rate, but he hasn’t specified what that rate would be. And his foreign policy can seem like one long improvisation. During a recent debate, he responded to a question about Syria and Afghanistan with a confusing claim that “the Chinese” were active in the region; in the days afterward, the campaign clarified that Carson hadn’t meant to suggest that Chinese troops were present in Syria. At times like this, Carson’s insistence that he is a reluctant candidate can seem all too convincing—a few months before he officially announced, he told a medical journal, possibly in jest, that he would be relieved if he didn’t win. Williams remembers Carson saying, of the people urging him to run, “Maybe they see something in me that I don’t see.”","1160","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Most Republican strategists maintain that voters will eventually settle on a more conventional choice, chastened by the prospect of President Carson or, more likely, of another President Clinton. But the rise of unaccountable PACs has weakened the party élites, which means that no one seems to have the credibility to tell the Republican base that nominating Carson might be a bad idea. The increasing messiness of the modern political primary has been, so far, a Republican story; this is in large part an accident of history. In Obama, the Democrats have had a leader who inspires loyalty. But in the next election cycle, or the one after it, the Democratic Party, too, may confront a base of voters eager for a candidate who has as little affection for politics as they do. Perhaps sober, élite-approved Presidential candidates, seasoned by decades of political experience, will come to seem as old-fashioned as network news anchors, and for some of the same reasons.","1161","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson is, even more than Trump, the ultimate 2016 outsider. In the years since the Prayer Breakfast, he has often played the role of soft-spoken firebrand, standing up for the core principles of conservatism. But one sometimes gets the sense that his ideological conversion is incomplete. The Club for Growth, a small-government think tank, often criticizes the timorousness of the Republican establishment, and it has been critical, too, of this year’s insurgents. The group’s Super PAC spent half a million dollars on a television ad to tell Iowa voters that Trump “supports higher taxes.” (The claim relied heavily on a Trump tax proposal from 1999; the Trump campaign responded with a cease-and-desist letter.) David McIntosh, the group’s president, says that he was alarmed by Carson’s suggestion, in a 2012 book, that it was possible to “extract socialism’s positive aspects and actually implement them within capitalism.” (Carson was referring to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps.) McIntosh is not reassured by Carson’s frequent paeans to liberty. “In the Republican primary, ‘free market’ and ‘less government’ are the buzzwords,” he says. “I think he may be using those, but they don’t really reflect a well-thought-out philosophy of the role of government.” The group says it is “unable to conclude that Ben Carson would be a pro-growth president,” but its Super pac has not spent money attacking him, because it does not view him as a serious threat. “As he gets closer to the election,” McIntosh says, “people will say, ‘I’m not sure he’s ready, yet, to be President.’ ”","1162","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson believes that readiness is overrated. “There’s no one person who knows everything,” he says, and he is confident in his ability to learn as he goes. But his struggles with difficult questions about governance have made that confidence harder to credit. There are signs that his popularity in Iowa is beginning to ebb—some polls suggest that Trump has regained a narrow lead there. Carson became a front-runner by deploying his motivational skills on his own behalf: he inspired Republican voters to believe that they could have any kind of President they wanted and that they did not need to settle for a mere politician. Now some of them may be realizing that there is no alternative to politics—no way for a retired neurosurgeon to become a Presidential candidate without becoming a politician, too.","1163","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” Carson admitted, “I don’t handle failure well,” although he added a humblebragging clarification: “I guess the Lord knows that, so He keeps it from happening to me often.” It’s not clear that he would regard an inability to win the Presidency as a failure. If the media interrogations grow too withering, or the polls too discouraging, Carson might happily return to a new version of his old life, talking and speaking a bit more about his journey out of Detroit, and a bit less about tax rates or military movements in Syria. In the meantime, he is enjoying the crowds and the adulation. At a recent book event in Lakeland, Florida, fans filled the parking lot, and a book-tour staffer climbed onto Carson’s tour bus to photograph the scene. A small media pen had been set up near the portable lectern where Carson was signing books, and he strolled over to take questions. One reporter wanted to know how he had been preparing for the next debate. “By listening to your questions,” Carson said.","1164","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"

"There are theories, out there, that the pyramids of Egypt are really giant batteries, or even electric generators. Think about it: their granite blocks were originally encased in limestone, almost as if they had been insulated, as a power conductor is, with rubber. They once had golden capstones, a bit like the copper-tops on Duracells. All that granite piled up creates a magnetic field or a radioactive one, depending on which engineering schematics one favors—this reading of the pyramids takes a number of forms—and has a profound effect on negative ions. The King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid contains what may look like a sepulchre but is really where all the gold wiring that ran through the pyramid met—a pharaonic circuit board. The pyramid is a cross between the Tower of Babel and the Tesla Tower: a massive source of wireless power, which explains why the torches that figures carry in Egyptian wall paintings aren’t plugged into anything. Delve too deeply, and the question seems less whether the pyramids are big and intricate machines built by ordinary hardworking Egyptians than whether they were built (perhaps, originally, upside down) by extraterrestrials, who might someday return to activate their force fields or laser beams. But that might be a bit much, as Ben Carson, who is running for President, would be the first to tell you.","November 5, 2015","1178","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"“Various scientists have said, ‘Well, you know there were alien beings that came down and they have special knowledge and that’s how they were,” Carson said, at a graduation speech at Andrews University, in 1998. (BuzzFeed found the video.) “You know, it doesn’t require an alien being when God is with you.” The explanation for the pyramids was not only divine but laid out in one of the best-known Bible stories, which tells how Joseph, after his brothers had sold him into slavery in Egypt, had interpreted a dream of the Pharaoh’s to mean that Egypt would have seven fat years followed by seven years of famine. The Pharaoh then assigned him to do some emergency planning. (Genesis 41: “Lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.”) “My own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain. Now all the archeologists”—here, Carson waves his hand dismissively—“think that they were made for the pharaohs’ graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big if you stop and think about it. And I don’t think it’d just disappear over the course of time, to store that much grain.” Carson had his own take on the engineering: “When you look at the way that the pyramids are made, with many chambers that are hermetically sealed, they’d have to be that way for a reason.” The King’s Chamber, as he saw it, was not an instrument panel or a power substation, but a big Tupperware container.","1179","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"“It’s still my belief, yes,” Carson said, on Wednesday, when CBS News asked him if he still held to this theory. Then, with an almost pitying smile, Carson explained again, as if to a child, that “the pyramids were made in a way that they had hermetically sealed compartments. You wouldn’t need hermetically sealed compartments for a sepulchre. You would need that if you were trying to preserve grain for a long period of time.”","1180","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"“That was a strange deal,” Donald Trump said, when asked about Carson and the pyramids. This time, the Donald is right. There are problems with Carson’s theory. For one thing, there is very good archeological and historical evidence that the pyramids were built as monumental tombs with a religious function; they were first built among complexes of tombs. There is also pretty good evidence of an extensive network of granaries, often associated with local temples. It’s odd that Carson, a critic of big government, would assume that the only way to manage the storage job was with a giant four-faced bubble—but since the pyramids are not actually hollow, and don’t have all that much storage space relative to their size, perhaps they would be an example of statist inefficiency. (Putting aside the question of whether those chambers were ever “hermetically” sealed, the dry climate of Egypt did mean that such sealing would not have been necessary.) A pyramid also takes longer than seven years to build. Also, the pyramid-building dynasties—the Third Dynasty (c. 2700–2600 B.C.), with its step-pyramids, and the Fourth Dynasty (c. 2600–2500 B.C.), with the great pyramids at Giza—do not match many of the guesses for when a historical Joseph might have lived, which range to the Eighteenth Dynasty. The counter-argument to that might be that, since we know almost nothing about Joseph, we might as well place him anywhere. Why not treat all of Egyptian and Biblical history as collapsible, and shuffle their incidents and artifacts as much as we like, under the general rubric of ancientness?","1181","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"There are mysteries about the pyramids—they were built, after all, nearly five thousand years ago—and we don’t know everything about how workers (free or not) were deployed, or what the geometry of the layout symbolized. Archeologists and engineers are still learning things from, for example, the found remnants of nearby construction camps. But that sort of study is not Carson’s project. In the 1998 commencement address, he moved quickly from the pyramids to doubts about the Big Bang theory, saying, “That’s the wonderful thing about having a relationship with God. You know, God has already told us what happened, so we don’t have to come up with fanciful theories about things.”","1182","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"When Carson speaks about pyramids, he does so with the same pretense of practicality that he brings to many topics. He is a doctor, and a bearer of knowledge, including the news that the standard stories Americans are told, whether about economics, history, or science, don’t add up. Joseph was a better model, a slave who “ended up as the Prime Minister of the most powerful nation in the world at the time”; because he persisted and listened to God, he “was basically able to save the entire world with his big thinking.” Does Carson think that there is someone else who might do that? (It might interest him that the historical figure actually credited with managing the work on the earliest pyramids, a civil servant named Imhotep, was also thought to be a medical doctor.)","1183","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"Thursday, the day after his CBS News interview, was a busy one for Carson, who is leading or close to Donald Trump in many polls—between them, they’ve got half of the Republican-primary electorate covered. His campaign released a radio ad with a rap beat (“Go and support Ben Car-son/For our next President and be awe-some”) and was working to counter a CNN report that suggested that, despite what Carson wrote in his autobiography, he might not have been a violent teen-ager who once almost killed his friend. It seems strange for a candidate to be offended by the idea that he had actually been a nice kid—Romney had to answer to the opposite charge—and a little like being puzzled that an ancient torch has no wires attached. But, in the context of this campaign, in which Carson has made a point of how God changed his character, there is a rationale for both the exposé and for his response. The whole business stopped making sense some time ago. A certain number of Republicans turned to Carson because the other candidates seemed even less plausible to them. As the granary theory is to the idea of the pyramids as a giant battery or the work of alien architects, so is Carson to Trump—although, some days, it seems like the other way around.","1184","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"

"Republican candidates for President seem unable to shake the habit of making wildly reckless comments about science and public health. Michele Bachmann remains responsible for perhaps the most remarkable of these statements, when, in opposition to all known facts, she told Fox News, after a 2011 debate, about a girl who had “suffered mental retardation” as a result of receiving the HPV vaccine. Last week, though, Donald Trump solidified his place in the circle of scientific ignorance when he drew his own connection between vaccines and autism. “We’ve had so many instances, people that work for me,” he said, and described a “beautiful child” who, according to Trump, had recently been vaccinated, fallen ill, and “now is autistic.” Trump claimed that if vaccines were spread out, “I think you’re going to see a big impact on autism.” Trump has repeatedly expressed his view that vaccines cause autism. In 2012, he tweeted that “massive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for big increase in autism.”","September 22, 2015","1194","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"I have written many times that possible links between vaccinations and autism have been researched widely and have never been found to exist, and that words like Trump’s are dangerous—and even deadly. And I am far from alone. The comments came at a particularly bad time, because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had just begun its annual attempt to convince Americans to get flu vaccines, which, while not always perfectly effective, are safe and far better for both individual and public health than not getting vaccinated. (It has always been hard to know precisely how many people die of the flu in this country each year, but the number is in the thousands.) Federal officials say that this year’s vaccine is almost certainly going to be more effective than last year’s. But, thanks to our nationally televised lunacy, the job of convincing people to get them just got harder.","1195","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"Trump is terrifyingly popular, but we have come to expect dangerous inanities from him. Ben Carson, however, is another story.

"Carson’s first comment on the subject made him sound like a responsible, educated physician: “There have been numerous studies and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism.” One cheer. Then things went south: “Vaccines are very important, certain ones—the ones that would prevent death or crippling,” he said. “There are others, a multitude of vaccines, which probably don’t fit in that category, and there should be some discretion in those cases.” And: “A lot of this is … is … is pushed by big government.”","1197","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"What on earth was he talking about? Today, the C.D.C. advises that American children be vaccinated for fourteen diseases before age six—and each of those diseases can, in Carson’s infelicitous words, cause “death or crippling.” “The only one you could reasonably say does not kill is mumps,” Paul Offit, a physician in the division of infectious diseases at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told the Times last week. Offit, who is among the nation’s most outspoken vaccine advocates, added that mumps can, however, cause permanent deafness and sterility in men after puberty. “Tetanus kills, rubella kills unborn children, measles kills, hepatitis B virus kills,” Offit said.","1198","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"But Carson was just warming up, because what he said later was even worse: “It is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time.” With that, Carson added his voice to the rallying cry of “too many too soon,” uttered reflexively by the anti-vaccine crowd. This notion, that the vaccine schedule for children has become so crowded that it puts extra pressure on their immune systems, is immensely popular among American parents—and, increasingly, pediatricians are yielding to their requests to delay vaccines.","1199","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"This, too, is dangerous. As Tara Haelle pointed out in a particularly useful post at Forbes.com, delaying vaccines just prolongs a child’s risk for preventable diseases. The data could not be clearer. And, despite the increase in scheduled vaccines, children are exposed to far fewer antigens than ever before. As many people (including me) have written, the smallpox vaccine—which we stopped administering after the disease was eradicated, in the nineteen-seventies—contained two hundred proteins. When counted all together, the fourteen vaccines that children receive today contain no more than a hundred and fifty.","1200","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"The only other trained medical professional on the stage also failed his biology (and public-service) tests last week. Rand Paul, an ophthalmologist, said, “I’m all for vaccines. But I’m also for freedom.” He seemed to care more about repeating that political conceit than about the lives of his constituents.

"The Republican Party has long exercised a veto on any meaningful addition to the gun laws. And among its current crop of Presidential candidates, there is no sign of anybody breaking ranks. Reaction to the shooting ranged from nonexistent to predictably depressing. As far as I could see, Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina, the third- and fourth-place candidates in the polls, didn’t say anything on Thursday about what had happened in Oregon. In a message on Twitter, Jeb Bush called the massacre a “senseless tragedy.” Donald Trump, in an interview with the Washington Post, referred to it as a “terrible tragedy.” He also said, “It sounds like another mental-health problem. So many of these people, they’re coming out of the woodwork.” Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, took a similar line. “Obviously, there are those who are going to be calling for gun control,” he said on “The Hugh Hewitt Show.” “Obviously, that’s not the issue. The issue is the mentality of these people.”","1236","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"That is a familiar trope, of course: it’s not the guns that are the problem, it’s the shooters. There was no suggestion from anybody on the Republican side that what had happened might justify a reconsideration of gun laws, let alone a significant recasting of them. Even those G.O.P. candidates who have previously expressed support for some forms of gun control, such as Chris Christie and George Pataki, didn’t have anything to say on that subject.","1237","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The Democratic candidates, by contrast, were united in calling for action. Speaking to reporters in Massachusetts, Hillary Clinton said, “We have got to get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe.” She suggested that it wasn’t a hopeless task: “I know there is a way to have sensible gun-control measures that help prevent violence, prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands, and save lives. And I am committed to doing everything I can to achieve that.” Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, said in a tweet, “Tweets won’t stop this. Thoughts and prayers won’t either. Only real gun reforms will stop mass shootings from occurring nearly every day.” Bernie Sanders, who has been accused by Clinton allies of shifting his positions on gun control, called for “sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them.”","1238","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"But Democrats aren’t entirely blameless. After experiencing a political backlash during the nineteen-nineties, when the Clinton Administration pushed through gun-control measures that included a ban on assault weapons, too many members of the Party adopted a craven approach as, during the Bush years, Republicans in Congress rolled back some of the reforms. Even President Obama, who urged for stricter gun control during his 2008 campaign, can’t entirely escape criticism. During his first term, when for two years the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, his Administration didn’t propose any actual gun-control legislation. It wasn’t until 2013, after the massacre in Newtown, that the White House made a serious effort to persuade Congress to act—one that failed in the face of implacable Republican opposition.","1239","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"

But it is also true, as Obama pointed out, that “this is not something I can do by myself.” To break through the politics of hopelessness, it will evidently take something more than blood—the blood of women, men, children, teachers, pastors, janitors, pensioners, first responders, anybody who happens to be in the way—being shed. “I hope and pray that I don’t have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances,” Obama said. “But based on my experience as President, I can’t guarantee that.”","1241","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Fifteen years ago, as Philip Roth was reading the galleys of a memoir by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., he came to a passage about the political fevers of 1939-40, when reactionaries like Father Charles Coughlin, Henry Ford, and Charles Lindbergh brandished the twin banners of nativism and isolation. Moderate Republicans, including Wendell Willkie, a corporate lawyer who eventually won the Party’s Presidential nomination, were never likely to topple F.D.R., and some Party grandees wanted Lindbergh to run. Lindbergh was known by then not only as the daring aviator who crossed the Atlantic in the Spirit of St. Louis but also as a bigot so vile that F.D.R., upon reading one of his speeches, remarked that “it could not have been better put if it had been written by Goebbels himself.”","1242","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Next to a passage where Schlesinger raised the question of whether Republicans would put Lindbergh forward at the head of a new Know-Nothing Party, Roth wrote, “What if they had?” That marginal note became the germ for “The Plot Against America,” a counter-factual novel in which Lindbergh is elected President. “Fear presides over these memories,” Roth’s novel begins, “perpetual fear.” Anyone who dares to look past the comedy of Donald Trump’s surreal tweets and Ben Carson’s end-times ruminations will notice that the politics of perpetual fear is, in our times, the stuff of nonfiction.","1243","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Last week, the Democrats held their first debate, a five-candidate affair in Las Vegas—an unlikely place to hear denunciations of “the casino-capitalist process.” Still, it was a relatively civil and sober discussion compared with the Republican rodeos. After a year of floundering, Hillary Clinton, cool, well-schooled, forensically skilled, had her best hours as a candidate. Her performance provided relief for her supporters and a potential lure for the undecided. She was, contrary to previous reports, conspicuously human-seeming—funny, passionate, even, at times, rueful of past mistakes—a development that might have robbed her potential rival, Vice-President Joe Biden, of the rationale he needed to make a run. Bernie Sanders, the seventy-four-year-old junior senator from Vermont and unapologetic democratic socialist, spoke in a voice that suggested Larry David, on “Seinfeld,” imitating George Steinbrenner. And yet although Clinton handily won the debate, Sanders largely set the terms, pushing her toward a more full-throated progressive view of income inequality and other issues. (From offstage, the Black Lives Matter movement had an equally serious influence on the discussion of race.)","1244","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Sanders also paused for an act of clever generosity, declaring, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails!” Beaming and extending her hand, Clinton thanked him but did not reciprocate the kindness, swatting him on his weak record on gun control, citing his multiple votes against the Brady bill. And while Clinton totted up her own list of Scandinavian-style domestic goals, such as paid parental leave, she raised a brow at Sanders when he talked of “revolution” and the systemic rot of late capitalism. In case we hadn’t figured it out, Hillary Clinton wants to win.","1245","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"History may look back on the Las Vegas debate as the event that elevated Clinton the way that Barack Obama’s eloquent victory speech after the Iowa caucuses elevated him, nearly eight years ago. It might even be regarded as the moment when she boxed out Biden, raked away the underbrush of Mssrs. Chafee, Webb, and O’Malley, and made Sanders look less like a plausible contender than like a protest candidate who forced his opponent to grapple with a political system poisoned by the outsized influence of an American oligarchy comprising, as the Times has reported, a hundred and fifty-eight families.","1246","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"One debate will not erase all of what many voters see as Clinton’s complications: the lingering perception of her sense of moneyed entitlement, her lawyerly slipperiness under questioning, the walled garden of her political circle, her interventionist reflexes, her belatedness on gay marriage, comprehensive immigration, and Wall Street reforms. But if Clinton was not flawless she and her debating partners managed one distinct achievement: they accentuated the chaos, the intellectual barrenness, and the general collapse of their rivals in the Republican Party.","1247","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Consider the political spectacle on Capitol Hill, in which Speaker John Boehner, hardly a Rockefeller Republican, could no longer deal with his caucus and, with little more than a chorus of “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah,” announced his early retirement. Members of the caucus stepped forward to admit that the hearings on Benghazi were aimed less at uncovering the truth than at burying Hillary Clinton. An ambitious Party loyalist, Paul Ryan, is reluctant to run for Boehner’s chair because the House Republicans are the new Wild Bunch and, as a friend of Ryan’s put it to Politico, “he’s not a f—ing moron.”","1248","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Consider, too, the G.O.P. candidates for the White House. Donald Trump and Ben Carson, the only Republicans polling in double digits, daily clear their throats with that ritual preface of modern self-satisfaction—“I am not politically correct”—and then unleash statements, positions, and postures so willfully detached from fact that they embarrass the political culture that harbors them. Trump is willing to say anything—anything racist, anything false, anything “funny”—to terrify voters, or rile them, or amuse them, depending on the moment. The worst of his demagogic arousals are reminiscent of Lindbergh’s speeches at America First rallies and his fear, as he wrote in Reader’s Digest, of a “pressing sea of Yellow, Black and Brown.” Carson, who seems as historically confused as he is surgically skilled, has said that Obamacare is worse than 9/11, “because 9/11 is an isolated incident.” What’s more, the two men’s rivals either fall into line or lack the persuasive powers and the courage to marginalize candidates they know to be dangerous.","1249","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"In electoral terms, Democrats had to view the week’s events with confidence. But there is pathos and foreboding here for the republic. In the debate, Clinton was clear who her enemies were: “the Republicans.” Reports of the death of the radical right are premature. In 2016, the G.O.P. is likely, at a minimum, to hold its majority in the House. If there is a campaign promise in 2016 that is almost sure to be fulfilled, it is that obstructionism and political war will continue, for within the G.O.P. the politics of perpetual fear goes on corroding not just a party but a nation. ♦","1250","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Over the past few days, as family members of the nine people killed by a gunman at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, prepared to bury their loved ones, many of the G.O.P. candidates for President have been offering their thoughts on what to do—or, rather, what not to do—about gun violence.","October 7, 2015","1251","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Let’s start with Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who is currently running second, behind Donald Trump, in the G.O.P. polls. Participating in an exchange on Facebook on Monday night, Carson recalled removing bullets from gunshot victims, and added, “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” On Tuesday morning, Carson went on Fox News and said, “It’s the person behind the gun. Guns don’t kill people.” He didn’t stop there. Asked what he would do if a gunman walked up to him, put a gun to his head, and asked him what his religion was, Carson replied, “I’m glad you asked that question. Because not only would I probably not coöperate with them, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’ ”","1252","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"It’s hard to believe that anybody, let alone a politician running for national office, would insult the victims of a massacre by suggesting that their response had been inadequate. About the most that can be said for Carson is that he isn’t a professional politician: he’s a novice. So is Trump, who, on Tuesday, described himself as a “very big Second Amendment person,” and suggested that the problem in Umpqua was that no one on the scene, apart from the twenty-six-year-old shooter, was armed. (At least one student, an Army veteran, was carrying a gun, a few buildings away.) Trump also said that he opposed a ban on assault weapons—a proposal that he expressed support for in 2000.","1253","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"But, surely, the serious candidates—the Jeb Bushes and Marco Rubios—must have said something more consequential. Not exactly.","1254","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Bush’s “stuff happens” line, which he uttered in South Carolina on Friday, has already entered the political lexicon and provided a gift to the Democrats. Rather than rehashing the debate about whether the remark was taken out of context (it wasn’t), let’s examine what Bush has said since then. After all, he’s had five more days to clarify how he would tackle gun violence. On Monday, he released a new campaign video, which said nothing about what happened in Oregon. On Tuesday, he published an op-ed in the Des Moines Register, which also didn’t bring up the massacre or its aftermath. Then, on Tuesday night, Bush delivered a long speech at a Republican dinner in Iowa. Once again, he made no mention of Umpqua or guns.","1255","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Perhaps that is not surprising. The recipient of an “A+” rating from the National Rifle Association, Bush, during his time as governor of Florida, vigorously opposed efforts to expand gun control, and signed into law the notorious “Stand Your Ground” law. Marco Rubio, who is now leading Bush in most polls, is perhaps a more interesting case. Back in 2000, when he was running for a seat in Florida’s House of Representatives, Rubio said that he supported “reasonable restrictions” on gun sales. And after the Sandy Hook massacre, in December, 2012, Rubio’s spokesman said that Rubio would support measures to keep guns out of the hands of felons and the mentally ill.","1256","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Since then, though, Rubio has backtracked and cozied up to the N.R.A. While campaigning in Iowa on Friday, he said, “Criminals don’t follow gun laws. Only law-abiding people follow gun laws.” On Tuesday, appearing on NBC’s “Today” show, he said, “The laws that many are proposing would have done nothing to prevent these attacks.” Rather than focussing on measures like expanding background checks for gun purchases, “the country should examine mental illness.”","1257","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Many of the other G.O.P. candidates took a similar line. “The problem is mental illness and not necessarily gun registration or gun ownership,” Rand Paul said in a radio interview. Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” Chris Christie told George Stephanopoulos, “I’m very concerned about the mental-health side of this.” On CNN’s “At This Hour,” Mike Huckabee said, “Do we need to do a better job in mental health? You bet we do.”","1258","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"What about Carly Fiorina, who promotes herself as a can-do, problem-solving leader? Couldn’t she say something different and less predictable? No. Fiorina, too, is a loyal supporter of the N.R.A., whose annual meeting she addressed earlier this year in a campaign-style video, boasting about her husband’s concealed-carry permits and saying, “When government takes away our guns, we are headed down a dangerous path.” On Friday, Fiorina criticized President Obama’s impassioned call for action, describing it as “premature, at best,” and “at worst, a really unfortunate politicization of this tragedy.”","1259","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"That was the pretty much the same thing Fiorina said in June, after Obama reacted to the mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. In fact, this is now the standard Republican/N.R.A. line. Each one of these massacres is regrettable and demands further study. But anybody who states the blatantly obvious—that countries with strict guns laws don’t have this problem—is politicizing the issue; they should either zip it, or confine themselves to expressing concern over mental illness.","1260","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Of course, as HBO’s John Oliver pointed out over the weekend, talking about mental illness is largely a diversion, which distorts the facts about gun violence and serves to preserve the status quo. In 2013, during the Obama Administration’s effort to get some relatively minor gun-control laws through Congress, the White House proposed increasing the funding for mental-health programs and other initiatives designed to identify and help people who are potentially dangerous. Republicans in the Senate blocked the gun-control measures anyway, and no doubt they’d do the same this year if Obama were to send over a similar bill. On this issue, elected G.O.P. officials aren’t interested in reason or compromise. They are interested, primarily, in avoiding a challenge in the next election from an N.R.A.-backed candidate.","1261","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"In a sense, there’s nothing new here. For decades now, the N.R.A. and the rest of the gun lobby have had a grip on the Republican Party. But as the number of gun massacres has increased the consequences of this political capture have become harder to ignore. Now, in the full glare of a Presidential election, they cannot be avoided. Rather than engaging in an honest effort to address gun violence and prevent more senseless carnage, practically every G.O.P. candidate has been reduced to repeating a mantra that many of them, surely, cannot fully believe.","1262","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"

"Behind the brash, self-aggrandizing, and occasionally obnoxious exterior that Donald Trump presents to the world lurks a not entirely inconsequential level of intelligence and self-awareness. “I play to people’s fantasies,” he has said in explaining his business success, which is based, to a large extent, on the often blatantly false idea that anything with his name on it is bigger, better, more exclusive, and more glamorous than rival products. “I call it truthful hyperbole.”","September 11, 2015","1264","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"When Trump entered Republican politics, which, increasingly, is the politics of reaction and resentment, he quickly grasped that making outlandish statements served a purpose in that arena, too, especially if his remarks were laced with vinegar. Indeed, he found that the bigger, badder, and meaner the persona he adopted was, the better he did in the polls.","1265","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Doubtless, this was welcome news to him. As anyone who has followed Trump’s career knows, he has always had very thin skin, which naturally inclines him to lash out at critics in the media and elsewhere who dare to question his claims. Now, it seemed, he could give vent to his inner nature and also do himself some good. Thus was born Trump the serial insulter, a political phenom who, for the past six weeks or so, has been sitting dandy atop the G.O.P. primary polls. Indeed, a new CNN poll shows that his level of support among likely Republican voters has crossed the thirty-per-cent mark. Apart from Ben Carson, another political neophyte, who was at nineteen per cent, the rest of the Republican candidates are all stuck in single figures.","1266","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"The CNN poll was released shortly after Rolling Stone reported that Trump had said, in remarks directed at Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and the only woman running in the G.O.P. primary, “Look at that face!

"Trump’s comments about Mexican immigrants, John McCain, and Megyn Kelly, among others, have accustomed us to his outrageous and misogynistic statements. (He has twice retweeted someone who called Kelly, the star of Fox’s news division, a “bimbo.”) In the political world, indeed, there has been growing acceptance that Trump can get away with saying things that other candidates can’t; in some quarters, there was even reluctant admiration for how adeptly he was exploiting this advantage.","1268","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Until now, that is.","1269","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"On Thursday, with very good reason, he was subjected to criticism from virtually every quarter, including from some Republican rivals who, earlier in the summer, had tried to ignore him. Jeb Bush called Trump’s remarks about Fiorina “small and inappropriate,” and said that he seemed intent on insulting his way to the Presidency. Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, called Trump an “egomaniacal madman who has no principles,” and said that it was time for him to return to reality television. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton said that Trump “seems to delight in insulting women every chance he gets.” Fiorina refused to respond directly, stating merely that, with her recent (if modest) rise in the polls, she seemed to be getting under Trump’s skin.","1270","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Trump, for once, seemed to be knocked off balance by all this. Initially, in an interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, he had suggested that Jann Wenner, the liberal publisher of Rolling Stone, had altered the article to make him look bad. “The writer actually called me and said, ‘I’m so upset, I wrote this great story and Jann Wenner screwed it up . . . because they added a lot of stuff, a lot of garish stuff, that I think is disgusting,’ ” Trump claimed.","1271","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Perhaps realizing that this story might not go over well, he provided an alternative explanation to Fox News, arguing that he had been talking about Fiorina’s “persona” rather than her physical appearance. “I say that about a lot of people,” he said. “I say, Look at that . . . . That’s not going to be our President!” Unfortunately for Trump, a quick glance at the article confirms that his remarks were surely directed at Fiorina’s appearance. The writer, Paul Solotaroff, was hanging out with Trump and some of his staffers on his private plane. They were watching the news and joshing around. This is Solotaroff’s description of the scene:","1272","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Later on Thursday, Trump tried out yet another line. Appearing once again on Fox News, he was confronted by a skeptical Greta Van Susteren, who said to him, “I don’t think you’re a first-time offender making a personal crack at a woman . . . the remark was about her face, and not about her persona.” This time, Trump suggested that he had been speaking not as a Presidential candidate but as an entertainer. “I did ‘The Apprentice’ and it was one of the top shows on television,” Trump said, adding, “Some comments are made as an entertainer and, as everybody said, as an entertainer is a much different ballgame.”","1273","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"That it is, and the issue now is whether Trump will finally suffer some adverse consequences for breaking the rules of his adopted sport. One theory, expostulated in this week’s edition of The Economist, suggests that he won’t. “He says things that no politician would, so people think he is not a politician,” an article in the magazine said. “His supporters . . . think his boorishness is a sign of authenticity—of a leader who can channel the rage of those who feel betrayed by the elite or left behind by social change.”","1274","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Surely, there is something in this argument. Even angry Republicans, however, demand a certain level of civility in their Presidential candidates. Or, at least, Trump’s frantic efforts to divert attention from what he actually said about Fiorina suggest that they do. So does the rise in the polls of Ben Carson, who is civil to a fault. Trump, by contrast, just can’t seem to quit. Like a gambler on a lucky streak, he keeps doubling down. Unlike normal gamblers, however, he has appeared during his campaign to be playing with the odds loaded in his favor.","1275","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Maybe, just maybe, that is changing. When Trump made his remarks about Megyn Kelly having “blood coming out of her whatever,” there was at least some ambiguity about what he really meant. This time, there is none. Still, Trump won’t apologize. “What can I say, I’m leading with the evangelicals, I’m leading with women,” he said to Van Susteren. “I’m leading with African-Americans, with a very high number, and I’m leading with Hispanics, which is very interesting and I’m not surprised, because I’m gonna bring jobs back to our country.”","1276","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"

"“President Obama and Hillary Clinton’s idea that we should bring tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America—it is nothing less than lunacy,” Ted Cruz said on Fox News, the day after the attacks on Paris. If there are Syrian Muslims who are really being persecuted, he said, they should be sent to “majority-Muslim countries.” Then he reset his eyebrows, which had been angled in a peak of concern, as if he had something pious to say. And he did: “On the other hand,” he added, “Christians who are being targeted for genocide, for persecution, Christians who are being beheaded or crucified, we should be providing safe haven to them. But President Obama refuses to do that.”","November 16, 2015","1306","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"The next day, at a middle school in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Cruz spoke even more openly about those whom he considers to be the good people in the world. He told reporters that we should accept Christians from Syria, and only Christians, because, he said, “There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror.” This will come as a profound surprise to the people of Oklahoma City and Charleston, to all parties in Ireland, and to the families of the teen-agers whom Anders Breivik killed in Norway, among many others. The Washington Post noted that Cruz “did not say how he would determine that refugees were Christian or Muslim.” Would he accept baptismal certificates, or notes from pastors? Does he just want to hear the refugees pray?","1307","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"On Monday, President Barack Obama reacted to this suggestion with some anger. “When I hear folks say that, well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims, when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which person who’s fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefitted from protection when they were fleeing political persecution, that’s shameful,” Obama said. (That last bit, about “families who’ve benefitted” when fleeing persecution, was an unmistakable reference to Cruz and Marco Rubio.) Obama continued, “That’s not who we are. We don’t have religious tests to our compassion.” The question is whether Obama can put that compassion to use, in this precipitous moment after Paris, when so many bad choices will seem appealing, including attacks on our fellow-citizens. (On Monday, Donald Trump said that, though he’d “hate to do it,” as President he would “seriously consider” closing mosques that were viewed as centers of radicalism.) The real criticism is that the United States has taken so few Syrian refugees of any religion—just about fifteen hundred, all of whom have been screened by a process that can take up to two years.","1308","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"Cruz is cruder than some, but he is not alone among Republicans. On Sunday, Jeb Bush also said that, although he isn’t entirely opposed to helping refugees who’d been screened, “I think our focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore.” (Christians were ten per cent of Syria’s population when the civil war broke out.) On Monday morning, Bush spoke about how “we should focus on creating safe havens for refugees in Syria rather than bringing them all the way across the United States”—a life in no-fly zones, while, according to a vision Bush also laid out over the weekend, a major land war involving U.S. troops was launched around them. He quickly added, “But I do think there is a special, important need to make sure that Syrians are being protected, because they are being slaughtered in the country and, but for us, who—who would take care of the number of Christians that right now are completely displaced?” Others, like Rubio, have avoided the Christian question by saying that they don’t think we should take refugees at all. Ben Carson, speaking to Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday,” said that taking in refugees “from that area of the world, I think, is a huge mistake. … To bring them over here, under these circumstances, is a suspension of intellect,” and would ignore “the reason the human brain has these big frontal lobes, as opposed to other animals.” (He then talked at greater length about “brain stems.”) Trump, in the past, has claimed that Syrian Muslim refugees can get into America “easily” (they cannot), while “if you’re from Syria and you’re Christian you cannot come into this country” (again, not the case). But, mostly, Trump doesn’t want to let anybody in, at least not anybody of the tempest-tossed type. Indeed, it’s not clear that the talk of Christian refugees is meant, even by the loudest Republicans, to translate into the appearance of Syrian Christians in America, as opposed to being an acknowledgment that some of the crowds that cheer when they hear anti-immigrant rhetoric might have qualms of conscience. The problem, they can be told, is just that our Muslim-sympathizing, cowardly leaders would bring in the wrong refugees.","1309","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"Christians are in danger in Syria. Their danger is distinct but not unique. The Yazidis, an even more isolated religious minority, have been a particular target of ISIS. Shiites and Alawites have been targeted, too. Refugee policies have at times rightly recognized the urgent danger that certain religious or otherwise distinct groups are in, and have properly responded. This is something quite different than saying, as Cruz does, that being a Muslim should be a basis for exclusion. Would he let in atheists, for that matter? It seems strange, when moderate Muslims are trying to distance themselves from a milieu of terror, that we would insist that such a thing is impossible. There are international and American laws that recognize people who need protection. There are principles of common decency which do the same. What they do not do is use faith, or the lack of it, as a basis for rejection. (America should have let in more Jewish refugees during the Second World War; that wouldn’t have meant turning away Thomas Mann.) And it is a brutal insult to Syrians who have gone through four and half years of carnage to say that the fact that they are Sunnis gives them some sort of immunity from ISIS or from the Assad regime. There are four million Syrian refugees outside of the country now, and many more inside it. There will likely be some bad people among them. That fact does not obviate their suffering. Taking more of them in can be an unpopular position at a moment when the news is full of speculation that one of the Paris attackers had passed through a refugee camp in Greece with a Syrian passport. But their desperation will not disappear if we lose interest in it; it may just take a different and more destructive form. We have a role in deciding where they will go next.","1310","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"One of the more dishonest aspects of Cruz’s comments on Fox was his characterization of who the Syrian refugees are. He mentioned an estimate that, in the “early waves” of refugees entering Europe, “seventy-seven per cent of those refugees were young men. That is a very odd demographic for a refugee wave.” Perhaps it would be, if the number were accurate. A bare majority of the Syrian refugees are women, as FactCheck.org noted in September, when Ben Carson and Scott Walker raised similar alarms. About twenty-two per cent are men between the ages of eighteen and fifty-nine—a broad definition of “young.” Cruz is smart enough to know this. He may be referring to a number given for migrants who arrived in Europe, from nine different countries, by taking a specific, dangerous Mediterranean sea route in 2014 (seventy-two per cent). Among the two million Syrian refugees the United Nations has registered in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon, a full thirty-eight per cent are under the age of twelve.","1311","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"For that matter, why shouldn’t there be young men among the refugees? In stories about why people emigrate, like the one told by Nicholas Schmidle last month in The New Yorker, one reason young men give as a motivating factor for leaving their countries is the fear of being conscripted by one side or the other. They don’t want to be killed, and they don’t want to be killers. Is it Cruz’s view that a nineteen-year-old, just out of high school, should head for the hills, looking for the moderate Syrian opposition that even the C.I.A. has been unable to find? Or should he languish in a camp, with no prospects of really settling anywhere, as a target for the wrong type of tutor? That is not going to make Europe or the United States any safer. What Cruz and the others are saying is that the threat people are living under, which has been enough to drive them from their homes, should not matter. What does matter is whether we feel threatened by them.","1312","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"The other insinuation that Cruz and others are making is that Obama doesn’t like Christians, and refuses to acknowledge the Islamic character of terrorism—maybe, they suggest, because of his character, or because of who he is. “I recognize that Barack Obama does not wish to defend this country,” Cruz said. And saying that was shameful, too.","1313","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"

"In the wake of the massacre at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, Hillary Clinton promised that if she is elected President she will use executive power to make it harder for people to buy guns without background checks. Meanwhile, Ben Carson, one of the Republican Presidential candidates, said, “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” The two responses could hardly have been more different, but both were testaments to the power of a single organization: the National Rifle Association. Clinton invoked executive action because the N.R.A. has made it unthinkable that a Republican-controlled Congress could pass meaningful gun-control legislation. Carson found it expedient to make his comment because the N.R.A. has shaped the public discourse around guns, in one of the most successful P.R. (or propaganda, depending on your perspective) campaigns of all time.","1316","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"In many accounts, the power of the N.R.A. comes down to money. The organization has an annual operating budget of some quarter of a billion dollars, and between 2000 and 2010 it spent fifteen times as much on campaign contributions as gun-control advocates did. But money is less crucial than you’d think. The N.R.A.’s annual lobbying budget is around three million dollars, which is about a fifteenth of what, say, the National Association of Realtors spends. The N.R.A.’s biggest asset isn’t cash but the devotion of its members. Adam Winkler, a law professor at U.C.L.A. and the author of the 2011 book “Gunfight,” told me, “N.R.A. members are politically engaged and politically active. They call and write elected officials, they show up to vote, and they vote based on the gun issue.” In one revealing study, people who were in favor of permits for gun owners described themselves as more invested in the issue than gun-rights supporters did. Yet people in the latter group were four times as likely to have donated money and written a politician about the issue.","1317","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"The N.R.A.’s ability to mobilize is a classic example of what the advertising guru David Ogilvy called the power of one “big idea.” Beginning in the nineteen-seventies, the N.R.A. relentlessly promoted the view that the right to own a gun is sacrosanct. Playing on fear of rising crime rates and distrust of government, it transformed the terms of the debate. As Ladd Everitt, of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, told me, “Gun-control people were rattling off public-health statistics to make their case, while the N.R.A. was connecting gun rights to core American values like individualism and personal liberty.” The success of this strategy explains things that otherwise look anomalous, such as the refusal to be conciliatory even after killings that you’d think would be P.R. disasters. After the massacre of schoolchildren in Newtown, Connecticut, the N.R.A.’s C.E.O. sent a series of e-mails to his members warning them that anti-gun forces were going to use it to “ban your guns” and “destroy the Second Amendment.”","1318","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"The idea that gun rights are perpetually under threat has been a staple of the N.R.A.’s message for the past four decades. Yet, for most of that period, the gun-control movement was disorganized and ineffective. Today, the landscape is changing. “Newtown really marked a major turning point in America’s gun debate,” Winkler said. “We’ve seen a completely new, reinvigorated gun-control movement, one that has much more grassroots support, and that’s now being backed by real money.” Michael Bloomberg’s Super PAC, Independence USA, has spent millions backing gun-control candidates, and he’s pledged fifty million dollars to the cause. Campaigners have become more effective in pushing for gun-control measures, particularly at the local and state level: in Washington State last year, a referendum to expand background checks got almost sixty per cent of the vote. There are even signs that the N.R.A.’s ability to make or break politicians could be waning; senators it has given F ratings have been reëlected in purple states. Indeed, Hillary Clinton’s embrace of gun control is telling: previously, Democratic Presidential candidates tended to shy away from the issue.","1319","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"These shifts, plus the fact that demographics are not in the N.R.A.’s favor (Latino and urban voters mostly support gun control), might make it seem that the N.R.A.’s dominance is ebbing. But, if so, that has yet to show up in the numbers. A Pew survey last December found that a majority of Americans thought protecting gun rights was more important than gun control. Fifteen years before, the same poll found that sixty-six per cent of Americans thought that gun control mattered more. And last year, despite all the new money and the grassroots campaigns, states passed more laws expanding gun rights than restricting them.","1320","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"What is true is that the N.R.A. at last has worthy opponents. The gun-control movement is far more pragmatic than it once was. When the N.R.A. took up the banner of gun rights, in the seventies, gun-control advocates were openly prohibitionist. (The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence was originally called the National Coalition to Ban Handguns.) Today, they’re respectful of gun owners and focussed on screening and background checks. That’s a sensible strategy. It’s also an accommodation to the political reality that the N.R.A. created. ♦","1321","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"

"Evidently, the folks at CNN decided that an hour was about as long as they could keep people hanging. That was the point in the debate, which was held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, in Simi Valley, California, when the host, Jake Tapper, asked Carly Fiorina to comment on Donald Trump’s recent offensive remarks about her appearance. (According to Rolling Stone, Trump said, after seeing Fiorina on television, “Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next President?”)","1323","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Until that point, the debate had gone pretty much as expected, with various candidates taking their shots at knocking Trump off his perch, and the seemingly indestructible New York businessman bluffing his way through without suffering much apparent injury. Tapper raised Rand Paul’s concern, expressed on CNN earlier in the week, about a man of Trump’s temperament having his finger on the nuclear button. (Trump replied, “My temperament is very good, very calm.”) Jeb Bush had accused Trump of using political donations to lobby for Florida to legalize casino gambling, and claimed that he had rebuffed Trump’s attempt. (“Jeb, don’t make things up. Come on,” Trump said, rebutting the notion that he’d wanted casino gambling there.) And Scott Walker, evidently unaware of Trump’s actual role on his long-running reality-TV show, said that we don’t need another apprentice in the White House. (Trump didn’t bother responding to that.)","1324","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Fiorina, though, bided her time. Offered an early opportunity to comment on Trump’s putative role as commander of America’s nuclear arsenal, she demurred, noting merely that he was “a wonderful entertainer.” The question of his fitness to be Commander-in-Chief would be one for the voters to answer, she said. A bit later, she made it clear that she had no doubt of her own C-in-C chops. Rather than negotiating with Vladimir Putin (as Trump has suggested he would), Fiorina said that she would rebuild the Sixth Fleet, reconstruct the American missile-defense system in Eastern Europe, and send thousands more troops to Germany. Russia was “a bad actor,” she averred, and Putin was “someone we should not talk to.”","1325","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"That comment earned Fiorina some applause from an audience that appeared to have been drawn from the Hoover Institution/Cold War wing of conservatism, more than the Tea Party. But she didn’t receive nearly as much applause for that as for the response she gave to Tapper’s question about the Rolling Stone article, following another exchange between Trump and Bush, during which Trump emphasized that he’d heard something Bush had said. Looking levelly into the camera, Fiorina, the only female in the G.O.P. race, said calmly but forcefully, “Mr. Trump said that he heard Mr. Bush very clearly and what Mr. Bush said. I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.”","1326","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Doubtless, it was a line that Fiorina had rehearsed, but she delivered it beautifully, and it generated by far the biggest cheers of the night. Trump, for once, seemed somewhat at a loss for words, and his face, which was red all night—it was very hot onstage, and many other candidates were sweating, too—seemed to blush a little deeper. “I think she’s got a beautiful face,” he said, finally, “and I think she’s a beautiful woman.” It wasn’t an apology (Trump doesn’t do those), and it was greeted with near silence.","1327","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"A bit later on, Tapper afforded Trump the opportunity to win back some points of his own, bringing up Fiorina’s record as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. “The company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster,” Trump said, citing a study by a Yale professor that described Fiorina’s tenure at H.P. as one of the worst in corporate history. Fiorina stayed calm, though, and showed that she possesses political talents that appeared sadly lacking in her previous venture into electoral politics, an abortive 2010 run in California for the U.S. Senate. In particular, she demonstrated the invaluable ability to deliver whoppers with apparent sincerity. Dismissing the Yale study as the work of a Clintonite, she described her troubled time at H.P., which ended when the company’s board fired her, as a period of revenue growth, innovation, and desperate measures taken in desperate times. She even managed to slip in the fact that, on the day she was fired, Steve Jobs called her to commiserate. All Trump could manage was “I only say this. She can’t run any of my companies.”","1328","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"After that, Trump seemed a bit deflated. (Admittedly, it could have been the heat.) And Fiorina, evidently seeking to portray herself as just as hawkish as any of the men surrounding her, laid it on a bit thick during a discussion of ISIS, saying that she would make sure that the U.S. military had fifty Army brigades, thirty-six Marine battalions, more than three hundred naval ships, and enough nuclear weapons to blow up the entire solar system. (I made up the last bit, but you get the idea: Jeane Kirkpatrick meets Dr. Strangelove.) By that stage, though, it probably didn’t matter. The television audience had dwindled, and the online pundits were already declaring Fiorina the winner—which, until the post-debate polls arrive, means she was the winner.","1329","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"For many of the other candidates, it was a mixed night. Jeb Bush was more forceful than in the previous G.O.P. debate, but the most memorable things he said were that he smoked pot in college, would choose Margaret Thatcher if he had to select a woman to appear on the ten-dollar bill, and would make his Secret Service name Eveready, because, as he explained to Trump, who has accused him of listlessness, “It’s very high energy.” (This comment came in garbage time, and it earned him an ironic low five from the front-runner.) Ben Carson, who is the closest candidate in the polls to Trump, once again disappeared for long stretches, but in a debate that most voters, even Republican voters, will only watch via soundbites, this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing for him. He had a couple of strong moments, such as when he revealed that he had advised George W. Bush not to invade Iraq (earning him a high five from Trump, who also opposed the war), and when he affirmed, twice, that there is no evidence that vaccinations cause autism. (Carson even had the temerity, in front of a Republican audience, to suggest that there are moments when it makes more sense to rely on intellect than military force.)","1330","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Marco Rubio, once again, had some good moments, although probably not enough to dislodge him from the position of everybody’s second-favorite candidate. John Kasich, to his credit and, almost certainly, his own detriment, followed a rote assertion that the Iranian nuclear deal was a “bad agreement” with an attempt to defend the virtues of a multilateral approach to foreign policy. Chris Christie, the forgotten man of Trenton, sought to position himself as the adult in the room, admonishing Trump and Fiorina to stop quibbling about their business records and concentrate on the concerns of construction workers who don’t give a fig about their careers. (It must be noted, however, that Christie’s efforts to look serious weren’t helped when he said that his Secret Service security name would be True Heart.

His famously wonky budget proposals would shrink food stamps and college aid while cutting rich people’s taxes, in many cases by half.

But its undisputed effect is to leave the House free to “chuse” anyone it chooses.","1340","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"This provision, or lack of provision, has been widely noted, and there was some early, desultory talk of taking advantage of it. One name that was tossed out was that of J. C. Watts, a former four-term congressman from Oklahoma, now a lobbyist. Diversity-wise, Watts would be what might be called the Ben Carson option, with football substituted for brain surgery. But Watts has a fatal taint: he has held public office. In the government. The federal government.","1341","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"

"Donald Trump fulfills the constitutional requirements for the Speakership, because there are none. Also, Speakers speak, and Trump is very good at speaking, as he has regularly proved on television, not only as a budding politician but also as a “reality” star—and reality, with or without scare quotes, is something of which the Republican Party is sorely in need.","1343","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Another thing Speakers are supposed to do—according to good-government types, bipartisanship junkies, and even the unknown but not insubstantial number of Republicans who suspect that it may be politically advantageous to at least show an interest in “governing” and “getting things done”—is make deals, as long as said deals are struck by a “tough negotiator.” Sound like someone you know? Someone like, maybe, the best-selling author of “The Art of the Deal”? Like the guy who, just last week, bluffed CNBC into immediately yielding to his demand that the next G.O.P. debate be an hour shorter and an opening statement longer?","1344","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"A Trump Speakership would be a win-win for all concerned. For the rest of the Republican Presidential field, “establishment” (Bush, Rubio, Kasich, etc.) and “insurgent” (Cruz, Huckabee, etc.) alike, it would eliminate a dangerously unpredictable, ideologically inscrutable, incomprehensibly popular rival who makes the others look like flop-sweat-covered, low-energy professional politicians hopelessly in hock to rich contributors and corporations. (The Ben Carson problem would persist for a while, of course, but, sooner or later, the doctor’s profound weirdness, among other problems, may be relied upon to dispose of that one.)","1345","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"As for Ryan, the deal would spare him the doom that very likely will be his fate if he becomes Speaker. Nothing about the terms under which he has agreed to accept the post changes the fact that, absurd as the notion may be, he is still “too far left.” For a small but procedurally decisive segment of his Republican colleagues in the House, governmental dysfunction, gridlock, paralysis, and chaos are features, not bugs. These features of the status quo are not about to go away. Ryan’s political business plan called for him to spend the next four years as the respected (among conservatives) chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, followed by eight triumphant years in the White House, followed by a comfortable retirement at the Ryan Presidential Library and Foundation. The prospect for him now is a short, harrowing, career-ending interval of misery on Capitol Hill followed by a lucrative but soul-killing job as a K Street lobbyist.","1346","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"For Trump himself, the deal is just as good. Let’s start with an assumption: notwithstanding the current hysteria, Trump is not going to be the Republican nominee. He can go down in the annals of politics and entertainment as a curiosity, a footnote: the flamboyant mogul who ran for President on a lark, threw a scare into the regulars for a while, got bored and/or boring, and went back to his perch at Trump Tower and the tabloids. Or he can be the first and only non-member of the House of Representatives to be its Speaker in the two hundred and twenty-six years since its founding. He probably wouldn’t last long in the job, and he probably wouldn’t want to, and, anyway, he wouldn’t have to. No matter what, he will have become a truly historic figure, and he can spend the rest of his life preening as such.","1347","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Not only that: Speaker Trump could continue to nurse his White House fantasies. It’s true that, for a conventional politician, the Speakership has always been a too-slippery steppingstone to the Presidency. Being a governor, a senator, or a victorious general has always been a better route. Ex-Speakers Henry Clay and James G. Blaine managed to make it as far as winning their respective parties’ nominations, but they got creamed in November. Of the sixty-one Speakers so far, only one has ever actually become President: James K. Polk—and he had quit the House six years earlier to take the governorship of Tennessee. But, for a conventional Republican politician like Ryan, given the nihilistic ungovernability of today’s G.O.P. caucus, the Speakership is a gravestone. Hence the man’s reluctance.","1348","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Trump, however, is not a conventional politician. A few months as Speaker would be just the dollop of “government experience” he needs to fill out his résumé for next time. Nor could this time be entirely ruled out. The Speaker of the House is third in line for the Presidency. An accident or some such could befall whoever is President and Vice-President. As Jeb Bush recently noted, stuff happens.","1349","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"In November, 1954, Dwight D. Eisenhower was mulling a matter that he mulled with some frequency: the effects of age on someone in a stressful, non-stop job like his. He’d been President for nearly two years and, in his diary, wrote down some of the reasons why seeking a second term might be a bad idea: “The greater likelihood that a man of 70 will break down under a load than a man of 50,” a need for “younger men in positions of the highest responsibility so as to symbolize the youth, vigor and virility of the Republican Party,” and, perhaps above all, the “growing severity and complexity of problems that rest upon the President for solution.” As far as he knew, he was in good shape, but intimations of mortality shadowed him, and he thought a lot about the next political generation. At a White House political dinner a few days before Christmas, he said, “We have got to begin right now, at the state level and at the precinct level, to see to it that the Party puts up the right kind of young man to run in ’56. All the programs in the world, and all the Eisenhower prestige, cannot elect some revolting old Republican hack against a youthful, able, and personable Democrat.”","September 23, 2015","1350","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"Modern readers will note a certain gender bias in phrases like “a man of 70,” “the right kind of young man,” and “virility,” and should know that these somewhat depressed observations came soon after the midterms, in which Democrats took control of the Senate and House, by majorities that the party would keep for decades. Eisenhower’s worries became far more intense several months later, in late September, 1955, when he suffered a major heart attack.","1351","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"This is a roundabout way of getting to the sensitive, impolite subject of when, if ever, a candidate might be too old for the Presidency. It is a question whose premise, in an era when the word “ageism” is embedded in the language, many are inclined to reject, in part because the motives for asking it tend to be suspect. The thuggish wing of the talk-radio community uses the age question to undermine Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, who will be sixty-eight in October. That makes her more than a year younger than Donald Trump, although age is the least of many concerns about him. Age should certainly count a lot less than the goofy ideas and inexperience demonstrated by too many Republicans. But the curious absence of a new political generation should concern Democrats, and a party whose other poll-leading 2016 candidates, declared and not, are Bernie Sanders, who is seventy-four, and Joe Biden, who will be seventy-three in November. (Barely registering in the polls are Jim Webb, who is sixty-nine, and Martin O’Malley, a relative teen at fifty-two.) Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Mike Huckabee are in their early sixties, but, for better or worse, Republicans also have half a dozen contenders in their forties and fifties. The distinct problem for the Democrats isn’t the presence of elders; it’s the absence of young women and men with the potential to be credible national candidates.","1352","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"Apart from Ronald Reagan, who at sixty-nine was the oldest President ever to be elected, Americans have tended to choose younger men for the office. Franklin D. Roosevelt was fifty when he won his first term; John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama were in their forties. Even Eisenhower, grandfatherly affect and all, was only sixty-two when he won the White House for the first time.","1353","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"In the early winter of 1956, as the next Presidential cycle began and Eisenhower recovered from his heart attack, he wrote to his childhood friend Edward E. (Swede) Hazlett to say, “We all know that when advancing years and diminishing energy begin to take their toll, the last one that ever appreciates such a situation is the victim himself.” In another letter, to a doctor who’d recently examined him and thought that he was healthy enough to run again, Ike expressed still more doubts. In “contemplating my own future duty,” he compared his job to that of a quarterback: “He may have all of the wisdom to be derived from years of experience in the game. But when the need arises, he has to throw himself unreservedly into the play…. If we merely needed a brain on the field, a quarterback could play if he had to be in a wheelchair; but that isn’t true in his case, nor is it in the Presidency.”","1354","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"At the end of February, 1956, a month after sending that letter, Eisenhower announced that he would indeed seek a second term, though he planned to let Vice-President Richard Nixon do most of the campaigning. Ike went on to win reëlection in a landslide. But his health was shakier than his doctors were willing to say, and he suffered two more serious medical alarms—ileitis, an intestinal condition, in the summer of 1956, and a minor stroke, in the fall of 1957. In October, 1960, he marked his seventieth birthday, which, until the Reagan era, made him the oldest President ever to serve.","1355","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"The country fifty-five years ago was lucky that it all turned out as it did. It was also another reminder, just ten years after Roosevelt’s death, that choosing a Vice-President is a serious matter. During the 1956 campaign, the Democratic candidate, Adlai Stevenson, made an issue of Eisenhower’s health—and the possibility that Nixon, deeply hated by Democrats, might become President. Democrats, without a successor generation in clear view, may get lucky in 2016, especially facing a Republican field whose contenders include people who say, inexplicably, as they did in last week’s debate, that George W. Bush left the country safer (Jeb Bush), or that vaccines may cause autism (Trump), or that it’s worth shutting down the government to defund Planned Parenthood (Ted Cruz, Chris Christie). Sixty years ago, Eisenhower was willing to consider the nation’s welfare ahead of personal ambition. That was an impulse rarely glimpsed in last week’s Republican debate.","1356","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"With about fifteen minutes to go in the G.O.P. Presidential debate last night, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, it looked as if it might be hard to pick a low point. The candidates had, after all, been squabbling for almost three hours, long enough to foster fantasies of using Reagan’s Air Force One, which was onstage, as an emergency-escape vehicle. Then Jake Tapper, the moderator, asked Ben Carson about vaccines—or, more specifically, what he, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, thought of Donald Trump’s statements linking childhood vaccines to autism, “which, as you know, the medical community adamantly disputes.” Perhaps Tapper thought that he was setting up a confrontation between rationality and Trumpism, a moment when the doctor would calmly dismantle the Donald. If so, he was disappointed. Carson, after allowing that studies “have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism,” and that some inoculations saved lives, added that “a multitude” of them probably weren’t important—“and there should be some discretion in those cases. But, you know, a lot of this is—is—is pushed by big government.”","September 17, 2015","1357","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"“Should he stop saying that vaccines cause autism?” Tapper asked.","1358","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"

"Trump proceeded to demonstrate his decision-making qualities with a digressive rant about how he knew “a beautiful child” who “went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.” He’d had his own regimen for his children, he said, spreading things out; if people followed his advice, “I think you’re going to see a big impact on autism.”","1360","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"You’re not: the science is very clear that vaccines do not cause autism, and that all the deniers have accomplished is to provoke outbreaks of diseases, like measles, that were once almost forgotten in America. (My colleague Michael Specter has written about this extensively.) A lot of what Trump says—diplomacy by yelling, for example—would be dangerous if put into practice. But most of it, assuming he doesn’t actually get elected, won’t be put into practice. The refusal to inoculate children, though, is something that his admirers can try at home. No other candidate was willing to anger the ideologues by standing up for something as suspicious as science. Given a final chance by Tapper, Carson smiled and said that Trump was “an O.K. doctor”—a reference to Trump’s dismissal of Carson’s surgical skills. Rand Paul, who is also a doctor, added that though he was for vaccines, “I’m also for freedom”—namely the freedom to reschedule shots, “even if science doesn’t say” that there’s a problem.","1361","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"The exchange was of a piece with the rest of the debate and with the state of the Republican Party: fervid, claustrophobic, recklessly insinuating, and, at the same time, utterly timid when it comes to extremism in its own ranks. The discussion about vaccines was immediately preceded by one about climate change: Tapper—citing George Shultz, Reagan’s Secretary of State, who said that his boss had urged industry leaders to come up with a plan to move away from chemicals destroying the ozone layer “as an insurance policy in case the scientists are right”—asked Marco Rubio why we shouldn’t now do the same, just in case there was something to the overwhelming evidence of climate change, rising sea levels, and retreating glaciers all around us.","1362","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"“Because we’re not going to destroy our economy the way the left-wing government that we are under now wants to do,” Rubio said. “Single parents already struggling,” he added, couldn’t afford to do things that, in his view, wouldn’t affect the climate. And anyway, “America is not a planet.”","1363","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Tapper turned to Chris Christie, apparently on the theory that he had previously been more willing than other Republicans to recognize the reality of climate change. He didn’t have much better luck than he did with Carson. “I agree with Marco. We shouldn’t be destroying our economy in order to chase some wild left-wing idea that somehow us by ourselves is going to fix the climate,” Christie said. Not that he was interested in working with others: he bragged that, while making the air cleaner in New Jersey, he’d pulled the state out of regional cap-and-trade agreements. America may not be a planet, but New Jersey is. Scott Walker then jumped in to say that he wouldn’t listen to the E.P.A. Tapper managed to move on, despite Paul’s clamoring to be heard “if you want a skeptic” about climate change. No one tried to break in on behalf of the planet—the one that America is on.","1364","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"The flaw in the debate, evident in both of these exchanges, may have been a structural one. In the interests of mixing it up, CNN’s moderators—Tapper was joined by Dana Bash, the network’s political correspondent, and Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio host—repeatedly quoted criticisms that one candidate had made of the others. The most blunt example may have been when Carly Fiorina was asked what she thought of Trump’s comments, to Rolling Stone, about the unelectability of her face. In lieu of an apology last night, Trump said, “she’s a beautiful woman.” (He also said that he’d heard that Jeb Bush’s wife was “lovely.”) Fiorina declined to simper; throughout, she played her designated role of Trump teller-offer, mixing in references to “my good friend Bibi Netanyahu” and lurid (and inaccurate) descriptions of secretly taped videos of Planned Parenthood employees. Later, she and Trump sniped about their respective business records, prompting Christie, of all people, to tell them to “stop playing” and being so “childish.” “And Carly—Carly, listen,” he said. “You can interrupt everybody else on this stage, you’re not going to interrupt me, O.K.?” He sounded like a first grader striking a pose for the kindergartners.","1365","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"But rather than really pushing the candidates on their positions, CNN’s did-you-hear-what-he-called-you approach served to keep the debate within the tinny echo chamber of the G.O.P. For example, Bash asked Jeb Bush, “After Chief Justice John Roberts voted to uphold Obamacare twice, Senator Cruz criticized your brother for appointing John Roberts to the Supreme Court. Looking back on it, did your brother make a mistake?” What followed was a somewhat bizarre exchange in which Bush offered a tepid defense of Roberts while saying that Cruz had supported him, too. Cruz replied by comparing Roberts—who, Obamacare aside, has led the court to achingly conservative decisions in Citizens United and Hobby Lobby, has helped to roll back voting rights, and has written bitter dissents on marriage equality—to the far more liberal David Souter. Mike Huckabee, who had earlier said that Kim Davis, the county clerk in Kentucky who is violating the Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision by refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, had been afforded less respect for her religious beliefs than “the detainees at Gitmo,” jumped in to expostulate about litmus tests. Only in the Republican primaries would any of this make sense.","1366","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"The Roberts exchange was one of several in which Jeb Bush couldn’t shake a certain air of petulance. “That’s—that’s my brother,” he said at one point, wiggling his arms a little. He had been trying to finish an evocative line about George W. Bush embracing a firefighter in the rubble of Ground Zero, but, since he’d been interrupted with interjections from, in sequence, Trump, Paul, and Walker, it was hard to figure out just what he was saying, or even parse it grammatically. He certainly didn’t command the foreign-policy discussion, amid a general clamor about renouncing the Iran agreement and Trump dismissing the need to learn “name after name, Arab name, Arab name.” Both Rubio and Carson had stronger moments in explaining why they might, if only occasionally, think before bombing, but both still came across as flagrantly hawkish. Paul, meanwhile, communicated the anti-interventionism that has set him apart. (His most effective moment, though, came when he talked about decriminalizing drug offenses, prompting Bush to talk about smoking marijuana as a teen-ager and Fiorina to speak, movingly, about her step-daughter who lost her life to addiction.) Bush said that he had chosen the same foreign-policy advisers that his brother and father had because, if you wanted a Republican, those were the only people available, “just by definition.” Near the end of the debate, Tapper asked each candidate to pick his or her Secret Service code name. (Paul: “Justice Never Sleeps”; Cruz: “Cohiba”; Walker: “Harley. I love riding Harley’s.”) Bush went with “Eveready—it’s very high energy, Donald.” Suddenly, it became hard to shake the image of Jeb as a giant Energizer Bunny. It also made him sound like a sulker, fixated on Trump’s description of him as “low-energy.” Trump, for his part, offered Eveready a hand-slap and then proposed his own name: “Humble.”","1367","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Tapper had another “light question”: What woman should, in accordance with a Treasury Department plan, replace Alexander Hamilton on the ten-dollar bill? Fiorina wouldn’t give a name, saying that she wasn’t in favor of that kind of “gesture.” Others nominated four American historical figures: Clara Barton, Susan B. Anthony, Rosa Parks, and Abigail Adams. The rest of the answers were divided between family members (Huckabee’s wife, Carson’s mother) and foreigners (Bush: Margaret Thatcher; Kasich: Mother Teresa). Really, Miss Oklahoma did a better job with this one than the Presidential contenders. (The correct answer, by the way, is to keep Hamilton on the ten, and put Harriet Tubman on the twenty.)","1368","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Trump went with both Parks and his daughter Ivanka—“because she’s been sitting for three hours.” Do we all get a bill, then? The debate was crowded, bloated, sour, and long. Far from adding order to the race, it is likely to have made it even more unpredictable. As was the case last time, each candidate probably did enough to satisfy his or her narrow faction, or at least to convince a couple of big donors to keep paying. Some (Carson, Fiorina, Rubio) likely did more than that. The question is who will lose the support they gain. Trump’s core supporters may not mind his performance, even though, at times, he seemed to be insulting people just to stay awake, like a truck driver lighting another cigarette. He was missing what he would call his usual “braggadocious” verve. It’s going to be a strange and pot-holed road on the way to 2016. But all we watched, on Wednesday night, were a bunch of bumper cars colliding in front of an old Air Force One.","1369","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"On Friday, October 2nd, Jeb Bush was onstage at a college auditorium in Greenville, South Carolina, for a public interview with Alan Wilson, the state’s attorney general and a prominent figure in the right-wing firmament. Bush is sixty-two, but, thanks to a low-carb Paleo diet, he looks younger than he did when he left the Florida governor’s office eight years ago for a life in the business world. A trim physique, however, hasn’t boosted his appeal to potential voters. A new national poll showed that Bush’s support had sunk to four per cent; South Carolina, which has one of the most conservative Republican electorates in the country, and will hold its primary early next year, just after Iowa and New Hampshire, is crucial to winning the nomination. Once considered the front-runner, Bush is trailing a clutch of candidates, among them Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who have never held public office and encourage comparison to buffoons.","1370","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Jeb has presented himself as the most electable Republican candidate: willing to break with Republican orthodoxy on domestic issues such as immigration and education, and committed to breaking, if vaguely, with his brother’s legacy on foreign policy and to being, as he has said, his “own man.” Before Bush officially entered the 2016 campaign, he remarked to a group of C.E.O.s at a conference in Washington, D.C., that a successful candidate had to be willing to “lose the primary to win the general,” and should campaign “without violating your principles.” He meant that one must avoid the perennial trap of party primaries, in which “base voters,” the hard-core conservatives, force politicians to take extreme positions that will prove unpopular in a general election and, when later disavowed, expose the candidate as a phony. “It’s not an easy task, to be honest with you,” he noted. (Hillary Clinton faces a similar problem in her race for the Democratic nomination.)","1371","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But in his conversation with Wilson, and in a subsequent interview with me and other reporters, Bush veered toward the right. On domestic affairs, his view was neatly summarized by his answer to a question about gun control. It was the day after the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, and yet Bush rejected any calls for new legislation. He noted that he had confronted similar pressure for government action after tragedies while he was governor: “Look, stuff happens. There’s always a crisis, and the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.”","1372","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush was pilloried by Democrats for his “stuff happens” remark, but he defended it, telling me that the government doesn’t have a solution to every problem, and that sometimes government action makes matters worse. Some variety of a laissez-faire philosophy is standard for modern Republicans, at least on most domestic issues. But, increasingly in recent months, Bush, like a number of his colleagues, has been making the case for aggressive intervention abroad. Two days earlier, Russia had carried out its first air strikes in Syria. When I asked Bush how he would respond if he were President, he said that it was the lack of American action that had created the dire situation in Iraq and Syria, and invited the Russian military to bolster the Assad regime.","1373","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I think we need to stand up to Putin, not just as it relates to Syria,” Bush told me. “This sends a signal all around the world of the United States pulling back, not being serious. Our allies don’t believe that we’re going to have their back. And this emboldens our enemies.” Bush offered no details on how to “stand up to Putin” or what, exactly, he would do to pacify the killing floor of the Middle East and South Asia and reconcile the tangled rivalries and interests there. But his message to the base was clear: We must do something. And we must do it now.","1374","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush’s view represents a return to a simplistic interventionism that seemed discredited in the wake of the Iraq debacle. For decades, the G.O.P. has been split into two camps. The realists, who dominated the Presidency of Bush’s father, George H. W. Bush, emphasized diplomacy and coalitions over go-it-alone displays of force, and a skepticism about America’s ability to shape the internal dynamics of foreign countries. They also expressed a willingness to tolerate tyrannical regimes that advance U.S. interests or create greater stability in volatile regions of the world. The other camp—variously described as idealists, hawks, and neoconservatives—dominated the Presidency of Bush’s brother. They have more often called for the overthrow rather than the containment of hostile regimes, and they remain committed to exporting American-style democracy to places where it has never flourished.","1375","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"The hyper-interventionist foreign policy of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney was widely blamed for the Republican Party’s loss of Congress in 2006 and of the Presidency in 2008. But many hawks, once more in full voice, now believe that the Obama years—the emergence of ISIS, the crisis in Syria and Iraq, Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, the rise of Putin at a time of Russian isolation and economic weakness—have vindicated Bush. “Any Presidential candidate, the first thing he or she needs to do is put up a map of the Middle East in 2009 and one today,” John McCain, a leading hawk in the Senate, told me, as we discussed foreign policy in his office. “And point out that it is this President’s failures.

"Obama thinks that intractable foreign-policy crises should be guided by the physician’s maxim of “first, do no harm”—or, as his aides have said privately, “Don’t do stupid shit.” To Republican hawks, this sounds like a willful and dangerous abdication of American power and influence. Lindsey Graham, who is one of the long-shot Presidential candidates and McCain’s closest ally in the Senate, has called for ten thousand American troops to be sent back to Iraq. Last week, Chris Christie said that he would set up a no-fly zone in the Syrian airspace in which the Russians are now operating, and shoot down any planes that entered it.","1377","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But of all the Republican candidates vying to reform the world of foreign affairs only one belongs to a family of Presidents that, for better or worse, did so much to give that world its present shape. When Jeb Bush began his campaign, he enlisted as advisers some of the realists from his father’s camp, including the former Secretary of State James Baker. But the heaviest contingent consisted of his brother’s liege men: Paul Wolfowitz, the Defense Department official who made the ideological case for invading Iraq; John Hannah, who had been an adviser to Dick Cheney and pushed bad intelligence into Colin Powell’s famous speech at the U.N. making the case for war; Porter Goss, the former C.I.A. director who condoned waterboarding as an interrogation technique; and Stephen Hadley, the former national-security adviser, who took the blame for false assertions that President Bush made about nuclear yellowcake allegedly sought by Saddam Hussein from Niger.","1378","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Another adviser on his team is Otto Reich, who served in various foreign-policy roles in the Reagan Administration and in both Bush Administrations, and is perhaps best known for his participation in the 2002 attempted coup against Hugo Chávez, the late socialist leader of Venezuela. (Reich denies that he or the U.S. played any role in the coup.) In May, Jeb Bush, after providing a series of confusing responses on the issue, said that, given what is now known about the condition of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear-, biological-, and chemical-weapons program in 2003, he would not have invaded Iraq. Not all of his advisers share this sentiment.","1379","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I can defend the invasion of Iraq,” Reich told me. “What did the invasion of Iraq do? It caused all of the people who would’ve otherwise come and attacked us and killed Americans on our soil—it caused them to go to Iraq and die there. That may sound very brutal, or whatever, but we have seen what has happened when you have an Administration like the current one, that did not realize what Bush had done; sent the troops home from Iraq; created a vacuum that was filled by ISIS. And they’re killing Americans and everyone else—they’re mostly killing Muslims. I lay that at the feet of the Obama Administration.”","1380","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He added, “All Republicans say what I just did . . . but it’s not reported. Nobody listens. It goes against conventional wisdom. Conventional wisdom is that Bush was a failure in foreign policy, because of Iraq. Well, history is beginning to tell a different story.”","1381","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"The American public’s appetite for military interventions runs in cycles. After the triumph of the Second World War, policymakers were emboldened to roll back Communism, but the miasma of Vietnam instilled a wariness of major overseas military entanglements that spanned the Carter and Reagan Presidencies. In 1991, the relatively quick and successful Gulf War sparked a new bipartisan consensus that American force could again be deployed wisely if it was undertaken with overwhelming strength and with the benefit of an international coalition. The lack of intervention in Rwanda was widely seen as a moral calamity for which politicians, including Bill Clinton, have apologized.","1382","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"That uneasy consensus lasted through the 2001 toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan. But the invasion of Iraq in 2003 came to be seen as such a catastrophic mistake that even its progenitor could not avoid casting blame on his own circle. George W. Bush, during his last two years in office, forced out Donald Rumsfeld and marginalized Dick Cheney. It was too late to save his own popularity. When voters went to the polls in November, 2008, Bush’s job-approval rating dipped to twenty per cent, the lowest of any outgoing President in the history of polling.","1383","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Voices of restraint can still be heard in the Party’s debates, including on Jeb Bush’s team. One adviser, in contrast to Reich, told me, “I’m sure he’s not going to invade Iraq again. We did that one. You can’t compare him to his brother, because his brother was operating in a different environment. We had just been attacked; we didn’t know what was coming next.”","1384","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Senator Lindsey Graham, whose candidacy is essentially limited to a hard-line foreign policy, said his opponents were trying to sort out the politics of interventionism. “Here’s the problem,” he said, “Republicans know it’s not popular to be for Obama’s foreign policy, but they’re nervous about how far to go. They’re trying to find out where the public is, and trying to take the public’s pulse. They’re trying to figure out where the market is—where’s the sweet spot?”","1385","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, who is also running for President, told me that he thinks he’s found it: a foreign policy that channels Reagan, by far the most popular Republican in modern history. In Cruz’s Senate office, we sat under an enormous painting depicting Ronald Reagan’s 1987 speech at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, in which he declared, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.”","1386","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz is forty-four, eighteen years younger than Jeb Bush. Other politicians of his generation, including Marco Rubio, also forty-four, were strongly influenced by 9/11, but Cruz told me that he draws more lessons from Reagan’s fight against Communism than from Bush’s and Obama’s fight against terrorism. “The foreign-policy events that shaped my world view the most did not occur in the past two Presidencies,” he said. “I believe in peace through strength. It’s worth underscoring. Reagan went through eight years in the Presidency, and the biggest country he ever invaded was Grenada.”","1387","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He emphasized that “among Republicans there is a spectrum of views of foreign policy. At one end, there is Rand Paul”—a non-interventionist who is the most skeptical of further involvement in Syria and Iraq. “At the other end, I would put John McCain. Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio are very similar to McCain. I would describe my views as a third point on the triangle.” He believes that “America should always be a clarion voice of liberty, and that the bully pulpit of the Presidency has enormous power. There is power to speaking the truth on a global stage.” He added, “However, speaking for freedom is not the same thing as using U.S. military force. Historically, America has always been reluctant to engage in military force.”","1388","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Reagan’s foreign policy was rhetorically idealistic but also deeply pragmatic. Although he described the Soviet Union as “the evil empire,” he was quick to negotiate with Gorbachev. Soon after Hezbollah attacked the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, in 1983, killing two hundred and forty-one Americans, Reagan said that a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon would send a “signal to terrorists everywhere: they can gain by waging war against innocent people.” But then he did it anyway, after concluding that the troops’ mission was unclear and that their presence offered too inviting a target to extremists.","1389","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"This strain of pragmatism was powerful enough that George W. Bush called for a “humble” foreign policy in his 2000 campaign, and condemned the kinds of democracy-building interventions for which he would later become known. Cruz strives to return the G.O.P. to its pre-9/11 philosophy. “If and when U.S. military force is required,” he told me, “it should, No. 1, always be to directly further the vital national security of the United States. No. 2, we should use overwhelming force. And, No. 3, we should get the heck out. It should not be the objective of our armed forces to engage in nation-building, to transform foreign nations into robust, utopian democracies.”","1390","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"While many Republicans now criticize Obama for not doing enough in Syria, Cruz was among those who opposed Obama’s 2013 request to strike Syria. “He repeatedly tried to justify this as ‘vindicating international norms,’ or as ‘the violation of international law,’ ” Cruz said. “It’s not the job of our military to behave like a law professor in a faculty lounge, vindicating international law. It’s the job of our military to protect the safety and security of three hundred and thirty million Americans.” He said that although “Assad is a monster” who “has used poison gas” and “killed hundreds of thousands of his own citizens,” he worries about what might happen “if the attack succeeds and you topple Assad, and the weapons then fall into the hands of Al Qaeda or Al Nusra or ISIS or any of the other radical Islamic terrorists.” (Donald Trump has said that he’s happy to have Russia in Syria fighting ISIS, though he failed to note that, so far, Russia has been mainly targeting U.S.-trained rebels, not ISIS.)","1391","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz added that the military commanders he has consulted insist that “the most potent tool to use against ISIS is overwhelming airpower.” He maintained that arming the Kurds in northern Iraq was a better alternative to sending U.S. troops. “We need boots on the ground, but they don’t necessarily need to be American boots,” he said. “The Kurds are our boots on the ground.”","1392","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But Cruz’s prescription may be more like Reagan’s supply-side tax cuts than like Reagan’s foreign policy: it promises enormous benefits with very little sacrifice. Graham, who wants American troops to lead the fight, scoffed at Cruz’s argument. “The Kurds don’t have any offensive capability,” he said, pointing out that Shiites and non-Kurdish Sunnis in Iraq and Syria would be as concerned about Kurdish advances as they are about ISIS. “They’re not gonna go down to Ramadi! Go ask the Kurds, ‘Would you help us liberate Syria?’ And they’d say, ‘Thank you, but no thank you.’ If you want to create a war to end all wars, have a marauding band of Kurds going through the Middle East.”","1393","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz has calculated that, despite the rise of ISIS, Republican voters are still hungover from the costly interventions of the Bush years, and that they share his skepticism about the ability of American troops to accomplish much in Iraq and Syria. “There are some politicians in Washington who approach foreign military action as if they’re playing Risk,” he said. “They want to deploy troops and command them in battle.” He added, “A number of politicians treat American boots on the ground as a talisman to demonstrate that they’re really tough.”","1394","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Obama, who has said that he was elected to end wars, not start them, has bombed more countries than George W. Bush did. But in fighting terrorism he has chosen to use drones and other forms of airpower, Special Forces, and proxy armies. Obama was skeptical about intervening to stop Muammar Qaddafi’s forces as they marched on a helpless population in Benghazi, Libya. He had to be talked into the operation by, among others, Hillary Clinton, and the result—a failed state in Libya that has created a haven for terrorists—shaped his skepticism about intervening in Syria.","1395","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Early on, key Republicans seemed to endorse Obama’s cautious approach. When Marco Rubio ran for the Senate in 2010, he supported Obama’s drawdown of troops in Iraq. As a former city commissioner in West Miami and then a state legislator, Rubio knew the foreign-policy issues that important Florida constituencies care about, such as the Jewish community’s staunchly pro-Israel views and the Cuban-American community’s fierce opposition to Castro. He had little experience with broader foreign-policy questions. In his early months in Congress, he supported attempts at diplomacy with Iran. During the 2013 fight over budget cuts, Rubio advocated for government-spending reform. He has since grown less cautionary, arguing for an increase in military spending and calling it the “most important obligation of the federal government.”","1396","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio, who was a leader in the Florida House while Jeb Bush was governor and is now his nearest opponent in the race, though they are both well behind Trump and Carson in most national polls, has recently positioned himself as one of the most hawkish Republicans running for President. McCain noted that Rubio, like others, had shifted into his camp after the emergence of ISIS, and he joked that Rubio has a history of switching positions, which McCain gently mocked by licking his finger and holding it in the air.","1397","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Recently, Rubio told me that he no longer believes that Obama’s drawdown was wise. “We are retreating from Afghanistan and Iraq, not anticipating the vacuum that would be left behind and the potential that creates for radicalism,” he said. His shift might seem political, but he suggested that it was the result of becoming immersed in issues, as a senator, to which, as a candidate, he had given little thought. He noted that some of his opponents, including Jeb Bush, have never held federal office. “I’m a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee,” Rubio said. “I spend a significant amount of time working on these issues on a daily basis. So most certainly I’m going to have more insight than someone reading briefings from the staffers.”","1398","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio’s foreign policy is a clear response to Obama’s alleged retreat from the world. The President’s biggest mistakes, in this view, were all failures to intervene more aggressively. Rubio has said that he would have forcefully taken the side of demonstrators in Iran during the 2009 Green Revolution. “The President was so intent on negotiating with Iran’s tyrants that he did little to help its people,” he remarked in a speech in Washington in 2011.","1399","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But the key issue for many emerging Republican hawks was Obama’s failure to attack Assad when he used chemical weapons. Obama had drawn a “red line,” but then retreated. Instead, he accepted a deal negotiated with Putin to place the weapons under international control. “Everyone heard him,” Reich said. “He said, ‘I didn’t draw the red line, the world drew a red line.’ No, Mr. President, the world didn’t stand before the cameras in the White House and say that it was drawing a red line; you did. . . . It’s very dangerous.”","1400","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"George Shultz, who is ninety-four and is also a Bush adviser, was Reagan’s Secretary of State. He said that the red line was one of the biggest mistakes of Obama’s Presidency. “I don’t think the President realizes how much damage was done,” he said. “I remember when I was in marine boot camp, at the start of World War Two, and the sergeant hands me this rifle and says, ‘Take good care of this rifle—this is your best friend. Remember one thing: never point this rifle at anybody unless you’re willing to pull the trigger.’ No empty threats. That’s boot-camp wisdom. With Obama there are empty threats lying all over the place, and they undermine his credibility.”","1401","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"This outlook relies on some revisionist history. When Obama asked Congress for authorization to bomb Syria in 2013, several Republicans, Rubio among them, voted against the resolution in the Foreign Relations Committee, and many others announced that they would oppose it on the Senate floor. It never came to a vote. Rubio said that the Administration’s proposed attack was not sufficiently robust; now he cites the failure to use force as the reason for much of the current chaos, including Putin’s recent involvement.","1402","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio told me that years ago he warned that the power vacuums in the Middle East were being filled by Islamic extremists, and he noted ISIS’s growing role in Afghanistan, where it had previously had little presence. “If they continue unabated a year from now, we could live in a world where ISIS is now operating in vacated spaces in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya,” he said. Rubio is a favorite of G.O.P. hawks. Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas billionaire who spent some $100 million in the 2012 election and is wooed by almost every Republican candidate, is reportedly also a fan. But Rubio sounds more cautious when asked for details about how to defeat ISIS.","1403","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“Intervening doesn’t mean ground troops,” he said. “Intervening can be a lot of things.” He went on, “A full-scale invasion, sending a hundred thousand troops to Iraq right now, is probably not the best way to defeat ISIS. Because it very well may be what they hope will happen, because it will allow them to point to radicals around the world and attract more recruits and more funding. I think that the better approach is to empower Sunni tribes to defeat them. And they need a lot of help from us, including air strikes and special-op forces.”","1404","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"What Rubio laid out wasn’t very different from Obama’s current plan. When pressed, he conceded that many more American troops might be necessary. “There’s no magic number,” he said. “I don’t know if nine thousand is worse than eleven thousand. What matters is: first you have to establish a mission—what are you trying to achieve? Then you have to allow the military to come up with operations and how to achieve that mission. And that will determine the number in the mission, not the other way around.”","1405","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio, Graham, and many other Republicans believe that the nation’s foreign policy suffers from timidity, not from overexertion. The problem is in the execution, not the intervention itself. “Here’s what I’ve learned,” Graham told me. “If you don’t have a plan after you take Afghanistan down, after you take Iraq down, after you take Libya down, after you take Syria down, you’re going to regret it.”","1406","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Given the failed states and the civil wars gripping Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, I asked Graham for an example of a successful intervention that would bolster his case for a more hawkish foreign policy. We were sitting outside, in Manchester, New Hampshire, and he was eating nachos. He looked at me excitedly, racing to swallow so that he could get to his answer: “How about Germany and Japan?”","1407","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Even as Bush watches his opponents solidify their foreign-policy positions, he has struggled to come to terms with his brother’s ideology. His opponents criticize him for being vague or unengaged. Graham told me, “I think he’s a work-in-progress. I think he’s been out of the game for ten years. . . . He’s gotta convince people that three Bushes are not one too many.”","1408","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Jeb Bush’s troubles began almost as soon as he declared his candidacy and included the eighty-five-year-old James Baker on his list. As Communism began to collapse, in 1989, Bush and Baker helped engineer a soft landing for the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the gradual reorientation of Europe’s Eastern Bloc countries toward the West. Hawks pilloried them for not asserting themselves strongly enough. When Bush went to Kiev, Ukraine, for instance, and warned Ukrainians not to secede from the Soviet Union, the address was mocked as the “chicken Kiev” speech. In 1991, after assembling a United Nations-backed coalition to push Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, Bush and Baker ignored the pleas of American neoconservatives who wanted U.S. forces to march on Baghdad and overthrow Saddam following the uprisings against his rule. They were again demonized. Wolfowitz said that it was as if America were “idly watching a mugging.” In 2006, Baker co-chaired the Iraq Study Group, which recommended a dramatic change in Bush’s policy in the Middle East, including the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Iraq and diplomatic engagement with Iran and Syria, policies that Bush rejected.","1409","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"When Baker appeared on Jeb Bush’s list, neoconservatives expressed alarm. His foreign-policy views—diplomacy, stability, and serious doubts about interventions requiring large numbers of U.S. troops—are closer to Obama’s than to George W. Bush’s. Jeb Bush faced a revolt from donors and excoriation in neoconservative publications. A few weeks after Jeb’s announcement, Baker was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at a Washington gala dinner for J Street, the liberal-leaning pro-Israel group founded in 2008 to act as a counterweight to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Commentary published an article about “Jeb Bush’s James Baker Problem” and warned that Jeb may be Baker’s “kindred spirit.” Mark Levin, an influential talk-radio host, wrote that “Jeb Bush turns to Israel-hater, Jim Baker, for foreign policy advice.” Adelson reportedly sent word to Bush that he should pressure Baker to cancel the speech. Bush declined, and Adelson’s allies leaked that Adelson wouldn’t support Bush.","1410","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"At the J Street dinner, Baker criticized Benjamin Netanyahu for “diplomatic missteps and political gamesmanship,” and spoke about his own role in the first Bush Administration’s withholding of loan guarantees to Israel in order to pressure the government to halt settlement construction. William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, called Baker “anti-Israel,” and tweeted, “Thankfully, James Baker doesn’t speak for today’s Republican Party.” Morton Klein, the president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America, told Bloomberg that Bush’s association with Baker would cost the candidate: “There are many mega-donors who will not be with him because of that.”","1411","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In May, Bush appeared in New York, at the Metropolitan Club, before an audience of financiers organized by Paul Singer, a hedge-fund manager and the kind of Republican mega-donor Klein had warned about. Someone asked Bush to explain Baker’s influence on his policymaking. According to the Washington Post, Jeb “said that he respected Baker, but maintained that he is not part of his foreign-policy team.” CNN, which cited four sources and the notes of someone present, quotes Bush as saying, “What you need to know is that who I listen to when I need advice on the Middle East is George W. Bush.” The Bush campaign later insisted that Jeb was speaking narrowly about Israeli policy. Either way, the message was clear: the hawks were back in control of Republican foreign policy.","1412","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Lately, in his effort to be his “own man,” Bush has displayed a willingness to move even further to the right than his brother. At the October 2nd interview in South Carolina, Wilson asked him about the U.S. prison at Guantánamo Bay. During George W. Bush’s tenure, the prison became such a source of shame for America that even Bush, who was loath to acknowledge mistakes or to bow to international pressure, said in 2007, “It should be a goal of the nation to shut down Guantánamo.” Jeb disagrees. Wilson asked if Guantánamo prisoners should be moved to maximum-security facilities in the U.S. “No,” Jeb said. “There is no option for these folks. They should stay where they are. Even if it’s—it’s expensive. It’s the nicest prison you’ll ever want to be in, by the way. And the rights of these terrorists are way beyond what a lot of people get in a lot of different circumstances. They’re not being mistreated at all. But there is no other option.”","1413","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"If the economy improves, and Democrats continue to maintain an advantage on domestic issues, the Republican candidates will increasingly highlight foreign policy, an area of perceived vulnerability for Obama and Clinton. McCain, who lost to Obama in 2008, said, perhaps hopefully, “National security, foreign policy, and terrorism will play a greater role in the decision-making of the American people than at any time since 1980.” He insisted that although Bush’s record on foreign policy contributed to his own defeat, “it has gone from a significant negative” at the start of the Obama Administration “to what has become more and more of a positive.”","1414","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In August, Bush travelled to Simi Valley, California, to give a speech on foreign policy at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Bush called Reagan “a leader of clarity and resolve, not given to idle words,” someone “who took command of events, rebuilt America’s strength, and moved the world toward peace.” But when he shifted from Reagan’s Cold War successes to more recent events his speech sounded more like a tribute to the Administration of George W. Bush.","1415","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“No leader or policymaker involved will claim to have gotten everything right in the region, Iraq especially,” he said. But he argued that, whatever mistakes were made, it was the surge of troops in 2007 that “turned events toward victory.” The surge “was a success—brilliant, heroic, and costly.” It was Obama who lost Iraq, not his brother. The “premature withdrawal was the fatal error,” Jeb said, referring to Obama’s gradual drawdown, “creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill—and that Iran has exploited to the full as well.”","1416","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He then turned this logic against the Democrats’ most likely nominee. “ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat,” he said. “And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the President himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away. In all her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly one time.”","1417","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Clinton herself has tried to create some distance from Obama’s record. Since leaving the Administration, she has repeatedly said that as Secretary of State she urged Obama to do more in the early days of the Syrian uprising against Assad, when moderates could still be found in that country and American intervention could, arguably, have made a difference. Obama has dismissed that view as “a fantasy.” But, whatever Clinton actually believes about the correct course in the Middle East, she has already shown that she will adopt the campaign position that best suits her politically. In early October, facing a challenge from the left from Bernie Sanders, she reversed her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that she championed as Secretary of State.","1418","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"It’s easy to attack Obama as feckless in the face of the chaos in Libya, Syria, and Iraq. Less apparent is how to translate vague campaign promises to do something into a plan that won’t put more American lives at risk. After Jeb Bush spoke with Wilson in South Carolina, he met with reporters backstage. His aides were scrambling to contain any fallout from the “stuff happens” remark, which had immediately elicited a response from President Obama, and echoed one of the most notorious statements of the Bush Administration: Rumsfeld’s declaration during the chaos in Iraq that “stuff happens.” After defending his remark, Jeb Bush then took some questions about Syria, Iraq, and Putin.","1419","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He has called for a no-fly zone over Syria that would help a Sunni-led army fight a two-front war against Assad and ISIS, but it’s unclear who would make up the forces. He told reporters that American airpower in Syria is “restricted by lawyers kind of imposing all sorts of conditions.” He would change the rules, he said, so “that it would be there to fight to win.” He didn’t specify which rules he would lift, but, as Graham noted, almost every military expert dismisses the idea that airpower alone can defeat ISIS. “The only way you destroy a big ground opponent is with another big ground opponent,” Graham told me. “You’re not going to bomb ISIL into submission. You gotta go tear the caliphate up by the roots. That means going into Syria on the ground.”","1420","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"To fight ISIS in Iraq, Bush made the familiar argument that America should arm the Kurds and “embed with the Iraqi military,” both of which Obama is effectively doing. When asked whether he would send more troops, Bush said that the U.S. already has thirty-five hundred troops in Iraq and that the real issue was how to better integrate them into Iraqi forces. Pressed further, he conceded, in a roundabout way, that he would be willing to send more American troops back to Iraq.","1421","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I would listen to the military commanders and I would create a strategy,” he said, a phrase that politicians revert to whenever they want to avoid details. “If it required more supportive troops, fine.” The statement was a reminder of Bush’s continuing dilemma: can he get the nomination without violating his principles? In the months since the start of his campaign, he has only clouded the matter of what, precisely, he stands for.","1422","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"At one point, someone asked Bush a churlish question about his father’s 1991 statement regarding the possibility of “a new world order” after the Cold War ended.

"“I don’t even know what that means anymore,” he said. “In 1992, it meant the end of Communism, and that the United States needed to play a constructive role in forging peace and security, and we still have that role to play. We have threats that are created by our absence. Just look at what’s going on in Syria as an example of that, where we have no strategy, where Putin, agile as he is, ends up injecting himself into something that makes it harder for me to imagine that this brutal Assad regime will depart.” He thought for a moment and added, “American leadership matters.” ♦","1424","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

"A teaser for the new “Daily Show”—“The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” which made its début last night—ran immediately before the broadcast began. It featured, over a shot of Noah opening his eyes and looking up at the camera almost sleepily, a snippet of Kanye West’s “Power”: “No one man should have all that power.” That song, one of the sly anthems at the beginning of “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” feels like something you’d play when a new leader takes the stage. But the single line they used felt like a subliminal message, or an overt one. “Daily Show” fans love and need what Jon Stewart made “The Daily Show”; since he announced his departure and Noah was chosen to succeed him, we’ve lived in a state of game apprehension, at best.","September 29, 2015","1443","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"At first, it was because American audiences barely knew Noah: we knew that he was young (thirty-one), handsome, biracial, hugely popular in South Africa. His three appearances on “The Daily Show” were awkward, but so are many guest appearances on “The Daily Show.” Then, after several of his dumb, awful, not-that-old tweets were discovered and publicized, our game apprehension turned to something like hopeful dread. It was hard to imagine someone who made lame jokes about Jews and “fat chicks” becoming what Stewart had been. Stewart, who loved to be silly and vulgar as much as anybody, was also deeply respectful, humble, kind—he mocked the powerful and the malevolent and instinctively defended everybody else. But had we made too big a deal about Stewart? Probably. You could sense that Stewart had perhaps had enough of our worship. No one man should have all that power.","1444","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"“This is ‘The Daily Show with Trevor Noah’!” an announcer’s voice said. Then came the familiar fanfare and intro with new, slicker-looking graphics, which now include, as Neil DeGrasse Tyson pointed out, “the Earth rotating in the correct direction.” Trevor Noah looked happy—so far, so good. “Welcome to ‘The Daily Show’! Welcome to ‘The Daily Show’!” He flapped his hands, already Jon Stewart-level annoyed-humble. “I’m Trevor Noah! Thank you so much for joining us!” He launched right in, almost as if he’d been doing it all along, and said that Kevin Hart would be joining us. Then he took a step back.","1445","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"“Before we get started, I just want to say a few things,” he said. “This is surreal for me. Growing up in the dusty streets of South Africa, I never dreamed that I would one day have—well, two things, really. An indoor toilet, and a job as host of ‘The Daily Show.’ And now I have both. And I’m quite comfortable with one of them.”","1446","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"Ha! It was reassuring to start off with a toilet joke, somehow. But I was wondering: Is he mocking himself and South African poverty, or are the other writers doing it? And when we laugh, what are we laughing at? “Now I’m in the chair and I can only assume it is as strange for you as it is for me. Jon Stewart was more than just a late-night host. He was often our voice, our refuge. And in many ways, our political dad. And it’s weird. Because Dad has left.” He looked grave. This was excellent—the studio audience laughed its head off. “And now it feels like the family has a new stepdad. And he’s black.” We were back in topnotch “Daily Show” territory here, and it felt good. He was teasing us, acknowledging the truth of our love and expectations and his newness and difference. The crowd went wild. “Which, ah, which is not ideal.” What? Not ideal that he’s black? What do we do with that?","1447","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"Noah went on to explain, warmly enough, that “Comedy Central did ask women to host, and the women they asked turned the job down, because they all had better things to do, and clearly knew something I didn’t.” American hosts had also turned the job down. “So, once more, a job Americans rejected is now being done by an immigrant,” he said. He thanked Jon Stewart: “I’m not quite sure what you saw in me, but I’ll work hard every day to find it, and I’ll make you not look like the crazy old dude who left his inheritance to some random kid from Africa.” He thanked us, the viewers, and pledged to “continue the war on bullshit.” This was a great start, and we were with him, all in this together.","1448","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"Then, the news, or what I tend to consider, on “The Daily Show,” the fun part. Noah did an able job with the fun part, and seemed to be enjoying himself. “Now, seeing as this is my first show, we wanted to start it off with something a little light, so here we go: Syria. Just kidding—it’s the Pope! YEAGHHHHHHHH!” he yelled. He put his arms in the air. There was a fine bit about Pope-themed emojis: Popemojis. “For when you want to inject just the right amount of confusion into your late-night sexting. Sup, girl! You up? Because eggplant winky face cartoon Pope likes cheesesteaks! Good luck figuring that one out.” It was great to have “The Daily Show” back, and the jokes about the Pope’s tiny Fiat (“Somebody’s undercompensating!”) and the Boehner resignation (“No! Why leave now? I have a fancy suit and a new set and I learned how to pronounce your name! Boehner!”—wink) were fun. But there’s a bad-feeling flip side of some of this. Some of the jokes were mean or weird: a good joke about Club Congress was undermined by “and everyone has aides.” Any joke about people having AIDS feels like the eighties, in the worst way. The crowd audibly recoiled. A joke about crack and meth and Whitney Houston, delivered hammily, was upsetting. The crowd recoiled again. “Too soon?” Noah said.","1449","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"Later, Kevin Hart came onstage. In the new setup, they seemed to sit very close together, and Hart, a live-wire who kept turning away from Noah and toward the audience, looked like he was going to spin off like a top, perhaps to start his own talk show. Noah said that he loved Hart’s series “Real Husbands of Hollywood,” and, perhaps to keep things rolling when the audience didn’t applaud, asked if he was still a mitch.","1450","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"Hart said, “For those of you who don’t know, mitch is a male term for a bitch. Yes, I am very much a male bitch.”","1451","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"“I don’t know if that’s true anymore,” Noah said. “You are very much a comedic rock star.” He cited some reasons: pushups, muscles, action-movie star.","1452","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"What is a male bitch?, people might be wondering. Which bad stereotype of a woman inspired it? A crazy female jerk? Somebody who’s been bitch-slapped? A kind of “making you my bitch” thing? And why did Noah lead with that?","1453","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"This exchange left me feeling like a female mitch. There had been several such moments: ha ha ha—hey! We’re all laughing together—oof! Wait, are they laughing at me? People with AIDS? The death of Whitney Houston? What the hell? Are we bullies? Are they?","1454","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"We want to love and trust our new comedy stepdad. But in part because of Noah’s tweets, we don’t yet have reason to trust who’s making the jokes, and what he’s laughing at. He and the writers should work extra hard to earn our trust. That means, basically, be funny, but don’t be an asshole. Don’t say it’s “not ideal” to have a black stepdad. Err on the side of kindness. You can be funny and still do this. Lay off the bitches and the mitches.","1455","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"
"At the end of the show, the feeling of game apprehension and hopeful dread remained. But our mood was given a boost by Larry Wilmore, at 11:30. “New ‘Daily Show’ viewers, don’t be confused!” Wilmore said. “I’m a different light-skinned brother late-night host. That’s right! It’s the first time late night’s gone black to black!” This was a thrilling moment. And Wilmore, who has our trust—he’s had it from the beginning, when he was so good on “The Daily Show”—launched right in. “Also: Ben Carson continues talking shit about Muslims! And I continue not giving a shit about Ben Carson!” Then he cited a recent Jeb Bush remark about Democrats luring black voters with “free stuff.” “Hey Jeb! Here’s something for free!” He reached into his pocket and gave Jeb! the finger. This felt deeply satisfying, and he later followed it up with a smart, sobering analysis of a passage from Jeb’s 1996 book “Profiles in Character.” O.K., Comedy Central: I like where this is going. Take us into 2016.","1456","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut"

"The days when Labor Day marked the beginning of the electoral season have long gone. Thanks to information technology, money, and the Supreme Court, we live in the era of the permanent campaign. But the end of summer still feels like a significant marker, and it provides a good moment to take stock of a set of events that surely would have prompted the good Doctor, had he been alive to chronicle them, to send out for another bottle of Wild Turkey.","1458","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Let’s start, as we must, at Trump Tower, where, last Thursday, Reince Priebus, the boyish-looking forty-three-year-old who has the unenviable task of heading up the Republican National Committee, presented a piece of paper to the fellow whose name is on the building. “I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,” the words on the paper said. “I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.” Donald Trump filled in his name in a blank space at the start of the text and signed at the bottom. He or someone else got the date wrong, writing August 3rd instead of September 3rd, but that didn’t matter: the deed had been done.","1459","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"A few weeks ago, when the loyalty pledge was first mooted, it looked like a clever insurance policy for the Republicans. After all, if Trump were to run as an independent and win even four or five per cent of the vote, he could easily hand the Presidential election to the Democrats. But as Trump extended and enlarged his position as the G.O.P. frontrunner, Priebus’s ploy came to take on a rather different aspect. From the vantage of Trump and his advisers, it must have seemed as if the Republican establishment, which they hold in utter disdain, were repeating the mistake of the Trojans and pulling the Greek horse into its midst.","1460","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"If Trump’s candidacy fails, as Priebus and his colleagues are dearly hoping that it will, whoever wins the Republican nomination won’t have to worry about Trump running as a third-party candidate: that’s the theory, anyway. But for the author of “The Art of the Deal,” this was a concession well worth making. For one thing, it assured him that his name will be on the G.O.P. primary ballot in every state, including those, like South Carolina, that had made (or threatened to make) a loyalty pledge a pre-condition for participating. Secondly, the signed pledge goes at least some way toward immunizing Trump against the charge that Jeb Bush had levelled at him on the very morning he signed it: that he isn’t a real conservative, or even a genuine Republican.","1461","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Finally, and most importantly from Trump’s standpoint, if all the other G.O.P. hopefuls go down—or rather, if they fail to get up from the prostrate position Trump’s summer stampede through the polls has left most of them in—the pledge insures that Trump will be guaranteed the support of the party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. As Jim Newell remarked at Slate, “Trump has not pledged to incorporate into his candidacy any of the cheerier tones or traditional Republican policies that the GOP establishment would like to see from him. The Republican Party, though, has agreed to incorporate Trump.” No wonder that, once Preibus had left, Trump called in the press and said he “will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands.” He added: “We will go out and fight hard, and we will win. We will win.”","1462","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"That remains an unlikely outcome, but not nearly as unlikely as it seemed a couple of months ago. Monmouth University’s poll data for June showed Trump’s favorable rating among likely Republican voters to be twenty per cent and his unfavorable rating to be fifty-five per cent. In Monmouth’s latest poll, which was released last week, Trump’s favorable rating among Republicans had jumped to fifty-nine per cent, and his unfavorable rating had fallen to twenty-nine per cent. Even in an era of declining party loyalty and footloose voters, these numbers represent an astonishing turnaround—and one that has sent pollsters searching, largely in vain, for a historical analogy. It isn’t unheard of for a previously unknown candidate to take off like a rocket before exploding at high altitude. But Trump wasn’t an unknown. He was a familiar television personality and blowhard, about whom the majority of Republicans harbored critical opinions. In just a couple of months, he has reversed many of those opinions, raising his positive rating by nearly forty percentage points and lowering his negative rating by almost thirty points.","1463","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Political scientists will be arguing for years about how he managed this feat. Clearly, his critical comments about Mexicans, and his pledge to deport as many as eleven million undocumented immigrants, struck a chord, as did his promise to renegotiate trade agreements that have cost jobs. But what really seems to have enthused the Republican electorate is Trump’s renegade attitude toward the Party establishment and the press. Every time he describes Washington as a hopeless cesspit, paints Jeb Bush as an ineffectual ninny, and jumps on anybody in the media who tries to question him, his numbers go up. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Real Clear Politics poll average showed him leading Ben Carson, another political outsider, by 27.8 per cent to 13.5 per cent at the national level, with all the other candidates stuck in single figures.","1464","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Developments on the Democratic side have been a bit less dramatic, but pretty remarkable nonetheless. At the start of the year, practically nobody in Washington took seriously the prospect of a Bernie Sanders Presidential candidacy. Indeed, some Hillary Clinton supporters were hoping that he would run, on the grounds that he would fill a potentially dangerous void to the left of Clinton with an unelectable presence. Now Sanders is running well ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire, the second primary state, and he’s gaining ground in Iowa, the first primary state.","1465","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The level of concern in the Clinton camp is perhaps best conveyed by two reports that appeared in the Times in the past few days, which were based on briefings from Clinton staffers and supporters. One of the stories said that, going forward, the candidate would seek to present a more likable side, demonstrating that she possesses a sense of humor and a beating heart. The other Times article said that the Clinton campaign is hoping to build a “political firewall across the South” starting on Super Tuesday, March 1st, when a dozen states, nine of them below the Mason-Dixon line, will vote in the Democratic primary. A firewall to contain Sanders? He was supposed to be incapable of lighting a gas stove, let alone sparking a raging brush fire.","1466","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"How did the Democratic primary come to this? Sanders deserves credit for recognizing that there is a resurgent progressive movement in the United States, one based on the proposition—shared by many Tea Party members, and even Trump—that American politics is now hopelessly corrupt. Once Elizabeth Warren made it clear that she wasn’t interested in acting as the movement’s standard-bearer in 2016, Sanders seized the opportunity. As the lone Socialist in Congress, he was never going to be accused of being an opportunist or a Johnny-come-lately to the progressive cause. But, at the age of seventy-three, he needed to show that he had the fire and the durability to be a Presidential candidate. This he has certainly done. Rather than engaging Clinton directly, he has stuck to the issues, calling for the public financing of elections, free enrollment at state universities, a breakup of the big banks, and a minimum wage of fifteen dollars an hour. All of these policies are popular, particularly with college-educated liberals, who have been flocking to Sanders in huge numbers.","1467","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The Vermont senator has earned his current position in the race. But he has also received a good deal of help from Clinton, who, despite the endorsement of many senior figures in the Party, is still struggling to recover from some self-inflicted wounds. Earlier in the year, when the stories about her private e-mail system and the tangled finances of the Clinton Global Foundation started to come out, it seemed like the money story would prove the most serious, but it is the e-mail saga that has plagued Clinton’s every step. It continues to damage her reputation. Recently, pollsters from Quinnipiac University asked a random sample of voters which word they most associated with various candidates. When Clinton’s name was mentioned, the three most popular answers were “liar,” “dishonest,” and “untrustworthy.”","1468","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"After this poll received a lot of publicity, some Hillary supporters argued that Quinnipiac had hyped the findings, and they raised some sound points. Out of a sample of fifteen hundred and sixty-three voters, a hundred and eighty-seven people answered “liar,” and it’s probably fair to assume that the vast majority were Republicans. (The sample contained six hundred and sixty-six self-identified Republicans.) Undoubtedly, much of the venom directed at Clinton is coming from ardent G.O.P. supporters, and this shouldn’t be overlooked. But it’s also true that her approval rating among independent and moderate voters has fallen sharply. In a P.P.P. poll released in April, fifty per cent of self-identified moderates had a favorable opinion of Clinton, and forty-one per cent had an unfavorable opinion. Now these numbers have flipped. A P.P.P. poll released last week showed that thirty-nine per cent of moderates view Clinton favorably, and forty-nine per cent view her unfavorably.*","1469","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The e-mail saga has surely helped to drive this turnaround. While Clinton’s insistence that she didn’t break any laws or violate any rules appears to be true, her explanation for why she did it—for the sake of convenience—beggars belief. The more she repeats this line, the harder it seems to be for voters to avoid the conclusion that she has something to hide. Last week, Clinton told NBC News’s Andrea Mitchell that she wasn’t thinking much about the server when she set it up. “We had so many problems around the world,” Clinton said. “I didn’t really stop and think, What kind of e-mail system will there be?” The day after the interview, the Washington Post reported that Clinton had personally paid a State Department staffer to set up the private e-mail server, maintain it, and keep it going. And in case you missed it, the staffer, Bryan Pagliano, has reportedly indicated that he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence rather than testify before Congress.","1470","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"To state the obvious, it’s a worrying situation for Clinton. In the past few months, she has laid out a series of liberal-leaning policies on everything from student loans to day care to short-termism on Wall Street. (On Tuesday, she outlined her plans for campaign-finance reform.) Once the televised Democratic debates get started, in October, this extensive and detailed platform, together with Clinton’s ability to master complex policy issues, should place her in a strong position. But for all the political good it’s done her so far, she could have spent her time quoting from the Book of Deuteronomy (or Thompson’s favorite, the Book of Revelation). In media coverage of the Clinton campaign, and particularly in broadcast coverage, the e-mail story has overshadowed everything else, and it isn’t going away.","1471","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"On Monday, the Times reported that an intelligence review has concluded that some of the information Clinton received at her personal account was “top secret,” although it wasn’t marked classified at the time. In all probability, there will be more such stories. Indeed, as Labor Day approached, Clinton appeared to be trapped in the same kind of three-sided vice that, over the decades, has crushed many Washington figures. Simultaneously, she had to contend with an F.B.I. investigation into whether classified information was mishandled; a hostile Congressional committee under the control of the opposition party; and a media eager to report any damaging leaks from the authorities. Small wonder that Vice-President Joe Biden was seriously considering a late entry into the Democratic race.","1472","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"All this, and there are still five months until the first primary voter casts a ballot. Before crowning Trump or burying Clinton, it is worth keeping this reality in mind—and a few others, too, such as the fact that early leads in primary races often prove ephemeral. It is certainly possible that Trump will go ahead and win the Republican nomination, but as Larry Sabato and his colleagues at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics said of Trump, in a post at Politico on Monday, “It’s far more likely he will fade long before the primary season does.” Only now is he being subjected to sustained attacks from other Republicans, and, as yet, the media scrutiny of his record has been cursory. For instance, we are still awaiting the first major investigative report into how many undocumented immigrants are employed at the hotels and golf courses that bear Trump’s name.

"On the Democratic side, Clinton remains highly popular inside her own party, and she has the support of important interest groups that help to mobilize Democratic voters. In the latest national poll of Democrats and voters who lean Democrat, which was released by Monmouth on Tuesday, she was leading Biden by twenty percentage points and Sanders by twenty-two percentage points. Among the electorate at large, Clinton’s favorable rating has fallen well below fifty per cent. But among the Democratic electorate, seventy-one per cent of voters have a favorable view of the former Secretary of State, and just seventeen per cent have an unfavorable view.","1474","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Seeking to solidify her position and change the post-Labor Day media narrative, Clinton on Tuesday apologized for setting up her own e-mail server, telling ABC News’s David Muir, “That was a mistake. I’m sorry about that. I take responsibility.” It remains to be seen what impact, if any, this statement will have on the polls, but many of Clinton’s supporters will welcome the interview as a step in the right direction. “As long as the email mess doesn’t sink her, Clinton could lose both heavily white Iowa and New Hampshire, and still have a fairly unobstructed path to the nomination because of her mighty position with women and minorities,” Sabato and his colleagues wrote on Politico. “This is true even if Vice President Joe Biden enters the race.”","1475","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"

On Friday, as Hillary Clinton was basking in the reaction to her marathon appearance before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, her communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, told reporters that the hour between nine and ten o’clock on Thursday night, after the hearing finally finished, was the campaign’s best fund-raising hour yet. And also on Friday, A.F.S.C.M.E., the largest public-sector union in the country, announced that it was endorsing Clinton for the Presidency—an important win in her tussle with Senator Bernie Sanders for the backing of organized labor.","October 25, 2015","1479","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Meanwhile, the campaign of the supposed Republican front-runner, Jeb Bush, was letting it be known that it was laying off people and slashing its payroll by forty per cent. It’s well known that the Bush campaign has been spending heavily, and there have been persistent rumors that, with the candidate trailing badly in the polls, its fund-raising efforts had stalled. Evidently, these rumors were accurate. Seeking to put a positive spin on things, the Bush campaign portrayed the cost-cutting as an effort to play the long game and direct resources toward the early primary states—Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. “This is about winning the race,” a Bush adviser told Bloomberg Politics. “We’re doing it now and making the shifts with confidence. We expect to win.”","1480","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Campaign advisers have to make such statements. But many people in the G.O.P. are losing confidence in Bush. A new poll from Iowa, which was released on Thursday, showed the former Florida governor garnering just five per cent of the votes among likely Republican voters. Perhaps the poll, from Quinnipiac University, was an outlier? No, it wasn’t. On Friday, another Iowa survey, this one carried out by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics, also showed Bush at just five per cent. “By any honest analysis, the first ten months of this year have been a political disaster,” a senior Republican told the Times, adding that it was “an unbelievable position to be twisted into, from ‘shock and awe’ to ‘aw, shucks.’ ”","1481","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"

"The obvious answer is that Bush has had Donald Trump to deal with, and Clinton hasn’t. In virtually monopolizing media coverage and subjecting Bush to months of public criticism, the New York billionaire has transformed the dynamics of the G.O.P. race in a way that almost nobody anticipated—a point the managers of the Bush campaign acknowledged in an internal memo announcing the cost cuts. “We would be less than forthcoming if we said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer health care and partial-birth abortion would be leading the G.O.P. primary,” the memo said.","1483","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"With Bush’s campaign having been outpaced in such outrageous fashion, it is hard not to feel a little sympathy for him. However, his problems can’t be entirely attributed to the Donald. According to the Real Clear Politics poll average, he’s also running behind Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz, and nationwide he has the support of just 7.2 per cent of likely Republican voters. For a candidate whose main selling point was supposed to be his electability, these are terrible numbers. On the Democratic side, Clinton, even at the height of concerns about her e-mail server, maintained a healthy lead in the national polls.","1484","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"In part, Bush’s weak numbers reflect the fact he has run a weak campaign—one dogged by his tendency to mangle the English language, or, at least, to use it carelessly. In his first big speech, back in February, he confused Iran with Iraq and got mixed up about how many fighters the Islamic State has. Since then, the list of phrases he has been forced to clarify or disavow is long and embarrassing: “People need to work longer hours”; “I’m not sure we need half a billion dollars on women’s health-care issues”; “anchor babies”; “stuff happens.” On the basis of what we’ve seen so far, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Bush simply isn’t a good communicator. Indeed, he often appears to be a terrible one. Asked on Saturday whether his campaign’s cost-cutting showed it was in crisis, he said, “Blah, blah, blah. That’s my answer: blah, blah, blah.”","1485","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"If Bush were wowing the world with innovative and substantive policy proposals, his verbal shortcomings could perhaps be overlooked. But he isn’t. His tax-cutting economic plan, which he claims will increase G.D.P. growth to four per cent a year, is largely based on wishful thinking. His foreign-policy speeches are so vague that they’re hard to evaluate. On social issues, such as guns and abortion, he has said little to distinguish himself from the G.O.P. pack. In 2000, his brother George ran on the platform of “compassionate Conservatism,” which was his way of distinguishing himself from Newt Gingrich and other Republican bomb throwers. Jeb’s only memorable slogan is “Jeb!”","1486","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Clinton, on the other hand, has made it clear that she is running as a progressive candidate; in the first Democratic debate, she defined herself as “a progressive who believes in getting things done.” To back up this talk, she has rolled out a series of proposals, including paid sick leave, expanded child care for preschoolers, a higher minimum wage, tax breaks for firms that promote employee share ownership, and a series of measures designed to make college more affordable. None of the things she has proposed is particularly radical, but taken together they amount to a concerted effort to tackle wage stagnation and boost the middle class.","1487","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Bush has nothing comparable to offer. And, even if he improved as a communicator and Trump dropped out of the race, there would be no assurance that he would win the nomination. Indeed, it now appears possible that his entire campaign is based on two false premises.","1488","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The first is that Republican voters want a shift to the center. The one area where Bush has issued a proposal that separates him from other Republican candidates is immigration. To his credit, he has stuck to the position that law-abiding undocumented immigrants should be given the opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship. About all that has done is win him the enmity of conservative pundits and talk-show hosts, who accuse him of promoting an “amnesty.” On this issue, most Republican voters agree with Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Polls consistently show that a majority favor the mass deportation of undocumented aliens—an issue Trump has built his candidacy on.","1489","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The second shaky premise is the notion that Republicans are keen on restoring the Bush dynasty. From the beginning, this seemed like a dubious proposition: never in its history has America had three Presidents from the same family. When Jeb entered the race, G.O.P. supporters were being asked to embrace the possibility of three Bush Presidents in thirty years.","1490","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"In its eagerness to promote someone it considered electable, the G.O.P. establishment sought to play down the dynastic aspect of Bush’s candidacy, portraying Jeb as very different from his elder brother: more thoughtful, more conservative, more articulate. Despite these efforts, no groundswell of support emerged for a Bush restoration. Indeed, it now appears that Barbara Bush, Jeb’s mother, spoke for many Republicans when she said, in April, 2013, “There are other people out there that are very qualified, and we’ve had enough Bushes.”","1491","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The Clinton campaign raises dynastic issues of its own, but there are important differences. As evidenced by the Adams, the Harrisons, and the Roosevelts, the idea of having two Presidents from the same family isn’t alien to the American tradition (even though the Roosevelts were only fifth cousins). And, in serving as a U.S. senator and as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has established credentials independent of her husband’s time in office. At the same time, it’s also important to note that Bill Clinton’s Presidency is far more popular among Democrats than George W. Bush’s Presidency is among Republicans. Some left-leaning Democrats may regard Bill Clinton’s Administration as a neo-liberal sellout, but most associate it with peace, prosperity, and the ability to outlast Republican attacks.","1492","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Even among Republicans, the last Bush Presidency inspires few fond feelings. It ended with the economy in recession, and with the U.S. military trapped in two costly and unwinnable-seeming wars. For a time, Jeb and his establishment backers pretended they could sustain a 2016 campaign that ignored this toxic legacy, but, once Trump entered the race, the strategy proved unsustainable. In portraying the Iraq war as a disaster and repeatedly tying Jeb to his elder brother, Trump forced Republicans to confront the question of why anybody would think that putting another Bush in the White House was a good idea.","1493","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"There are still more than three months to go before the G.O.P. Iowa caucus, but, if Bush is going to reëmerge as the front-runner, he’ll have to do a much better job of answering Trump’s charges. He’ll get his first opportunity this week, at the Republican debate in Boulder, Colorado. When the pressure was on these past two weeks, at the first Democratic debate and then at the Benghazi hearing, Clinton rose to the occasion and gave her campaign a huge boost. Now it’s Bush’s turn. “Jeb really needs a knockout performance—it needs to be all him, with nobody even close,” a New Hampshire Republican told Politico. “Otherwise those fumes he’s on are going to evaporate even quicker.”","1494","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"One recent morning at the Jefferson Hotel, in Washington, D.C., Peter Wehner, a conservative writer who served as an adviser for the past three Republican Presidents, described his party’s problems over a bowl of oatmeal. He said, “We got clobbered in 2012”—the fifth Presidential election out of the past six in which the Republican candidate lost the popular vote. “There’s a demographic problem. White votes are going down two points every year. We’re out of touch with the middle class.” Mitt Romney—whose very hair embodies wealthy privilege—was nominated at a national convention, in Tampa, that became an Ayn Rand-style celebration of business executives, the heroic “makers.” During the campaign, Romney wrote off forty-seven per cent of the country—the “takers”—as government parasites. He went on to lose badly to President Barack Obama, whom Republicans had regarded as an obvious failure, a target as vulnerable as Jimmy Carter. In the shock of that defeat, Wehner said, some conservatives realized that “there was a need for a policy agenda that reaches the middle class.” He added, “This was not a blinding insight.”","1495","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"A generation ago, Democrats lost five of six Presidential elections; in 1992, Bill Clinton, calling himself a New Democrat, ended the streak. Clinton didn’t repudiate the whole Democratic platform—government activism on behalf of ordinary Americans remained the Party’s core idea—but he adopted positions on issues like crime and welfare that were more closely aligned with the views of the majority, including some rank-and-file Democrats. The message, Wehner said, was as much symbolic as substantive: “ ‘We’re not a radical party; we’ve sanded off our rougher edges, and you can trust me.’ ” He went on, “The hope for some of us was that our candidate in 2016 would be the Republican version of Clinton”—a conservative reformer who, having learned from past defeats, championed economic policies that placed Republicans on the side of the hard-pressed, including non-white Americans, the soon-to-be majority.","1496","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"For fresh ideas, such a candidate had only to turn to a group of Republican thinkers who call themselves “reformocons,” of whom Wehner is a leader. Last year, the reformocons published a pamphlet of policy proposals called “Room to Grow,” on health care, education, taxes, entitlements, and other topics. In an introduction, Wehner writes, “Americans do not have a sense that conservatives offer them a better shot at success and security than liberals. For that to change, conservatives in American politics need to understand constituents’ concerns, speak to those aspirations and worries, and help people see how applying conservative principles and deploying conservative policies could help make their lives better.”","1497","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"The essays don’t upend Republican orthodoxy. They argue that government should intervene on behalf of poor and middle-income Americans, but in ways that apply market principles to public policy, taking power away from Washington and giving individuals more options. Some proposals are familiar: school choice, health-care savings accounts. Others are more daring—for example, having college education underwritten by private investors, then repaid over the next decade as a predetermined percentage of graduates’ earnings. A few ideas, such as a wage subsidy that would increase the pay of workers making less than forty thousand dollars a year, building on the Earned Income Tax Credit, could easily garner bipartisan support.","1498","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Room to Grow” contains a striking description of the American economic landscape: children born into poverty with little chance of escaping it, and middle-class families overwhelmed by the rising costs of health care and education while their incomes stay flat. It’s not that different from the story that Elizabeth Warren, the liberal Massachusetts senator, tells. After years of ignoring these stark realities—or of blaming big government, in the spirit of Ronald Reagan—some Republicans have begun to sound more like Abraham Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt.","1499","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"The reformocon project shows how extreme mainstream conservatism has become in its opposition to anything involving the state. The reformocons court right-wing censure simply by acknowledging that the middle class is under pressure, and that government has a role to play beyond cutting taxes. The reckless, and ultimately doomed, shutdown of the federal government by congressional Republicans, in October, 2013, precipitated the first conference of reformocons, in Middleburg, Virginia, and that led to “Room to Grow.”","1500","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"When the 2016 Presidential campaign began, an organizer of the conference, April Ponnuru, became a policy adviser to Jeb Bush. Governor John Kasich, of Ohio, read an essay by Wehner and Michael Gerson, a speechwriter in the Bush White House, titled “A Conservative Vision of Government,” and expressed approval to an aide. Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, sought policy advice from several reformocons, including Yuval Levin, who, as editor of the quarterly National Affairs, is the group’s foremost intellectual. Earlier this year, Rubio published a book, “American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone,” interwoven with the personal stories of struggling Floridians.

Since he entered the race, in June, slurs and feuds have been the mainstay of his media image. Less widely discussed are his positions on working- and middle-class concerns like trade, taxes, and entitlements. In his scattershot, get-out-of-my-way fashion, Trump has vowed to rewrite trade deals involving China, impose tariffs on the products of American companies that send manufacturing overseas, leave Social Security and Medicare alone, and raise taxes on hedge-fund managers. (“I want to save the middle class. The hedge-fund guys didn’t build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.”) To the reformocons’ dismay, Trump has commandeered their target audience and tainted their high-minded proposals.","1503","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Trump’s popularity isn’t based on ideology. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, he draws about evenly from Republicans who consider themselves “moderate to liberal,” “somewhat conservative,” and “very conservative.” More than anything, Trump supporters are defined by class: non-college-educated whites favor him at twice the rate of those with college degrees. Trump is attracting the very blue-collar Americans whom the reformocons were aiming to bind to the Republican Party. So far, at least, these voters, many of them angry and alienated, aren’t listening to the “Room to Grow” crowd. They’re thrilling to madder music.","1504","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Working-class whites remain the most coveted demographic in American politics, even as they shrink as a percentage of the electorate. Ever since Ronald Reagan became President, Democrats have worried about their declining share of this vote. In 2012, Obama captured just thirty-six per cent of white voters without college degrees, down three per cent from 2008—partly owing to the unpopularity of the Affordable Care Act, and skewed by Obama’s abysmal numbers among white Southerners. The emergence of the reformocons shows that more thoughtful Republicans have also grown concerned about the allegiance of the Party’s presumed base.","1505","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Last year, a Gallup poll found that forty-five per cent of Republicans think that the rich should pay more in taxes. Another poll, by the Pew Research Center, showed that more Republicans favor increased spending on Social Security, Medicare, education, and infrastructure than favor cutting those programs. Although government activism is anathema to conservative donors and Grover Norquist, it’s fine with a lot of Republicans making less than fifty thousand dollars a year. April Ponnuru’s husband, Ramesh, a contributor to “Room to Grow” and a senior editor at National Review, said, “Trump shows that Republican voters are not especially dogmatic conservatives—not as much as I’d like them to be.”","1506","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Reihan Salam, the executive editor of National Review, told me, “Trump is not someone I consider an ideal candidate—he does not represent my line of thinking. But he is proving that certain beliefs the professional political class had about who Republican primary voters are—what they respond to, what they care about—were just incorrect.” In 2008, Salam, along with Ross Douthat, the Times columnist, published a manifesto that presaged the reformocon movement: “Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream.” Salam grew up in lower-middle-class, multi-ethnic Brooklyn. At Harvard, where he met Douthat, he became interested in wage subsidies “as a way to enhance the legitimacy of market economies,” he said. “There’s a natural marriage between a belief in a dynamic economy and a belief in solidarity and mutual trust, because the one tempers the other. Most human beings seek stability. A society where you allow this idea of a dynamic economy to pervade every aspect of life is very frightening to people, and certainly you’re not going to be able to build a political coalition around it.”","1507","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

He points to evidence that second-generation Hispanic Americans have less faith in the country’s promise than their parents did—that the vaunted American talent for absorbing people from other places is waning under economic pressure. Salam’s idea of a national community, united by a sense of mutual obligations and a belief in legitimate institutions, evokes the type of conservatism found in Europe. Trump, meanwhile, calls to mind Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi: a strongman, a nationalist, and a nativist, who appeals to voters of limited means by tapping into their gauzy aspirations, echoing their anxieties about decline, and assuring them a secure place in a country restored to greatness.

Trump is doing the opposite—he’s taking popular passions and stoking them, by demonizing the Other.” Since then, Trump’s front-runner status has been challenged by another outsider, Ben Carson, who presents even more extreme ideas, but with a whisper instead of a shout. In late September, Wehner posted an essay on the Commentary Web site called “The G.O.P. Is Killing Itself.”","1513","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Conservatism in the spirit of Madison” has almost ceased to exist. The outlook of the Republican grass roots, and of many Party leaders, is what Richard Hofstadter, writing toward the end of the McCarthy era, called “pseudo-conservative,” because “its exponents, although they believe themselves to be conservatives and usually employ the rhetoric of conservatism, show signs of a serious and restless dissatisfaction with American life, traditions, and institutions.” Republicans today have given the country conservatism in the spirit of Sarah Palin, whose ignorance about the world, contempt for expertise, and raw appeals to white identity politics presaged Trump’s incendiary campaign. So did the spectacle, in 2009, of a Republican congressman calling the President a liar during a speech Obama gave to a joint session of Congress, and Party leaders comparing Obamacare to Nazism and slavery. Earlier this year, forty-seven Republican senators wrote the Supreme Leader of Iran and declared that the President didn’t speak for the country. There have been regular threats to close the federal government in order to accomplish limited political goals. (In September, another shutdown, over the defunding of Planned Parenthood, was narrowly avoided, despite the support of nearly all the Republican Presidential candidates.) On right-wing radio, Obama is constantly accused of tyranny and treason. Once the restraints are lifted, they’re hard to restore.

Eighty chairs were arranged around a stool. One of the early arrivals was a twenty-six-year-old named Mark Lynch, who had come with his grandmother. Lynch, the son of a firefighter and a factory worker, had a crewcut and stubble, and wore a Red Sox T-shirt that exposed the tattoos on his biceps. He had just finished four years of service in the Navy and was training to be a policeman.

He didn’t want an overweening government creating costly programs and interfering in people’s lives. He just wanted a system that wasn’t rigged in favor of the rich and well-connected.","1517","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In Lynch’s eyes, his antipathy toward this privileged class didn’t make him an unwitting Democrat. “I don’t think Republicans are the party of big corporations and billionaires,” he said. “They’re for ordinary middle-class people.” The problem wasn’t conservatism but the dirty role of money in politics. Change would have to come at the hands of someone who wasn’t beholden to the system—a rich outsider like Trump.","1518","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich entered the room, dressed casually, all in black. At sixty-three, he’s lean and combative, with a slump in his posture and a jutting neck. He served nine terms in Congress, and, as chairman of the House Budget Committee, in the nineties, he was a key lieutenant of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and a crusader for balanced budgets. As he never fails to tell audiences, he helped craft the 1997 deal that brought surpluses to the federal government for the first time in three decades, though most of the credit belonged to a booming economy. Elected governor of Ohio in 2010, and reëlected overwhelmingly last year, Kasich turned the state’s deficits into surpluses, while cutting taxes.

"“I’m running for President ’cause I know how to land the plane,” he said, without mentioning the name of the candidate who could well crash it. “I understand that people are frustrated. My dad carried mail on his back. My mother was a blue-collar housewife. I understand anxieties about losing jobs and ringing up college debt. I know all this. But we can beat these things.” The way to beat them was to cut the deficit and say no to special interests in Washington. He offered no policy proposals to help the middle class, besides balancing the federal budget and deregulating business.","1520","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich added a dose of spiritual uplift to this starchy message. “We need to live a life bigger than ourselves,” he said. “Life is not just about me, me, me, me, me. Do you agree with that? It’s about living a life that’s bigger than yourself. . . . I am the most flawed in this room, but at least I know I give grace and every day I can start over and try to do something positive.” There’s a strain of George W. Bush’s compassionate conservatism in Kasich. (During a run for the Presidency in 2000, Kasich admitted to wishing that he’d thought up the term.) He often mentions the working poor in the same breath as the addicted and the mentally ill, as if all three groups needed charitable help. He has supported the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio, to the abhorrence of many conservatives; he likes to say that he’ll have this accomplishment in hand when St. Peter asks him what he did for the poor. “Be a center of justice and healing,” Kasich told the audience in Raymond.","1521","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

I can’t—” He pointed a finger at me. “What do you think I should do?” I started to describe Lynch’s views, and when Kasich realized I was talking about an ex-serviceman he found his sound bite: “Our veterans, they should be top priority.”","1527","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

The best alternative, he felt, was Rubio. When I pointed out that Rubio was a Washington insider, Lynch sighed. “That’s the pickle I’m in, and a lot of people are in,” he said. “No matter who gets elected, it’s just going to be more of the same.

"Over the past few years, the key phrase for Democrats has been “income inequality.” The relentlessly widening gap between wealthy Americans and the rest—accelerated by the Great Recession and the not-so-great recovery—is at the heart of Sanders’s campaign, animates many of Hillary Clinton’s policies, and would make Warren an instant contender were she to enter the race. But “inequality” is a word that Republicans don’t like to use. Romney, during his Presidential campaign, characterized “inequality” as a code word: “I think it’s about envy. I think it’s about class warfare.”","1530","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"In other words, the way to think about inequality is by looking down, not up. It’s not the wealth amassed at the top but, rather, the lack of “skills, values, and habits” at the bottom that accounts for the widening income gap. Oddly, Wehner’s essay barely mentions the economic struggles of the middle class. A close look at the three middle quintiles of income, where Americans with an education, a job, and a spouse can be found treading water or sinking, would have forced him to reconsider the notion that a lack of “social capital”—as opposed to just capital—explains the entire problem.","1532","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Even though the reformocons recognize the difficulties of the middle class, they prefer to focus not on income disparities but on “mobility,” which describes how individuals fare across their own life span and in comparison with past generations. Levin told me that the word “growth”—the unconvincing mantra of supply-siders—was losing its hold on conservatives. When Jeb Bush predicted that his economic policies would lead to four-per-cent economic growth, a level not seen since the late nineties, the claim was either ignored or derided. “ ‘Mobility’ is much healthier,” Levin said. “It’s the right lens to talk about the economy.”","1533","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"But there’s a reason to look up as well as down the economic ladder, and it has nothing to do with envy or with punishing the rich. Economic stratification, and the rise of a super-wealthy class, threatens our democracy. Americans are growing increasingly separated from one another along lines of class, in every aspect of life: where they’re born and grow up, where they go to school, what they eat, how they travel, whom they marry, what their children do, how long they live, how they die. What kind of “national community” built on “mutual obligation” is possible when Americans have so little shared experience? The Princeton economist Alan Krueger has demonstrated that societies with higher levels of income inequality are societies with lower levels of social mobility. As America has grown less economically equal, a citizen’s ability to move upward has fallen behind that of citizens in other Western democracies. We are no longer the country where anyone can become anything.","1534","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Inequality saps the economy by draining the buying power of Americans whose incomes have stagnated, forcing them to rely on debt to fund education, housing, and health care. At the top, it creates deep pools of wealth that have nowhere productive to go, leading to asset bubbles in capital markets bearing little or no relation to the health of the over-all economy. (Critics call this the “financialization” of the economy.) These fallouts from inequality were among the causes of the Great Recession.","1535","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Inequality is also warping America’s political system. Greatly concentrated wealth leads to outsized political power in the hands of the few—even in a democracy with free and fair elections—which pushes government to create rules that favor the rich. It’s no accident that we’re in the era of Citizens United. Such rulings give ordinary Americans the strong suspicion that the game is rigged. Democratic institutions no longer feel legitimate when they continue to produce blatantly unfair outcomes; it’s one of those insights that only an élite could miss. And it’s backed up by evidence as well as by common sense. Last year, two political scientists found that, in recent times, policy ideas have rarely been adopted by the U.S. government unless they’re favored by corporations and the wealthy—even when those ideas are supported by most Americans. The persistence of the highly unpopular carried-interest loophole for hedge-fund managers is simply the most unseemly example.","1536","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"Thus far in the campaign, the ideas of the reformocons have scarcely made an appearance among the Republican candidates. In Washington in June, Rubio—the favorite of the reformers—gave a speech to a group of them summarizing the arguments of his book. And he became the first Republican candidate to support paid family leave when, in September, he proposed a tax credit for businesses that offer their employees between four and twelve weeks off to care for newborns or sick family members. (Critics say that the tax credit wouldn’t offset enough of the costs in wages to induce companies to permit such leaves.) For the most part, though, Rubio has left the proposals in “American Dreams” on the shelf. “Rubio has the most interesting platform, but he’s not using it,” Ramesh Ponnuru said. Rubio, the son of a bartender and a maid who both emigrated from Cuba, “has established himself as the articulate, different Republican in a biographical sense,” Ponnuru added. “He’s not working to establish himself as a problem-solver. His campaign guys must be saying, ‘You have a good story, and voters aren’t interested in policy ideas.’ ”","1538","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In April, Rubio announced a tax proposal that hardly diverges from the Republican Party line. It offers families a twenty-five-hundred-dollar tax credit per child. But the proposal also reduces income taxes beyond the levels of George W. Bush’s cuts, making them even more regressive; cuts corporate taxes by ten per cent; and eliminates taxes on most investment income and inheritance. It gives a huge windfall to the rich, amounting to trillions of dollars in tax revenue. At the same time, Rubio promises to increase defense spending and pass a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Ponnuru offered an explanation for Rubio’s lapse into conventional conservative thinking: “The problem with the campaign-finance system is that it forces the candidates to spend too much time with rich people.”","1539","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Even though Rubio’s tax plan included the usual deep cuts for the wealthy, it was unacceptable to the Wall Street Journal, which criticized the child tax credit as a giveaway. Stephen Moore, the former president of the Club for Growth, explained his opposition to the columnist Albert R. Hunt: “The more you increase things like the child tax credit, the more you will move back to the 1960s and 70s tax system with higher tax rates.”","1540","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Jeb Bush, another hope of the reformocons, issued his tax plan in September. He framed it as an attempt to support social mobility and the “right to rise”—the name of his Super PAC, which, in the first half of the year, raised more than a hundred million dollars. Such rhetoric fooled some political reporters into characterizing the plan as “populist.” Though it does eliminate the carried-interest loophole, it offers the rich more than ample compensation, in the form of a large cut in income and capital-gains taxes. According to the Times, people making ten million dollars or more a year would see their effective tax rates reduced from twenty-six to twenty-one per cent, saving them an average of a million and a half dollars a year. Bush’s plan would drain up to $3.4 trillion dollars from the Treasury.","1541","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In the end, the reformocon candidates haven’t sounded that much different from Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, and Rand Paul. All of them have had more to say about defunding Planned Parenthood, shutting down the federal government, repealing Obamacare, balancing the budget, and building a wall along the border with Mexico than about the problems of the middle class. The mantle of economic populism has essentially been handed to Donald Trump.","1542","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"At a press conference at Trump Tower on September 28th, Trump unveiled his own tax plan. “Too few Americans are working, too many jobs are being shipped overseas, and too many middle-income families cannot make ends meet,” he proclaimed. “This plan directly meets these challenges, and the challenges also of business.” What followed was a tax cut for just about everybody. Seventy-five million Americans—single people making less than twenty-five thousand dollars a year and married couples making less than fifty—would be dropped from the tax rolls altogether. But the biggest winners would be the rich: Trump would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four, and would cut the rates of the top earners by fourteen per cent, below the level proposed by Bush. Even Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform blessed Trump’s plan. In the midst of an anti-establishment revolt, supply-side dogma has an unbreakable hold on Republican politics.","1543","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

The Presidential campaign felt far away—Ohio’s primary isn’t until next March—but the state remains key to the general election. “Part of it is that Trump’s an emblem of success, and the other part of it is he taps people’s anger,” Green said. “It’s not the same anger as a few years ago, when it was ‘Where are the jobs?’ Now it’s ‘Where’s our share of the American dream?’ ” Green, who does polling research on Ohio and American politics, went on, “A lot of white working-class votes are up for grabs in this election. In recent years, they’ve gone Republican, but this year the Democrats could get a slice of them.” The Republican coalition of business interests and the white working class, he said, “is under more stress this year than it’s been for a while.”","1544","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

Canton is one of those American towns where industrial decline and population loss give a sense of uninhabited space. The Hoover vacuum company, once headquartered in North Canton, was acquired in 2007 by a Hong Kong firm that moved production to Mexico and China. An abandoned brick factory is being redeveloped for white-collar service companies and apartments.

"After a winter of continuous below-zero temperatures, many of Canton’s streets crumbled, and nearly a year later they remain impassable. The Democratic mayor, William Healy, laid the blame for the city’s infrastructure woes on climate change and John Kasich. In balancing Ohio’s budget, the Governor dramatically reduced state contributions to local governments while cutting certain business taxes and eliminating the estate tax. The result, Healy said, was a loss of seventeen million dollars to Canton—twenty per cent of its revenue—bringing spending below the level of 2007. The Mayor had to choose between keeping policemen and firemen employed or repairing broken streets. “That tells you the impact of John Kasich,” he said. “But on the national front, where you’ve got Trump, Kasich comes across as a moderate! Damaging as Kasich has been to my city, as mayor, if I had to vote for a Republican for President I would vote for Kasich over the entire field.

"Around Ohio, local governments are being forced to choose between raising taxes and neglecting services, even though the state now has a two-billion-dollar “rainy-day fund.” In his stump speech in New Hampshire, Kasich claimed that his fiscal policies helped create three hundred thousand jobs. In fact, Ohio remains below its pre-recession employment rate, meaning that the state has lagged behind most of the country during the recovery. Zach Schiller, the head of research at the nonpartisan group Policy Matters Ohio, in Cleveland, told me, “Kasich’s claims to good economic performance? I don’t know if I want to say ‘deceptive,’ but they’re certainly misleading.”","1547","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"According to Policy Matters Ohio, since 2013 Kasich’s policies, including a higher sales tax and cigarette tax, have raised average annual taxes on the state’s poorest fifth by seventeen dollars, given middle-income people a ninety-four-dollar cut, and returned seventeen thousand dollars to members of the one per cent. “We’ve engineered a tax shift to lower- and middle-income Ohioans,” Schiller said. “And we’ve reduced over-all tax revenue.”","1548","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich’s tax policies have earned him the approval of Arthur Laffer, a native of nearby Youngstown, whose famous curve—supposedly demonstrating that lower income taxes generate higher revenue by stimulating economic growth—started the revolution in supply-side economics, forty years ago. Schiller pointed out that nothing in Ohio’s recent economic experience supports supply-side theory. The same is true nationally: growth has accelerated in periods when tax rates have been higher on top earners and stalled when rates came down. Kasich, who has positioned himself as the capable, reasonable, experienced “grownup” on the G.O.P. stage, is a supply-sider at his core. As long as Republicans cling to the warped logic of trickle-down economics, their efforts to help middle-class Americans will be largely rhetorical.","1549","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

Conservatives don’t emphasize the individual and the state; they focus on the space between—where families, communities, religious groups, associations, and private enterprises create a web of interrelationships. “What happens in that space generally happens face to face—between parents and children, neighbors and friends, buyers and sellers,” he writes. “It therefore answers to immediately felt needs, and is tailored to the characters, sentiments, priorities, and preferences of the people involved.

There is no “common life” except for the workers’ desperate effort to stick together as they look ahead to weeks or months without pay—or, perhaps, a future without a job.

Speaking in a legislature dominated by a party that is increasingly held hostage to the doctrines and interests of individualism and free enterprise, the visitor from the Holy See delivered a timely defense of communal values and solidarity with the poor and dispossessed. While he was at pains not to appear partisan or to give offense to his hosts, there was a reason why some Republicans were nervous about what the Pope might say. Between the follower of Saint Francis of Assisi and the leadership of the G.O.P. lies a gulf that no politesse can disguise.","1563","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"To the delight of the assembled, the Pope began by saying that he was grateful for the opportunity to speak “in the land of the free and the home of the brave.” But he quickly made clear that his concept of liberty and freedom doesn’t jibe with the one promoted by the Republican Study Committee or the Club for Growth. Citing Abraham Lincoln’s call for “a new birth of freedom,” he said, “Building a future of freedom requires love of the common good and coöperation in a spirit of subsidiarity and solidarity.” The “common good” isn’t a concept that gets discussed often in Washington these days, but Pope Francis invoked it several times. And in reminding the senators and representatives sitting before him of their obligation to pursue this goal, he said that they had a particular obligation to protect “those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk.”","1564","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"It was perhaps predictable that Francis would bring up Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr., two Americans who have achieved secular canonization, and to whom politicians across the political spectrum pay lip service. But the other two Americans he cited as inspirations were both figures of the left: Dorothy Day, the founder of the Catholic Worker Movement, and Thomas Merton, a Catholic theologian and mystic, whose enthusiastic support for the civil-rights movement and participation in protests against the Vietnam War attracted criticism from some conservative clergy. The Pope praised Day’s “passion for justice and for the cause of the oppressed.” (She died in 1980.) He lauded Merton, who died in 1968, as “a thinker who challenged the certitudes of his time and opened new horizons for souls and for the Church.”","1565","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"Many of Francis’s defenders would claim that he is cut from the same cloth. Turning his attention to global happenings, he referred to the world as increasingly blighted by “violent conflict, hatred, and brutal atrocities, committed even in the name of God and of religion.” He continued: “A delicate balance is required to combat violence perpetrated in the name of a religion, an ideology, or an economic system, while also safeguarding religious freedom, intellectual freedom, and individual freedoms…. We know that, in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within. To imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place. That is something which you, as a people, reject.”","1566","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"Was the Pope alluding to Abu Ghraib, the birther movement, or those Americans, such as Ben Carson, the Republican Presidential candidate, who would seek to debar Muslims from the Presidency? Of course, he didn’t say. Instead, he moved on to the global refugee crisis, which he rightly described as the worst such crisis since the Second World War. But rather than focussing on the situation in Europe, Francis noted that, “On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities. Is this not what we want for our own children?” Instead of paying attention to numbers or seeking “to discard whatever proves troublesome,” he went on, “let us remember the Golden Rule: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’ ”","1567","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"That was about the closest the Pope came to calling out Republicans explicitly for their heartless policies. Francis wasn’t done yet. In rapid succession, he called for an end to the death penalty, for concerted action to confront environmental degradation caused by human activity, and for steps to halt a global arms trade carried out in the name of “money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood.” Then, at last, he moved onto ground that is friendlier to traditional Republican doctrine, saying, “I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life.”","1568","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"The Pope will probably have more to say on this subject in Philadelphia, where he is due to attend the Catholic Church’s triennial World Meeting of Families. On this instance, though, he returned to his central message, invoking the belief, which virtually every American imbibes from childhood, that this is a great country. A country “can be considered great,” he said, “when it defends liberty as Lincoln did, when it fosters a culture which enables people to ‘dream’ of full rights for all their brothers and sisters, as Martin Luther King sought to do; when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed, as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work … and sows peace in the contemplative style of Thomas Merton.”","1569","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"
"In conclusion, Francis said that he had “sought to present some of the richness of your cultural heritage, of the spirit of the American people.” It was his wish, he added, “that this spirit continue to develop and grow, so that as many young people as possible can inherit and dwell in a land which has inspired so many people to dream. God bless America.”","1570","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/pope-franciss-timely-message-to-congress"

"“Maybe I missed it,” Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said in a tweet on Friday morning, “but we just had an entire #GOPDebate on economics and #TPP was never mentioned.” Haass was referring, of course, to the recently agreed upon Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement encompassing twelve Pacific Rim countries. He also could have cited numerous other economic phenomena that received cursory attention, at most, during Wednesday night’s Republican debate, which CNBC aired from Boulder, Colorado: the lingering effects of the Great Recession, the unemployment rate, the economic slowdown in China, the size of the budget deficit, the United States’ poor performance in math and science, the state of America’s physical infrastructure.","October 29, 2015","1572","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Rather than focussing on topics like these, the ten candidates spent much of their time attacking CNBC’s moderators (my colleague Amy Davidson has more on this) and competing with each other over who could offer Americans the lowest tax rates. In response to a question about whether he was running a “comic book” campaign, Donald Trump said, “We’re reducing taxes to fifteen per cent.” Ben Carson mentioned the same figure. Rand Paul said that he would offer the zero option for payroll taxes: abolishing the contribution that workers make.","1573","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Did any of the candidates detail how they would pay for their huge tax giveaways? Of course not. Relying on the discredited arguments of supply-side economics, a few of them did say that reductions in tax rates would produce a much higher rate of economic growth, which would boost tax revenues. Carson talked vaguely about eliminating some tax deductions. Carly Fiorina said that she would reduce the mammoth U.S. tax code to three pages. Ted Cruz said that his plan would allow people to file their tax returns on a postcard.","1574","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"It was left to John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, who is seeking to position himself as the voice of sanity in the asylum, to state the obvious: “You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt…. Why don’t we just give a chicken in every pot, while we’re, you know, coming up—coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.” Referring to proposals to clean up the tax code, Kasich went on: “We’ll just clean it up. Where are you gonna clean it up? You have to deal with entitlements; you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending. You gotta be creative and imaginative.”","1575","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"In a better world, Kasich would be rewarded for his honesty. As it is, the Real Clear Politics poll average indicates that he has the support of just 2.6 per cent of potential Republican voters. And that’s the rub. Given the incentive structure that Kasich and the other candidates are operating under, there is little reward attached to being honest and realistic with voters, or to taking nuanced positions on complicated subjects such as trade treaties and education policy. Rather than getting involved in detailed policy discussions, which almost invariably involve balancing benefits against costs, it can seem perfectly rational, from the candidates’ perspective, simply to bash anything associated with President Obama, promise a chicken (or tax rebate) in every pot, and fudge the details.","1576","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"The first problem the candidates face is that the field is still too crowded. Like Wall Street analysts (and media commentators), they therefore have an incentive to adopt extreme positions, because outliers get noticed. Thus, on the eve of last night’s debate, Ted Cruz, channelling Herman Cain from four years ago, unveiled a plan for a flat tax of ten per cent on personal income. Perhaps recognizing the fact that there is a limit to what anybody, even a diehard Tea Party supporter, will believe, Cruz didn’t claim that this proposal would balance the budget. Instead, he cited a study from the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based research organization, and claimed that it would cost less than a trillion dollars.","1577","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"The second problem the Republicans have—and this will become even more acute as the election approaches—is that, by many measures, the U.S. economy is doing pretty well. In the past five years, the unemployment rate has been cut in half, and about twelve million new jobs have been created. G.D.P. has been growing at a steady, if unspectacular, rate for more than six years. House prices and stock prices have rebounded strongly from the Great Recession.","1578","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"The big drawback with the Obama recovery is that it has been very lopsided, with the folks at the top receiving most of the gains, and those in the middle and at the bottom seeing little or no income growth. During the debate, some Republicans seized on this. Jeb Bush claimed that the incomes of middle-class families have fallen by twenty-three hundred dollars since President Obama took office. Cruz said that the share of income going to the top one per cent has never been higher.","1579","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Such data make good talking points for the G.O.P. candidates, but they also raise an awkward problem for the Party and its 2016 nominee-to-be. Tackling rising inequality isn’t exactly a Republican strength. Almost all of the candidates’ tax plans are extremely regressive: they would benefit the well-off more than everybody else. That’s partly because all of the plans would cut the top income-tax rate, which is currently 39.6 per cent. And it’s partly because most of the proposals would also sharply reduce the tax rates on dividends and capital gains, the forms of payment in which the super-rich receive most of their income.","1580","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Take Cruz’s tax plan, which might be the most regressive and irresponsible one yet. According to the preliminary Tax Foundation analysis that Cruz cited, households in the top one per cent of the income distribution would see their post-tax income rise by 29.6 per cent, whereas households in the middle twenty per cent of the distribution would see their incomes rise by 1.5 per cent or less. (I’m citing the “static” estimates, which don’t incorporate an overly rosy growth scenario for tax revenues. But the “dynamic” figures also show a big difference in how the ultra-wealthy would make out relative to everybody else.)","1581","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"These aren’t the sorts of figures that any candidate, except perhaps one running for the Presidency of his local Rotary Club, wants to advertise. And it also turns out that Cruz’s claim about his plan costing less than a trillion dollars was highly suspect. According to the Tax Foundation, the actual figure is $3.6 trillion. It was only by invoking some very optimistic assumptions about G.D.P. growth that the Foundation’s analysts got the number below a trillion dollars.","1582","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Relative to the other candidates’ plans, Cruz’s proposal is at the edge of the curve, but in its basic features it’s not atypical. Given the way these plans work, about the only way to have them avoid looking like reverse-Robin Hood schemes is to exempt some of the households at the bottom of the income distribution from any federal income tax. That’s what Marco Rubio’s plan would do, for example, and another analysis from the Tax Foundation suggests that he was right when he claimed, in response to a challenge from CNBC’s John Harwood, that the biggest gains (in percentage terms) under his proposal would go to the poor. But the exemptions in his plan wouldn’t apply to payroll taxes paid by poor families, and they wouldn’t apply to any of the taxes paid by middle-income households. So Harwood, who had said that very rich households would make out a lot better than average households under Rubio’s plan, was also right.","1583","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"That assessment is also true of Bush’s plan, and of Trump’s plan, and of Carson’s plan, and of Huckabee’s plan, and of Paul’s plan. Indeed, when you delve into the details of the Republicans’ economic proposals, it’s easy to see why most of them would rather not get into the details. G.O.P. primary voters tend to be tax averse. But most of them are also averse to tilting things even more in the direction of the donor class.","1584","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Before ending, I should note that one or two of the Republican candidates have put out more credible proposals. In what they describe as efforts to shore up Social Security, for example, Bush and Chris Christie have suggested raising the retirement age and cutting the benefits that rich retirees receive. Since benefit cuts are hugely unpopular, about the only people who have cheered these proposals are budget hawks at Washington think tanks.","1585","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"At this stage, anyway, neither Bush nor Christie appears to have much chance of getting the nomination. And that’s another illustration of the underlying incentive problem. In a Republican primary, making tough policy choices and trying to be substantive doesn’t necessarily pay off. Small wonder that the debates tend to be food fights, instead.","1586","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Let’s say you are a diehard Muppets fan with very mixed feelings about the new ABC show “The Muppets.” Maybe you grew up on the Muppets and worry that they are now being cynically marketed back to your demographic with bizarrely adult humor. Maybe you’re not sure whether Kermit would really call Miss Piggy “sexy”—Muppet sex being something you’ve never had to ponder before now. But perhaps you feel ambivalent about condemning such gags, because you don’t want to sound like a prude, and because it’s nice to see the Muppets back on prime-time TV.","October 5, 2015","1587","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"In this case, you may find yourself refraining from criticizing the show by any means necessary, including avoidance of the first-person pronoun (a tactic you learned from Nancy Franklin). You may even distract yourself by deciding which Muppets are which Presidential candidates. (Here goes: Hillary Clinton is Miss Piggy, Joe Biden is Fozzie, Bernie Sanders is Gonzo, Jeb Bush is Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Ben Carson is Rowlf, Marco Rubio is Scooter, Chris Christie is Sweetums, Carly Fiorina is Janice, John Kasich is Sam the Eagle, Rand Paul is Beaker, Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee are Statler and Waldorf, and Donald Trump, obviously, is Animal.)","1588","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"That being done, you have to get down to business. Two episodes of “The Muppets” have aired, but even before that there were signs that this wasn’t your mother’s “Muppet Show.” Over the summer, as part of a cheeky marketing campaign, the “news” broke that Kermit and Miss Piggy had split up, and that Kermit was now seeing a younger pig, Denise. In the pilot, Kermit explains, “What can I tell you? I’m attracted to pigs.” (A future Prime Minister?) (Sorry.) In the same episode, Fozzie talks about his dating foibles: “When your online profile says, ‘Passionate bear looking for love,’ you get a lot of wrong responses.” And Kermit describes his life as “bacon-wrapped hell on Earth.” In the second episode, Zoot draws a penis on a greeting card, and Miss Piggy sleeps with Josh Groban. (Both, thank goodness, are off-camera.)","1589","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"The show is itself bacon-wrapped in a clever premise: Miss Piggy is the host of a late-night talk show, Kermit is her beleaguered producer, and the rest of the Muppets comprise her terrorized staff: sort of a felt “Larry Sanders Show.” The series is shot in the mockumentary style of “The Office” and “Parks and Recreation,” a contemporary spin on the original “Muppet Show,” which mirrored variety television. Also like its predecessor, “The Muppets” makes good use of celebrity cameos—kudos to whoever thought Reza Aslan would have chemistry with Miss Piggy, because (surprise) he did. And, as TV’s only female talk-show host, Miss Piggy is given the status and ambition she deserves.","1590","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"But the off-color humor seems badly misplaced, as if the show’s creators were trying to beat “Crank Yankers” and “Avenue Q” at their own game. With the exception of Gonzo, the Muppets should not work blue. The problem isn’t that the Muppets should appeal solely to children; Muppets humor has always been sophisticated and self-knowing, a “gateway drug to comedy,” as Jason Segel, the ultimate Muppets superfan, put it. The 2011 film “The Muppets,” which Segel wrote with Nick Stoller, nailed the absurdist tone that had eluded the franchise post-Henson: at once antic, self-referential, and heartfelt. Kids could revel in the anarchic (Gonzo as a toilet magnate), while nostalgists could smirk at the jokes that flew over their children’s heads (Animal in anger management). But the funniest bits were funny for everyone—the villain saying the line “Maniacal laugh!” instead of maniacally laughing—because absurdism, done right, cuts through the age gap. This was a lesson that Segel and Stoller took from the “classic” Muppets films, especially “The Great Muppet Caper.” What’s funnier than John Cleese dryly informing his wife of a “pig climbing up the outside of the house”? Or Miss Piggy, stranded on the side of the road, watching a motorcycle fly from the back a moving truck and remarking to the camera, “What an unbelievable coincidence”?","1591","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"Not that the Muppets are strangers to innuendo. Charles Grodin’s lust for Miss Piggy, in “The Great Muppet Caper,” is legitimately steamy—though it’s never implied that they actually have sex. What the new show misjudges isn’t some kind of moral standard but what makes the Muppets funny in the first place. They exist in the rude, recognizable world of adult humans but are too innocent to notice. It’s funny, in a cheap way, to joke about Zoot being in Alcoholics Anonymous. (“It’s not that kind of meeting,” he’s told in the pilot.) But it’s a lot funnier when Fozzie, at a London nightspot in “The Great Muppet Caper,” says of his champagne, “You know, if you put enough sugar in this stuff, it tastes just like ginger ale!” Maybe that’s the recipe for Muppets humor: take champagne and add sugar. Not salt.","1592","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"It’s a testament to Jim Henson and Frank Oz that the Muppets sensibility has been so tricky to get right without them. After Henson died, in 1990, the brand languished for years under various owners, and its reëmergence has been a welcome consequence of our current mania for rebooting. (As the writer Pixie Casey tweeted, “Racist Atticus Finch and Midlife Crisis Kermit are exactly what we deserve for our collective inability to let go of things.”) Scores of think pieces accompanied the Kermit-Piggy breakup, including one on Miss Piggy as a domestic abuser (though most often she used her karate skills to thump bad guys). The Muppets revival has even brought on an academic volume, “Jim Henson and Philosophy,” with entries on “Fraggle Rock and Post-Structuralism” and “The Metaphysics of Muppetationality.”","1593","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"What is Muppetationality, anyway? To me, it’s a haven for eccentricity, where even “whatevers” like Gonzo have a place. And it’s a style of humor that can work on multiple levels, winking differently at the same fans as the decades pass. So, to those who have been given temporary custody of the Muppets legacy, I ask this: dig deeper, handle with care, and keep it PG.","1594","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"

"Afterward, Trump was widely criticized for not correcting the man, for not acting, in fact, as that “loser” John McCain had, in 2008, when a questioner at one of his rallies described Barack Obama as “an Arab” whom she couldn’t trust. It would seem like the minimal act a decent candidate could undertake. One might ask the other Republicans in the race why they haven’t really found the opportunity to correct Trump—at this point, they’ve been on plenty of stages with him. On Friday, Lindsey Graham said that Trump should apologize for not acting as Graham’s friend McCain did, and Christie said that he would have handled the encounter differently—though he added that he didn’t want to “lecture” Trump. Otherwise, the Republican candidates were slow to speak. Trump is not just someone who stands by when the President’s faith, birthplace, or basic identity are put into question; he pushes that view. As recently as this July, when Anderson Cooper asked Trump if, with all the documentation out there, including a long-form birth certificate, he accepted that the President was born in America, Trump said, “I don’t know. I really don’t know.”","1603","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-man-in-the-t-shirt"
"But even more outrageous, this week, was Trump’s tolerance of the questioner’s premise: that Muslims in America are “a problem.” Calling Obama a Muslim is not wrong because being a Muslim is bad; it’s wrong because he is a Christian, and so “Muslim” becomes a shorthand for impostor and liar, for deceptive secret agent. Trump, though, went well beyond not defending the President: he affirmed an attack on the millions of Muslim Americans who are as much a part of the national community as anyone else. The man in the T-shirt’s actual point, after all, was about the supposed training camps “where they want to kill us.” He wanted Trump to answer his question: “When can we get rid of them?”","1604","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-man-in-the-t-shirt"

A campaign official also said that Trump was focussed on the part of the question about this larger phantom threat, and not on the part about Obama’s religion—as if entertaining an insult to an entire community, rather than just to the President, were a defense. Trump’s own statement seemed to underscore the man in the Trump T-shirt’s fears: “The media wants to make this issue about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country. Christians need support in this country.

Perhaps his comments in New Hampshire will persuade his competitors to confront his extremism instead. So far, they have been too fearful or too eager for the votes of people like the man in the T-shirt.

There has always been a strain of that, and he is not alone in playing to it: a number of Republican senators solemnly presented themselves as concerned investigators of Jade Helm, a U.S. military training exercise that, in some circles, was presented as a dress rehearsal for martial law. The man in the T-shirt has a theory; the man in the suit smiles. What is less and less clear, in the interaction between the potential Presidents and the crowd, is who is humoring whom.","1613","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-man-in-the-t-shirt"
"“The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don’t trust the media,” Senator Ted Cruz said last night, drawing himself up in a way that made him appear to slightly inflate. Sweeping his arm across the stage, at the University of Colorado, in Boulder, he said, “This is not a cage match. And, you look at the questions: ‘Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?’ ‘Ben Carson, can you do math?’ ‘John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?’ ‘Marco Rubio, why don’t you resign?’ ‘Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?’ How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?” He got a big round of applause, which Carlos Quintanilla, one of the moderators for CNBC, tried to interrupt, asking, “Do we get credit…,” before Cruz interrupted him again.","October 29, 2015","1614","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"“The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was ‘Which of you is more handsome and why?’ ” Cruz said. That wasn’t quite how anyone who saw that debate would remember it, but the Senator just shook his head, compared the Democrats to “the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks,” and wondered at the implausibility of a debate moderator voting in a Republican primary. Quintanilla tried again to be heard over the laughter of the crowd before he managed to say, somewhat forlornly, “I asked you about the debt limit and I got no answer.”","1615","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"For the record, this was the question that inspired Cruz’s rant about insubstantiality: “Congressional Republicans, Democrats, and the White House are about to strike a compromise that would raise the debt limit, prevent a government shutdown and calm financial markets that fear of—another Washington-created crisis is on the way. Does your opposition to it show that you’re not the kind of problem-solver American voters want?” Given that Cruz’s previous responses to such crises have included filibustering the Senate with a reading of “Green Eggs and Ham,” and that he has, in just the past month, been involved in a squabble with his fellow-Republicans over his efforts to make the debt ceiling a hostage in the fight against Planned Parenthood, it was a pretty good question, which Cruz blithely ignored. And yet, in the brief tussle that followed, Cruz managed to make it sound as if he were being unjustly denied a chance to turn to the debt ceiling as the questioning moved on to the next candidate.","1616","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"Even before the debate ended, CNBC was being roundly criticized—Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, tweeted that CNBC “should be ashamed of how this debate was handled”—and, to be clear, the moderators did fail. But not for the reasons that the Republican candidates gave: Rubio said that “the Democrats have the ultimate Super PAC. It’s called the mainstream media”; Carson called a question “propaganda”; Chris Christie complained that he wasn’t being asked about ISIS, even though this was a debate about business and the economy. Nor was it because their questions were especially marked by infotainment froth. It is because the moderators utterly failed to control a group of candidates whose level of detachment from facts and vitriol seemed to surprise them when it shouldn’t have.","1617","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"It’s unclear what anyone’s best-case scenario for this debate would have been, in terms of real engagement with the issues. The shallowness of much of the rhetoric in the campaign can lead to simple questions that, to some ears, sound simplistic, but have to be asked, such as why the math in Carson’s very vague budget proposals doesn’t add up, or why, as another moderator, John Harwood, asked Donald Trump, his talk about forcing Mexico to build a wall “and make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others” (Trump: “That’s right”) didn’t amount to “a comic-book version of a Presidential campaign.” The moderators just didn’t account for the pits of deep ugliness in those shallows and didn’t know how to navigate them. They weren’t prepared for candidates who called them liars, and who, by the end, were simply ignoring both questions and time limits. Carly Fiorina, notably, just started talking when she wanted; at the very end, she had a brief blinking contest with Harwood, who surrendered with a weary “All right, go ahead.” Again, by this point in the campaign, the moderators really should have known better.","1618","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"For example, when Becky Quick asked Trump why he’d been critical of Mark Zuckerberg’s call for more H1B visas for tech workers, and Trump denied that he had been, she seemed surprised, saying, “Where did I read this and come up with this that you were?”—as if he would tell her. “I don’t know—you people write the stuff,” Trump said. A minute later, when Quick tried to follow up by noting that Trump had called Marco Rubio “Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Senator because he was in favor of the H1B,” Trump replied, “I never said that. I never said that.”","1619","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"“So this was an erroneous article the whole way around?” Quick said. “My apologies. I’m sorry.” It took until after a commercial break for her to discover that the quotes had come from Trump’s own Web site. He didn’t apologize, and it didn’t matter. Cruz had set a model for his colleagues that night: people hate reporters. Just insult them and you’ll be fine, regardless of the question you’ve been asked. It was similar to a moment Newt Gingrich had, during a debate in 2012, when he gained momentum by telling off John King, of CNN. But that was a rejection of questions about Gingrich’s personal life (“despicable” questions, Gingrich said) and not of fact-based queries altogether.","1620","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"There were some bad and petty questions. Quick pressed too much and with too much alarm about Rubio, the father of four school-age children, taking money out of his retirement savings, at a cost to him and his family of thousands of dollars. It’s more Suze Orman’s job to berate people about things like that, and what Rubio did is neither unethical nor disqualifying. Then again, it allowed him to play to his strengths, saying, “Here’s the truth. I didn’t inherit any money. My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.” He said that after getting married he had to explain to his wife “why someone named Sallie Mae was taking a thousand dollars out of our bank account every month.” Rubio did well all around (my colleague John Cassidy writes about why he was the big winner), including when Jeb Bush tried, with an ill-conceived feint, to cut him down.","1621","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"The issue was Rubio’s frequent absence from the Senate—the occasion for another of the questions Cruz objected to, based on a call in an editorial in Florida’s Sun-Sentinel for Rubio to resign. Rubio had already dealt with the question, inevitably, by attacking the press: “It’s actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today,” he said of the editorial. Bush asked if he could jump in, “because I’m a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.” Whoever told Bush, who so often in his life has been given well-paid opportunities through family or political connections, that he should put Rubio in his place by calling him an employee who had failed to provide good “service” is not advising him very well. When Rubio asked why Bush didn’t mind that Senator John McCain, whom he’d cited as a model, had missed a lot of votes, Bush underscored the patron play by saying, “He wasn’t my senator.”","1622","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"“Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,” Rubio said. And maybe it would have, if Bush had any aptitude for this sort of thing. But he lost the stage, having demonstrated only the sort of petulance that he showed last weekend, when he complained that there were a lot of “really cool things” that he could be doing besides running for President. His only memorable moment came when he bragged about how well his fantasy-football team was doing—“Gronkowski is still going strong!”—better, it seems, than his fantasy Presidential campaign.","1623","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"The Republicans might have liked a “successful” debate even less. Trump’s campaign had fought with CNBC to make sure that the debate wouldn’t go too long and that there would be closing statements, and Trump used that time to say that he had fought CNBC and won: “In about two minutes, I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.” But, once we do go out, where do we go?","1624","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"Political parties are rarely suicidal in Presidential campaigns. While it’s not uncommon for a party to nominate an unelectable candidate in a Senate or House election, the Presidential nominating systems used by both Democrats and Republicans only occasionally produce a fringe candidate. The last time that the Republican Party truly misfired was in 1964, when it nominated Barry Goldwater, who lost forty-four states in the general election. On the Democratic side, the last time the party produced a fringe candidate was in 1972, when George McGovern, who took advantage of new nominating rules that he had helped to write, lost forty-nine states.","October 28, 2015","1625","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"The question that has hung over the Republican race for the past few months is whether the party is on the path to producing another historic loser by nominating an unelectable candidate, like Donald Trump or Ben Carson, or whether Republican voters, many of whom don’t make up their minds until the final days before a caucus or primary, will settle down with a more traditional—and electable—candidate, such as Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, or even the voluble Ted Cruz.","1626","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"Ever since June, when Trump announced his candidacy, the conventional wisdom among G.O.P. and media élites has been that Trump was a soufflé candidate who would collapse just like fringe outsiders in previous contests, such as Herman Cain, in 2012. But recently, a number of prominent observers have stepped forward to declare that, actually, Trump could win the Republican nomination.","1627","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"In August, Norm Ornstein, a longtime and well-regarded political observer, made the most comprehensive argument that Trump could prevail. Ornstein pointed to several factors: a conservative media that has fostered a deeper anti-establishment sentiment among G.O.P. voters, who are less likely to get news from outside an ideological bubble; a more extreme G.O.P. electorate, especially on the issue of immigration; the absence of a consensus establishment alternative to Trump; the emergence of Super PACs, which might encourage the traditional candidates to stay in the race longer and divide up the non-Trump vote; and the fact that Trump is “a far more savvy candidate” than Cain and the like.","1628","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"More recently, Alex Castellanos, who worked for Mitt Romney, echoed Ornstein’s arguments, and wrote, “Slow learner that I am, I’ve resisted the idea that Donald Trump could and would become the Republican nominee. Unhappily, I’ve changed my mind.” Steve Schmidt, a veteran of John McCain’s 2008 campaign, has repeatedly argued that Trump could win. Ron Fournier, the National Journal columnist, said in June that Trump “won’t win the G.O.P. nomination,” but this week he changed his mind and wrote, “I was wrong to rule out Trump winning the nomination or the presidency.”","1629","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"Ironically, the recent burst of Trump-could-win commentary occurred just as Trump lost his lead in Iowa to Ben Carson, and, in at least one poll, nationally as well.

"It’s doubtful.","1632","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"The overwhelming majority of Republican voters have repeatedly told pollsters this year that, whatever their choice in any given poll, they haven’t made up their minds yet. Most won’t think hard about their decision for at least another three months. At this point in 2008, Rudy Giuliani was the polling leader. In 2012, it was Cain. Rather than tell us anything deep about voter sentiments, polls at this point generally reflect name recognition and which candidates are receiving the most media attention at any given time.","1633","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"That’s why, despite Bush’s obvious troubles this year, it makes no sense for him to drop out of the race while he still has money in the bank and a very flush Super PAC financing an advertising blitz on his behalf. The most likely scenario remains that the G.O.P. will eventually coalesce around the most conservative candidate who is electable. Bush seems less and less likely to be that person, not because of Trump but because someone like Marco Rubio seems more conservative and more electable.","1634","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"While the G.O.P.’s rightward lurch is well-documented, the influence of the most conservative voters in Republican primaries is frequently overstated. Last year Henry Olsen, writing in the National Interest, dissected the Republican electorate and explained that it is divided into four groups: “moderate or liberal voters; somewhat conservative voters; very conservative, evangelical voters; and very conservative, secular voters.” His surprising argument was that, while most of the media coverage focusses on the latter two groups, which are louder and often more interesting to cover, it is the candidate who wins over the “somewhat conservative voters” who has the best shot at the nomination:","1635","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"While Trump often talks about the silent majority he is awakening, his actual supporters come from the G.O.P.’s noisy minority. The true silent majority in the Republican Party hasn’t picked its candidate yet. As Olsen makes clear, the G.O.P. Presidential electorate is little different from four years ago. Super PACs have not been able to save the candidacies of Rick Perry or Scott Walker, so the traditional process that winnows the field of unfunded candidates continues apace. It’s possible that the “somewhat conservative” kingmakers will end up backing Trump or Carson, but the safe money remains on Rubio, Bush, or even Kasich—one of those “even-keeled men with substantial governing experience.”","1636","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"There was a time—how often has this sentence been written?—when the Republican Party stood for certain ideas, even if they sometimes contradicted each other: for instance, antipathy toward high marginal tax rates and a belief in balanced budgets. On issues involving national security and economic emergencies, many were willing to entertain, and even seek, coöperation from Democrats, as happened after the financial collapse of 2008. It was the approach taken by our postwar (or post-New Deal) Republican Presidents, up to and including George W. Bush, even if the party went through occasional ideological swerves, as when it nominated the sometimes alarming conservative Arizona senator Barry Goldwater, in 1964. But the real live-and-let-live Goldwater, popular with his Senate colleagues, never fully fit his scary image.","October 1, 2015","1637","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"The emergence of the Republican Class of ’16 may be changing the shape of historic Republicanism once and for all. Part of it stems from the “outsiders”—Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina, who have never held elective office and probably never will. But no one better embodies this change than the freshman Texas senator Ted Cruz, who seems unable to stop talking, although the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, recently outsmarted him, as Politico’s Burgess Everett put it, by effectively putting him in party “quarantine.” (McConnell, like past Senate leaders such as Howard Baker and Bob Dole, has the job here of representing the sanity wing of the party.) Cruz, though, knows where to find receptive audiences, as when he recently spoke to the conservative religious Values Voter Summit, in Washington, and went on to win the group’s straw poll, for the third year in a row. (Cruz got thirty-five per cent, followed by Carson, at eighteen per cent, and Mike Huckabee, the perennial champion of his own values, at fourteen per cent.)","1638","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Cruz still surprises. Just when you think he can’t go any further, he goes further. Considering the venue, you can understand why he got an appreciative laugh at the “Values” meeting when he mentioned Xi Jinping’s meeting with President Obama and said, “Media all across the world are reporting on this historic meeting of the world’s most powerful Communist, and the President of China.” (Drum roll.) But his ear has difficulty recognizing the proper key. A few days after Vice-President Joe Biden’s son Beau died, of a brain tumor, Cruz was having his fun: “Joe Biden … You know what the nice thing is? You don’t even need a punch line. I promise you, it works. At the next party you’re at, just walk up to someone and say, ‘Vice-President Joe Biden,’ and just close your mouth. They will crack up laughing.” That wasn’t nearly as funny as the Obama-is-a-big-Communist gag, and perhaps that’s why Cruz offered an apology.","1639","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"On foreign policy, Cruz is even less funny, as when he dilated on the Iran nuclear deal: “If you vote for me, under no circumstances will a nation led by a theocratic Ayatollah, who chants ‘Death to America,’ under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.” So far, that is pretty much what Obama says. Cruz, though, added, “If the Ayatollah doesn’t understand that, we may have to introduce him to his seventy-two virgins,” which sounded very much like a threat to murder Iran’s Supreme Leader. Cruz did not approve of recent Supreme Court decisions that upheld the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage. His solution, as he told Steve Inskeep, of NPR’s “Morning Edition,” is a constitutional amendment—“one that would make members of the Supreme Court subject to periodic judicial retention elections … [so that] if judges overstep their bounds, violate the Constitution, then the people have a check to remove them from office.” This was an attack on a branch of government far more radical than Franklin D. Roosevelt’s infamous “court packing” scheme, in 1937, to add as many as six members when Justices reached age seventy and didn’t retire.","1640","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Sounding mean-spirited and over the top is nothing new in American politics. Senator Joseph McCarthy, to whom Cruz bears a slight physical resemblance (it’s the eyebrows), made use of the Red Scare to attack Democrats. McCarthy, like Louisiana’s Huey Long, belonged to a subcategory of demagogic, disruptive senators, a role that suits Cruz perfectly. McCarthy never ran for President.","1641","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Cruz’s thoughts and language bring to mind the 1993 American Scholar essay “Defining Deviancy Down,” by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (though not Moynihan himself). In it, Moynihan writes, “I proffer the thesis that, over the past generation … the amount of deviant behavior in American society has increased beyond the levels the community can ‘afford to recognize’ and that, accordingly, we have been re-defining deviancy so as to exempt much conduct previously stigmatized, and also quietly raising the ‘normal’ level in categories where behavior is now abnormal by any earlier standard.” Moynihan was writing about crime and antisocial behavior in general, but the change in standards might just as well apply to politics. That someone like Ted Cruz is running for President, and taken seriously—that nearly sixty per cent of Republicans now support, in aggregate, Trump, Fiorina, Carson, and Cruz—suggests that the modern Republican Party is close to “defining politics down.” With more than a year to go before the next Presidential election, Cruz may be posing the essential question: “How far down?”","1642","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"The annual party conference, a centerpiece of the U.K. political calendar, has no analogue in the U.S., but the pregame commentary by the British media resembles the buildup for America’s quadrennial conventions: the controlled leaks of lines from the speech; the unsolicited advice from pundits and scolds; the official photos of the speaker hard at work on the draft. This year’s Labour Party gathering in Brighton has generated more of this sort of interest than usual, since yesterday marked the maiden conference speech of Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s newly elected leader. (The Conservatives will meet next week in Manchester.) Even the photos, unremarkable as they are—Corbyn, in a white shirt with rolled-up cuffs, sits in a room at the Brighton Hilton, writing with a pen or drinking coffee from a paper cup—drew the attention of BuzzFeed. The site invited readers to decipher Corbyn’s scribblings by zooming in on a photo, rotating it, and squinting. Interpretations sprung up on Twitter: “soil please” and “mandatory peas” were phrases people professed to see through the pixels; so were “goats of mercy” and, more darkly, “goats of rage.”","September 30, 2015","1643","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"
"They kid. But, in the run-up to the conference, the question was not whether Corbyn would ride the podium off the rails but how quickly and spectacularly he would do it. In his few weeks as leader, his speeches have been so shambling, malcontented, and overheated that a meltdown in Brighton seemed as likely as not. There is an opposing camp: the young supporters who have just joined Labour and helped install Corbyn as leader. To them, the man’s grouchiness, his allergy to contrivance and spin, is exactly what recommends him. These are the markers of the New Authenticity, prized in Britain no less than in Bernie Sanders’s and Ben Carson’s America.","1644","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"
"Corbyn may be new to his role as party leader, but his problem is not a lack of experience; his problem is a surplus of the wrong kind of experience. At sixty-six, he has been for decades a protest politician—a pest, a goad, answerable chiefly to his own conscience and to Islington North, his constituency in London. Listening to Corbyn, one often has the feeling of being castigated—which might be his intent. He has never, until recently, aimed to appeal to the whole of the Labour Party, never mind the broader electorate. Instead, he has been tuned to a frequency that sounds, to many ears, like a stuck whistle. “People must understand,” Jack Straw, who served as Foreign Secretary under Tony Blair, warned during the leadership contest, “this is a vote for perpetual opposition.”","1645","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"
"Corbyn, it appears, has been listening to his critics. Yesterday’s conference speech made concessions to speechcraft, as well as to stagecraft: Corbyn wore a tie; he used a teleprompter (“autocue” is the British term); and he opened with a run of politically deft jokes, taking the air out of perceptions that he is a radical who would end, among other things, premier-league football. He was friendly, never scary; he didn’t shout more than was necessary. Corbyn’s “movement,” as he portrays it, is a diverse and sunny and, well, effervescent group of Britons who “are fizzing with ideas. Let’s give them the space for that fizz to explode into the joy we want of a better society.” (So maybe he was a little scary.) “Just because I’ve become the leader of this party,” he assured supporters, “I’m not going to stop standing up on those [human rights] issues or being that activist” he’d been before. But, unless you were a member of the Conservative Party (who have nothing but “misery on offer”) or the “commentariat” (“Cut out the personal abuse,” he told them), it was a mostly inoffensive speech, padded with soft-focus phrases like “kinder politics” and “caring society,” and obviously intended to take the edge off his public persona. There were no “goats of rage.” (No goats at all, in fact.)","1646","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"
"It was surely Corbyn’s best big performance to date, but there is substantial room for improvement. The speech had no structure and no consistent theme. It fulfilled, all too well, his anti-political promise of “not necessarily message discipline all the time.” Three-quarters of the way into the hour-long address, Corbyn started to take on the aspect of a man who strikes up a conversation with you at a bar (“pub” is the British term), draws you in with his intensity and intellect, and then at last call is still talking at you about “property and power, class and capital,” having hardly touched his beer (“pint”). Right to the end, Corbyn was still throwing in topics—housing policy, tax breaks to hedge funds—that could well have been introduced by saying, “and another thing.”","1647","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"
"The reception on the floor was enthusiastic, but that was misleading: the crowd was not broadly representative of the party that Corbyn must now try to lead. Some moderate, “Blairite” M.P.’s fled Brighton before Corbyn gave his speech. One, on the way out of town, muttered to a reporter that “it’s like occupied Paris here”; another explained that he was afraid of getting caught on camera wearing a sour expression. As for Corbyn, beyond his repeated promise to “listen to everyone” he had little to offer the disaffected by way of conciliation or common ground. His call for an “open debate in our party” was the sound of one man punting. Nor did he manage to define or direct what he calls “our movement”—or even to argue persuasively that a movement, rather than a loose body of the like-minded, exists. “Our new members,” Corbyn said, “they don’t want to do things the old way.” But what is the new way?","1648","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"
"In Britain, as in America, there is a widespread and well-founded feeling of frustration and disgust with the political process—of being “fed up,” as Corbyn puts it, of being “sick and tired,” as Bernie Sanders often says. But the problem with the New Authenticity, as presently practiced, is that it is just another form of telling people what they want to hear. It offers psychic satisfaction but few credible solutions. “Straight talk,” which Corbyn promises, is not just a matter of tone.","1649","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeremy-corbyn-takes-the-stage"

In Virginia, a well-funded Democratic bid to take control of the State Senate failed. In Mississippi, voters rejected an effort to change the state’s constitution to guarantee more funding for public schools.

In 2008, the Republicans controlled both chambers in fourteen states; today, they control both chambers in thirty states. Some of these states are sparsely populated, but some aren’t. In five of the ten most-populous states in the country—Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas—Republicans run the governor’s mansion and both houses in the State Legislature.

In some places, such as Kentucky, where Mitt Romney won more than sixty per cent of the vote in 2012, disapproval of the President clearly played a role. Bevin, and groups supporting him, ran ad after ad seeking to tie the Democratic candidate, Jack Conway, to the President. (Conway, in turn, ran ads trying to distance himself from Obama.) The Republicans also harped on and on about the supposed evils of Obamacare. Since Kentucky is one of the Southern states where the Affordable Care Act has had a lot of success in bringing down the rate of uninsured (Arkansas is another), Bevin’s effectiveness in demonizing health-care reform was depressing, if not entirely surprising. Rather than acknowledging Obamacare’s successes, he played on voter concerns about rising premiums, large deductibles, and restricted doctor choice. In a state with a lot of evangelical Christians, Republican opposition to gay marriage also played a role.","1654","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"The Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza wrote, on Tuesday, that Bevin has Obama to thank for his victory, at least in part. This is true. But before buying the line that Obama has been a disaster for the Democratic Party in general, two other factors should be noted. First, it isn’t anything new for the Party of a two-term President to suffer electoral losses on Capitol Hill and at the local level. It’s the norm, as Philip A. Klinkner, a political scientist at Hamilton College, pointed out in an article on Vox, last month. When Bill Clinton was elected, there were thirty Democratic governors across the country. When he left office, there were seventeen. When George W. Bush entered the White House, there were twenty-nine Republican governors. When he left, there were twenty-two. Judging by the number of governor’s mansions it now controls, the Democratic Party isn’t in worse shape now than it was in 2000.","1655","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"The other factor that needs to be taken into account is a historical one. Support for the Democratic Party and some of its policies was ebbing in Southern states like Kentucky and Mississippi long before Obama came along. The Party’s problems below the Mason-Dixon line date back to the Civil Rights Act and Richard Nixon’s Southern strategy, which was based on attracting disgruntled white Southerners to the G.O.P. Obama’s Presidency may well have sped up the electoral secession of the Confederate states from the Democratic Party, but it didn’t start the process.","1656","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"The big question now, of course, is whether this development is permanent. In mining the demographic trends that are affecting states like Texas and Florida just as much as the rest of the country, particularly the rise of the Hispanic vote, can the Democrats start to recapture some of the ground they’ve lost in the South, and also in states surrounding the Great Lakes, such as Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin?","1657","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"The short answer is that if they do, it is likely to take a while. Next year, there will be another eleven races for state governorships, and the Republicans will be hoping for wins in Missouri and West Virginia, where the Democratic incumbents—Jay Nixon and Earl Ray Tomblin— can’t run again because of term limits. The Democrats’ best shot of a gain might be in North Carolina, where the Democratic attorney general, Roy Cooper, is challenging Pat McCrory, the Republican governor.","1658","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"Since voters will also be picking a President next November, turnout should be considerably higher than it was on Tuesday and in last year’s midterms, which should help Democrats, on balance. Despite Republican inroads into the white working class, most Americans who are poor or living on modest incomes still tend to go Democratic. But getting them to vote in local elections is a big challenge in years when there isn’t a Presidential election. On the other hand, the electoral map favors the Republicans. To the extent that local races continue to be seen as referendums on eight years of Obama in the Oval Office, it is tough to see Democrats doing well in places like Missouri and West Virginia, where the President’s approval ratings are below forty per cent. And even if the Democrats hold steady in 2016, they will face another big challenge in 2018, when thirty-six governor’s mansions will be up for grabs.","1659","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"In addition to exposing Democratic constituencies to Republican efforts to cut social programs, dismantle environmental protections, and weaken labor unions, the Party’s losses at the local level are also handicapping it nationally. More Republican state legislatures means more congressional districts gerrymandered to benefit the G.O.P. And the dearth of Democratic governors is depriving the Party of potential future leaders. When it was at a low ebb during the Reagan years, Southern Democrats like Clinton and Al Gore helped revive it. Today, it is hard to identify their successors.","1660","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"After consoling themselves with their success at the Presidential level, some senior Democrats are finally facing up to the dangers facing the Party and the extent to which it has fallen behind the Republicans in organizing at the local level. The report by the D.N.C. task force acknowledged that the G.O.P.’s “stranglehold on state houses, governorships and congressional seats is a by-product of more than 30 years of organizing, fostering talent and significant financial investments at the state and local level.”","1661","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"Efforts are under way to match the Republicans. Earlier this year, the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democratic donors that includes George Soros, agreed to spend tens of millions of dollars at the local level, on such initiatives as building up progressive networks, launching ballot initiatives, and countering Republican groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council. “People have gotten a wake-up call,” Gara LaMarche, the president of the Democracy Alliance, told the Washington Post. “The right is focused on the state level, and even down-ballot, and has made enormous gains. We can’t have the kind of long-term progressive future we want if we don’t take power in the states.”","1662","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"Smart Democrats recognize that reviving their Party is a long-term project. Ironically, however, they could get a short-term boost at the local level if they lose the White House next year and the G.O.P. retains its majorities in the House and the Senate. With the Republicans exerting complete control in Washington—no screaming, please—there would be the potential for a backlash come the 2018 midterms. Democrats, however, need to do more than pin their hopes on the emergence of another unpopular Republican President.","1663","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-and-the-g-o-p-s-red-sea"
"You can think of the three minor candidates who were onstage at last night’s Democratic Presidential debate as ghosts, who, in addition to whatever other qualities doomed them to insignificance, represent vanished political types. Lincoln Chafee, as he noted, was the liberal Republican, a once influential, though maybe not numerous, group that was long ago expelled from its original party but has not been fully accepted by its new one. Jim Webb was the Reagan Democrat—the military-culture white Southerner who leans conservative on social issues. Martin O’Malley was the urban Catholic white-ethnic liberal, representing what’s left of the old political machines that produced the Kennedys. None of these groups could be written off in late-twentieth-century presidential politics; now, evidently, they can.","October 14, 2015","1664","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, was the undead: a representative of an ideology, socialism, that was buried with the Eugene Debs campaign of 1912, but now, unaccountably, has been resurrected, with “middle class” replacing “workingmen” in the rhetoric. Yes, Hillary Clinton won the debate, and yes, she will be the Democratic nominee, but the big surprise of the Democratic campaign so far has been voters’ response to Sanders. A year ago, nobody would have predicted that of the other Democratic presidential candidates, Sanders would be the one who mattered.","1665","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"There seems to be more going on here than Sanders’s ability to take advantage of the atypicality of Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two voting states in the campaign for the nomination. More than the other candidates, he has a simple, clear, strong message, which he repeats constantly. The packaging—Brooklyn accent, bad hair—reinforces the sense of angry authenticity. And it’s worth noting that he’s obviously uncomfortable when forced outside the tight box of economic populism. That’s why he has trouble talking about Black Lives Matter and gun control. (Margaret Talbot wrote about Sanders’s campaign for the magazine last week.)","1666","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"One aspect of Clinton’s adept performance last night was that at every opportunity, she tried to change the subject from her Democratic opponents to the Republicans. She knows they’re her real opponents, and a far more significant obstacle to her becoming President. So, on the evidence of the debate, how do her prospects look? Merely being prepared, assured, and on-message doesn’t guarantee victory. You also have to connect.","1667","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"The big, obvious gap between the two parties at this moment is on non-economic issues. In the Republican debates, it has been interesting to see how difficult a time the more moderate candidates have had creating any general-election breathing room for themselves on issues like abortion, gun control, marriage equality, and immigration. Conversely, it was interesting to see last night how completely comfortable Clinton has become with what not long ago were dangerously liberal positions, even for a Democrat, on these issues. This year Clinton and her party are obviously betting that social issues will break strongly their way. If they turn out to be wrong, that will be an unpleasant surprise for Clinton.","1668","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"The strong feelings that Sanders has tapped into present a greater challenge for Clinton. For one thing, the voters this year, in both parties, are in an anti-Establishment mood—that explains not just Sanders’s popularity, but also Donald Trump’s and Ben Carson’s. Clinton is part of the Establishment, and there’s no way around it. She was also the least anti-Wall Street candidate on the stage last night. It was almost surreal to see Anderson Cooper, the moderator, have to define Glass-Steagall—a Depression-era piece of financial regulation that Bill Clinton effectively repealed when he was President—because the candidates were so eager to talk about it that they forgot the first rule of debate training, which is never to get technical. Clinton noted that as a senator, she represented Wall Street, and her attempts to distance herself from it were obviously well rehearsed, but not even in Sanders’s range, emotionally.","1669","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"In the Times last week, Thomas Edsall wrote a counterintuitive column arguing that the Democrats have become, if not the party of the rich, the party that has the loyalty of most rich people. Clinton would never sign on to that sentiment, but Sanders’s challenge has forced her into speaking supportively about “capitalism” and “business”—not traditionally Democratic terms—onstage. And on the Republican side, though almost everyone’s rhetoric is anti-government, we have not heard defenses of Wall Street in response to the Democrats’ attacks. The Democrats don’t automatically own economic populism in this election.","1670","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"There is no chance that the Republican nominee, whoever it is, will talk like Bernie Sanders. But it’s almost certain that he will argue that, more than Clinton, he understands the behind-the-eight-ball feeling that pervades the American middle class, and propose to do a better job of fixing it than she would. Such an argument won’t necessarily come across as hollow just because it’s coming from a Republican. Bernie Sanders is getting at something powerful, which matters to a lot more people than socialists. Clinton’s biggest challenge is finding her way to a more powerful, and perhaps less prepared, way of persuading the disempowered middle class that she can be its champion.","1671","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"“Our goal tonight is to have a true debate,” CNN’s Jake Tapper said at the opening of Wednesday night’s entertainment. “A debate doubleheader” is what CNN called it, but the preferred sports analogy was to boxing. Last month’s feisty Fox News debate having been dubbed Round One—“If you think Round One was intense, you haven’t seen anything yet!”—an onscreen clock counted down the seconds to Round Two. The idea was to put the candidates in a ring two at a time, show them in split-screen, and poke them with sticks. “Tell Donald Trump why he’s wrong,” Tapper begged the candidates. They obliged with sucker punches and dodges but no knockouts. Like every other televised Presidential debate, except more so, Round Two was more of a long, disjointed, train wreck of a group interview than anything resembling an actual debate. Three reporters (but mainly Tapper) spent nearly five hours asking questions of fifteen candidates, in two sessions. They got canned answers, piety, and jibber-jabber. As debate, it was terrible; as television—“Hollywood Squares” meets “The Bachelor”—it was unlookawayable, at least for the first eight or ten minutes or so and then, really, you could look away, especially if you had something super important to do, like loading the dishwasher.","September 17, 2015","1672","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"Democracy requires deliberative debate: people who want to govern themselves have to determine what rules to live by and what men and women to elect to represent them.

"The first televised Presidential debate was held between Kennedy and Nixon, in 1960. Nixon was expected to win, because he was a good debater, in the college-debate-society sense. Kennedy won because he didn’t debate; instead, he gave an excellent interview. The Kennedy-Nixon debate was followed by sixteen years of not bothering, but there have been televised Presidential debates since 1976, when Jimmy Carter bested Gerald Ford. Last night’s eleven-at-once is the largest number of Presidential aspirants on a debate stage, but not by much. In 2003, nine Democratic candidates appeared in front of CNN cameras, at the Orpheum Theatre in Phoenix. That night, Carol Moseley Braun said Americans should elect her because “the men have ruined it, our country is a mess, it’s time to give a woman a chance,” while Howard Dean said the one thing he knew, from the polls, was that “there are five of us up here who are going to beat George W. Bush.” It turns out that most of what people say at debates is both forgettable and wrong.","1674","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"This year’s CNN G.O.P. debate was held in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. “By the end of this debate, this will be the most time I’ve spent in any library,” Lindsey Graham offered, cheerfully, during the four-man opening act. The podiums were lined up in front of a decommissioned Air Force One, which is on display in the library. George Pataki looked as though he wanted to open up a hatch and hide inside. Rick Santorum got uncharacteristically animated, talking about American workers. But Bobby Jindal won the Barry Goldwater Prize for Reckless Political Incitement when he said, “Immigration without assimilation is invasion.”","1675","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"What CNN called “The Main Event” started at 8 P.M. E.S.T., prime time, and obeyed an unwritten rule of television: the bloodier, the better. If a candidate mentioned another candidate, even if only in passing, that other candidate was given an opportunity to reply and encouraged to take a swipe. CNN must have thought this would make great television, and help draw an audience as big as the unprecedented number of viewers who tuned in for last month’s Fox News debate. The hitch here, though, is that televised Presidential debates are all or nearly all that many citizens see of the American political process. Is this how the nation’s political leaders want to model disagreement and deliberation in a democracy? By kicking each other in the shins? A lot of high-school kids were required to watch the CNN debate, and, in class, they’ll hold their own debates, applying the lesson this debate taught them, which is that appearance is everything and squabbling is everything else.","1676","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"“Mr. Trump is a wonderful entertainer,” Carly Fiorina said, when Tapper asked her if she wanted Trump’s finger on the “nuclear button.” Somehow this led to Trump arguing that “Rand Paul shouldn’t even be on this stage” and that Pataki, who in fact wasn’t on the stage, “couldn’t be elected dogcatcher.”","1677","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"Fiorina appeared poised and commanding, and Marco Rubio appeared eloquent and erudite. (“We should have a deeper debate about these issues,” Rubio said, and he meant it.) Ted Cruz reached for learnedness and never achieved it: as always, he looked nuts. Ben Carson had the best suit, and the gentlest and most appealing laugh, though he had very little to say. I forgot Scott Walker was there. Jeb Bush was nervous. He took a jab at Trump, claiming that when Trump wanted to open casinos in Florida, he’d tried to buy politicians with campaign donations. After Trump denied this, Carson piped in that he wouldn’t “lick the boots of billionaires,” which was memorable, but not in a good way.","1678","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"“If I were sitting at home watching this back and forth, I’d be inclined to turn it off,” John Kasich said, as things got fiery, fairly early in the debate, thereby revealing that, while he is a sane man among madmen, he has no real knowledge of American television.","1679","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"There was much discussion of the Iran deal, ISIS, and the Middle East. Rubio and Paul were sober. “This world is a mess,” Trump said, summing up his foreign policy. He blamed President Obama: “Somehow, he just doesn’t have courage.” Mike Huckabee declared, “This is about the survival of Western civilization.” The domestic version of Huckabee’s impassioned rhetoric was Fiorina on the need to defund to Planned Parenthood: “This is about the character of our nation.” Chris Christie blamed Hillary Clinton: “She believes in the systematic murder of children in the womb.” This produced another spat between Trump and Bush. “You said you were going to cut funding for women’s health issues, you said it,” Trump said. “I heard you.” And, presumably because the subject was, vaguely, women, this led to Tapper raising the matter of Trump having said, in comments to Rolling Stone, that no one can stand to look at Fiorina’s face and later insisting that, by “face,” he meant “persona.” Shoved into the ring with Trump, Fiorina said, “I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.” Here Trump did a kind of curtsy: “I think she’s got a beautiful face, and I think she’s a beautiful woman.” And when the topic turned to immigration, and descended very quickly into the question of whether Bush ought to speak Spanish in public, and why Trump had insulted Bush’s Mexican-born wife, Trump refused to apologize and curtseyed again: “I’ve heard she’s a lovely woman.”","1680","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"It went on for a while after that. (“Can you believe @CNN is ‘milking’ it for almost 3 hours?” Trump had tweeted earlier in the day.) Near the end, Tapper cited former Reagan Secretary of State George Shultz, who has called for a more active government response to climate change, whereupon Christie called the notion that people can help fix the problem a “wild, left-wing idea.” Ben Carson turned a question about whether vaccines cause autism into an indictment of big government. In a round robin, Tapper asked the candidates which woman they’d put on the U.S. ten-dollar bill. Presumably, he meant American women, but Bush named Margaret Thatcher and Kasich came up with Mother Teresa. There was mention of Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, and Abigail Adams. Rubio made a compelling case for Rosa Parks. But three of the candidates apparently couldn’t think of any American woman worth honoring, and instead—more curtseying—suggested their own relatives, Carson his mother, Huckabee his wife, and Trump his daughter.","1681","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
