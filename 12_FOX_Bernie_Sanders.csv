"DAMAGED GOODS NO BARGAIN FOR DEMOCRATS Another day, another revelation of ethical misconduct in Clintonland. This time it’s the Boston Globe’s discovery that the largest single non-profit group in the Clinton network utterly ignored the disclosure agreement that Hillary Clinton promised would be a bulwark against corruption during her tenure as secretary of state. Foreign donations exploded during Clinton’s tenure as America’s chief diplomat, but her organization said nothing about it. At the same time, we are learning more about the astronomical overhead in the Clinton family’s charitable network. So it is no wonder that Politico reports that the donors who have funded the multi-billion-dollar enterprise – the kind of folks who go on whirlwind Africa tours with Bill Clinton – are getting queasy about the new scrutiny and the serial improprieties. Their world is shrinking down to folks like billionaire Tom Steyer, who openly embrace the Washington cash-for-influence game. So what’s a conscientious liberal to do? The GOP is out of the question. Republicans are tumbling over themselves to seek the favor of the super PAC donor whales who are preparing to fund potentially hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of red-on-red attack ads in the coming months. This isn’t a big problem for GOP voters, though, since the members of the party widely oppose restrictions on political spending. But for liberal Democrats, these are famine times. The wife of a former president is preparing to claim by regal right their party’s nomination. She is mired in a scandal that involves boatloads of cash from unseemly sources, the violation of basic transparency standards and the destruction of huge troves of documents. To go from “hope and change” back to “no controlling legal authority” is a far fall indeed. But there’s nothing else to be done, right? Wrong, say liberals. A fake primary is just what’s in order. While Matt Taibbi is quite right that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is about as real as it gets in Washington, the response to his declaration for president has been as phony as the bust lines at a Georgetown brunch. Others are still touting “the virtual candidate” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and her supposed ability to make the Clintons compliant. (Because people who were not bound by bulletproof language in disclosure agreements drafted by teams of lawyers can be counted on to honor backroom deals with rival politicians… ) But Sanders is really running and he is driven by a righteous ideological fire, sort of a Rick Santorum of the left – a Jeremiah warning his party of the dangers of falling away from the faith of its fathers. Millions of pixels are being poured out about how Sanders could make things “interesting” and “shape the Democratic race.” Some of this is the lamentable but understandable product of beat writers looking for any hook on which to hang a necessary long-shot-candidate-declares write. Some of it seems sincere. Consider Jill Lawrence who is ecstatic over “an explosion of substance” on the Democratic side. Well… Yes, Clinton gave a policy talk (in which she repudiated policies set in place by her husband but without explaining any part of her head-snapping reversal), but the Democratic race still isn’t one. Imagine if on this date the only declared candidate standing athwart Jeb Bush’s drive to the nomination was Santorum. How would Republicans feel? That’s the sinking feeling that will be setting in for Democrats over the months to come. The enormous empire built by the Clintons – plus the consequences to the party’s bench from successive midterm waves – has scared everyone out of the field except for a Jeremiah and, perhaps, a couple of guys who don’t appeal to the party’s base. Liberal Democrats may like the idea of a phony primary that nudges Clinton on ideology, but shadowboxing with a socialist senator from Vermont who is six years older than the 67-year-old presumptive nominee won’t keep Clinton busy, even for six weeks. With no race, there’s no interest. With no interest, there’s no pressure. Reform-minded Democrats are looking for a way to make it right to coronate the woman who has more fully inhabited the Washington establishment than perhaps any national politician of her generation. Good luck in your rationalizing. THE JUDGE’S RULING: ROUNDHEADS ON THE POTOMAC Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano looks back to the dark days of Oliver Cromwell to underscore that the Constitution is designed to not only to prevent the perception but also to prevent the reality of the tyranny of one man’s opinion: “President Barack Obama has rejected not only the theory but also the practice of due process by his use of drones launched by the CIA to kill Americans and others overseas.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Researchers and scientists announced that they found remains of the first feathered dinosaur in North America, reports Discover magazine. Though the fossils found do not have an individual name yet they are part of the Ornithomimus family meaning they look similar to the modern-day ostrich. The discovery caused a stir in the paleontology world, but gave more questions than answers, particularly on the purpose for the feathers since feathered dinosaurs are not thought to fly. A floated theory is that they used them as means of communication, or momentum when running on the ground. Regardless of the purpose, researchers are already hot on the chase for more feathered dinosaurs and the purpose for the additional feature. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Ted Cruz, R-Texas] advanced a theory as to why a candidate with his views can succeed with the Hispanic vote, insisting that Romney’s tough talk on immigration had nothing to do with the relatively anemic 27 percent of the Hispanic vote he mustered in his 2012 campaign. ‘The media repeatedly said the reason Mitt Romney got clobbered in the Hispanic community was because of immigration,’ Cruz said during a question-and-answer session at the National Press Club. ‘The data don’t bear that out,’ said Cruz, adding that Hispanics care most about the economy. ‘The Obama economy has been a disaster for the Hispanic community,’ he said. The reason Cruz Romney got ‘clobbered’ was his ‘infamous comment’ that Republicans don’t have to worry about the 47 percent of all Americans vote reliably Democratic because they feel entitled to government services. ‘I can't think of a statement in politics I disagree with more strongly,’ said Cruz.” Picks Iowa campaign chairman - USA Today: “Former Iowa secretary of State Matt Schultz will lead the Iowa campaign for Ted Cruz as the Texas senator seeks the Republican nomination for the presidency…Schultz currently serves as the Madison County attorney, a post voters elected him to in November.” RUBIO PUSHES HARD FOR ISRAEL AMENDMENT NYT: “Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, is demanding a vote on an amendment that would press Iran to recognize the state of Israel, threatening a fragile bipartisan coalition that had already fashioned a compromise bill giving Congress a voice in the Iran nuclear talks. As other Republican senators worked to persuade their colleagues to pass the bill largely unchanged, Mr. Rubio, a candidate for president, seemed determined to press a series of amendments that would significantly toughen the legislation, and if passed, would almost certainly provoke a veto by President Obama, who is already reluctant to give Congress any role in an Iran deal. ‘This is not a game,’ Mr. Rubio said. ‘This is a very serious matter.’”","70","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/30/damaged-goods-no-bargain-for-democrats.html"

Roughly half of the nation’s top 250 Republican donors have given money to Mr. Walker in his campaigns for Wisconsin governor, according to an Upshot analysis of Federal Election Commission records and state records.

Rand Paul’s (R., Ky.) most prominent pro-Israel backer, who funded the senator’s 2013 visit to Israel, is throwing his support fully behind Gov. Scott Walker’s prospective presidential campaign, he told the Washington Free Beacon. Rich Roberts, a major Republican donor from New Jersey, has been central to Paul’s Jewish outreach efforts.

Though the plan is non-binding and spending bills must be passed, the proposal lays out the Republican vision of how to handle the taxpayers’ money. With the 2016 political battlefield in sight reaction was swift. Democrats called it a “gimmicky” plan that paves the way for tax break for the wealthy, while Republicans said it would make Washington “live within its means.” A vote in the House is expected Friday with the Senate following suit next week. [Winners and losers - National Journal takes a look at the compromises leading up to the GOP budget plan] What’s in the plan - Bloomberg: “The budget proposal spells out the Republican Party’s priorities by calling for $5.3 trillion in spending cuts to reach balance in nine years. Of this, $4.1 trillion in reductions would come from programs including entitlements like Medicare. Discretionary spending in 2016 would be limited to $1.016 trillion, while war funding would total $96 billion, far above Obama’s request. The plan allows total spending of $3.9 trillion in 2016, with a $400 billion deficit.” Early snag on VA spending bill over war fund - The Hill: “House Republicans delayed a vote Wednesday night on their first spending bill of the year amid concerns that a controversial bipartisan amendment to eliminate use of a Pentagon war fund for military construction projects might have the votes to pass….[House] leadership decided to push back votes on the legislation…until Thursday. The amendment offered by [Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C.,]… would strike provisions of the bill for military construction projects that use funds from the Pentagon's war fund known as the Overseas Contingency Operations account. Both Van Hollen and Mulvaney argued it represented a budgetary ‘gimmick’ to avoid spending caps established by the 2011 budget deal known as the Budget Control Act (BCA).” MCCONNELL LAUNCHES SURPRISE OFFENSIVE ON EPA WashEx: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he plans to use a little-known, little-studied, little-used Clean Air Act clause to undercut a key element of the Environmental Protection Agency’s attempt to cut carbon emissions from power plants. The Kentucky Republican cited language in the Clean Air Act, the federal law under which the EPA is crafting its climate change regulation, that he said requires Congress to approve regional cap-and-trade plans and other compacts. That’s key because the EPA has touted multi-state plans as the best, most cost-efficient way to meet its proposed rule’s goals, and some states are planning to use that strategy.” SUNDAY’S GOOD NEWS IS… Fox News colleague Dana Perino may not always like what’s on the pages of the New York Times, but there’s one upcoming edition she is sure to like.

"Homers - But while Rubio and Walker would need a win or at least a good showing in Iowa to propel themselves into the final fight with establishmentarian Jeb Bush, Iowa means everything to the candidates who would need a win there to fuel their candidacies. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., might be considered the favorite in a state where he won a stunning victory in 2008, but former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., and former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, also have favorability in the state. Newbies like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., have put a lot of time in the Iowa, however, and might catch fire among libertarian-leaning Republicans, while unknowns like Carly Fiorina, who spent the past five days in Iowa, might take with voters there too. Not on the schedule is Ben Carson, who is expected to launch his candidacy next week in Detroit. [Cruz heads to Tulsa, Oklahoma today for a rally with former Alaska Gov.

They were wrong, Hayek said in his Nobel lecture, entitled ‘The Pretence of Knowledge.’ They didn’t have enough solid information. What they lacked couldn’t be reduced to a number. It wasn’t quantifiable.

"DRAMA ERUPTS ON PLANET HILLARY On the eve of one of the high holidays on Planet Hillary, the winter meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in New York, the bitter feuding long rumored to be simmering within Democratic 2016 frontrunner’s campaign erupted. One of Hillary Clinton’s top lieutenants, David Brock, fired off a letter resigning from the board of Priorities USA Action, the main super PAC funding what is expected to be a more-than $2 billion effort to return the Clintons to the White House. WaPo reports that Brock quit in an angry letter denouncing “an orchestrated political hit job” by his rivals inside the campaign that came in the form of a brutal NYT story on Brock’s fundraising efforts and huge commissions paid to a professional buckraker. Hours later, though, Brock offered to rejoin the 12-member board and board members promised they were “working to address” Brock’s concerns. As the Clinton campaign ponders when to make it official, keeping the team together looks like a major concern.","135","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/10/drama-erupts-on-planet-hillary.html"

"More money, more problems - The problem, of course, is the amount of money involved. While Hillary will not there today, her husband and daughter will be backscratching with leaders from big business and big labor in New York. And while the hundreds of millions of dollars the Clintons have raised for their foundation isn’t campaign cash, it’s all part of an empire built around the celebrity and potential return to power of the former first couple. And as the campaign prepares to file paperwork and the PACs prepare to start making larger payouts, the fight for control is evidently intensifying. Brock’s allegations read like he believes the many members of Team Obama and rival Clintonites were looking to elbow him out with allegations of impropriety right before the starting pistol fired. So ask yourself this: Do you expect these problems to get better or worse as time goes on? And here we see one of the major dangers to Clinton being without a real rival for her party’s nomination. If there is no common threat, the animosity will be directed inward.","137","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/10/drama-erupts-on-planet-hillary.html"

We already have the microchip, we're working on small handheld devices in [a doctor’s] office.” During her battle, Boyle and his wife discussed possible applications of his company’s technology, “You develop technologies for a reason.

Other times it's to make a difference.” Boyle is optimistic to have the system out to the public in the next two years with ambitious goals including “to save the NHS £245m - but more importantly to save 10,000 lives.” If successful there are plans to include tests for bowel cancer, tuberculosis and asthma.","152","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/10/drama-erupts-on-planet-hillary.html"

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “And the idea, the line that [President Obama] and [Angela Merkel] were pushing today about how united the allies are, is itself a farce.

"WHAT’S WITH THE WORD GAME ON ISLAMIST MILITANTS? Since when did White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest become a theologian? Pressed on the administration’s tortured effort to avoid the I-word when talking about attacks by Islamist militants, Earnest offered a long disquisition as to why. But the core reason seemed to be that since the Islamists’ conduct did not comport with Islamic values, the militants did not qualify for membership: As Earnest put it, it stems for a desire for “accuracy.” This hearkens to President Obama’s claim this summer that the Islamic State is not Islamic because its conduct doesn’t reflect the values of the faith and not really a state, either. Okay. Or, reaching back to the beginning of what was then known as the Arab Spring, when a top administration official claimed the Muslim Brotherhood was “a largely secular” organization. Or the claim this week from a State Department spokeswoman who said that talking about Islamist extremism might improperly minimize the threat from other forms of violent ideological extremism. Like which ones? Well… The president and his team seem to have lashed themselves to the idea that somehow non-Muslim politicians in the West have some say in defining the Pillars of Islam. Facing increasing press criticism for tortured and obfuscatory language, however, the armchair theologians of the White House are spending a lot of time explaining their view of the faith. This stubbornness is interfering with the effort to explain the administration’s policy to a skeptical public and rally support for the president’s plan (whatever that may be). Sekulow: Legal semantics blunt sane strategy - Fox News Opinion: Pointing to the deadly threat posed by Western jihadists carrying out attacks on the homeland, Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice writes that it’s time to strip U.S. citizenship from those who enlist in militant groups: “The law currently provides that Americans can lose citizenship when they enter or serve in the armed forces of an enemy foreign state. But ISIS and al Qaeda are not “foreign states,” so the law doesn’t apply….stripping citizenship and revoking passports represent just two small steps – but critical ones – towards a sane national security strategy. However, it’s difficult to take even these small steps with the Obama Administration steadfastly refuses to name our enemies (Mr. President, our enemies are Islamic radicals, not generic “extremists”), accurately describe their ideology (no, they are not “nihilists”), or even to acknowledge their obvious, widespread appeal in the Muslim world.”","220","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/14/whats-with-word-game-on-islamist-militants.html"
"HOUSE VOTE TO BLOCK OBAMA IMMIGRATION MOVES EXPECTED TODAY The House is poised to vote today to block President Obama’s immigration executive actions granting temporary amnesty to illegal immigrants, despite a White House veto threat. Fox News: “The House began debate Tuesday night on a Department of Homeland Security spending bill which Republicans want to use to defund and undo the president’s immigration plans…. ‘We’re voting to block the president’s overreach, his executive overreach, which I believe is beyond his constitutional duty and frankly violates the Constitution itself,’ House Speaker John Boehner said. ‘This is not about the issue of immigration. What it is about is the president acting lawlessly.’…But House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md.,…called Republicans’ approach ‘indefensible’ and ‘irresponsible.’ Democrats, and even some Republicans, warn that the effort to wage the immigration fight during debate over a DHS spending bill risks vital security funding – at a time when the department is ramping up security measures in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Current DHS funding expires at the end of February” Keep it simple - WashEx’s Byron York wrote recently that unless Republicans lawmakers bill to block President Obama’s immigration actions is simple and direct they risk failure: “Republicans have two basic options, and as the time to act nears, it appears they are preparing to choose the one more likely to fail. The first option is to pass a brief, simple bill that denies funding for the implementation of Obama’s action…Such a move would be direct, unambiguous, and would focus specifically on Obama's action, which is what the controversy is about in the first place. The second option is to begin with a defunding measure but then add other provisions, targeting not just Obama’s executive action but also a large chunk of the president’s immigration policy going back five years….In answering the president's overreach on immigration, Capitol Hill Republicans are engaging in some overreach of their own.”","221","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/14/whats-with-word-game-on-islamist-militants.html"
"OBAMA TO USE PEN TO IMPOSE NEW METHANE REGS NYT: “In President Obama’s latest move using executive authority to tackle climate change, administration officials will announce plans this week to impose new regulations on the oil and gas industry’s emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, according to a person familiar with Mr. Obama’s plans. The administration’s goal is to cut methane emissions from oil and gas production by up to 45 percent by 2025 from the levels recorded in 2012. The Environmental Protection Agency will issue the proposed regulations this summer, and final regulations by 2016, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the administration had asked the person not to speak about the plan….Environmental advocates have long urged the Obama administration to target methane emissions, and the rules would be the first to do so….The oil and gas industry has pushed back against methane regulations, insisting that new rules could stymie a booming industry and that voluntary industrywide standards are sufficient to prevent methane leaks….The new rules are part of Mr. Obama’s push for regulations designed to cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases from different sectors of the economy. The White House says it can make the moves under the Clean Air Act, rather than by trying to push legislation through the Republican-controlled congress.” Is climate change real? Senate to put it to a vote - The Hill: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday he will allow the Senate to vote on an amendment asking if they agree that climate change is impacting the planet. At his weekly press briefing, McConnell said ‘nobody is blocking any amendments’ to legislation that would approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline….But a measure proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had raised questions about whether he would stick to that commitment. The Sanders measure asks whether lawmakers agree with the overwhelming consensus of scientists who say climate change is impacting the planet and is worsened by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Democrats believe the measure could be a tough vote for some Republicans, particularly GOP senators running for reelection in 2016 in states carried by President Obama in 2012….Sanders's amendment is one of many Democrats are looking to tack on to the controversial bill, which Republicans are eager to send to President Obama’s desk. The White House has threatened to veto the Keystone legislation. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... Ludwig van Beethoven relied in part on the beats of his heart to continue to compose masterpieces after he lost his hearing. Now, some researchers argue that some of the irregularities in his music may directly correspond with cardiac arrhythmia. Co-author Joel Howell, M.D., Ph.D, says, “When your heart beats irregularly from heart disease, it does so in some predictable patterns. We think we hear some of those same patterns in his music.” Cardiologist Dr. Zachary Goldberger says that while Beethoven was linked to a variety of illnesses nothing could be diagnostically proven at the time, “However, the symptoms and common association of an abnormal heartbeat with so many diseases makes it a reasonable assumption that Beethoven experienced arrhythmia – and the works we describe may be ‘musical electrocardiograms,’…While these musical arrhythmias may simply manifest Beethoven’s genius, there is a possibility that in certain pieces his beating heart could literally be at the heart of some of the greatest masterpieces of all time.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Scott Walker [R-Wis.]. The Wisconsin Republican plans to enter the 2016 contest by mid summer, and Team Walker calculates that a competition between Romney and Jeb Bush for cash and endorsements slows the former Florida governor’s momentum, providing Walker with more room to maneuver.

Reid [D-Nev.] and has worked on the campaigns of many Senate Democrats.” Podesta timeline - WSJ:“John Podesta, a top White House adviser, will take on a senior advisory role in Hillary Clinton’s emerging presidential bid after he leaves the administration in February, three people familiar with the matter said. The move is one of the most definitive signs yet that Mrs. Clinton is building the apparatus to launch a 2016 campaign.” WARREN GIVES DEFINITIVE ‘NO’ ON PRESIDENTIAL RUN Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., gave what may have been her most categorical rejection of a 2016 run in an interview with former FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair for Fortune. Warren, who has previously favored a present-tense evasion, saying she is “not running” for president, was direct with her former colleague. Blair asked, “So are you going to run for President?” Warren offered a one-word answer: “No.” But draft effort kicks into higher gear - AP: “[Liberal] activists hoping to draft Sen. Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.] into the 2016 presidential race will hold their first meeting in the key early-voting state of New Hampshire on Saturday. Members of MoveOn.org and Democracy for America are starting their ‘Run, Warren, Run’ New Hampshire effort with a meeting in Manchester.” POWER PLAY: TRUST GAP HAMPERS WORK ON OBAMACARE Nebraska’s freshman Republican Sen. Ben Sasse came to the senate with a unique resume on the number one issue for many in his party: A way to replace ObamaCare. Sasse, a former top Bush administration health insurance official, tells Power Play host Chris Stirewalt about the plan to replace the law and how Washington can restore enough trust with voters to tackle the topic. WATCH HERE. STEYER ‘WILL DECIDE SOON’ ON SENATE RUN The Hill: “Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer said Tuesday that he is close to deciding on whether to run for Senate in 2016. Steyer did not say whether he would run for the seat Sen. Barbara Boxer [D-Calif.] is leaving, nor which way he is leaning. ‘Holding office is a sacred trust in our society, and I am honored that so many colleagues and friends have encouraged me to consider entering this race,’ Steyer wrote Tuesday in the Huffington Post. ‘California Democrats are blessed to have a deep bench of talent, and I will decide soon based on what I think is the best way to continue the hard work we have already started together to prevent climate disaster and preserve American prosperity.’ Shortly after Boxer announced her intention to retire from the Senate in two years, a close ally of Steyer said he was considering running, and was reaching out to fellow Democrats in an effort to gauge their interest.” DELICIOUS BOOTLEGGING SURE TO ENSUE Reuters reports that frugal Swiss residents will have to look for other ways to keep their cheap pizza delivery. The strong Swiss franc has residents crossing the border into Germany and France looking for deals. Swiss customs officials removed an exception that allowed food delivery including pizza to cross the border without having to pass through customs. That rule previously prompted businesses to offer deals targeted at the Swiss customers. The Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Hochrhein-Bodensee, a region of Germany that shares a Swiss border, had been lobbying for the exception to be reinstated for pizza deliveries. Officials have ruled against granting such waiver for now. “IHK Hochrhein-Bodensee is disappointed with this information and will, in the interests of our member companies, continue to work to find a solution,” the industry body’s Chief Executive Uwe Boehm said.

"SHOVEL READY: TEAM OBAMA SEES ISLAMIST THREAT AS JOBS PROBLEM Today is the start of the White House conference on “violent extremism,” which is the administration’s preferred euphemism for Islamist terrorism and militancy. The point is to gather government officials from around the world to discuss strategies for dealing with extremists of every kind. The actual purpose is to show that the president is doing something about a war effort Americans are deeply dubious about . One of the spokeswomen for the State Department certainly set the tone for the big to-do in an interview with MSNBC. And Marie Harf certainly had a doozy of a Kinsley gaffe. She explained to an exasperated Chris Matthews that it wasn’t about winning military conflict with ISIS or other Islamist militants, but rather dealing with “root causes.” She offered this to Matthews demand for a more robust offensive: “…we cannot win this war by killing them, we cannot kill our way out of this war.” So what is the way to victory? “We need, in the longer term, medium and longer term, to go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups, whether it’s lack of opportunity for jobs...” Ah. [WashEx: “According to a Brookings Institution survey of American Political Science Association scholars, they put Obama on the worst, not best, list by a margin of nearly three-to-one.”] ‘And his momma cried…’ - “Good jobs for good wages” sounds like an increasingly far-fetched campaign slogan in several parts of America as salary stagnation remains upon us. But if you think selling it Nashua, N.H. is tough, try Yemen. When people are eating grass and dirt, long-term economic recovery would sound just plain silly. When they’re eating grass with murderous Islamists pointing Kalashnikovs at them, it would sound downright cruel. But that’s what Harf said. She argued that the U.S. should work to end to the poverty that “makes these 17-year-old kids pick up an AK-47” instead of “trying to start a business.” In this version, a budding entrepreneur is trapped in a hopeless society and eventually turns to “violent extremism” [wink, wink] in frustration. It is like Elvis Presley’s “In the Ghetto” but for global Jihad. This doesn’t quite explain why certain poor people are peaceful while others seem to be increasingly falling prey to “violent extremism” [nudge, nudge] but it’s not an insane point of view… for an Elvis song, or Methodists missionaries or the International Monetary Fund. For the government that is charged with protecting America, however, this is some wild stuff. [WaPo: “Shiite militias backed by Iran are increasingly taking the lead in Iraq’s fight against the Islamic State, threatening to undermine U.S. strategies intended to bolster the central government, rebuild the Iraqi army and promote reconciliation with the country’s embittered Sunni minority.”] More vox, less populi - Leave aside the issue of whether Islamist militants are actually primary causes of much of the economic suffering of these nations. The real deal here is how long such a strategy might take given the nature of the economic disadvantage in the countries where Islamists are running riot. We’re talking decades or centuries. That’s a pretty stunning lack of urgency. But it seems to be in keeping with the president’s recently outlined position that Americans’ worries about Islamists are a media-driven distraction from other issues. The real things are global warming and sustainable agriculture, you see. Beheading people or shooting up a magazine office is just a symptom… As it becomes clearer that this really is the administration’s view the president and his party (and its presumptive nominee) will pay a heavy political price. BAIER TRACKS: COURT SHAKES UP AMNESTY FIGHT ON HILL… “As is so often the case, states lead the way. A lawsuit filed by 26 states against President Obama’s executive actions on immigration, took a big step forward. On Monday, a federal judge blocked the president’s actions granting legal status to millions of illegal immigrants. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen’s decision puts a freeze on the president’s plan, the first phase of which was supposed to begin Wednesday. While the administration will no doubt appeal the ruling, this decision could provide a legislative opening for the Homeland Security funding bill that is stalled in the Senate. The bill is being blocked by Democrats and would also be certainly vetoed by the President should it pass. So what is the way out of the standoff? The Republican argument may be to ask how they could fund anything that has been blocked by the courts and go full steam ahead on offense. Or, Republicans may be so encouraged about the chance for legal remedy that the looming showdown is drained of some of its urgency and move toward compromise. We’ll see what they choose.” – Bret Baier. Pump it up - The Hill: “The Obama administration is ratcheting up pressure on Republicans to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which faces a shutdown without action by Congress after Feb. 27. Congress appears stuck on the issue because the House is insisting that the funding bill also overturn President Obama's executive actions on immigration that have provided legal status and work permits to millions of immigrants…Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and other agency officials are also expected to press the case over the coming days, with one senior official there calling the push for full funding a ‘huge priority for this department.’ Johnson is trying to convince Republicans to bend. The department says Johnson has already visited with at least 20 lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss the funding situation, and placed more than a dozen phone calls to members.” OBAMACARE DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR SOME The Hill: “The Obama administration is giving some customers an extra week to buy health insurance if they have faced long wait times or other issues when trying to submit applications over the final sign-up weekend. Customers who experienced difficulties with ObamaCare signups will have until Sunday to buy coverage, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS] announced in a statement one day after the official enrollment period ended.” [Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream has the latest on ObamaCare.] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... While the celebrations of Mardi Gras in New Orleans and Carnival in Brazil get all the attention, today is significant for Christians all over the world as the last day before the start of Lent, a season of somber reflection before the faith’s highest holiday, Easter. But for many, the feasting and revelry done with abandon on Bourbon Street or in Rio is replaced by the humble pancake. The English-born tradition of a modest feast on Shrove Tuesday (derived from the word “shrive,” meaning to present oneself for penance or confession) has become synonymous with pancake suppers, which once sounded like a pretty tame as an indulgence by American standards. But given current dietary attitudes about sugar, gluten and fat, pancakes have returned to a position of decadence. So this brings us to a key question of doctrine: Thick or thin? While there are many devotees of flapjacks as thick as a pillow, making those is as simple as following the directions on a store-bought box. But if you want to go thin to win, here’s how: Mix two teaspoons of sugar very thoroughly into two eggs. Then stir in 3 cups of milk and a quarter teaspoon of salt. Then gently add just one-and-a-quarter cups of white flour until the batter is combined but not perfectly smooth. Let the batter stand for 15 minutes. Then heat up your best cast-iron skillet to medium-high and slide in a pat of butter. Pour a ladleful of batter into the foamy butter and cook for a couple of minutes until nicely browned. Flip it over and even up the other side for about a minute. Serve hot with butter and either jelly or powdered sugar and lemon. A few plates of those will keep you feeling penitent for at least 40 days! Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

With almost a year to go until the first votes are cast, the first ads are out. RealClearPolitics: “[The] campaign that will document each time a Republican candidate ‘ignores, insults, or offends’ American women. The ‘Insult & Injury’ initiative, first shared with RealClearPolitics, includes digital advertising and graphics that can be shared via social media…. EMILY’s List is targeting Republican presidential candidates’ opposition to Planned Parenthood and/or their efforts to defund it, as well as their opposition to raising the federal minimum wage, which the group argues disproportionately affects women.” Coming out party - Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, is slated to keynote EMILY’S List’s 30th anniversary gala March 3. The speech before the group, which is a pillar of the machine backing her probable bid for the White House, will be Clinton’s first appearance before a political organization this year. [GOP 2016 hopeful Ben Carson is scheduled to speak today at the Parkgate Pregnancy Clinic in Tupelo, Mississippi.] Time for choosing - WashEx’s Noemie Emery observes that Hillary has a tough choice to make: “Her problem has been getting voters as enthused about herself as she is, leaving her to: A) Play the woman card, which becomes less specific to her as many more women rise to high office; and B) go the Gore/Kerry/Romney route of trying to bend herself into the image of what polls suggest voters find appealing.” [In an extensive National Journal interview, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina criticizes Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton saying she “will play the gender card over and over again, which is unfortunate but predictable.”] Hush - Clintonites are getting annoyed at David Axelrod, former top strategist to President Obama, for a rash of comments about Hillary and her potential campaign. “‘It’s not helpful and it’s definitely not appreciated,’ [a Clinton ally told The Hill]. ‘The last thing we need is another round of headlines about lingering tension and this is doing exactly that. ‘When he speaks, it gets picked up and people listen,’ the ally added.” It could hurt his hopes?

Sanders, a self-described socialist…” NYT STAYS ON WALKER BEAT (DOWN) NYT: “Summed up in one phrase, ‘the boundaries of the university are the boundaries of the state, the mission statement, known as the Wisconsin Idea, has been cherished by educators and graduates for a century. So when Gov. Scott Walker, a second-term Republican, presented a budget this month proposing to delete some of its most soaring passages, as well as to sharply cut state aid to the system, he ignited a furious backlash that crossed party and regional lines…” Howdy, neighbor - Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is the featured guest speaker tonight at the Lincoln Reagan Day dinner in Clermont, Ohio. Christie puts corporate tax reform at the top of his presidential priorities - [New Jersey] Star-Ledger: “Gov. Chris Christie gave the first glimpse of what he'd do if Americans elected him to the White House while speaking to New Hampshire Republicans in the presidential battleground state tonight. ‘Within the first 100 days, if I were to run for president and be elected, we would change this tax system in this country so that people and companies aren't leaving the country anymore,’ Christie said during a brief question and answer session with audience members at the Concord and Merrimack County GOP Annual Lincoln Reagan Day Dinner. ‘Secondly, we would pass a national energy policy, and one that takes full advantage of all of the resources that we have available to us to help grow our economy and make the world a more peaceful and stable place,’ he said. ‘And the third thing is ... is to reestablish American leadership around the world.’” Glad I caught you - David Drucker is keeping track of which Republican lawmakers’ phones are ringing with calls from GOP Sixteeners in pursuit of a well-timed endorsement. On the list of sought after would-be backers: Sens. Tim Scott, R-S.C., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Cory Gardner, R-Colo. Sound off: Readers respond to this week’s 2016 Power Index… “I think that former Texas Governor Rick Perry remains one of the most underrated candidates in this Presidential cycle and this will play to his advantage in 2016. He’s got a veteran, he’s a patriot and more importantly, he’s got the experience and the record. He’s the one to watch this Presidential cycle.”--Ian Tan, Perth, Australia “My overwhelming choice though has to be Rick Perry who ran the second largest state for FOURTEEN years with balanced budgets, and left Billions of Dollars in a ‘Rainy Day Fund.’ During Obama's reign - Perry has helped Texas create one-third of ALL the jobs created in the U.S. That's the leadership we need.”--Doug Mathes, Houston, Texas. “In a state brimming with potential 2016 Presidential candidates, the voters are talking about [Scott Walker]. Not Rand Paul whose father hails from Texas as does Jeb Bush and of course our former outstanding Governor Rick Perry and our rock star Senator Ted Cruz. I mean shazam that's four fabulous candidates with Texas roots vying for the support and cash of the Big Boys here.”--Lori Haughton, Dallas, Texas. “John Kasich is the only one with the background to be the next president, with experience in congress and a governor of a large industrial state and wants an amendment to the constitution for a balanced budget. What more could you want more!”--Paul J. Schmitz, Foley, Ala. DEMS STRUGGLE TO LAND BLUE-CHIP RECRUITS WaPo: “The war hero. The star fundraiser. The popular governor. The toughened ex-senators. These are the blue-chip recruits many Democrats believe are essential to winning back control of the U.S. Senate in 2016 after a midterm drubbing cost them their majority. Less than four months after the painful losses, Democratic officials have begun charting a path back to Senate control that runs through more than half a dozen blue and purple states where the presidential campaign is expected to boost Democratic turnout. But even in that favorable terrain, the party faithful fear they could fall short if marquee challengers don’t step forward, since their talent pool is shallow and they are trying to unseat a well-prepared group of Republican senators.” SHHHHHH…. If you are longing for some peace and quiet, the American Association for the Advancement of Science has the spots for you. In their latest research, scientists have mapped the noise levels across the country on an average summer day. Using acoustic data fed into a computer algorithm researchers modeled gradations in audio levels including variables such as air and street traffic. The deepest blues predominantly occurred in the western portions of the country including Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and the Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado. These areas had levels under 20 decibels similar levels as prior to European colonization, significantly lower than most cities which averaged 50 to 60 decibels. The National Park Service will put the research to use identifying where human noise affects that are considerably more sensitive than human ears and impacts the animals’ abilities to hunt small insects and rodents. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “[T]he ideology of ISIS is clearly supremacist in the sense that anybody who is not Islamic in their understanding is to be either enslaved or eradicated in a genocidal movement. You kill Christians, you kill Jews you kill Yazidis but you may in certain circumstances, enslave them, that’s what we’re up against. And we have an administration that will not even admit there is a religious basis underline what’s going on.” —Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"INTRODUCING THE DEMOCRATIC 2016 POWER INDEX Fox News First has been ranking the Republican presidential contenders in our Power Index since January, but left the Democrats out of the mix. Why waste our time and yours on what was shaping up as a coronation? But the ongoing and far-from-finished scandal around Hillary Clinton’s use of a secret home email server as secretary of state casts things in a new light. We have much more on the scandal below, but the political takeaway is fairly straightforward: her cloak of inevitability is torn. Whether as an actual rival or as a life raft for their party’s presidential hopes should Clinton sink herself, Democrats increasingly want and need alternatives. And so, we give you our inaugural Democratic 2016 Power Index. 1) HILLARY CLINTON","296","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/09/introducing-democratic-2016-power-index-email-flap-puts-field-in-play.html"
"Today is a perfect encapsulation of Clinton’s campaign: big resources that bring big troubles. Clinton’s controversial family foundation will be acting as an extension of her campaign as it celebrates a speech Clinton gave 20 years ago in China on women’s rights with a dense report, public events and speeches by the candidate. Of course, since the foundation funds its work partly through gifts from countries that repress women as part of official policy, it does get a little icky. She will again be appearing in public but again failing to address the email scandal beyond an impossibly Clintonian tweet on the topic. So she gets a huge boost on visibility on her central campaign theme – that it’s time for a female president – but the means by which she paid for the platform create controversy of their own. [“What I would like, is for her to come forward and say just what the situation is because she is the preeminent political figure right now. I think from this point on the silence is going to hurt her.” – Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”] 2) JOE BIDEN The vice president is kind of a hot mess. He boldly makes untrue statements. He nape-nuzzles other men’s wives in public. He’s 72, but lacks any of the campaign discipline that decades in public life ought to have brought him. And yet, he’s the single biggest threat to Hillary Clinton and the automatic frontrunner if he decides to run. Aside from having Air Force Two and near-universal name recognition, he can make the best claim to Democrats for protecting and defending President Obama’s legacy. And plus, the press loves Biden, a negative since his every gaffe would be amplified but a positive since he would have the best platform to call Clinton out. The two were consistently at odds during their time in the administration, and he would surely make a potent prosecutor of her claims of foreign policy expertise. [The Atlantic: “There’s only one prominent Democratic contender who has traveled to all three early presidential primary states so far in 2015. It’s not Hillary Clinton. Nor is it Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or even Martin O’Malley.”] 3) ELIZABETH WARREN The freshman senator from Massachusetts says she’s not running for president, but she and thousands of her supporters say they just want Hillary Clinton to move to the left and be a “progressive warrior.” But that’s an empty threat without the means to punish Clinton if she doesn’t oblige. Warren, who has had an audience with the frontrunner, has shown a reticence to run beyond coyness in recent weeks. It is helpful to appear not overly ambitious, but too much resistance will cause supporters to look elsewhere. Warren boasts the advantage of a campaign in waiting, but time is running out for her to make a long-shot run. While she might do well in Iowa and New Hampshire, to avoid being road-kill under the Clinton machine in the rest of the primaries, Warren needs to get busy. If she can get rolling, though, her zeal and authenticity could make her the Democratic heartthrob in a flash. Unlike Biden, Warren would also be a history-making nominee. [Union label - Warren and Biden both address the International Association of Firefighters today in Washington.] 4) MARTIN O’MALLEY You can’t win the game if you don’t suit up and show up, and therein lies former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley’s cardinal advantage as a candidate. Unlike the others, he is actually on the trail and looking for donors and support. O’Malley is little known and isn’t broadly identified with any particular message, but as the very liberal former governor of a very liberal state, he has many policy points to please Democrats unhappy about the idea of veering from Obama’s domestic doctrine. Campaigning in New Hampshire this weekend, O’Malley demurred when questioned about Clinton’s sketchy email account. If O’Malley wants to be more than a running-mate in waiting, he will have to draw deeper distinctions with the frontrunner to show he’s serious. 5) JIM WEBB Candidates who are running against their parties don’t usually fare well, and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb looks to be no exception. Webb’s cry is that Democrats have to restore faith with the blue-collar white voters who once were the party’s backbone. And while he has a point to make about economic populism, and the deep embrace by Clinton of Wall Street, on the rest of the party’s issue set, he is a man out of time. Whether it is abortion or gun rights, Democrats made their collective choice against the party’s former base decades ago and won’t be coming back. Over the horizon - Suppose Hillary Clinton actually imploded and dropped out of the race. Who else might consider a run and could reasonably get a campaign together on the double. Some names to watch would include Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Gov. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y.

Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chairman of the House select committee investigating Benghazi, said that there is a period of missing Hillary Clinton emails from her time as secretary of State spanning several months. ‘There are gaps of months, and months and months,’ Gowdy said Sunday on CBS’s ‘Face the Nation.’ ‘If you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya – she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand – we have no emails from that day. In fact, we have no emails from that trip,’ Gowdy said…” On your own, Hill - ""If they screwed up on the emails, if we find out they skipped over her emails . . . then that will be a problem for them, it’ll be a scandal. But it’s not one that we’ll own."" – “a senior administration official” speaking to the WSJ. News to him - President Obama said he first learned of Clinton’s private e-mail use, “the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.” Obama defended Clinton in an interview with CBS stating, “The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails — the BlackBerry I carry around — all those records are available and archived, and I’m glad that Hillary’s instructed that those e-mails about official business need to be disclosed.” [Watch Fox: Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest on the Clinton e-mails] GOP 2016 POWER INDEX: JEB NEEDS CONSERVATIVE CRACKUP; KASICH RISING; CARSON FADES His first Iowa foray behind him, Jeb Bush has further solidified his position as the party’s establishment choice and the frontrunner for 2016. Jeb’s tougher push and the biggest threat to his overall nomination remains winning over the social conservative and libertarian wing of the party. A point that stretches beyond Iowa’s corn fields and is underlined in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, which found a divide among conservative GOP primary voters with “48% saying that could see themselves backing Mr. Bush and 45% saying they couldn’t.” But the biggest concern for Bush remains the durability (so far) of conservative support for Gov. Scott Walker. To win, Bush needs conservatives divided in their loyalties and for his potential top rivals to keep pulling each other down the ladder. [Des Moines Register: “Bush did six events plus several one-on-one meetings in two markets — Des Moines and Cedar Rapids — in 24 hours. He turned some heads on Friday and Saturday, describing himself as the most successful conservative governor in Florida history and saying his record of accomplishment ‘is what's necessary right now for our country to get back on track’”] Iowa’s March Madness - National Journal provides a nifty visualization of the GOP’s 2016 field that illustrates how Iowa voters who look favorably on one candidate view the rest of the field and what this means to candidates’ strategies: “[C]andidates start out fighting to emerge as the front-runner among a smaller subgroup—in some ways like college basketball teams fighting their way through one side of a tournament bracket before the finals.

John Kasich, calling him “the stuff of conservative dreams,” with a “tendency toward contrarianism:” “If the governor does eventually plunge into the race, one thing seems guaranteed: He would be, by a large margin, the Republican field's most provocative voice. No, he likely wouldn’t win, and he might well get the snot kicked out of him. But more than any other underdog flirting with 2016, John Kasich—defiant, outspoken, critical of conservatism from within—could upend the tenor of the primary season. [Calendar of a candidate - Kasich will be making stops in South Carolina and New Hampshire at the end of the month. Columbus [Ohio] Dispatch: “Kasich said he plans to attend the Detroit Economic Club — a forum that hosted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush a month ago — and the 21 Club in midtown Manhattan — which heard from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker a couple of weeks ago and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry in January.”] Cruz and Perry resist pandering on corporate welfare - [Fort Worth] Star-Telegram: “Texas Sen. [Ted Cruz’s] and former Gov. [Rick Perry’s]… messages at the Iowa Ag Summit were occasionally at odds with what some members of the audience wanted to hear… Cruz, a Republican, was the most blunt when [Iowa ethanol mogul Bruce Rastetter] asked him about the Renewable Fuel Standard, which sets a minimum amount of biofuels that must be blended into the gasoline supply. ‘The answer you’d like to me to give is I’m for the RFS,’ Cruz told Rastetter. ‘That’d be a pretty easy thing to do.’ But Cruz, who has called for phasing out the RFS program over five years, said Americans are fed up with ‘career politicians’ who pander to voters, especially in places like Iowa, with its outsized role in the presidential nominating process. Perry was equally unapologetic for his opposition to the RFS, saying he has no regrets about unsuccessfully seeking a federal waiver from the mandate as governor during a corn-sapping drought a few years ago in Texas.” Kentucky GOP gives OK to Rand’s caucus plan - AP: “Kentucky Sen.

Did you commute to work in the dark again? Not surprising since the government mandated that you wake up an hour earlier this morning (and every day until Nov. 1). The rationale for the creation and expansion of Daylight Savings Time was to save energy. The original idea was said to be Ben Franklin’s, but it became part of the mainstream American experience under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Wilson famously tried to keep the regime in place after the war, but Congress overruled him, even overriding his veto. The practice returned during World War II and was maintained by some local governments after the war. The time-shifters fought and won a long battle, eventually pushing through legislation in 1966 that required states to adopt uniform standards and gave the federal government authority over starting and stopping Daylight Savings Time. Today, every state except Arizona and Hawaii obeys. But does it work? Nope. WaPo passes along a study from time-zone-crazy Indiana that revealed that the shift wastes energy. Why? Because whatever electricity people are saving by having more sunlight in the evening is outstripped by the energy used for heating in the chillier, earlier mornings and cooling in the evening.

"BOEHNER BATTLE SETS UP ANOTHER BUST Conservatives who demand maximal resistance to President Obama’s agenda have placed a new marker: the election for House Speaker set to be held as the new Congress convenes on Tuesday. Two Republican rivals to Speaker John Boehner have declared themselves, with Reps. Louie Gohmert of Texas and Ted Yoho of Florida announcing their candidacies over the weekend. And as Alex Pappas reported, the leader of the effort to topple Boehner, Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., has spent weeks trying to build the 28-member coalition he needs to deny Boehner a 217-seat majority. The coverage has been intense, but is Boehner really in danger? Nope. Despite the announcement from at least six other GOP lawmakers that they won’t be voting for Boehner, this looks like a dead letter. [Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel sets the scene for the incoming Congress.] Moral minority - Boehner’s supporters have pledged that even if the speaker fell short on the first ballot, they will hold successive votes until he is reelected. Even so, multiple ballots would be a moral victory for Boehner’s foes. History is certainly against the insurgents. No election of a speaker has gone beyond the first ballot since 1923, when Frederick Gillette, R-Mass., won re-election on the ninth ballot. Forcing so rare a moment would get attention for the movement and foreshadow deeper difficulties for Boehner on looming votes on immigration, spending, taxes and other hot topics. But is even a moral victory in reach? Nah. Whipped - Just look at the pool of potential votes for the Jones plan, which are presumably lawmakers from the most conservative districts in the country. Here’s one metric: Of the 30 House districts in which Obama fared the worst in 2012, many are represented by members of Boehner’s leadership team, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise and committee chairmen including Jason Chaffetz and Hal Rogers. And the same is true as you page through other less-red districts. The votes just aren’t there. A similar effort to unseat Boehner came to a clattering end in 2013, and the speaker has more clout now. With Republicans in control of the Senate, Boehner’s friendship is more valuable to ambitious members who would like to see bills passed and headlines made. These are not unknown facts to Jones & Co., who fell out with Boehner long ago. So what’s the point? [To do - You could scour around the Internet for 30 stories today about what to expect in the opening weeks and months of the 114th Congress, which convenes tomorrow. Or, you could just let David Drucker do the work for you.] Elimination round - There’s no downside for Jones, Yoho and Gohmert, who have already been frozen out of leadership love. The move generates attention and headlines from both conservatives yearning for a more ideological speaker as well as liberals who just want to see the fight. But there may be some downside for the movement the men seek to lead. This gambit stands to be another disappointment for an insurgency that came up empty with convoluted procedural plays on blocking Obama’s temporary executive amnesty as well as a bid to defund his health law. Failures such as these shrink rather than grow insurgencies, especially when they are conducted in very public fashion to the jeers of the press corps and pundit class. If the conservative rebels in the House and Senate make one resolution for 2015 it ought to be this: Next time, win one. MCCONNELL KINDLES HOPE ON TAX DEAL The Hill: “This much is true: Both President Obama and top Republicans are saying the right things about tax reform right now. Whether that means that the two sides will make the progress in 2015 necessary to overhaul the tax code before Obama leaves office is another question entirely…Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has said that tax reform is on the short list of issues - also including trade and infrastructure improvements - with the best chance for bipartisan cooperation once Republicans take full control on Capitol Hill in January. And Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who will be the House's top tax writer next year, has said he's willing to compromise on one of the GOP's top priorities for reform - that the individual and corporate systems be revamped together…And while Ryan has said that he's willing to work with Obama on tax reform, he's also been far from confident those discussions will lead to anything.”","302","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/05/boehner-battle-sets-up-another-bust.html"
"WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... It is finally 2015, that far off exotic time that Marty McFly transported to in the 1989 classic, “Back the Future II”. The Atlantic compares the future McFly expected to find in 2015 to what really exists. Many of the technological predictions in the film came true in varying degrees however two key components missed were the development of Internet and the evolution of mobile phone technology. Cell phones didn’t exist in the film instead featuring banks of phone booths. The internet didn’t seem to exist in the film at least not in the individualized devices as expected today. JVC glasses are pretty close cousins to today’s Google Glass though not nearly as mobile as the Google device. Fax machines dominated business communication in the film, a technology that is just about obsolete today. To their credit, the filmmakers did accurately predict a smart watch, flat screen televisions and facial recognition technology. Society has yet to see the Hoverboards and flying cars featured in the film but have no fear there is still time as McFly didn’t go to the future until 4:29 pm on Wednesday October 21, 2015.

"SHOWTIME FOR WALKER IN WISCONSIN Today Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., on the short list of governors with 2016 GOP presidential potential, will be sworn in for his second term. With his sons emceeing the inaugural ceremony in Madison, Walker will reportedly push plans to grow the economy, develop the state’s workforce and reform education. And like other hopefuls, Walker knows that his words and record will be carefully scrutinized in a crowded field of potential 2016 nominees. “My ability to be even potentially a viable candidate is almost solely driven by how well we do in the state. If the state’s not doing well, I’m nothing — no possibility of being a candidate,” Governor Walker told WITI. Flashback: Walker-Christie a frosty pair - Amid his tough re-election battle last fall, Walker and potential 2016 rival Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., got into a tiff over whether the Republican Governors Association – with Christie at the helm – was supporting Walker with “sufficient enthusiasm and money.” [Timing may be everything - Watch Fox: Carl Cameron examines a busy 2015 calendar for potential 2016 candidates as they consider the best times to jump into the race.] No thaw in sight - One potential rub likely to keep up the Walker-Christie chill: the NFL playoffs. As a lifelong Wisconsinite, Walker often tweets his support of the Green Bay Packers. Christie’s football allegiances lay hundreds of miles south, in Dallas. Following the Dallas Cowboys win over the Detroit Lions Sunday, Christie was seen celebrating with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. The scene lit up social media, including ESPN analyst Skip Bayless who tweeted: “Chris Christie, you had better make plans to be in Green Bay, Wisconsin next weekend. You are needed.” This divisional playoff marks the first post season game at Lambeau Field between the two teams since the Ice Bowl of 1967. Christie to hit string of inaugurations in key 2016 states - Politico reports that Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., will attend a series of gubernatorial inaugurations in key 2016 states, beginning Tuesday with Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., followed by Gov. Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, Gov. John Kasich in Ohio, Gov. Bruce Rauner in Illinois, Gov. Nikki Haley in South Carolina, and Gov. Terry Branstad in Iowa. HUCKABEE SCRAMBLES GOP FIELD We can’t yet know whether Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor who on Saturday gave up his Fox News Channel show to pursue a presidential run, can upend the GOP field as he did with an upset victory in Iowa and seven other states in 2008. But he has already changed the race. The presidential aspirations of every other potential candidate counting on working-class voters and Evangelical Christians took a hit this weekend. That would certainly include Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Dr. Ben Carson and former Sen. Rick Santorum. Even libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., whose father saw strong support among Evangelicals in 2012, had to reconsider his strategy. Huckabee’s high name identification and durable popularity in Iowa and other states with large numbers of blue-collar Christian voters will make it harder for others to do as he did and use Iowa as a staging ground for a broader insurgency. Huckabee’s move raises interesting possibilities for mainstream candidates too. If Paul, Cruz, Santorum and Carson were all to proceed, the conservative vote in Iowa could be so splintered, that candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, might consider making a play in otherwise unwinnable Iowa. A tough fight for values voters would also create opportunities for Midwestern Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, John Kasich of Ohio and particularly Mike Pence of Indiana to try to run as fusion candidates. Dough, yo - WaPo: “If Mike Huckabee is going to make a serious run for the Republican presidential nomination, he will have to do something he was unable to do in 2008: raise millions of dollars and build a sprawling national campaign to complement the well of support he has among evangelicals and grass-roots activists in early primary states… A senior Huckabee aide … The aide said Huckabee’s team anticipates the need to raise about $50 million by the time of the Iowa caucuses in early 2016, with the money divided between the campaign’s budget and a super PAC, and said Huckabee has done much work to make that a reachable goal.” Perry prepping Iowa rollout - The Hill: “Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) is just weeks away from leaving office after more than a decade running Texas — and he is turning his eye beyond the Lone Star State as he looks to kick-start another presidential bid. Perry will leave the governor's mansion after 14 years on Jan. 20. Just a few days later, he’ll be in Iowa participating in the state’s first major candidate event of the 2016 campaign. … His Jan. 24 speech in Des Moines at the high-profile event organized by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and the conservative group Citizens United will be “very important for him,” according to one Perry ally.” Jindal, too - Des Moines Register: “Bobby Jindal’s [R-La.] Iowa caucus campaign test drive continues this week with events in front of a key demographic: conservative religious leaders. Jindal, the two-term Republican governor of Louisiana, is scheduled to meet politically active pastors in closed-door meetings in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids on Tuesday. Fate of Iowa Straw Poll to be decided Saturday - WashEx: “Republicans are examining the future of the Iowa Straw Poll, a key early measure of support for GOP presidential contenders. When members of the Iowa Republican Party central committee convene Saturday, they will decide whether the event, an institution in Republican presidential primaries since 1979, will continue — and what it will look like if it does.” [South Carolina Tea Party Coalition will feature 2016 Republican contenders, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Rick Santorum and Dr. Ben Carson at their convention later this month.] JEB RETURNS TO FAMILY’S POLITICAL SPAWNING GROUND Greenwich [Conn.] Times: “Jeb Bush’s [R-Fla.] flirtation with running for president in 2016 will take the former Florida governor to the familiar and lush stomping grounds of the Bush political clan: Greenwich. The Republican will raise money for his newly-created leadership PAC at a reception Wednesday in the hometown of his father, former President George H.W. Bush…The private reception is being organized by Craig and Debbie Walker Stapleton, he was U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic and then France under former President George W. Bush and she is a Bush cousin. The host committee also includes Richard Breeden, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during the first Bush presidency, and David McCormick, a former Treasury undersecretary during the second Bush presidency who is president of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund…Greenwich was the home of the late Bush family patriarch Prescott Bush Sr., who served in the U.S. Senate and was the grandfather of Jeb Bush.” Double run helps Rand fund campaign infrastructure - National Journal: “Sen. Rand Paul [R-Ky.] could have a financial edge over many of his prospective presidential rivals in 2016 due to a quirk in timing and election law that lets him to tap his biggest donors for campaign cash twice. Paul has said he plans to seek Senate reelection and, if he runs, the Republican presidential nomination simultaneously. And because he would be campaigning for two federal offices, he would be eligible to have two open federal campaign committees at the same time. Thus, his largest donors could give $2,600 to his presidential primary campaign and another $2,600 to his Senate account for the primary. While federal rules do limit how he could spend the money, veteran election lawyers say diligent accounting could allow for legal cost-sharing between the two committees, saving Paul's presidential bid precious dollars and letting him collect bigger checks from his biggest contributors.” TOP IOWA DEMS NOT FEELING THE LOVE FOR HILLARY WSJ: “Iowa Democratic leaders say they are troubled by the prospect that Hillary Clinton could win the state’s 2016 presidential caucuses without a serious challenge, a view primarily rooted in a desire for a more liberal candidate or at least a robust debate about the party’s policies and direction. Interviews with more than half of Democratic chiefs in Iowa’s 99 counties show a state party leadership so far reluctant to coalesce behind Mrs. Clinton. County Democratic officials also voiced qualms about Mrs. Clinton’s ability to win a general election and her fundraising ties to Wall Street firms and corporations, which remain a target of liberal ire. Many county officials said they would like to see senators including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont enter the race, though they were split over whether any could gain traction and overtake Mrs. Clinton…Beyond the personal, some worry Mrs. Clinton might not be best-positioned to defeat the eventual Republican nominee, concerned her candidacy wouldn’t be exciting enough to draw in the younger voters who backed Mr. Obama.” THAT BAR IS FULL OF CLOWNS The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that Paul Miller plans to open Bircus Brewing Co. later this year, an offshoot of his current business Circus Mojo that currently operates in the city’s Ludlow Theater. Soon the brewery will run amidst the trapeze, high wire and other acts… including clowns. But Miller is well aware of potential customer fears; his clowns do not wear makeup. “You can be funny or funny looking,” Miller said. “We choose to be funny.” Whew. “Our goal is really to … have people be wowed by the destination of having some circus acts going on and pretty girls hanging from the ceiling,” said Miller, who founded Circus Mojo after his own circus and acting career.

"BIG TO-DO LIST FOR SIXTEENERS IN N.H. The New Hampshire primary looks wide open, which is why every top-tier candidate in the GOP field is beating a path to the Granite State today and tomorrow to audition for party activists there. The First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit kicked off today and continues into Saturday. But while many candidates have good chances to win, they have very different tasks this weekend and in New Hampshire in general. Affirmed: Walker needs to remind voters why they like him - Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is so far the man to beat in New Hampshire, but that also makes him the top target. His campaign swing through the state last month impressed voters. If Walker were to hold on to win both Iowa and New Hampshire, as polls currently suggest, he’d be hard for the GOP establishment to derail. The question now is whether early support will dissipate in an expanding field. Walker is also taking the smart step of wooing the top GOP political figure in the state, Sen. Kelley Ayotte. [AP: “Scott Walker’s expected campaign for the White House got a boost Thursday as his former campaign managers formed a political group able to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money. Two former campaign managers for the Republican governor of Wisconsin said Thursday they have formed a super PAC to support Walker. It’s called Unintimidated PAC…] Unpacking baggage: Jeb has to break with history - His family has an unhappy electoral history in New Hampshire. Can Jeb Bush start a new trend? Bush is off to a pretty good start as he shows himself to be accessible and relatively unguarded with voters. To accept a national front runner, especially the scion of a patrician Connecticut clan, New Hampshire voters will expect to see lots of Bush and he will have to keep taking all the tough questions. Bush picked a wise moment to ditch his low-carb diet. [WaPo: “Presumed Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush urged Republicans to move ahead with confirming Loretta Lynch to be the next attorney general, but stopped short of actually endorsing her nomination.] Other end of U.S. 1: Rubio needs to break through - WaPo: “For [Sen. Marco Rubio], the challenge on this trip is much like his broader national challenge: Find a way to get noticed and build a following as an underdog in a crowded field…. Rubio has already hired a staffer to help him break though in the first-in-the-nation primary state: Jim Merrill, a veteran campaign strategist who worked for Mitt Romney….Rubio was most recently in New Hampshire in February as he traveled the country to promote his new book. His busy Friday schedule — he is also doing an interview with CBS's ""Face The Nation"" and sitting down with the New Hampshire Union Leader newspaper — underscores his belief that he can compete for the state. [Wayne Berman, adviser at the investment firm Blackstone Group, will hold a fundraiser for Rubio at Berman’s Washington, D.C. home. Berman happens to be neighbors with Hillary Clinton.]","330","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/17/big-to-do-list-for-sixteeners-in-nh.html"
"Hunting trip: Cruz looks to poach libertarians from Paul - Fox News: “The battle for the 2016 Republican nomination is on in New Hampshire, where presidentialcontenders Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have targeted the libertarian vote in hopes of winning the country’s first primary. Marco Rubio, the third GOP candidate to announce thus far, has yet to visit the state as an official presidential contender. In New Hampshire, libertarian voters represent 10 to 15 percent of the vote in a Republican primary – a percentage that could make or break a candidate’s shot at the nomination.” [Cruz revealed to The Federalist his favorite Simpson’s episodes: “Round Springfield” and, aptly, “Treehouse of Horror VII”, in which aliens Kang and Kodos run for president.] Got to be in it to win it: Fiorina needs to show her path - New Hampshire Republicans will buck party elders to back insurgent candidates, but they do not like to waste their votes. Carly Fiorina is getting a lot of attention as Republicans consider her potential as a foe for Hillary Clinton. As Fiorina put it, she could “put a hitch in [Clinton’s] swing” on the debate stage. But savvy New Hampshire voters will want to hear how she aims to win the Republican nomination and get to that stage. Fiorina is giving herself a good opportunity with a long interview with WMUR and some old-fashioned retail politicking. Broader base: Huckabee’s economic imperative - Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee isn’t exactly on his home turf in New Hampshire. A son of the Ozarks and a favorite of Iowa, he’s not much of a favorite of Yankees. Huckabee, though, has been rolling out his campaign with an emphasis on an aggressive approach to Islamist militants and a middle-class prosperity emphasis on domestic issues. Social issues may actually help a bit, too. Huckabee attends a breakfast with supporters in New Hampshire on Saturday then visits a gun shop and shooting range visit later in the day. [Arkansas Online: “Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who is weighing a 2016 bid for president, announced Wednesday that his nationally syndicated radio commentary will no longer be broadcast starting May 1.] Kicking the tires: Perry likens early state campaigning to used car sales - Union Leader: “What did [former Texas Gov. Rick Perry] learn from his short-lived campaign four years ago? ‘You must spend an inordinate amount of time in New Hampshire, in Iowa, and in South Carolina,” Perry said. ‘These are unique places. I refer to it as not unlike running for county sheriff. You had better go, stay, interact, really like being around people, like doing town hall meetings, getting probed - it’s kind of like buying a used car, you know, we’re looking under the hood here, we’re going to look in the trunk, I’m going to get a Carfax.’” All or nothing at all: Christie bets everything on New Hampshire - The candidate with the most at stake in New Hampshire is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has spent much of the week already campaigning in the state ahead of the summit. Without broad national support, Christie seems to be counting on New Hampshire to keep him in the game. In a bid to appeal to the state’s fiscally flinty nature, he’s making an entitlement overhaul his focus. It’s all about who you know: Graham tries to replicate McCain’s success - Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., isn’t a good fit for New Hampshire, except on foreign policy. He also has a friend that was a big favorite in the Granite State: 2000 primary winner Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Can Graham use his hawkish foreign policy and famous friend’s support to get in the running? [Graham will appear exclusively on “Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace” on the heels of his speech at the First-in-the-Nation Summit this weekend. Also on the show is Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt. The show airs at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. ET on the Fox News Channel.

Chris Stirewalt sits down with the National Journal’s Lauren Fox and Bob Cusak, editor in chief of The Hill to discuss how the thorny topic will the figure into the 2016 picture for the likes of Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton. WATCH HERE [Watch Fox: Campaign Carl Cameron reports on New Hampshire's GOP cattle call from Nashua] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… 45 years ago today, earth’s inhabitants collectively held their breath as Apollo 13 astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert hurtled through the upper atmosphere toward the Pacific Ocean. A drama that began four days earlier with an onboard explosion followed by the words “Houston we’ve had a problem,” gripped the world’s attention. As the astronauts and NASA ground teams overcame numerous hurtles to bring the crippled spacecraft home, their progress was followed by a hopeful and prayerful public. A final uncertainty – whether their heat shield would hold up during a fiery re-entry – kept the world watching in suspense. After a torturing communication blackout, mission control and crowds in places like New York’s Grand Central Station burst into applause at the sight of the spacecraft Odyssey, under blossoming parachutes, as it drifted to a gentle splashdown in the warm Pacific waters.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich is preparing to run for president. He’s getting ready to launch his campaign apparatus and before he heads to New Hampshire this weekend, he’s heading down to campaign in South Carolina. Can the former congressman who was forced to abandon a 2000 bid use his new status as swing-state governor to push his way into a crowded field? That will largely depend on whether Republicans are ready for a candidate who is preaching a social justice doctrine and wielding scripture like a Jesuit. Kasich points to tax cuts in his home state to bolster his conservative bona fides, but supports Common Core, a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants and expanding Medicaid. “I’ve cut taxes in Ohio,” he told CNN in February. “That’s kind of conservatism.” He defended his decision to expand Medicaid in Ohio with: “Mathew 25 says that it’s about how you treat the widowed, how you treat the poor” adding, “[T]he conservative movement is you don't just kick people to the shadows, or push them off the side of the road.” At a GOP governors meeting in November, Kasich called Common Core “common sense” and said he wouldn’t oppose eventual citizenship for illegal immigrants, because “We’ve got to think about what’s going to bring about healing.” And influential conservatives at a NY dinner last month weren’t happy when Kasich answered health policy wonk Avik Roy’s question about Medicaid being a top-down government program with: “Maybe you think we should put them in prison. I don't. I don't think that's a conservative position….I think rehabbing them, getting them on their feet, training them and getting them jobs, is a conservative position.” Kasich’s contrast to the bulk of the GOP field, makes for a singular challenge and makes him a standout target for critics.

The Huffington Post reports: ‘Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign will accept donations from lobbyists and political action committees, a difference in policy from the man she’s hoping to replace, President Barack Obama. The Clinton campaign confirmed that there would be no prohibition on such donations, after The Huffington Post was tipped off by two lobbyists supportive of the former secretary of state's run for the White House...’ As the liberal website correctly points out, Clinton’s position on this issue is the same as it was in 2008. ‘The approach is consistent with the one Clinton took in her last White House run in 2008. But it differs from what Obama did that same year and four years later.’” O’Malley slams Hillary as flip flopper - The Hill: “Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D), who is weighing a 2016 presidential bid, on Thursday delivered a shot at Hillary Clinton, suggesting she flip-flopped on gay marriage and immigration reform. O’Malley was asked about his potential rival's stances on those issues at an event hosted by The Guardian newspaper at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. ‘I’m glad Secretary Clinton’s come around to the right positions on these issues,’ O’Malley said, according to a report in the Guardian. ‘I believe that we are best as a party when we lead with our principles and not according to the polls…Leadership is about making the right decision, and the best decision before sometimes it becomes entirely popular,’ he added.” How much money?

The woman says she struck the guardrail when she glanced down to see what the bird was doing. The woman told police that the bird likes to drink coffee – and they also found bird seed in a cup holder next to the coffee and a few feathers nearby. Police say the woman broke her arm and had facial cuts because her air bag deployed. The bird was safely removed from the vehicle.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “This is [Hillary Clinton’s] Marie Antoinette cake tour.

"Buzz Cut: • Degraded: Obama’s ISIS response prompts new worries • Dems take risk in backing Obama amnesty • Jeb to test ‘Right to Rise’ in Detroit • Can Hillary really dodge debates? • B.Y.O.B. (Bring Your Own Blubber)","334","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/04/degraded-obamas-isis-response-prompts-new-worries.html"
"DEGRADED: OBAMA’S ISIS RESPONSE PROMPTS NEW WORRIES There’s chutzpah and then there’s being self-deluded. President Obama appeared to veer toward the latter when he vowed to “redouble vigilance” against ISIS in the wake of the Islamist militant’s latest and most depraved atrocity, burning alive a pilot from a key member of the U.S.-coalition fighting the group. With mounting evidence that the current U.S. strategy is not meeting the president’s promise that the group will be “degraded and ultimately defeated,” and anguished pleas from Jordan and others to move decisively against ISIS, it seems unlikely that the president will be able to stay the course in Iraq and Syria. As in other conflicts, including Libya and Afghanistan, the president will be reluctantly dragged deeper into the fight. He was pushed into this conflict by political pressure last year, and as pressure grows he will continue to escalate it. But as prior experience shows, reluctant hawks leave the fight as soon as pressure abates or shifts again, not when victory is won. [Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., tells WashEx’s Byron York that Jordan’s King Abdullah II quoted from Clint Eastwood’s western opus “Unforgiven” to describe his intention to strike back at ISIS for killing a captive Jordanian pilot: ‘He said there is going to be retribution like ISIS hasn’t seen,’ Hunter said, after a meeting with the king. Abdullah apparently meant it.] What was that name again? - And the fact that the president wouldn’t say the name of “radical Islam” and instead chose to be facile in denouncing “whatever ideology they are operating off of” as “bankrupt.” Hmmm. Which ideology is it again? Are they feminists? Dadaists? Jacobites? Maybe Jedis? If you cannot even bring yourself to say the name, how likely are you to maintain the fight even amid losses or public opposition? Remember that the “bankrupt” ideologies of the previous century, communism and fascism, led to the deaths of tens of millions and the oppression of hundreds of millions more. And they did not eventually fail because they were poor philosophical concepts, but rather because they were defeated. [The effectiveness of President Obama’s efforts to counter ISIS militants and Russia’s involvement in the Ukraine are expected to be questioned at confirmation hearings today for Ashton Carter, the president’s nominee to lead the Department of Defense.] Reset - It was particularly telling that Obama made his remarks on the very day that his administration acknowledged that the other war in which the West is engaged – the struggle with Putinist Russia over Ukraine – is going poorly. A senior official told the WSJ “It’s fair to say that costs haven’t risen high enough for the Russian leadership to rethink their course of action.” To be so dismissive of ISIS on the same day that your team tacitly acknowledges misunderstanding the motives and dangers of the other major, ongoing threat kind of says it all about the current condition of the Obama foreign policy. Like a point guard with a sore elbow heading into the tournament, it’s always “day-to-day.” “Number one is that [President Obama] does seem to have a problem defining what the ideology is. Much less doing something about the ideology…The other thing that I’m struck by with the president’s remarks is he says we’re going to double down. Well, if you double down on empty words, you still end up with nothing.” –Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, on “The Kelly File” Watch here. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... Author Harper Lee is set to release her second book Go Set a Watchman more than 50 years after her iconic book, To Kill a Mockingbird was published. As Rolling Stone reports the original transcript was rediscovered by Lee’s friend and lawyer, Tonja Carter last year. It features an adult Scout traveling from New York to Alabama to visit her father, Atticus, centering on the relationship between the two and the racial tensions of that time. Watchman, though originally written first served as the inspiration for Mockingbird. As Lee explains, “My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel from the point of view of the young Scout. I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told.” Lee was hesitant to consider publication of Watchman, saying, “I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years.” HarperCollins has set a release date for July 14th. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 46 percent//Disapprove – 49.6 percent Direction of Country: Right Direction – 34.6 percent//Wrong Track – 57 percent DEMS TAKE RISK IN BACKING OBAMA AMNESTY While Senate Democrats certainly risk being branded “obstructionists” by blocking policies favored by the Republican majority, that’s a charge with little electoral sting. As Republicans demonstrated in last year’s elections, while voters generally say they want “compromise” there is a higher price to be paid for bad votes. Blocking unpopular legislation, however, is a plus. Remember, voters don’t tell the whole story to pollsters. When survey respondents say that they believe both sides should work together to advance common goals, what they often really mean is that the other side should give up. “Obstructionist” is just another word for someone who disagrees with you. When Republicans were being branded obstructionists over the past six years, they were telling voters at home it was to block President Obama’s agenda, a strategy that delivered two midterm tsunamis for the party. So what are Democrats blocking now? [EPA offers cover for Obama Keystone veto - WashEx: “The Environmental Protection Agency challenged the State Department's environmental review of the Keystone XL pipeline, saying the analysis should ‘give additional weight’ to whether low oil prices could cause the project to drive the development of oil sands.”] That was easy - We’ve had two notable tests of Democratic resistance so far in the new GOP-controlled Senate. The first was on the Keystone pipeline, on which nine red- or swing-state Democrats jumped the aisle to pass. This was a low-cost vote, except for perhaps vulnerable Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who has to face global-warming absolutists in his party base. But if the president vetoes the measure, as expected, and then vouches for Bennet, the Sierra-Club-set should be easily mollified. So, all-in-all, good politics. The hard part - But on the more controversial issue of immigration, no Democrats were willing to buck the president on his executive action to grant a temporary amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. That looks like bad politics. Not only do Americans overwhelming disagree with the means by which Obama is implementing his plan, many residents of even deep blue states worry about the effect that illegal immigration has on job availability and pay. Blocking a plan that would fully fund the Department of Homeland Security but roll back Obama’s move would seem designed primarily to save the president from embarrassment. You can bet that Democrats will see that vote thrown back at them in campaign spots, especially Sen. Joe Manchin if he proceeds with a contemplated run for West Virginia governor next year. Club for Growth shopping for McCain challenger - The Hill: “The fiscally conservative Club for Growth is keeping a close eye on a possible primary challenge to Sen. John McCain [R-Ariz.], its president said Tuesday morning. ‘In Arizona, we will watch that carefully. We'll look at John's record and his score,’ Club for Growth President David McIntosh told The Hill during a Tuesday breakfast sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor. Reps. David Schweikert [R-Ariz.] and Matt Salmon [R-Ariz.] have both told The Hill they're considering a challenge to McCain. Both Tea Party-leaning congressmen have been supported in the past by the group, which has also been critical of McCain. ‘We'll see if either of the two members, you're right, they're people the Club's supported and thinks well of in Congress, does one of them decide to enter the race,’ McIntosh continued.” Hypothetical example stinks in reality - AP: “[N]ewly elected GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina… raised the issue when speaking Monday to the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. Restaurant chains such as Starbucks should be able to skip obligatory hand-washing by workers, he said, ‘as long as they post a sign’ and take other steps to alert the public. ‘Let them decide’ such issues, Tillis said.” GOP hopes in Florida Senate race boosted by possible Grayson entry - The Hill: “Rep. Alan Grayson [D-Fla.] is talking like a man who will run for Senate in 2016. In an interview with The Hill on Tuesday, Grayson said he’s thinking about running…‘We have some very substantial advantages,’ Grayson said in an interview with The Hill on Tuesday.” JEB TO TEST ‘RIGHT TO RISE’ IN DETROIT Detroit News: “Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is scheduled to speak in Detroit Wednesday about ‘restoring the right to rise in America,’ the first in a series of speeches that will test potential themes for his possible run for president in 2016. Bush, a Republican who runs a leadership political action committee, plans to outline a ‘positive conservative vision for the future’ on domestic issues during the Detroit Economic Club speech, said Kristi Campbell, a Bush spokeswoman. His talk will discuss ‘policies that will allow for middle-class families and those in poverty to move up the economic ladder,’ Campbell said. Republicans have criticized President Barack Obama for presiding over the slowest economic recovery since World War II. But the GOP also has been criticized for not adequately emphasizing in presidential campaigns policies that help the middle class. Bush also plans to hold a variety of private finance and political meetings in Metro Detroit, Campbell said.” [Campaign Carl Cameron is in Detroit to cover the big speech and he wants to know: “if any potential rivals will be able to beat Rand Paul to posting something critical or snarky online?”] Windy City Windfall? Jeb lines up big donors in Illinois - Chicago Sun Times: “On Feb. 18, Bush will headline a reception at the Chicago Club in the Loop, where tickets start at $1,000. After that, Bush will go to a dinner at the Lake Forest home of Melissa and Reeve Waud, he runs an investment firm, where the minimum is $25,000 to be raised or contributed…According to the invitation, the top tier ask is for $250,000 to raise or donate to be listed as co-chairs; the tab is $100,000 to give or raise to be a sponsor.” [Power Play - Mitt’s out, Jeb and Scott Walker are on the rise as the deck is shuffled.

WATCH HERE.] Walker rolls out conservative budget blueprint with school vouchers, tax cap and deep cuts - Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel: “To bridge a budget chasm, Gov. Scott Walker on Tuesday proposed holding the line on local property taxes and school spending, cutting public universities and expanding private K-12 voucher schools using money otherwise earmarked for public education. On a wintry Wisconsin night, Walker outlined the two-year, $68 billion proposal that will serve as a blueprint for state government as well as his own potential presidential bid…One year after touting an expected budget surplus, Walker proposed sweeping spending cuts such as ending state funding for highway beautification, and Wisconsin Public Radio and Television; phasing out a long-standing racial integration program for students; and leaving most prison watchtowers vacant at night…Walker's plan would also eliminate about 400 state jobs, though not all those would translate to layoffs because at least half the jobs are currently unfilled.” Would it be simpler at this point to ask who didn’t? - Daily Mail: “Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz smoked marijuana in his youth, his campaign [said]… ‘Teenagers are often known for their lack of judgment, and Sen. Cruz was no exception,’ a Cruz spokesperson said. Pence to take Congress to school in education hearing - Fort Wayne Journal Gazette: “Gov. Mike Pence will be in Washington today to talk about education, and President Barack Obama will visit Indianapolis on Friday to speak to educators and students.

The hearing is titled ‘Expanding Opportunity in America’s Schools and Workplaces.’” Boots and Books - Mike Huckabee’s book tour continues with a stop in Dallas, Texas today. CAN HILLARY REALLY DODGE DEBATES? When Chris Matthews (the Democratic staffer turned cable news host not the Seattle Seahawk) is taunting the head of the New Hampshire Democratic Party for being “so scared of Hillary Clinton” that he won’t even call for presidential debates ahead of the first-in-the-nation primary, we are approaching full absurdity of the Clinton coronation drive. Clinton has reportedly decided that she will wait to see if she must actually debate. This makes good sense for her, since dangling the chance to appear in a highly-publicized, nationally televised debate might entice a challenger to jump in. Rather, Clinton seems more likely to stay within the deep baffles of her campaign cocoon for now. Then, if no credible threats emerge, submit to a debate or two – purely symbolic stuff with adorable third-tier challengers like Sen. Bernie Sanders. Like an alderman turning over the first shovel of dirt at the new rec center, Clinton can have a “debate” in which she will actually praise her “opponents” for being so passionate. The question is whether Democrats can overcome their anxieties about Clinton’s weakness as a candidate and demand that their nominee at least suit up for the real thing before giving her the crown. All that’s missing is the candidate: ‘Run Warren Run’ hires N.H. director, opens office - [New Hampshire] Union Leader: “An experienced New Hampshire activist is the new state director of ‘Run Warren Run,’ which announced three other hires and the opening of its first campaign office in the state. Kurt Ehrenberg, a former political and legislative director for New Hampshire AFL-CIO, was just hired, Democracy for America said Wednesday. He previously worked for Sierra Club in the state and region. Jake Belanger, Diego Hernandez, and Jennica Simms were hired as regional field directors in the Granite State.” B.Y.O.B. (BRING YOUR OWN BLUBBER) Ah, hipsters. Boston Magazine reports that a resident of Cambridge, Mass. named Pierre is looking to cash in on the recent blizzard with an airbnb listing for the ultimate in minimalist lodgings. Pierre has built an igloo on Putnam Avenue in the hometown of Harvard and MIT, and it comes with a blue tarp and a yoga mat. Pierre brags that he perfected his igloo-building skills on a recent trip through Siberia, but acknowledges that the space is small. He says it will sleep one person “comfortably” or two people “curled up.” The price is $10 a night, but it does include use of the kitchen and bathroom in his house “if needed.” Your host reminds you, however, that you have to provide your own sleeping bag. Oh yeah, the forecast low for Cambridge on Thursday is 2 degrees below zero. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “So here we are bringing in Jordan for symbolic reasons yet a real pilot is shot down in real time and then executed in this horrible way causing a reaction in Jordan where the King is now on the spot…He’s got a lot of internal dissent which we have seen over the years.

"WAIT. WHAT? HILLARY CALLS FOR ‘RESTORING TRUST’ IN POLITICS Facing a scandal that threatens to capsize her quest to return to the White House, Hillary Clinton debuted her first major policy speech since the official launch of her current campaign. Clinton focused on a call to end “mass incarceration” in America and denounced racial injustice in the legal system, but her focus was on the question of “trust” saying “we must urgently rebuild the bonds of trust and respect among Americans. …Restoring trust in our politics, our press, our markets.” That’s a pretty tall order for a woman who is now widely distrusted by the American electorate and facing accusations that she and her husband raked in part of their massive fortune through payola from people doing business with her State Department. Remember the last time Clinton spoke in so public a setting in New York, she was explaining that she had destroyed 31,000 emails from her time in office. It’s quite a switch for Clinton to join President Obama and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., in anti-imprisonment crusade. Clinton has long heralded the tough-on-crime policies of her husband’s administration – laws credited with helping to end the bloody drug turf wars of the 1990s but blamed for a booming black prison population. Under the Clinton administration, federal prosecutors stepped up drug prosecutions and today, and today most federal inmates are behind bars for drug offenses. Facing pressure from her left and a skeptical black electorate, Clinton had no trouble making the reversal. Clinton swung hard on the subject and seemed to score – at least with reporters. One called her speech “truly remarkable” and another called it “compelling.” But how about the issue of moral authority? Clinton is no doubt right that Americans, and not just black Americans, have lost confidence in the basic institutions of the Republic. What is unclear is how a woman who has been at the core of the bipartisan establishment for decades and is embroiled in what is only the latest corruption scandal of her long career can credibly claim the mantle of change. The candidate who is famous for shady dealing and intense secrecy doesn’t sound like the one to make the pitch for reform. CLINTONS DIDN’T DISCLOSE DONATIONS TIED TO URANIUM DEAL FIGURE Bloomberg: “There are in fact 1,100 undisclosed donors to the Clinton Foundation, [Frank Giustra] says, most of them non-U.S. residents who donated to CGEP. ‘All of the money that was raised by CGEP flowed through to the Clinton Foundation—every penny—and went to the [charitable] initiatives we identified,’ he says. The reason this is a politically explosive revelation is because the Clinton Foundation promised to disclose its donors as a condition of Hillary Clinton becoming secretary of state. Shortly after Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, the Clinton Foundation signed a ‘memorandum of understanding’ with the Obama White House agreeing to reveal its contributors every year. The agreement stipulates that the “Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative” (as the charity was then known) is part of the Clinton Foundation and must follow ‘the same protocols.’ It hasn’t.” Bubba to take donors on nine-day Africa junket - WaPo: “A delegation of 20 major Clinton Foundation donors — many of whom have also supported Hillary Rodham Clinton’s political campaigns — will accompany former President Bill Clinton on a nine-day foundation trip to Africa that starts Wednesday. … The Africa trip would appear to provide a select group of big dollar contributors the unique opportunity to travel abroad with the former president, spending days in his company. The Africa trip had already come under fire because it will conclude with a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in Morocco, an event being partially funded by a company owned by the Moroccan government.” Obama’s Millennial clout doesn’t transfer to Hillary - In an early indication that Hillary Clinton will not be able to replicate the success President Obama had with millennial voters, a poll out today from Harvard’s Institute of Politics says that generic Democratic candidate leads a generic Republican candidate by 15 points among millennial voters. That sounds big until you compare it to history. President Obama carried voters ages 18 to 29 by 23 points in 2012, and an astonishing 34 points in 2008. The 2016 forecast looks much more like 2004 when then-Democratic nominee John Kerry beat then-President George W. Bush in the demographic by 9 points. O’MALLEY’S CRIME CRACKDOWN AS MAYOR DRAWS HEAT ON RIOT TOUR WaPo: “Former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley was heckled on a packed street corner in West Baltimore Tuesday, after he cut short a trip to Europe to return to the city he led as mayor for seven years. O’Malley (D), who is preparing to launch a White House bid, waded into a crowd near the burned-out shell of a CVS pharmacy that was destroyed and looted Monday night. He was confronted by two men on motorcycles who shouted expletives and blamed the recent violence in the city on O’Malley’s tough-on-crime policies from 1999 to 2007. … In his travels to early nominating states, O’Malley has…trumpeted progress made during his tenure, including a steep drop in violent crime, which is attributed in part to a zero-tolerance approach that led to a sharp increase in arrests.” [Bird on a wire - NYT describes O’Malley’s walking tour of an angry Baltimore and his defense of his tough-on-crime policies in a city that long reigned as the murder capital of America.] Pow! - Kevin Williamson writes: “Black urban communities face institutional failure across the board every day. There are people who should be made to answer for that: What has Martin O’Malley to say for himself? What can Ed Rendell say for himself other than that he secured a great deal of investment for the richest square mile in Philadelphia? What has Nancy Pelosi done about the radical racial divide in San Francisco?” Enter Sand-man - Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., will announce Thursday he’s challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, the National Journal reports: “[A] senior Sanders adviser confirmed…he’s made a decision on 2016—and that he’s going to go for it…[though] the latest polls show him in single digits…some more liberal Democrats hope that Sanders’ run could get Clinton talking about more [liberal] policies…”] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE The long, cold winter covered much of Lake Michigan with sheets of ice, but now that the ice has retreated the water is remarkably clear. (The cold held back seasonal algae blooms that make the water murky in warmer weather.) As a result, the many shipwrecks that dot the floor of the second largest of the Great Lakes are visible through the blue waters. NPR reports: “Photos from the flight out of the Coast Guard’s Traverse City, Mich., air station show a variety of ships resting on the lake bottom, including the James McBride, a 121-foot brig that sank in 1857. … ‘An estimated 6,000 vessels were lost on the Great Lakes with approximately 1,500 of these ships located in Michigan waters,’ according to the state Department of Environmental Quality, which calls the wrecks ‘irreplaceable records of our cultural history.’” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 45.0 percent//Disapprove – 49.4 percent Direction of Country: Right Direction – 29.1 percent//Wrong Track – 61.6 percent BIG SPEECH TODAY IN JEB’S EVANGELICAL OUTREACH Speaking at his first major forum after huddling with major donors in Miami, Jeb Bush heads to the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference in Houston, Texas today. With more than 1,000 Hispanic evangelical leaders expected, this is a big opportunity for Bush to keep making inroads with the socially conservative voters who could deliver the nomination for him, as they did for his older brother. In addition to talking about his personal history with Christianity, and family he’ll also need to address his stances on education and immigration. Bush has taken heavy criticism for his position on Common Core, which is widely detested by conservative Christians. Bush’s position on immigration, however, will be his calling card with the group today. [Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee also addresses the crowd at NHCLC today providing Bush the opportunity to align with the evangelical favorite.] Prominent evangelical minister likes Jeb - Although much disappointed with Republican leadership so far, Samuel Rodriguez says that he remains ‘hopeful’ about Bush’s candidacy. Read the full interview with Bloomberg here. Contra Cruz - WaPo looks at the way Bush and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, an evangelical Hispanic himself, are making their appeals to Hispanic voters. Cruz answers questions from the head of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce at a Washington event today. Backs Puerto Rico statehood - Tampa Bay Times: “On Tuesday in Puerto Rico, Bush spoke in English and Spanish and talked about immigration. As the Washington Post reported, Bush ‘reiterated his support for Puerto Rican statehood and said that the next president should help make Puerto Rico a state if residents vote to do so.’” Jeb weak on establishment endorsements - FiveThirtyEight: “So far, Bush has won very few endorsements. No current Republican senators or governors have endorsed him, and only five members of the House of Representatives have done so, all from his home state of Florida. Fortunately for Bush, none of his rivals are doing much better.” How James Baker cost Jeb a donor whale - National Review: “The bad blood between Bush and [Sheldon Adelson] is relatively recent, and it deepened with the news that former secretary of state James Baker, a member of Bush’s foreign-policy advisory team, was set to address J Street, a left-wing pro-Israel organization…Adelson sent word to Bush’s camp in Miami: Bush, he said, should tell Baker to cancel the speech. When Bush refused, a source describes Adelson as ‘rips***’; another says Adelson sent word that the move cost the Florida governor ‘a lot of money.’” RUBIO ISRAEL AMENDMENT COULD KILL IRAN DEAL Time: “Sen.Marco Rubio has proposed a change to the Iran nuclear review bill that could unravel a carefully crafted compromise and kill the Obama Administration’s negotiations. At issue is a one-page amendment from the Florida Republican and 2016 presidential candidate that would certify as part of the deal that Iran’s leaders have publicly accepted Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state, a proposal earlier pushed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Earlier this month, President Obama rejected that idea...Many Republicans support the idea, however, while some influential Democrats, such as New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, have declined to comment on any amendments.” NO PRESS FOR WALKER’S ISRAEL TOUR BuzzFeed:“Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker isn’t inviting reporters to come along with him on his first political trip to Israel next month, a spokesperson said. ‘Gov. Walker’s trip to Israel will be a listening tour,’ said AshLee Strong, a spokesperson for Walker’s PAC, Our American Revival, last week. ‘It’ll happen mid-May and we won’t be having any press join.’” Governors have a rougher run - Noted smart person Josh Kraushaar explains why the conventional wisdom about governors being better positioned for presidential runs than senators is probably bunkum (especially in the era of social media and the nationalization of local controversies). CHANGING FORTUNES FOR RAND IN NEVADA David Drucker surveys the changing landscape in libertarian-leaning Nevada: “Some Paul supporters worry that a move by Nevada Republican leaders to replace the 2016 caucuses with a standard primary election could diminish the Kentucky senator’s prospects. Some Paul backers view this as the party’s way of diminishing Paul’s viability, an accusation GOP officials say is categorically false. A primary would attract a broader array of rank-and-file Republicans. Caucuses, where people meet publicly in small groups, tend to attract fewer, more committed voters.” SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER INDEX “The index showing Bush in the lead has a large flaw. He is so well known and attracts polling and money from a crowd that has already made up its mind, that we have to question whether any amount of money can get him more voters on a primary level.” – Richard Nelson “The two ‘gainers’ this week in the Fox Power Index were Marco Rubio (now #2) and Carly Fiorina (now #6). Both are proving standouts ‘on the stump’. For the GOP to win in 2016, the ticket will require very smart, articulate and aggressive candidates--Rubio and Fiorina are showing the way.” – Jim Hartman “It’s too early to be sure, but I'm thinking now that the dream ticket for the Republicans would be Rubio/Fiorina. They’re both strong on the issues, and they each bring tremendous additional strengths.” – Danny Bass SHE’S A LOWRIDER The Guardian: “A tortoise in Pembroke, west Wales, who faced a grim future after it was attacked by a rat during hibernation, has been given a new lease of life by its owners. They have aided their pet, named Mrs T, with wheels taken from a model aircraft to help with its mobility. The wheels are glued onto a frame that fits around Mrs T’s shell.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “…[T]here are two issues in the inner cities. One is single parenthood and the other is the worst schools on earth. Of the first, we have no idea how to solve that, of the second, we do. If you can’t improve the schools, give the kids a choice to go to better schools. The parents begged to have that opportunity but the teachers unions won’t allow it and thus the Democrats won’t. ” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"OBAMA FAULTS MEDIA HYPE FOR TERROR FEARS The Hill: “The news media ‘absolutely’ overstates the risks of terrorism because stories about things like climate change aren’t ‘sexy’ and don’t drive ratings, President Obama said in an interview published Monday. ‘What's the famous saying about local newscasts, right? If it bleeds, it leads, right?’ Obama told Vox. ‘You show crime stories and you show fires, because that's what folks watch, and it's all about ratings. And, you know, the problems of terrorism and dysfunction and chaos, along with plane crashes and a few other things, that's the equivalent when it comes to covering international affairs.’ Obama said there was not going to be ‘a lot of interest’ in stories showing positive progress on issues like infant mortality or improving productivity for farmers. ‘It's not a sexy story,’ Obama said. ‘And climate change is one that is happening at such a broad scale and at such a complex system, it's a hard story for the media to tell on a day-to-day basis.’”","376","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/09/obama-blames-media-hype-for-terror-fears.html"

"Kerry says U.S. ‘on the road’ to defeating ISIS - Fox News: “Secretary of State John Kerry and a top White House official claimed Sunday that the U.S. strategy to defeat the Islamic State is working, despite warnings from other corners of the Obama administration that the terror network is in fact spreading. Following the purported deaths last week of two ISIS hostages and concerns about the U.S. needing to do more, Kerry told NBC's ‘Meet the Press’ that the U.S.-led coalition was ‘on the road’ to defeating the Islamic extremist group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, in Iraq and Syria. He argued that coalition forces have recaptured 22 percent of the populated areas that ISIS once held in the region ‘without launching what we would call a major offensive.’ The claim came just days after Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, delivered a grim assessment of the group’s evolution in testimony to the House Armed Services Committee.”","378","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/09/obama-blames-media-hype-for-terror-fears.html"

"Go ahead and go: - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s plan for keeping the Senate runs through the Senate amendment process. David Drucker reports: “In after action reports, Republican strategists said that a major driver behind the demise of Sen. Harry Reid’s Democratic majority in 2014 midterms was his extraordinary ability to keep his caucus unified on Senate votes and President Obama’s agenda…. But his strategy for keeping his caucus from splitting had a side effect: Democrats had virtually no opportunities to collaborate with Republicans and establish their independence — either from the party or from Obama. This turned out to be fatal blow to the Democrats in a battle for the Senate that was fought largely on Republican turf. Ever the political tactician, Kentucky Republican McConnell is determined not to repeat Reid’s mistake in 2016, when the Senate battleground is likely to favor the Democrats.”","383","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/09/obama-blames-media-hype-for-terror-fears.html"

"HUNDREDS OF EXPERTS LABOR ON HILLARY ECONOMIC PLAN NYT: “With advice from more than 200 policy experts, Hillary Rodham Clinton is trying to answer what has emerged as a central question of her early presidential campaign strategy: how to address the anger about income inequality without overly vilifying the wealthy. Mrs. Clinton has not had to wade into domestic policy since before she became secretary of state in 2009, and she has spent the past few months engaged in policy discussions with economists on the left and closer to the Democratic Party’s center who are grappling with the discontent set off by the gap between rich and poor… Although people close to Mrs. Clinton say she has not yet settled on a specific platform, she is expected to embrace several principles. They include standard Democratic initiatives like raising the minimum wage, investing in infrastructure, closing corporate tax loopholes and cutting taxes for the middle class. Other ideas are newer, such as providing incentives to corporations to increase profit-sharing with employees and changing labor laws to give workers more collective bargaining power.”","405","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/09/obama-blames-media-hype-for-terror-fears.html"

According to Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, “She was totally stuck, legs up in the air and all!” Authorities were so perplexed by the initial call that they called back to clarify the situation, Campbell said, “[The dispatcher] called her back and said, ‘Your husband can’t get out of the bathtub?’ And she says, ‘No it’s my horse.’” Rescuers took about 20 minutes to free Phantom from her precarious position. After the successful rescue, Campbell joked that he would “have to get one of those old folks tubs that has the door on it.” The entire escapade was caught on video and posted online by Sacramento Metropolitan Fire.","411","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/09/obama-blames-media-hype-for-terror-fears.html"

"Buzz Cut:","Published April 27, 2015","421","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/jeb-bush-cash.html"
"JEB SET TO DEBUT BIGGEST CASH HAUL EVER To put Jeb Bush’s first-quarter fundraising in perspective, if it is, as expected, well over $100 million, he may have managed a 70 percent increase over Mitt Romney’s previous quarterly record, and done it a year earlier in the cycle. This is obviously very good news for Bush. For any other candidate hoping to woo big-money donors, a sum so large will make life very difficult. Just as Marco Rubio is ascending to the stratosphere and Chris Christie is getting ready to re-launch, Bush is making it clear that he’s building a Clinton-sized mother ship to take all the big-buck GOPers into orbit. The big donors who believe big money is the key to winning elections aren’t likely to try to try to top this. And for people who give to get access, they follow fundraising leaders rather than chase them. But, on the other hand, Bush is making a big gamble. Bush is operating in a loophole within a loophole of campaign finance law. Because he is not officially a candidate and isn’t registered with federal elections officials, he can coordinate with the network of super PACs raising and, eventually, spending unlimited sums on his behalf. Other candidates, even the still-technically undeclared Scott Walker, are bound by elections rules related to their current positions. Bush is free to raise and direct the PAC because he is doing so as a private citizen. And because Bush is pioneering a new role for his PAC, it will need all of this and money and much more. But as soon as Bush declares himself a candidate, he will have to sever ties to PAC world. Bush is raising all of this money to hand over to Mike Murphy and say “see you after Election Day.” Sums so vast provide a lot of cushion for mistakes in judgment. Plus, with this much cash behind him, Bush can start nudging other candidates out of the race. Ideological candidates relying on small-dollar donations won’t scare off easily, others, though, may decide they’d rather not endure having a $1 billion flamethrower in their faces. But Bush is debuting his nine-figure quarter at a moment when the country is very much talking about the dangers and improprieties of funny money and politicians. Team Jeb argues that the only way to beat Clinton cash is with more cash. Perhaps, but the narrative of two rival political families exploiting loopholes to fight a nuclear war of campaign spending won’t exactly stir the hearts of the Republican (or Democratic) base. 1) Jeb Bush; 2) Marco Rubio [+1]; 3) Scott Walker [-1]; 4) Ted Cruz; 5) Rand Paul; 6) Carly Fiorina [+1]; 7) Mike Huckabee [-1]; 8) Chris Christie; 9) John Kasich; 10)Rick Perry On the Radar - Ben Carson, Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham [Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins “The Real Story” in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who’s up and who’s down in the 2016 Power Index.] Campaigning for Jeb, Dubya escalates anti-Obama rhetoric - Bloomberg: “In a closed-door meeting with Jewish donors Saturday night, former President George W. Bush delivered his harshest public criticisms to date against his successor on foreign policy, saying that President Barack Obama is being naïve about Iran and the pending nuclear deal and losing the war against the Islamic State... Bush then went into a detailed criticism of Obama’s policies in fighting the Islamic State and dealing with the chaos in Iraq. On Obama’s decision to withdraw all U.S. troops in Iraq at the end of 2011, he quoted Senator Lindsey Graham calling it a ‘strategic blunder.’” But will keep it behind closed doors - WaPo: “‘He said that one of the challenges his brother is going to have is that the country doesn’t like dynasties,’ recalled David Volosov, a RJC member from Silver Spring, Md...” Jewish GOPers up for grabs - David Drucker writing from Vegas, baby: “Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who addressed the Republican Jewish Coalition on Saturday during the group's annual spring meeting at The Venetian hotel and casino, wowed the gathering and has quickly - and unexpectedly - established himself as a player for Jewish Republican support, particularly among the grassroots…But the coalition is an Establishment-oriented group. The board and other senior leaders, who include mega donors like Sheldon Adelson and Paul Singer, consist of veteran GOP insiders, including former ambassadors appointed by President George H.W. Bush and President George W. Bush.” There’s niche, and then there’s niche - Sen. Rand Paul is in Brooklyn, New York today for a lunch with Jewish leaders National Society for Hebrew Day Schools. Rubio running away with the ‘pundit primary’ - The Hill: “On newspaper pages and online, the pundit primary is heating up in the Republican Party. The views of conservative columnists such as George Will, Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol, Stephen Hayes, and Jonah Goldberg will shape the way donors and party leaders view the 2016 candidates... The Florida senator is running away with this contest” Walker makes secret prosecutions a campaign issue - Milwaukee Sentinel Journal: “In a swing through the crucial presidential state of Iowa this weekend, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took the rare step of lashing out at prosecutors who had probed his campaign by questioning whether their tactics were constitutional. In an equally unusual turn, prosecutors fired back by calling Walker's comments inaccurate, offensive and defamatory - with Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm suggesting Walker could be criminally charged for lying. They said Walker should call for the release of sealed court records so the public could know more about the investigation and raids on people's homes, but Walker gave that notion little heed...His remarks on the investigation into his campaign were made as the Wisconsin Supreme Court mulls whether to let prosecutors revive their investigation.” [Walker gives the keynote address at the National Tank Trucker Carriers conference today in Boston, Massachusetts.] On a warm summer’s evening... - The Hill: “Gov. Scott Walker (R-Wis.) in an interview broadcast Sunday argued that President Obama’s default strategy for dealing with Iran was surrender. ‘I wouldn’t mind playing poker with this guy, because he tends to fold all the time,’ Walker told host John Catsimatidis on his New York radio show…” Carly courts big bucks in NYC - Carly Fiorina attends a private function at the home of Georgette Mosbacher, CEO of Borghese, a cosmetic line and Republican fundraiser, in New York City. Michigan Gov. Snyder moves toward a run - WSJ: “Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder made a surprise pivot toward an influential group of Jewish Republicans convening here this weekend, leaving some with the impression the two-term governor could jump into a crowded GOP presidential field. Mr. Snyder attended a private dinner Thursday night at the home of Sheldon Adelson, the owner of Las Vegas Sands Corp. LVS +0.24%, who is hosting the annual Republican Jewish Coalition meeting at his Venetian Resort Hotel. Mr. Snyder also made a presentation at that influential group’s board meeting Friday.” Kasich: All or nothing - The Hill: “Should Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) launch a 2016 presidential bid, it would be exclusively for the Oval Office. ‘This is not like, ‘Well let me try and if it doesn’t work I’ll try again or if it doesn’t work I’ll be vice president or something,’ Kasich told CNN’s Gloria Borger…” Texas tough - Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry introduces “Lone Survivor” author Marcus Luttrell at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library for a leadership forum today. BIG GAY MARRIAGE HURRICANE ABOUT TO HIT GOP WaPo: “Republican presidential hopefuls are struggling with how to position themselves on same-sex marriage, an issue that is bedeviling a party hoping to avoid social controversies as the 2016 election approaches. Rapidly changing public opinion has forced much of the field to recalibrate their pitches. Early front-runners have sought balance between the GOP base and the broader electorate - saying that they have no problem with gay people but oppose a national right to gay marriage and favor strong legal protections for business owners who do not want to serve same-sex ceremonies. It is a difficult task, with the perils on stark display last month in Indiana. Republican state lawmakers encountered criticism when they tried to strengthen religious-liberties laws in the face of legal same-sex marriage in that state. With support for same-sex marriage hovering around 60% percent nationally, opponents also risk being labeled bigots.” Cruz’s dinner host apologizes for hospitality - NYT: “Ian Reisner, one of the two gay hoteliers facing boycott calls for hosting an event for Senator Ted Cruz, [R-Texas] who is adamantly opposed to gay marriage, apologized to the gay community for showing ‘poor judgment.’ Mr. Reisner put the apology on Facebook, where a page calling for a boycott of his properties, the gay-friendly OUT NYC hotel and his Fire Island Pines holdings, had gotten more than 8,200 ‘likes’ by Sunday evening... ‘I was ignorant, naive and much too quick in accepting a request to co-host a dinner with Cruz at my home without taking the time to completely understand all of his positions on gay rights,’ Mr. Reisner said.” Rubio: no constitutional right to gay marriage - CBN News: “In a one-on-one interview with The Brody File in Des Moines Iowa this weekend, GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio says there is NO constitutional right to gay marriage. ‘It doesn’t exist. There is no federal constitutional right to same sex marriage. There isn’t such a right. You have to have a ridiculous reading of the U.S. constitution to reach the conclusion that people have a right to marry someone of the same sex.’” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… This weekend marked the 54th anniversary of the patent for Robert Noyce’s silicon transistor – the microchip that has changed the world in ways large and small. In honor of the occassion, Esquire republished Tom Wolfe’s 1983 piece on the rise of the tech town, and how Noyce, the preacher's son from Iowa, shaped the town’s image.

Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 44.8 percent//Disapprove – 49.7 percent Direction of Country: Right Direction – 29.9 percent//Wrong Track – 61.0 percent CLINTON FOUNDATION: OH, YOU MEAN THAT $31 MILLION Fox News: “The Clinton Foundation acknowledged Sunday that the nonprofit group ‘made mistakes’ in IRS filings and defended its disclosure of controversial contributions from a Canadian financier, following days of intense public scrutiny about foundation finances. ‘We made mistakes, as many organizations of our size do, but we are acting quickly to remedy them,’ foundation executive Maura Pally wrote on the foundation website. ‘And [we] have taken steps to ensure they don't happen in the future.’ The donations were called into question last week by Peter Schweizer, author of the soon-to-be-released book ‘Clinton Cash.’ Schweizer found Canadian financier Frank Giustra gave $31.1 million to the foundation after a 2005 uranium-mine deal he made in Kazakhstan, with former President Clinton at his side. The deal eventually led to one that gave Russia access to U.S. uranium deposits.” Top charity watchdog puts Clinton’s on ‘watch list’ - NY Post: “Charity Navigator put the foundation on its “watch list,” which warns potential donors about investing in problematic charities. The 23 charities on the list include the Rev. Al Sharpton’s troubled National Action Network, which is cited for failing to pay payroll taxes for several years. Other nonprofit experts are asking hard questions about the Clinton Foundation’s tax filings in the wake of recent reports that the Clintons traded influence for donations. ‘It seems like the Clinton Foundation operates as a slush fund for the Clintons,’ said Bill Allison, a senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group once run by leading progressive Democrat and Fordham Law professor Zephyr Teachout.” CW sours on Hillary - “Imagine if an assistant Secretary of State had done what Hillary Clinton – we know that she did. They'd be out of the State Department.” – Mark Halperin on ABC’s “This Week” Capillaries tighten - Team Hillary plans to raise at least $1 billion to help get her into the White House, so why is her team on a skimpy budget? Politico reports that staffers at her Brooklyn headquarters do not have phones, instead they are being asked by campaign manager Robby Mook to use voice-over Internet service. There are also no business cards, and “Mook has told everyone to stay with supporters while traveling, and avoid hotels when possible.” More buzzwords than a sawmill - Clinton has an op-ed in the Des Moines Register today: “When I came to Iowa, I wanted to do something a little different. No big speeches or rallies. Just talking directly with everyday Iowans. Because this campaign isn't going to be about me, it's going to be about Iowans and people across our country who are ready for a better future.” [Las Vegas Sun: “Hillary Clinton is coming to Nevada…Clinton will arrive in Nevada May 5 as part of a ""Ramp Up"" period, giving locals the chance to ask her questions and share ideas. It will be the third stop on her campaign trail, following trips to Iowa and New Hampshire earlier this month.”] O’Malley shines in S.C. - Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, former Gov. Lincoln Chaffee, D-R.I., Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., fired up liberal activists this weekend at the South Carolina Democratic convention. Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, sent Mudcat Saunders, a favorite of southeastern Democrats to dish out some populist red meat. Clinton did not attend and instead sent former fundraiser Gov.

[Watch Fox: Senior National Correspondent John Robertstalks to Former Virginia Senator, and possible Hillary rival, Jim Webb, from Iowa.] Ouch - BuzzFeed: “And when one reporter wondered if the former governor’s speech had a ‘different message than Hillary Clinton,’ O’Malley was ready with a tart reply. ‘Was she here?’ he asked. ‘No,’ the reporter said. ‘I guess it was different in every way then.’” 2016 Democratic Power Index - 1) Hillary Clinton; 2) Martin O’Malley; 3) Jim Webb]; 4) Joe Biden; 5) Lincoln Chaffee 6) Bernie Sanders 7) Elizabeth Warren [-1] What would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index we will share the best and brightest with the whole class. Send your thoughts to FOXNEWSFIRST@FOXNEWS.COM POWER PLAY: DEMS HARDEN RESOLVE AGAINST OBAMA TRADE DEAL President Obama is pushing for a big trade deal, but several Democrats are turning against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), saying, among other things, that the deal will do more harm to American workers, than good. Chris Stirewalt talks to Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who says he has seen the devastating effects of free trade in his district. WATCH HERE OBAMA RIFFS ON BLACK ANGER Byron York writes: “Depending on your perspective, President Obama's performance at the White House Correspondents Dinner Saturday night was either funny or filled with rage. Or perhaps it was funny about being filled with rage. Either way, there's no doubt that Obama, by incorporating comedian Keegan-Michael Key into his act, went public with the anger — specifically, the black anger — that has become part of the general conversation about Obama's time in office. Key and partner Jordan Peele do a Comedy Central routine in which Peele, playing Obama, delivers a calm, measured speech while Key, playing Obama's ‘anger translator,’ named Luther, acts out what Obama is really thinking, sputtering in rage against criticism and opposition that Obama believes is based in racism.” [The Hill: “Obama mocked critics of his recent unilateral moves, saying he maintains ‘something that rhymes with ‘bucket list’…‘Executive action on immigration? Bucket,’ Obama said to laughs, ‘New climate regulations? Bucket.’”] YES, EVEN THE TREFOILS Michigan Live: “Two sisters who were missing for nearly two weeks in a remote area of the Upper Peninsula survived on Girl Scout Cookies and cheese puffs. Lee Wright, 56, and Leslie Roy, 52, were weak but otherwise seemed to be in good condition when a state police helicopter rescued them Friday from a two-track road in northern Luce County, where their Ford Explorer became stuck in deep snow on April 11. The women stayed with the vehicle, which had died earlier this week. The out-of-state residents relied on eight boxes of Girl Scout Cookies and cheese puffs for food, as well as snow for water.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “But the emails and these stories; these are self-inflicted wounds has redefined [Hillary Clinton] as controversial – you know on the edge of corruption, not trustworthy. And that's an impression that even though the details aren't known, it's going to be very hard for her to overcome.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.” Watch here.

"HILLARY LOSES HER NERVE, SET TO SCRUM WITH REPORTERS All eyes will be on the United Nations this afternoon as Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton makes remarks there. No, it’s not the event itself. That’s strictly Turtle Bay puffery of the kind on which Clinton prefers to float: “Business Partners for Gender Equality.” NGOs, big banks and telecom companies will be celebrated for their commitment to women’s issues and then, presumably, shower their well-wishers with continued donations. Maybe they can even drop a little something in the collection plate for Clinton’s family foundation on the way out the door. The main event is what will happen after all of that backscratching, as Clinton is expected to answer questions from reporters about the, ahem, brewing scandal around her secret email server as secretary of state. Not only is it an admission that her original plan of bunkering out the scandal whilst surrogates bullied and bashed the press is kaput, but it is also a surge of the kind of panicked dysfunction that oft wracked her 2008 effort. [Throwback backfire - Howard Kurtz looks at the failed Clinton strategy of publicly attacking reporters who are following the email scandal.] Tattered - The Clinton campaign in theory was as perfect as a microprocessor in a Silicon Valley clean room. The idea was to ignore the news cycle and use Clinton’s hyperdominant position in the field to drive the discussion. Rather than the messy, reactive lurching that became the hallmark of her divided 2008 organization, this time would be different. Not so much. A gross miscalculation of her ability to repress the press, the anxious chatter of Democrats and plenty of pot shots winging in from her old foe, President Obama, and his team have forced Clinton in the span of just a few weeks to rip up her script. Recall that it was just 40 days ago that news broke that some in Clinton’s inner circle were weighing a July launch for her official campaign. Now, her team is just trying to survive for a few weeks to get the doors open and deal with this crisis and the ones that will flow after them. We’ve gone from royal languor to crisis management in five weeks. [Do you remember when Obama bashed Clinton for hiding documents from her husband’s administration? The Daily Caller does.] Go time - Today’s press conference will take her campaign all the way from that Silicon Valley clean room down to a boiler room floor. But doing some kind of impromptu-seeming scrum with reporters rather than an actual press conference is necessary in this moment. The campaign will no doubt spring the exact time and location as late as possible to keep news outlets from getting in position and vamping for an hour before it goes live. Rather than a high-expectation, presidential-style event, they will be getting something that looks ad hoc and unofficial. She can also say she’s really there to talk about what matters, the World Bank’s commitment to gender equality, but wanted to quickly clear the air for the scandal mongers who just won’t leave her alone. It will still be a bombshell, but its detonation may be muffled. In all this, two failures emerge in Clinton’s campaign, both rooted in hubris. The first is that she believed herself untouchable by the ordinary trials of politics and could run for president without running. That one is being remedied even now. The second, that she believed herself entitled to break the rules in the first place, seems unlikely to be remedied at all. Nope - Wash Times: “Rep. Trey Gowdy, [chairman] of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, has reportedly canceled an appearance at a Virginia Republican Party fundraiser after he learned the event was Benghazi-themed.” BIDEN BURNS DOWN THE HOUSE Politico: Vice President Joe Biden hit opponents of organized labor in remarks to a firefighters union on Monday, invoking a term closely associated with interwar European fascism in describing those who are ‘intent on breaking’ unions. Biden denounced those blocking the National Labor Relations Board’s attempts ‘to enforce the basic rules of the road,’ saying, ‘They’re not looking for striped shirts, guys. They’re looking for blackshirts, not referees.’ The blackshirts were paramilitary forces loyal to the Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini. Labor unions were among their targets. Speaking at a conference of the International Association of Fire Fighters in Washington, Biden said that firefighters and their unions used to have bipartisan support but that the Republican Party had changed.” [The International Association of Fire Fighters conference continues today in Washington with speeches from Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as well as former Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.) and a pre-recorded speech from former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.).] Run Liz Run - Iowa City Press Citizen reports that local supporters will meet in Iowa City to continue their organizing efforts to draft Sen.

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… The discovery of an ancient Celtic prince’s grave in a Lavau, France, dating to 500 B.C., is providing a treasure trove of artifacts and enlightenment about intersecting cultures. Live Science: “The ancient princely tomb, which was discovered in a large burial mound, was filled with stunning grave goods, including gorgeous pottery and a gold-tipped drinking vessel… [A] giant jug was decorated with images of the Greek god of wine and revelry, and was probably made by Greek or Etruscan artists. The stunning new finds ‘are evidence of the exchanges that happened between the Mediterranean and the Celts,’ Dominique Garcia, president of France's National institute of Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP), told journalists at a field visit, according to France 24. [See Photos of the Ancient Celtic Prince’s Tomb]…. Merchants from the East came to the region seeking slaves, metals and amber, according to an INRAP statement about the find. Many of the Mediterranean merchants bestowed impressive goods from Greek and Etruscan cultures as diplomatic gifts, in hopes of opening new trade channels. As a result, the Celts who ruled centrally located inland regions in the central river valleys amassed great wealth.”","455","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/10/hillary-loses-her-nerve-set-to-scrum-with-reporters.html"
"Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 44.4 percent//Disapprove – 51.1 percent Direction of Country: Right Direction – 32.2 percent//Wrong Track – 59.2 percent VOTERS’ DESIRE FOR CHANGE STRONGER THAN IN 2008 NBC News: “More Americans are clamoring for change in the upcoming 2016 presidential election than they were in the ‘Hope and Change’ year of 2008, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. That desire for change is a potential roadblock for two of the leading frontrunners - Democrat Hillary Clinton (the former first lady, presidential candidate and secretary of state) and Republican Jeb Bush (the former Florida governor whose brother and father served as president)…. In the poll, 59 percent of all voters prefer a candidate who will bring greater changes to current policies, even if he or she is less experienced and tested - up from 55 percent who said this in July 2008 during the general-election contest between Barack Obama and John McCain.” When Bush worlds collide - Lexington Herald-Leader: “Scott Jennings, the Louisville GOP strategist who was instrumental in U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's landslide win last year, is joining former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's likely presidential campaign. Jennings, a former adviser to former President George W. Bush, is joining Jeb Bush's political action committee, Right to Rise, as a senior adviser.” Walker burned on ethanol subsidies - Tim Carney tracks back Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s turnaround on federal subsidies for ethanol: “…Walker went to Iowa over the weekend and embraced the ethanol mandate – a corporate welfare program that subsidizes corn farmers and ethanol producers at the expense of drivers, eaters, restaurants, and the environment. … Why do I assume this position was tailored to Iowa's caucus goers? Because Walker vehemently opposed the ethanol mandate back in 2006, actually standing out from the rest of Wisconsin's gubernatorial field in that regard.” Cruz touts opposition to same-sex marriage - Des Moines Register: “U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz cast himself as a leading Republican opponent of same-sex marriage during an appearance before a crowd of evangelical Christians in Des Moines on Monday. Cruz, R-Texas, described the ongoing shift toward legal recognition for gay couples as an ‘unrelenting assault on traditional marriage,’ and castigated judges who have struck down prohibitions for ‘ignoring their oaths, ignoring the Constitution and legislating from the bench.’ The issue is one that Cruz said distinguishes him from other potential candidates in what looks to be a crowded 2016 presidential field.” Rand to light up another marijuana bill - Reuters: “Senator Rand Paul, a possible Republican presidential candidate, will introduce legislation with two Democrats that would prevent the federal government from prosecuting medical marijuana users in states where it is legal, aides said on Monday. While the bill's prospects in Congress are uncertain, it could help the libertarian-leaning Kentucky senator stand out in what is shaping up to be a crowded field ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Public opinion has shifted dramatically toward legal marijuana in recent years, and several of Paul's potential Republican rivals have framed it as a states' rights issue…Last month, he accused former Florida governor Jeb Bush, a potential rival, of ‘hypocrisy’ for opposing medical marijuana in Florida after admitting to pot use as a student.” Rubio, Rand set to do battle over war powers - USA Today: “A Senate hearing Wednesday on President Obama’s request for Congress to authorize military force against the Islamic State could spotlight an emerging foreign policy debate between two potential Republican presidential rivals. Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., both serve on the Foreign Relations Committee, which has set the hearing to question top administration officials about the president's request…Rubio has called on Congress to pass an authorization with no geographic limits on where the president can battle Islamic State fighters and no time limits on how long Obama and future presidents can use military force against them. Paul has advocated limits on the duration of fighting, the geography of the battle and the use of ground troops.” “I’m glad that our party has such a deep bench of individuals potentially prepared to lead our country. The Democrats can’t even come up with one good candidate. And we have six or seven. That’s a good thing. I would say that my experience has been quite different than President Obama’s. He was a backbencher in the state legislature in Illinois. I was in leadership all nine years that I served there, including two as speaker of the House.”--Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., “Your World with Neil Cavuto” Watch here. Pork shoulder, not beef brisket - Former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, is making another swing through South Carolina today with a BBQ dinner for the Greenville County Republican Party. Wash Times: “Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has hired Brian Phillips as senior adviser to his political action committee, the latest move to beef up his staff for a possible run at the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.”] SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER INDEX “Looks to me like the Democrats have a real problem here. Hillary may coast to the nomination, but she has exposed herself to a potentially major issue with her email debacle and worse yet, reminded the voters of all her (and Bill’s) past baggage.” --Fran Laughton “What on earth has Elizabeth Warren ever thought/said/DONE that qualifies her to be president?” –Serena Lewis “Should HRC collapse immediately put Andrew Cuomo at the top of the heap…Just look at his recent push of an anti-fracking bill for Western New York…an otherwise idiotic measure that only a presidential candidate trying to secure the far left's support would pen. It's Keystone Light and the Dem's [Kool-Aid].” --Ed Dziob “If President O and [John Kerry] can sell an agreement with Iran as a major accomplishment and Mrs. Clinton implodes, then the obvious choice would be Kerry who dreams about being President.” – Alan Jacobson “I strongly favor Scott Walker over Jeb Bush, mainly because he has a proven track record fighting the liberal left and the unions.” – John Hull “I think [Jeb] is an honest man and does love our country and wants to do right by it, but I want to listen to all of his speeches in front of different groups to hear what he tells them; is it what he believes or what he wants them to hear.” – Carol Chizzolin TURNABOUT: OBAMA STRUGGLES TO FIND HIGH GROUND ON SEPARATION OF POWERS President Obama and his supporters are livid at attempts by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and other congressional Republicans to interfere with Obama’s effort to cut a nuclear arms deal with Iran. But as Byron York, writes, Team Obama shouldn’t be surprised since Obama already set the rules of engagement: “There’s a war going on between the executive and legislative branches in which Obama has shown contempt for Congress’ constitutional powers, and now, in response, Congress is showing contempt for the president’s constitutional powers. It’s an unfortunate situation, but it’s what Obama has wrought.” “The decision to undercut our President and circumvent our constitutional system offends me as a matter of principle.” – Vice President Joe Biden in a statement on Republican Senators’ letter to Iran. “Tehran Tom asks Iranian Revolutionary Guards for help in battle against US diplomats” @jaredpolis – Tweet by Rep.Jared Polis, D-Colo, on the Cotton letter. Flashback - Instances of congressional forays into the executive’s coveted foreign policy turf are not unprecedented. There’s the account of Sen. Edward Kennedy’s, D-Mass., 1983 gambit to Russian President Yuri Andropov, offering to lend a hand in dealing with President Ronald Reagan. In 2007, then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi poked a finger in President George W. Bush’s eye, leading a hi-level congressional delegation to visit Syrian President Bashar Assad. Egypt president appeals for aid against ISIS - Fox News: “Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, in an exclusive interview with Fox News, appealed to the U.S. to play a greater role in helping his country fight terrorism -- as he urged the creation of an ‘Arab ready force’ to confront the Islamic State and similar groups. The Egyptian leader spoke with Fox News’ Bret Baier in an extensive interview conducted in Cairo. He addressed the need for what he called a religious ‘revolution,’ urging moderate Muslims around the world to ‘stand up’ against terrorists twisting their religion. But in the short term, he said more military might and funding will be needed to confront the extremist threat and questioned whether the U.S. was doing enough for Egypt.” German diplomat says Obama agreed to withhold weapons from Ukraine - AP: “President Barack Obama agreed last month not to send lethal defensive aid to Ukraine, a top German diplomat said Monday, as lawmakers from both parties continued to press the president to shore up Ukraine’s beleaguered military in its fight against Russian-backed separatists” MENENDEZ CASE: SEBELIUS ALSO QUESTIONED BY FEDS Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reveals to Politico that she spoke with then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) as well as federal investigators about the criminal probe into Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.). The meeting between the three parties took place in August 2012 on Capitol Hill regarding federal billing practices that impacted the business of Salomon Melgen, a friend and benefactor of Menendez. Sebelius downplayed the meeting saying, “It was pretty straightforward. We just reiterated what was not new information to the senator, but reinforced the fact that this was the procedure, the rules were clear that they were uniformly administered.” She added that Reid said very little in the conversation, “Sen. Reid did the convening, but he really wasn’t a participant.” He was previously interviewed by the Department of Justice and the FBI and now Sebelius reveals that she was questioned as well. She explained how the billing regulations were laid out and Menendez’s complaints saying, “Neither of those topics were very complicated.” IT’S NEVER TOO EARLY, JIMMY Traffic reporter Candace Dold of Baltimore’s Fox 45 learned that sometimes the news has to wait. Dold tossed to Traffic Jam Jimmy who was out on the road tracking conditions in Thursday’s winter weather. Rather than Jimmy, viewers heard a crackly voice over the intercom system at the McDonald’s drive-through and Jimmy asks, “Hey is it too early to get a fish sandwich?” Quickly realizing his dilemma he says, “Oh Candace, we live? Woops. Hey I’ve been in the car since 4:00. I’m starving.” He ended up ordering an Egg McMuffin and black coffee, continuing his report between placing the order and paying for it. “I didn’t think it was that funny. I just wanted a fish sandwich,” Jimmy said. He did in fact eventually get his fish sandwich. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “Look, I think the damage here, it could be horrible if there is actually stuff in the e-mails. But imagine that there isn’t any. The damage is already done precisely because it revives the memories of the Clintons in the ‘90s, especially with Saturday Night Live with a young audience telling them for the first time that this is who the Clintons are.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"OBAMA CONTROLS CLINTON’S FATE IN EMAIL SCANDAL Hillary Clinton said she wants “the public to see [her] email” in a tweet so Clintonian in its tortured language that it would have been perfect for a #throwbackthursday. The presumptive Democratic nominee most certainly does not want the public to see her “email,” which is why she built and maintained a secret server that risked massive security breaches but was designed to allow the eradication of any troublesome messages. That the server may have been overseen by a longtime aide with ties to the Clintons’ pardon scandal only makes the nostalgia more poignant. Pop in a Spin Doctors’ CD and let the 90s vibe flow, America. The former secretary of state is actually referring to emails she has already given the agency. Clinton’s campaign team would obviously have no qualms about releasing what has been already sterilized. But blaming the scandal on a bureaucratic snag beyond her control is an effort to inculpate the Obama administration. Team Obama, however, is fighting back. “That is why Doritos doesn’t get to decide which ingredients consumers need to know about, or why you don’t get to tell the cops which pocket to search.” – Jon Stewart on “The Daily Show.” Out on the ledge - AP reports today that the White House counsel’s office did not know Clinton was relying on private email servers and did so against the instructions she had been given. This comes after administration figures on Wednesday stepped gingerly away from the whole controversy, declaring their own electronic hygiene immaculate but leaving unanswered questions about Clinton’s potential misdeeds. It seems unlikely that Republican-led efforts to extract Clinton’s old emails will be fruitful. After all, if she is guilty of what her accusers allege, why would she suddenly get religion and cough up incriminating emails? What would be the point of breaking the rules and having a shady “homebrew” server if only to dump the data at the moment most damaging? But if the Obama administration were to decide to get serious, this could be the beginning of the end for Clinton’s second presidential campaign. Did someone say “special prosecutor?” “The bigger concern is was she transacting official government business that’s on a server that’s not secure? Because we know these servers are targets for foreign intelligence. We know the Chinese, the Russians, the North Koreans, the Cubans and others are constantly trying to hack into computers and especially that of government officials and if she was transacting sensitive State Department business on an insecure server, that alone is reason to be alarmed.” –Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on “The Kelly File” Dems anxious for alternative - WaPo: “Democratic activists in early presidential nominating states say that new controversies swirling around Hillary Rodham Clinton have made them more eager than ever for alternatives in 2016. The undercurrent of anxiety about Clinton’s vulnerabilities has grown in recent days with potentially damaging news of foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation and the former secretary of state’s use of private email accounts to conduct official business.” [A new Quinnipiac Poll, taken before the controversy broke over Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email account as secretary of state, showed the Democratic frontrunner maintaining a 42 point lead over her closest competitor. Without Clinton in the race, Democratic voters polled give Vice President Joe Biden the lead at 35 percent, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 25 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, 7 percent.] “There’s always another shoe to drop with Hillary… ‘I’ll tell you this: [Joe Biden] ain’t got no e-mail problems. He ain’t got no foundation problems. What you see with Joe is what you get. There’s nothing hidden there.’” -- Dick Harpootlian, a former Democratic Party chairman in South Carolina in an interview with WaPo. Heh - “Our Constitution is being shredded. We know about the secret wiretaps, we know about the secret military tribunals, the secret White House email accounts…It is a stunning record of secrecy and corruption, of cronyism run amok. It is everything our founders were afraid of, everything our Constitution was designed to prevent.” – Hillary Clinton in a 2007 jeremiad against the Bush administration. [Former Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., led a years-long effort against Karl Rove and others in the Bush administration over private emails. He sees things differently this time, though, telling Buzzfeed that while “he believed that she should turn all those records over there was a ‘distinction, though, between the presidency of the United States and other people in government.’”] Splatter paint - There has been a slew of reporting in the past three days on the electronic hygiene of Republican Sixteeners and the use of private email accounts. Rick Perry got some. Scott Walker too. While Jeb Bush got some sneers for having a private email server, his decision to preemptively dump his emails last month is looking wiser by the day as he seems to have broader latitude than any of his rivals to whack Clinton for her dubious digital conduct. Glass ceiling high, hard - Weekly Standard: “In late February, Hillary Clinton, a self-proclaimed champion of women’s rights and gender equity, came under fire for a Washington Free Beacon analysis that showed women on Mrs. Clinton’s staff during her tenure in the Senate were paid an average of 72 cents on the dollar compared to male staff. Now, an analysis of the latest IRS filing for the foundation that bears her name, the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, shows a similar compensation disparity between men and women employees. Although compensation figures are available for only a limited number of Foundation personnel, the 2013 Form 990 filed with the IRS shows that out of eleven highly compensated individuals listed, the top eight are all men.” LET’S PLAY HARDBALL Kathleen Matthews, chief global communications and public affairs officer for Marriot International and wife of MSNBC's Chris Matthews, is planning to run for the seat of Rep.

"THE JUDGE’S RULING: OBAMA GONE ROGUE Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano examines the constitutionality of separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches. “What’s going on is the exercise of authoritarian impulses by a desperate president terrified of powerlessness and irrelevance, the Constitution be damned. I say ‘damned’ because when the president writes laws, whether under the guise of administrative regulations or executive orders, he is effectively damning the Constitution by usurping the powers of Congress.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...

"Walker opposed to Homeland funding retreat - Pointing to Gov.

Democrats have questioned the president’s overreach in the past but didn’t hold him accountable when given the opportunity.” Rubio dips out on Iowa ethanol event - Des Moines Register: “U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio is canceling plans to attend this weekend's Iowa Ag Summit, he told the Des Moines Register on Wednesday. Rubio, a Florida Republican and likely candidate for president in 2016, had RSVP’d for the event, but is backing out now to attend a family wedding. ‘I feel terrible about it, we really wanted to be a part of it,’ Rubio said in an interview Wednesday morning. ‘We really thought logistically we were going to be able to get back but we just can’t do it.

Mr. Paul and Mr. Adelson are not especially close, personally or in their world views. Mr. Adelson, a staunch supporter of Israel, favors a robust, activist military policy. Mr. Paul, the junior senator from Kentucky and a likely candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, has advocated a more restrained approach overseas.

Carson restated his support for individual states to sanction or not sanction same-sex marriage. Carson also emphasizes that he is not a politician, and will err again, but unlike others will take full responsibility. IS THERE AN EMOJI FOR JAIL? Cincinnati Enquirer: “Andrew Dale Marcum, 21, of Lemon Township, achieved local internet celebrity Monday when he publicly defended himself against allegations from the Butler County Sheriff’s Office in a Monday Facebook post. However, tipsters learned of Marcum because of that defense, and they helped lead police to him less than 24 hours later. … The [Sherriff’s] post contained information and pictures of Marcum, who is associated with alleged burglary and safe cracking, abduction, assault, domestic violence, criminal endangering and some bench warrants….A Facebook account bearing the name ‘Andrew Marcum’ and featuring a profile picture consistent with Butler County mugshots was first to comment on the post: ‘I ain’t tripping half of them don’t even know me.’ The exchange took another turn hours later when the operators of the Butler County Sheriff's Office Facebook account responded: ‘Andrew Marcum - if you could stop by the Sheriff's Office, that’d be great.’” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “This is the same old Clinton that we know, and I think the reason that it hurts her is because we've seen the movie before throughout the 90s. The Clintons aren't just entitled, they also have a sense that they are to be protected in a way no one else is. Then they end up, when they're accused of either violating the law or the practice, making distinctions that are...I mean, the adjective Clintonian was invented for these fine distinctions, between legal and illegal, proper and improper.

"""We're really trying to give this message now that children need to spend more time outside,” says the head of orthoptics at the University of Technology, Sydney. One leading theory is that the light triggers the release of dopamine in the retina, which in turn provides a natural protection of sorts against the disorder, writes Nature's Elie Dolgin. Definitive research isn't there yet, but studies in the preliminary phase support the get-outside idea. In Taiwan, for instance, a school that sent kids outside for 80 minutes a day saw 8% of them diagnosed with myopia after a year, compared with 18% at a control school. Whether powerful indoor lights can have the same effect is unclear for now. In the meantime, researchers have begun experimenting with ideas such as classrooms with glass walls. What sounds like a simple remedy may not be so easy to pull off. In Taiwan again, 80% of university students had myopia in 2014, reports the Diplomat. It blames a culture in which overworked parents demand their kids succeed academically and often leave them in the care of nannies, ""who will always be tempted to keep the children indoors, silenced with the tablet computer.""

Sanders’ comments are a reminder of just how far the second-place Democratic presidential candidate stands from the American mainstream on some issues, and the looming reckoning Democrats face with their party’s leftward drift.","802","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/09/bernie-mania-why-press-isnt-really-taking-sanders-seriously.html"
"“Never mind whether Sanders can crack 40 percent in any primary against Hillary Clinton — he has already established himself as her de facto challenger and a standard-bearer of a party that was, until this year, too far to the right for his liking.” That’s because Sanders wants to break up the big banks, move to single-payer health care and provide free tuition at four-year colleges and universities.","803","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/09/bernie-mania-why-press-isnt-really-taking-sanders-seriously.html"

"Otherwise, news organizations would be pounding the senator over claiming in a freelance article in the early 1970s (as reported by the New York Times) that cancer could be caused by psychological factors such as unresolved hostility toward one’s mother, a tendency to bury aggression beneath a “façade of pleasantness” and having too few orgasms: “Sexual adjustment seemed to be very poor in those with cancer of the cervix.”","805","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/09/bernie-mania-why-press-isnt-really-taking-sanders-seriously.html"

"DEMS TOY WITH BERNIE AS HILLARY SEES SWING STATE DROP The bad news for Hillary Clinton today comes in two polls. One is from New Hampshire that shows Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders getting to within 10 points of Clinton and another that shows her trailing in must-win Ohio and knotted up against less-known potential GOP rivals in swing states Florida and Pennsylvania. The New Hampshire poll tells us that Democrats are thinking this election is in the bag and are indulging themselves with the idea of offering symbolic support for a self-described socialist who favors a policy list that would make swing and independent blanch. Trillions of spending and new taxes on everything from free college to global warming are not winners for debt-averse, economically insecure suburbanites. Republican voters, after two heartbreaking quadrennial elections, are kicking old habits with an eye on retaking the White House. Democrats, though, may be trying to get back on the Hopium in a misplaced belief that their victory is inevitable. If Democratic voters get Sanders into the discussion with Clinton and potentially even force her to adopt even more of his far-out positions, the party will be badly damaging its chances. Driven substantially by her falling trustworthiness, Clinton finds herself in trouble compared to three months ago in Quinnipiac University’s swing-state poll. Clinton does best on Florida (not good news for either of the favorite sons running there) but in all three, the results are fairly consistent. Take Ohio. In March, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was trailing Clinton by 9 points. This week, it’s down to 1 point. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker trailed in a head-to-head matchup by 11 points. Now it’s 4 points. Sens. Marco Rubio and Rand Paul improved by 6 points and 5 points, respectively. And the state’s Gov. John Kasich went from a 1-point deficit in January to a 7-point advantage today. Some if this is a result of Clinton’s policy changes and efforts to identify herself as a partisan figure and a very liberal one at that, but another part is that voters increasingly distrust her. But the net effect is to damage her standing with general-election voters. And herein we see another problem with “inevitable” candidates: They struggle to get their parties in line because they lack the powerful political motivator of fear. GOWDY: HILLARY’S LIBYA SOURCE WAS FUNNELING ‘INTEL’ FROM POTENTIAL PROFITEER Fox News: “Longtime Clinton insider Sidney Blumenthal was ‘merely a conduit’ and did not write the numerous memos about Libya he forwarded to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the chairman of the House panel investigating the deadly 2012 Benghazi attacks said Tuesday. Blumenthal was forwarding information from someone who may have had business interests in Libya, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly after Blumenthal spent nearly nine hours at the Capitol as Gowdy’s committee met in closed session…. ‘Not only was [Blumenthal] providing unvetted, uncorroborated, unsubstantiated intelligence to our top diplomat, he was just simply forwarding on intelligence that somebody by the name of Tyler Drumheller was sending him,’ Gowdy said.” “[Clinton] used the word ‘unsolicited’…When these emails are released, I want you to count the number of times she says ‘keep ‘em coming’ ‘this is great’ ‘useful information.’ I don’t know what her definition of unsolicited is, but it is very strikingly different from my own.”— Benghazi committee chairman, Trey Gowdy on “The Kelly File.” Watch the interview here. Gate crasher - The Hill: “Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) tried to crash former Hillary Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal’s deposition before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on Tuesday. Issa marched into the closed-door deposition and remained inside for about a minute before he was escorted out by the panel’s chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.). The pair briefly exchanged hushed words in a nearby hallway before Issa stormed off, throwing an empty soda can into a nearby trash bin.” [Incomplete accounting - WSJ provides the documents’ current state of play and why it matters.] Trade still looms for Dems - Fortune: “The House is giving itself until the end of July to reconsider denying President Obama the negotiating authority he needs to wrap up a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade pact…Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters Tuesday the decision came after several conversations with Obama about the way forward.” Dems fume over new Obama/GOP trade plan - WashEx reports that the idea that Obama might accept a GOP plan to pass a narrower trade bill is creating an uproar in Democratic ranks. “I think he would really, really piss off the majority of his party” if he went along with such a scenario, said Rep. David Scott, D-Ga., one of the most conservative members of the Congressional Black Caucus who sometimes votes with Republicans, but opposes fast track. Dems waffle on Defense - National Journal: “Senate Democrats were against defense authorization before they were for it. Or maybe it’s the other way around. Either way, their message is mixed: They fully support the troops, but they really don’t like how Republicans are supporting the troops with contingency war funds.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Christopher Lee’s iconic villains may have some inspiration from real life horror. Lee, who died at age 92 earlier this month, was witness to the last public execution in France done by guillotine. The executed that day was Eugène Weidmann, a man convicted of several murders and kidnappings in the area. Women waited after his execution to dip their handkerchiefs in his blood. Authorities realized that instead of creating a public deterrent for crime, public executions riled public passions. Lee witnessed Weidmann’s beheading 76 years ago today.

We were under attack. I think it was appropriate. It was also appropriate to change the policies once…we had enough history.” — Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on “Hannity” saying that as president he would not permit the use of interrogation techniques authorized by his brother, George, and deemed “torture” by critics. [National Journal: “…The amendment divided the four Senate Republicans intent on winning the White House in 2016. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida were against it, while Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas voted for it.”] Team Jeb escalates Florida fight with Rubio - Bloomberg: “[Jeb Bush] backers…heavily emphasized his executive experience… [and] Rubio’s lack of it… Even as they hail Rubio’s charisma and political talents, some Florida Republicans worry that the 44-year-old senator and former speaker of the Florida House—whose campaign declined to comment for this story—is unready for the task of taking on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and leading the country.” [Feeling good again - Wash Ex: “…Some Bushies … were momentarily nervous. Jeb Bush’s well-executed opening campaign rally and sharply written, succinctly orated speech calmed jitters and left the governor's backers in about as confident a position as they were when he shook up the race in December when he signaled his intention to seek the nomination.”] But does he have a Harley? - Scott Walker filed for president Tuesday, according to the Federal Elections Commission. No, not that one. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s camp says he is still un-declared. Instead a same-name candidate joined the nearly 100 Republicans who have who have made their intention known to the FEC. Carly takes ‘The View’- Legal Insurrection’s Amy Miller gives analysis of Carly Fiorina’s performance on all ladies talk show. Miller writes, “At around the 3:40 mark, the lovely ladies steered the conversation toward the problem of Fox and CNN using polling data to decide which candidates will be allowed to participate in the initial debates. It didn’t feel like a malicious question, but it did put her in a vulnerable position. This would have been a perfect opportunity for Fiorina to knock Fox, or white male presidential candidates, or the polling system in general, but she didn’t do it. Instead, she dropped a ‘started from the bottom now I’m here’ nugget, and looked confident when she said, ‘I’m kind of used to being underestimated, so I’m sort of assuming I might make it to those first [debates].’” [Fiorina’s campaign Carly for America came under fire earlier this year due to the F.E.C. rule that PAC names cannot contain the name of a candidate. This week, the PAC changed the name to Conservative, Authentic, Responsive Leadership for You and for America, or CARLY for America.] Back to bros? - Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and fellow Bluegrass stater Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have joined op-ed in the Lexington Herald-Leader on how the EPA’s Clean Water Act is just another example of government overreach. Perry takes Hillary to the movies - Former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, released an ad that has Hillary Clinton in the front row seat of her own flick. Throwback images of her Benghazi hearing testimony, new tidbits of foreign donations, and a shadow of Hillary in a van make for an intensely comical spin. #CruzCrew hits Twitter record - Wash Ex: “…The independent grassroots support group ‘Cruz Control’ blasted out nearly 75,000 tweets on the candidate’s behalf under the #CruzCrew hashtag…[an unnamed spokesperson said] by midnight on June 16, ‘74,532 tweets, yielding 1.1 billion impressions, had been dispatched by the army of #Cruz Crew volunteers.’” Goldilocks Graham - “If you think Marco is too young, and Bush is one too many, and you think Scott Walker is not quite ready for the job then over time you start looking at a guy like me.” — Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to Fox News Ayotte knocks Fox News, CNN debates - Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., is decrying the debate criteria used by Fox News and other networks in establishing participants for presidential debates. In a statement, she called for more influence for New Hampshire’s first in the nation primary saying, “the debate criteria should be based on candidates’ early state performance.” [Former Gov. George Pataki, R-N.Y., told the New Hampshire Union Leader he would participate in the paper’s forum on the same day as the Fox News Channel debates in Ohio. “I’ll put my trust in the voters,” Pataki told the newspaper “especially here in New Hampshire.” Pataki registered zero support in this week’s Monmouth University’s New Hampshire poll.] Carson hires neophyte finance chairman - Wash Ex’s David Drucker writes that Ben Carson is picking other non-politicos to run his presidential campaign in a new way. Read more from Carson’s interview here. Schake warns GOP on electoral quagmire - Hoover Institution’s Kori Schake writes that Republicans can’t win on their foreign policy platform alone. Despite President Obama’s dive in popularity for his foreign policy agenda Schake says the Republicans also don’t have a coherent strategy. As she writes, “Many candidates are allowing themselves to be drawn into debating troop levels for Iraq without explaining either the political objective that military force would achieve…” GOOD OLD REGULATION 27, SECTION 37 Germany is famed for its orderly towns and cities, but sometimes it gets a little, um, verrückt. The Local tells the tale of a traffic light in Germany that never changes to green. Why? Well, according to the local authorities, “Because on [that street] one is only allowed to turn right, in accordance with regulation 27, section 37 of the transport regulations, we can do without using the traffic signal’s green light.” Then why not just have a stop sign? “Stop signs do not correspond to traffic light systems and do not fulfill the same set of regulations.” The orderliness even continues to the finances: the annual budget includes amber and green replacement bulbs, just in case. AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “…It would be analytic overkill to go, to parse the actual things [Donald Trump] said. I think it was great showmanship, it was stream of consciousness. I think single most important statement was ‘I am very rich.’ That’s the basis for the campaign...I can assure you one thing: the mainstream media who wished the Republicans no good will lavish upon him enormous coverage.” — Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"Sanders has already gotten support from one of the country’s most influential labor leaders, Larry Cohen, the outgoing president of the roughly 700,000-member Communications Workers of American.","938","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/11/sanders-draws-early-support-for-white-house-bid-from-long-time-union-allies.html"

"Hillary Clinton is to lay out her plan today for free college at government schools. It’s noteworthy that Clinton claims her plan costs exactly half – $350 billion – of what Bernie Sanders’ proposal.","1028","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"
"The posture here is that Clinton is the candidate who has the same goals as Sanders – in this case, making college a right, like primary and secondary education – but can attain them in a more responsible way. Her message to the party is that free college isn’t free to taxpayers, aka voters, and support for outlandish measures will be a killer come next fall. Her call to her party base: Be reasonable, people.","1029","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"

"In a party that is in the process of disowning its father and in which even socialist Sanders gets silenced by liberal activists, the idea that Clinton can squelch the populist uprising with some triangulation (definitely scalene in nature) is as ridiculous as the thought that Jeb Bush could shoo Donald Trump out of the GOP race with a white paper on border security.","1031","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"

"If Sanders can pack nearly 30,000 souls into a Portland, Ore. arena it’s fair to say that he is doing even better than Trump into harnessing the outrage that animates voters, particularly older, white ones, who believe that America is truly at the abyss. And remember that both Trump and Sanders share the view that a conspiracy between business and politics is at the core of the problem.","1033","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"

"Donald Trump stayed swinging Sunday, but broadened his field of targets to include the only woman in the GOP field, Carly Fiorina. Trump posted on Twitter, “I just realized that if you listen to Carly Fiorina for more than ten minutes straight, you develop a massive headache. She has zero chance!” This after Fiorina continued to ding Trump for his disparaging comments about Fox News’ Megyn Kelly. Women aren’t the only ones to face the Trump wrath, however, former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., also joined the list with Trump attacking Bush for being… insensitive to women. Trump said on CBS News, “I watched Jeb Bush last week talking about women’s health issues like they don’t exist. I couldn’t believe what he said.” Trump added, “I want to help women.”","1051","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"

The campaign is making hires in the early states and organizing policy positions set to release this week.","1052","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"
"Jeb cheered, jeered at Red State - Wash Ex: “During the presidential debate on Thursday, conservatives gathered at the RedState watch party vehemently booed Bush. A few even shouted obscenities as he spoke about immigration and Common Core educational standards. But he received a standing ovation from a majority in the audience on Saturday and got loud applause for taking on [Donald Trump].”","1053","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"
"Walker talks Ferguson, race relations - Spartanburg Herald Journal: “Republican presidential candidate and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker received a warm reception during campaign stops in Spartanburg and Gaffney on Sunday...Walker also talked about the one-year anniversary of Michael Brown’s shooting death in Ferguson, Mo., at the hands of Officer Darren Wilson and the racial tension that followed in many communities over policing. Walker said if the nation focused on racial discord it would only lead to more racial discord.”","1054","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, stopped in Alabama delivering a thundering speech on his first steps in office including an investigation into Planned Parenthood. What he wouldn’t do? Knock friend Donald Trump. Cruz said he believes every candidate should be treated with, “civility and respect.”","1055","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"

"Fiorina funding fire - Fox News: “Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina said Sunday that her breakout performance during the last week’s debates has created a surge in support and that she can ascend to win the party nomination. “The truth is the race has just started,’ Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, told “Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace”…the exposure was key to her campaign because as a first-time presidential candidate she lacked name recognition, Fiorina said. ‘It was a big night for me…Only 40 percent of Republicans had heard my name. … There’s been an uptick in financial support, in support generally.’”","1058","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"
"Carson powers up from the pulpit - Ben Carson showed why he remains so high in the polls this Sunday with a stop at an Iowa church. He told the story of how God healed his anger as a young man, and how that healing is what the country needs. He said, “I don’t think there’s anybody who can deny that our land right now is in need of God’s healing hands.” The story, along with quotes from scripture, clearly moved the congregation, and show why Carson continues to rank high in the polls.","1059","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"

"For a Democratic front-runner, she's just not drawing huge crowds. By comparison, underdog Democratic candidate Sen.

"""I think you see a certain amount of exhaustion amongst Democrats and a certain amount of Clinton fatigue,"" said Jeanne Zaino, political science professor at Iona College, who says the drip-drip of email revelations have ""taken their toll"" and it is reflecting in the crowd sizes as well as poll numbers.","1072","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"On Thursday at Case Western Reserve University in the battleground state of Ohio, Clinton spoke to a crowd of an estimated 2,800 people in an outdoor “commit to vote” rally, the first for her campaign outside the key primary/caucus states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.","1073","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"Her biggest crowd, of 5,500 people, was for her New York City kick-off rally. She hasn't matched that number since, drawing an estimated 1,800 to a Virginia fundraiser in June. Clinton has, rather, held grassroots organizing and town hall events more conducive to smaller crowds. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll, says this is likely designed that way, ""because she is very good in small venues and not so much in big ones.""","1074","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"For example, she chose to unveil her college affordability plan to an audience of about 600 at Exeter High School in New Hampshire on Aug. 10. On Aug. 6, she jazzed up an estimated 300 supporters in a packed nightclub in Denver, and on Aug. 18, held a town meeting in a Las Vegas community center that drew an estimated 300.","1075","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"Yet Sanders, who runs to the left of Clinton, has drawn well over 100,000 people combined at his summer rallies as of mid-August. In a pair of appearances in Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles in August alone, he attracted an estimated 55,000 people.","1076","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"

"“I hardly see any liberal enthusiasm for [Clinton], and they are concerned she could even drag down the entire ticket,” charged Richard Viguerie, longtime conservative media strategist, who blames the energy lag on Clinton’s political “baggage” and her demeanor, which he claims has never been “warm and fuzzy.”","1078","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"Michael Cohen, a Boston Globe columnist, disagrees, calling the “enthusiasm gap” a creation of media boredom during the dog days of summer. “I don’t think it much matters what is happening in August,” he told FoxNews.com. “I think it’s hard for anyone to get excited about politics right now. All of a sudden people are saying she is in trouble and I just don’t see any evidence of that.”","1079","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"“She has the support,” Democratic strategist Doug Schoen told FoxNews.com, “but she needs to get a message and to communicate a campaign strategy to mobilize and excite the Democratic base.” Does she have the tools light a fire under this base? “That’s an open question,” Schoen said.","1080","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"But even squared against this time in 2007, Clinton's crowds don't hold a candle to those of Obama, who was drawing huge audiences of exuberant, mostly young, supporters.","1081","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"On Sept. 27, 2007, Obama set a record for that early stage of the Democratic primary, filling Washington Square Park in New York City with an estimated 24,000 people. He had been drawing five-digit crowds since February, according to The New York Times.","1082","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"

"The Clinton campaign sent out a string of memos Thursday touting their organizational efforts – and support – in key primary/caucus states. A memo on the state-of-play in New Hampshire said organizers are activating more than 3,400 residents to take part in the campaign.","1084","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"“With more than 11,400 followers and fans, Hillary for New Hampshire’s Facebook and Twitter pages are among some of the largest political accounts in the state,” the memo said.","1085","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"As for Iowa, a campaign memo said, “the campaign has 47 organizers on the ground with more on the way, 11 offices open from river to river where volunteers are being engaged, at least one identified supporter in each of Iowa’s 1,682 precincts.”","1086","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"The candidate also addressed the Democratic National Committee summer meeting on Friday, touting her own organization while mocking Trump, criticizing other Republican candidates on women's issues and questioning whether those candidates think ""black lives matter.""","1087","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"But despite her sharp comparisons of Republicans to extremists on women’s issues – a battle cry to the liberal flank – Sanders appears to be getting more visible adulation from college-age crowds. Not that all his rallies have been ‘full Bern.’ In a recent swing through South Carolina, Sanders faced the stiffer task of appealing to black voters who typically weigh in heavy for Clinton. According to Politico, he drew an estimated crowd of 2,800 in Greenville, and around 3,150 for his Aug. 22 rally in North Charleston. The College of Charleston, however, still covered his speech as though it were a major campus event.","1088","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"

What would appear to be a summer music festival was quite the opposite, this was the Bernie Sanders rally,” the school's paper said.","1089","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"Viguerie told FoxNews.com that Sanders and Trump are “change” candidates who are stealing the show because they are appealing to voters angry and frustrated with the status quo.","1090","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"

"Schoen doesn’t think the size of the crowds actually matters for Clinton’s overall success, and he has written that he believes she will still be the nominee. “But there are a lot of challenges she still has to face,” he acknowledged, and one of them is energy.","1092","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"

"When you get out of the Acela corridor, it becomes easier to see why there’s considerable anger and resentment out there. People see a Congress that hasn’t been able to get much of anything done for years and a White House that has all but given up on working with the Hill. They see a political culture that favors posturing over practicality. They see a media culture that thrives on confrontation over consensus.","1100","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/28/angry-america-why-medias-failure-goes-beyond-trump-and-sanders.html"

"“The discontent is real, whether economic, racial or cultural. It knows no particular ideological boundaries. It currently disrupts both the Republican and Democratic parties. It reflects grievances that long have been bubbling. It reflects, too, the impatience with many political leaders — what they say and how they say it.”","1102","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/28/angry-america-why-medias-failure-goes-beyond-trump-and-sanders.html"
"Think about it. Conservatives are angry about illegal immigration, liberals about income inequality, blacks about police misconduct. A new CNN poll captures some of this angst, with 40 percent of those surveyed saying their views are not well represented by the government in Washington. That figure jumps to 53 percent among Republican and GOP-leaning voters, compared to 27 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters. The disparity probably reflects the fact that Barack Obama is in the White House.","1103","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/28/angry-america-why-medias-failure-goes-beyond-trump-and-sanders.html"

"I don’t think it’s wise to lump Trump and Sanders together, but one thing they have in common is their most passionate supporters believe the system is broken and the game is rigged. They cheer their champions for taking on the powers that be, and while Trump is a classic outsider and Sanders a senator, Bernie isn’t even a registered Democrat.","1105","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/28/angry-america-why-medias-failure-goes-beyond-trump-and-sanders.html"
"Sanders rejected the comparison on “Meet the Press,” saying: “The chord we are touching all over this country is that people are profoundly disgusted with the economics that make the richest people richer and everybody else poorer.

"Trump would be one of those very rich people, as he himself will tell you, but that success is part of his appeal. His approach to the economic doldrums is to say he’d be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, and that America is getting screwed on trade by the likes of Mexico and China. Sanders, for his part, opposed Obama’s Pacific trade deal.","1107","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/28/angry-america-why-medias-failure-goes-beyond-trump-and-sanders.html"
"Trump and Clinton aren’t immune from the divisiveness in the country. In an NBC poll of registered Iowa voters, Hillary’s fav/unfav is 37/56 percent, or -19. Trump’s is 32/60, or -28. Sanders is actually +3, or 30/27, but that partially reflects the fact that many voters still don’t have an opinion of him.","1108","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/28/angry-america-why-medias-failure-goes-beyond-trump-and-sanders.html"
"The magnitude of the media’s failure here goes well beyond botched horse-race coverage. As initially happened with the rise of the Tea Party in 2009, most of the press has been blindsided by the anger in America. The challenge now is to step up the reporting to understand why so many folks in this country don’t trust their politicians or their pundits.","1109","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/28/angry-america-why-medias-failure-goes-beyond-trump-and-sanders.html"

"The protesters stormed the convention hall chanting, “Black lives matter!” As O’Malley and interviewer Jose Antonio Vargas looked on, one of the group’s leaders took the stage and addressed the audience as a largely female group of demonstrators railed against police-involved shootings, the treatment of immigrants and Arizona’s racial history.","1114","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/19/omalley-sanders-heckled-during-presidential-forum-at-netroots-convention.html"
"Before departing the stage, O’Malley told the convention: ""Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter,"" prompting some heckles and boos in the crowd.","1115","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/19/omalley-sanders-heckled-during-presidential-forum-at-netroots-convention.html"

"""I meant no insensitivity by that and I apologize if that's what I communicated,"" he told reporters at an immigration event. ""That was misstated.

"Sanders was met with heckling and protesters from the crowd as well as he tried to address the 3,000 Netroots activists. At one point, Sanders said: ""Black lives of course matter. I spent 50 years of my life fighting for civil rights and if you don't want me to be here, that's OK.""","1118","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/19/omalley-sanders-heckled-during-presidential-forum-at-netroots-convention.html"
"During an abbreviated 20-minute appearance, the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont spoke about the need to address wealth and income inequality, noting that blacks and Hispanics face high rates of unemployment. Sanders was scheduled to meet with representatives of the organization Black Lives Matter after the speech, but his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, attended the meeting instead, spokesman Michael Briggs said.","1119","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/19/omalley-sanders-heckled-during-presidential-forum-at-netroots-convention.html"

"The response at the forum to both candidates shows that all Democratic candidates have work to do to understand the black lives movement, according to MoveOn.org executive director Anna Galland said.","1123","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/19/omalley-sanders-heckled-during-presidential-forum-at-netroots-convention.html"
"""Saying that 'all lives matter' or 'white lives matter' immediately after saying 'black lives matter' minimizes and draws attention away from the specific, distinct ways in which black lives have been devalued by our society,"" Galland said.","1124","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/19/omalley-sanders-heckled-during-presidential-forum-at-netroots-convention.html"
"She added that while issues of economic and racial justice intersect, ""portrayals of racial injustice as merely an offshoot of economic injustice or the implication that solutions to economic inequality will take care of racism represent a fundamental misunderstanding of how race operates in our country.""","1125","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/19/omalley-sanders-heckled-during-presidential-forum-at-netroots-convention.html"
"The demonstrators were promoting the national “Black Lives Matter” movement, which seeks changes to police policies following high profile deaths of black men at the hands of law enforcement officers.","1126","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/19/omalley-sanders-heckled-during-presidential-forum-at-netroots-convention.html"
"Before the demonstrations, Vargas pressed O'Malley to defend his law enforcement record as Baltimore's mayor a decade ago.

"O'Malley discussed his work to deal with violence and drug addiction in Baltimore, telling the crowd, ""there are very few issues in our country that are quite as painfully intertwined as the legacy of violence, race and law enforcement in America."" He said his policies improved policing, reduced the number of police-involved shootings and increased drug treatment.","1128","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/19/omalley-sanders-heckled-during-presidential-forum-at-netroots-convention.html"
"The Netroots Nation convention has been a rough place for presidential candidates before. Clinton last appeared in 2007, when it was called the Yearly Kos, and heard boos from some activists who disapproved of her vote for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and her acceptance of campaign contributions from lobbyists.","1129","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/19/omalley-sanders-heckled-during-presidential-forum-at-netroots-convention.html"

"Pundits have focused recently on Hillary Clinton’s narrowing lead in polls among a group of less well known Republicans, along with voters' growing skepticism about her integrity. But a much more immediate threat to her electability is beginning to appear: in the last few weeks, Clinton has lost significant ground in both New Hampshire and Iowa to socialist Bernie Sanders.","Published July 09, 2015","1135","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"The latest Suffolk University poll has Sanders within 10 percentage points of Clinton, at 41-31, among Democrats in New Hampshire.

"In Iowa, Clinton remains well in front, with 52% to Sanders’s 33%--but she has slipped 26 points since May. And top Iowa Democrats have voiced skepticism about Clinton’s candidacy for months, as reported in the Wall Street Journal earlier this year.","1137","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"“My heart wouldn’t be in it for Hillary to the extent that it might be if it was a different candidate,” said Jennifer Herrington, chair of the Page County Democrats. “There’s always the nagging feeling that her ship may have sailed,” said Tom Swartz, who heads the Marshall County Democrats, of Hillary. “Elizabeth Warren, I would enjoy going out to lunch with her. Hillary, less,” Lorraine Williams, chairwoman of the Washington County Democrats, commented.","1138","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"Considering this enthusiasm gap, and data from an Iowa focus group, conducted by Bloomberg Politics and Purple Strategies in May, that showed Clinton’s supporters struggling to list her accomplishments, Hillary finds herself in a precarious position. At this point in the race, national poll numbers mean far less than the numbers in primary and caucus states. And that means that Clinton is in serious trouble.","1139","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"Front-running candidates typically lose support as the campaign wears on.

"In 2008, for instance, Hillary came in third in Iowa, behind then-Senator Barack Obama and former Senator John Edwards, but she had been ahead as voting day neared. Just a month earlier, in December 2007, she led Obama 31-26 and Edwards 31-19, but she wound up eight points behind Obama and a percentage point behind Edwards.","1141","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"And back then, Clinton wasn’t battling daily revelations about her private email server, extraordinary intelligence activities, and the unanswered questions surrounding the attack on our embassy in Benghazi.","1142","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"So even while Hillary holds close to a 20-point lead in Iowa today, the caucus there figures to be closer in January. And with her well under 50% in New Hampshire already, she could stand a chance of losing there as well.","1143","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"All this shows that Clinton finds herself with a real and credible threat in the primaries from Sanders, who spoke to 10,000 cheering supporters in Madison, Wisconsin last week—the biggest crowd that a candidate from either party has drawn.","1144","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"Over the holiday weekend Sanders drew a crowd of 2,500 in Iowa while Clinton saw much smaller crowds in New Hampshire and was heckled by a voter carrying a poster that read “Benghazi” and taunts such as “carpetbagger” and “tell us when you were poor” at the former Secretary of State. Moreover, Clinton whose ratings on trust and being in touch with ordinary people have been plummeting, organized a walking tour in such a way that the press had minimal contact with her, further exacerbating the sense that she is consciously seeking to distance herself from those ‎whose reporting could well make the difference for her candidacy.","1145","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"What’s driving the support for Sanders? It doesn’t have that much to do with Sanders himself.","1146","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"It has to do with the issues driving the progressive agenda, along with old- fashioned anger. The Left is fired up about a range of issues, most prominently income inequality.","1147","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"Indeed, perhaps more so than any other topic in the last 50 years, income inequality has become the issue most akin to Vietnam for the Democratic electorate. Clinton’s efforts to move left and accommodate these sentiments have been ham-handed, as in her comment last fall at a Boston rally. “Don’t let anybody tell you that, you know, it's corporations and businesses that create jobs,” she told the crowd, trying to tap into the populist-left energy. Other gestures are simply tone-deaf, especially for a candidate trying to rebrand herself as a progressive. When she recently decided to go to the Hamptons again this summer for three weeks, she set herself up for endless barbs by late-night TV hosts and her political opponents.","1148","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"And there’s another reason to take Sanders seriously. If Hillary loses the first two states next year—and she could—the landscape will change, just as it did for Lyndon Johnson in 1968, when he effectively ""lost"" the New Hampshire primary by winning just 49-42 over Senator Eugene McCarthy. That led to LBJ’s withdrawal from the race and the subsequent entry of Senator Bobby Kennedy of New York. RFK had been waiting on the sidelines until then, uncertain about whether he should get in.","1149","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"Who’s the Bobby Kennedy in this race? Elizabeth Warren.","1150","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"If Sanders can manage to raise $15 million online in small grassroots donations in just two months, as he has, imagine what Warren—whose stature is far higher—would be able to generate, merely by declaring an interest. So far, Warren has demurred. But in the same way that Obama said he wouldn’t run and Kennedy said he wouldn’t, circumstances and changing poll numbers affect political decisions, and could yet bring the Massachusetts senator into the race.","1151","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"My polling firm has collected data showing that Warren is competitive in both Iowa, where Hillary sits at close to 50%, and in New Hampshire, where she’s clinging now to a single-digit lead. Don’t be surprised if, in both states, 2016 looks a lot like the late 1960s.","1152","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"
"In short: Hillary Clinton’s candidacy faces a far greater threat—from within her own party—than the media and pundits have been yet willing to recognize.","1153","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/09/potentially-mortal-threat-to-hillary-s-candidacy.html"

"The former governor of Maryland told reporters that the debate schedule – trimmed to six from more than 25 in 2008 – represents a circling of wagons around Clinton, who is clearly ahead of her Democratic challengers. He is joined by fellow Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is also calling for more debates.","1157","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/07/fellow-dems-blast-dnc-for-coddling-hillary-in-debate-schedule.html"
"“This is not how democracy works,” O’Malley told supporters in a fundraising letter Thursday. “It’s ridiculous.

"“Hillary is not known for debates, she does much better in small groups,” said Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall Poll in Pennsylvania. “She does not do well in big arenas, she is not compelling. Right now she is pursuing the front-runner strategy, in that she can be hurt more by a primary process that gets combative in debates. So she speaks more to selective audiences.”","1161","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/07/fellow-dems-blast-dnc-for-coddling-hillary-in-debate-schedule.html"

"“We are thrilled to announce the schedule and locations for our Democratic primary debates,” said DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Thursday. “These six debates will not only give caucus goers and primary voters ample opportunity to hear from our candidates about their vision for our country’s future, they will highlight the clear contrast between the values of the Democratic Party which is focused on strengthening the middle class versus Republicans who want to pursue out of touch and out of date policies.”","1165","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/07/fellow-dems-blast-dnc-for-coddling-hillary-in-debate-schedule.html"

"2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney was said to have been banged up so badly by his fellow primary candidates during their 19 official debates that it hurt him in the general election, which he lost to President Obama.

"The fundraising face-off for the benefit of the state party came Friday night as the Democratic primary fight — long assumed to be just short of a coronation for Clinton — appeared to be heating up into a slightly more serious contest. In recent weeks, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has risen in the polls and packed arenas with voters eager to hear the message of the self-described socialist who's become Clinton's chief rival.","1179","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/18/as-democrats-face-off-clinton-keeps-her-focus-on-gop.html"

"On Friday, Clinton's campaign said it bought $7.7 million worth of television advertising time in early voting states, its first ad buy for the 2016 contest.

"Unlike her rivals, Clinton has already built a vast campaign infrastructure, run from a multistory headquarters in New York City, with hundreds of staffers across the country.

"Podesta also declared the campaign to be under “a ferocious onslaught of dark money” from Republicans, but that Hillary is funded by grassroots Americans who’ve “chipped in $1, $5, or $10.” An examination of the facts shows something different.","1199","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/17/clintons-campaign-claims-to-be-small-donor-driven-facts-show-otherwise.html"
"The email, under the subject line: “A ferocious onslaught of dark money,” says, “Republicans are out-raising us 4 to 1. If we win the Democratic nomination for president and this pace keeps up, we are in for a ferocious onslaught of dark money, regardless of who the nominee is on the other side.” But what does that “4 to 1” margin mean?","1200","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/17/clintons-campaign-claims-to-be-small-donor-driven-facts-show-otherwise.html"
"The Clinton campaign took in $46.7 million in its first quarter of existence, no small sum. Even NBC News called it a “Huge Fundraising Haul.” The next highest total for a campaign was another Democrat, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders raised $15 million. Senator Marco Rubio came in third with $12 million. So where does the “4 to 1” come from? Turns out it’s creative math.","1201","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/17/clintons-campaign-claims-to-be-small-donor-driven-facts-show-otherwise.html"
"The Clinton campaign combined the totals each of the current top-tier Republican campaign raised, $53 million, with the money raised by Super PACs associated with them, $203 million, for a total of $256 million for the GOP. Clinton’s Super PACs raised $24.3 million. If you add that to her total, as she does with the GOP, her total is $71 million. That’s roughly 3 to 1, not 4 to 1, but it’s still a false number.","1202","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/17/clintons-campaign-claims-to-be-small-donor-driven-facts-show-otherwise.html"

"If you add in the money Sanders raised, the Democrats’ total increases to $86 million, closer to 2.5 to one. But Clinton’s team created a false equivalence – one against all. Clinton’s campaign, by itself, has raised more than the top 4 GOP candidates combined – $46 million to $43 million.","1204","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/17/clintons-campaign-claims-to-be-small-donor-driven-facts-show-otherwise.html"

"The wording is a deliberate attempt to mislead the reader into thinking the Clinton campaign is funded by small dollar donors, average Americans simply “chipping in” what they can. But again, math tells a different story.","1206","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/17/clintons-campaign-claims-to-be-small-donor-driven-facts-show-otherwise.html"
"If each of Clinton’s 250,000 donors “chipped in” all the low dollar amounts listed in the email — $1, $5, $10, for a total of $16 each — that would total $4 million. That leaves $42 million unaccounted for.","1207","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/17/clintons-campaign-claims-to-be-small-donor-driven-facts-show-otherwise.html"
"The Washington Post reports only 17 percent of Clinton’s haul, or $7 million, came from donations of $200 or less, which leaves $39 million from high dollar donors.

"CLINTON PUTS SQUEEZE ON DEMS CAMPAIGN CASH Having celebrated Independence Day with a mobile rope line to keep the press away, Hillary Clinton’s campaign is looking to clamp down an iron fist on the purse of Democratic National Committee. The staff behind Clinton, who has seen her poll numbers plummet on trustworthiness, has been “struggling for months to finalize a joint fundraising agreement” with the DNC, Politico reports. The problem: Team Hillary “doesn’t trust the national party structure with the money.” “The Clinton campaign’s chief administrative officer, Charlie Baker, is serving as the point man to start laying the groundwork for what Clinton aides expect will be an eventual takeover of the national party structure, according to sources familiar with both DNC and Clinton activity. While DNC staffers are officially neutral, most see her as the eventual nominee, and several staffers describe a ‘first among equals’ approach to her when dealing with the primary field. A joint fundraising agreement would enable events to raise the $2,700 maximum for Clinton and the $33,400 level for the DNC from the same donors….The campaign has insisted that any money raised through joint fundraising activities be put in what’s essentially a lockbox until the general election campaign. The DNC wanted access to all the funds immediately.” Hillary uncorked? - Campaign insiders tell #mediabuzz” host Howard Kurtz that Clinton has decided to make herself more available to the media and will begin doing national TV interviews in the next week. After an internal debate and realization that keeping her at arm’s length from the press has damaged her campaign, “…a consensus has formed around the notion that allowing more routine access will drain the drama from each encounter.” [Prologue - The Atlantic’s David Frum contrasts the approach to the press taken by legacy candidates Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush: “[W]hat we’re seeing from these two leading candidates are deep personality traits that developed long before the 2016 campaign began—and will continue into their presidencies, should either win the presidency.”] Sanders: Clinton is the ‘establishment’ - “Clinton…is the candidate of the Democratic establishment…but I think what is equally interesting is the fact that all over this country, ordinary people, working people, elderly people are moving in our direction because they do want a candidate to take on the establishment.” – Sen.

"WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Belfast-born writer Clive Staples Lewis will have one of his most famous books “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe” commemorated with sculptures of his notable characters including Mr. Tumnus, and the White Witch, reports the Belfast Telegraph. Set in a newly designed public square in East Belfast, the characters will be placed in strategic locations throughout that area to reflect their role in the story. Lewis’ contribution to literature was more than just a fantasy story for children’s imaginations, though. His main identity was as a Christian apologetics writer; a type of writing that provides reasoned basis for Christian faith. Christian symbolism bled into his children’s stories, particularly in “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.” The story is supposed to be an allegory of Christ’s resurrection with Aslan the lion representing Jesus Christ. Aslan’s sacrifice for Edmund after he is taken by the White Witch symbolizes the Christian belief that Christ sacrificed himself for their sins. When Aslan is resurrected the Stone Table, depicting the Mosaic Law in the story, breaks representing the end of the stricter Old Testament for the redemption seen in the New Testament of the Bible after Christ’s death.

Over the weekend, Trump brought in the death of Kathryn Steinle, the young woman gunned down by an undocumented worker in San Francisco, to prove his point. But most GOP rivals baulked. Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., said, “To make these extraordinarily ugly kind of comments is not reflective of the Republican Party. Trump is wrong on this.” Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., added Trump’s comments were, “offensive and inaccurate.” There is understandable cringing within the party, but candidates like Bush and Rubio are also able to use Trump as the bogie man. While advocating secure borders, rivals can increase their appeal to Hispanic voters, pushing their own immigration policy as less extreme. Although Trump fired blistering retorts at Bush and Rubio, and his overall poll numbers are high, his rhetoric may simply result in making him increasingly an outlier and benefit his opponents. “Hispanics in America and Hispanics in Texas, from the Alamo to Afghanistan, have been extraordinary people, citizens of our country and of our state. They have served nobly.” – Former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, on ABC.","1258","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/06/clinton-puts-squeeze-on-dems-campaign-cash.html"

"HILLARY IN TROUBLE IN SWING STATES Hillary Clinton has fallen behind three top tier Republican candidates in Colorado, Iowa and Virginia. A new Quinnipiac University poll of voters in the key election battleground states shows Clinton trailing in matchups with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Marred by rising unfavorable ratings, Clinton has seen a huge drop from Q’s April poll which showed her clearly leading or statistically tied in matchups with Republican rivals. “She has lost ground in the horserace and on key questions about her honesty and leadership,” said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. “On being a strong leader, a key metric in presidential campaigns, she has dropped four to 10 points depending on the state and she is barely above 50 percent in each of the three states.” [The breakdown - In Colorado, Clinton trails Rubio 38 percent to 46 percent, Bush 36 percent to 41 percent and Walker 38 percent to 47 percent. In Iowa, she trails Rubio 36 percent to 44 percent, Bush 36 percent to 42 percent and Walker 37 percent to 45 percent. And in Virginia, she lags behind Rubio 41 percent to 43 percent, Bush 39 percent to 42 percent and Walker 40 percent to 43 percent.] Clinton bashes quick traders, then takes their cash - AP: “A day after proposing higher capital gains taxes on short-term investors, Clinton raised at least $450,000 Tuesday night at the Chicago home of Raj Fernando, a longtime donor. His firm, Chopper Trading, specializes in high-frequency transactions and was recently purchased by Chicago-based competitor DRW. Let’s cobble - Detroit Free Press: “Hillary Clinton, in town Tuesday for a fund-raiser…decided to make a brief campaign stop at a Detroit eatery to highlight her support for small businesses – and to taste some of the restaurant's signature sweet potato cobbler.” [Clinton attends a fundraiser in the Pittsburgh area today at the home of community activist Cindy Shapira.] Sanders to intro wage hike bill today - The Hill: “Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is pushing new legislation to raise the minimum wage for all workers to $15 an hour. The Democratic presidential candidate, who has made addressing income inequality a centerpiece of his campaign, will introduce the minimum wage bill Wednesday. Sanders has long called for a $15 minimum wage, but this is the first bill he is introducing to do so.” O’Malley ripped for linking ISIS to rain - Fox News: “Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus ripped Democratic presidential hopeful Martin O’Malley on Monday for linking the rise of the Islamic State to climate change. ‘Whether it’s the weak Obama-Clinton nuclear deal that paves the way for Iran to obtain an atomic bomb or Martin O’Malley’s absurd claim that climate change is responsible for ISIS, it’s abundantly clear no one in the Democratic Party has the foreign policy vision to keep America safe,’ Priebus said in a statement…. When asked about terrorism, O’Malley said that climate change and a devastating drought were linked to Syria’s instability and ISIS’ rise. Dems to descend on Iowa again - Des Moines Register: “Four of the five Democratic presidential hopefuls will share a stage for a second time on Aug. 14 at the annual Iowa Wing Ding. Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will speak at the party fundraiser at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake. The only candidate not listed in the event announcement is Jim Webb, a former U.S. senator from Virginia.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… National Geographic sits down with author Mark Adams to discuss his new book “Meet Me in Atlantis: My Obsessive Quest to Find the Sunken City,” in which he describes a new theory on the location of the lost city. Adams has been researching Atlantis for the past few years looking to ancient Greek philosopher Plato for guidance. The author claims Plato has the “most reputable” writing on the city even to this day. Adams presents a few different theories in his book, but says the latest theory that the city is in current day Morocco has a lot of merit. Part of the desert he toured there with fellow Atlantis enthusiast Michael Hübner matches with descriptions of the ancient city given by Plato. Adams told National Geographic, “One of the best clues that Plato gives about Atlantis is that there was a series of concentric circles around the city, black and red stone, and of course it was a seafaring society…Michael Hübner and I walked across the desert [in Morocco] and, sure enough, there was black and red striped stone.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 44.8 percent//Disapprove – 51.0 percent Directions of Country: Right Direction – 30.4 percent//Wrong Track – 61.3 percent IN A TRUMP TIZZY Yes, the barbs between Donald Trump and fill-in-the-blank are become increasingly prankish. Yes, they are feeding a salivating media. And yes, they are causing some Republican party angst. But is the sky falling? No. The fact that Trump is running like the showman he is is hardly surprising. And while there is honest concern over the drowning out of candidate campaign launches, policy proposals and the potential for circus-like debates, there is also evidence that Trump’s rise in the polls has a weak underbelly. Tuesday’s Washington Post/ABC News poll came with a big asterisk showing a downturn among those polled after his comments on McCain. And today’s Quinnipiac poll, shows the mulit-billionaire has the worst unfavorable rating of any candidate, by far. [The dumps - Quinnipiac University’s new poll of swing states Colorado, Iowa and Virginia shows Trump with negative favorability ratings of almost 2-1 among voters in each of the battleground states.] Trump has pushed some issues to the forefront, a fact that shouldn’t concern the GOP field. And while rivals have reacted with strategies ranging from direct return fire or more subtle rebukes, the closed cycle of attack-counter attack perpetuates Trump’s plan of action. Whether Trump can parlay this tactic into a serious candidacy is highly questionable. But for now only time, the polls and Trump’s own utterings will tell the tale. “I want to be nice, but everyone’s calling me names since I went to number one in the polls.” – Donald Trump on “Fox & Friends.” [‘Thank you, Mr. Trump’ - A woman whose son was beaten to death by an illegal immigrant thanked Trump in a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday. The woman said, “Thank you to Mr. Trump for getting a message out in two minutes that countless families like our own have been trying to get out for years.”] Jeb treads lightly around Trump supporters - LAT: “In a town hall-style discussion in Spartanburg, S.C., Bush said those who are gravitating toward Trump see a world in which there is a ‘lack of rule of law’… ‘You go across the spectrum and you sort of watch TV and you see this unfold and you go, ‘Look I want someone to fight for me on this,’ and so I respect the sentiments that people feel when they hear Trump talk.’” [Americans for Prosperity hosts Bush today at a “Road to Reform” discussion in Manchester, N.H.] Carly says Trump has wrong target - On “Fox & Friends” Carly Fiorina said that while she understands the frustration that Trump has tapped into in his presidential run, the former CEO suggested that he turn his attacks towards Hillary Clinton. Fiorina said, “In the end, it is Hillary Clinton we have to beat.” Watch here. Walker orders arming of Wisconsin National Guard - AP: “Republican Gov. Scott Walker issued an executive order Tuesday authorizing Wisconsin National Guard personnel to carry firearms while on duty in the wake of an attack on a pair of military facilities in Chattanooga, Tennessee.” Fast friends - WSJ: “The relationship stands to be beneficial for both men: Mr. Walker has access to a well-known surrogate who represents the moderate wing of New Hampshire Republicans; [Former Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass.] gets to be seen as a player in presidential politics – he introduced Mr. Walker during his first campaign stop in New Hampshire last week.” [Walker holds a breakfast stop in Nashville today.] Rubio: Only man with a plan - National Review goes into Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s tax plan, drafted with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Rubio, the only presidential candidate with a published tax plan, has a good basis but is too broad writing, “The problem with Lee-Rubio, in other words, isn’t that it breaks with the Republican Party’s supply-side traditions; it doesn’t. The problems are that it pursues supply-side goals on investment taxation too avidly, and that it’s too large. Put the plan on a diet and both problems are solved.” ‘Clear my schedule’ - Rubio tweeted to his campaign team saying that he needed his scheduled cleared August 14 to hit the cinema. The biopic flick “Straight Outta Compton” is set for release that day, and Rubio is eager to see it. The film tells the story of the rap group N.W.A. who rose to fame in the 1980s, of which Rubio is a fan. CRUZ, RAND LOOK TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD The Hill: “[Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas] office said Tuesday that he plans to file an amendment on the highway bill that would eliminate all federal funding for Planned Parenthood, in addition to an amendment that would fully repeal ObamaCare. Cruz is the second senator — and the second GOP presidential candidate — who is eying the highway bill as an attempt to defund Planned Parenthood. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said last week that he will ‘use all legislative vehicles at his disposal” to force a vote this week but has not released details of his plan.’” Carly calls out Dems, Hillary for ‘deafening silence’ on abortion - In a new video, Carly Fiorina stands with pro-life leaders to highlight her concerns over allegations that Planned Parenthood sold fetal body parts. “It is made even more terrible by the absolute deafening silence of the Democratic Party…Democrats have always fought for a policy that says it is not a life until it leaves the hospital. Hillary Clinton has fought to preserve that policy.” [Fiorina attends an event for State Sen. Ken Rozenboom, in Leighton, IA.] Kasich goes for broke - Columbus Dispatch: “[Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio], who became the 16th candidate to enter the GOP race, will try to use his unique style – and almost $3 million in TV advertising for New Hampshire – to rapidly gain stature. He currently registers in the low single digits in national polls and surveys in key early-voting states.” [Kasich spends his first full day in New Hampshire as an official candidate at a pair of Town Hall meetings.] NO MORE BULL IN THIS TOWN The Local: “Trigueros del Valle, with a population of just 300, has become the first municipality in Spain to enshrine the rights of pets alongside those of human townsfolk…‘Dogs and cats have been living among us for over a thousand years,’ said the mayor after the measure was voted in during a plenary session on Monday. ‘And the mayor must represent not just the human residents but must also be here for the others.’ The animal bill of rights…comprises 13 articles including statements such as…‘a resident, whether human or non-human, is entitled to respect’…In a move which will clearly prohibit any form of bullfighting in the town, the resolution bans ‘any action that causes the mutilation or death of a non-human resident.’” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “It will probably have the effect in the short run in this election cycle of putting the issue on the table. Abortion issue on the table in a way that Democrats are gonna be on the defensive. Do you believe in this? Do you believe that this is ok? But in the sense it kind of redefines backroom abortion. It used to mean illegal abortions but now that abortion is legal, we’ve opened the door on what really happens in the back room.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"Jeb is losing to a guy who’s never run for public office and is in hot water over comments about Mexican immigrants. In short, he’s been Trumped. (Though maybe The Donald has trumped himself by making light of John McCain’s Vietnam captivity, not that the media were in love with him before.)","1326","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/jeb-and-hillary-flawed-front-runners-generating-little-excitement.html"

"As the New York Times has noted, Hillary may have raised $47.5 million, but less than one-fifth has come in contributions of $200 or less. That means big-money donors, many of whom have maxed out at $2,700, are powering her campaign. Bernie Sanders, by contrast, has gotten four-fifths of his $15 million in small donations. (Hillary has also spent a chunk of her haul, stirring concerns about another bloated, consultant-heavy campaign.)","1328","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/jeb-and-hillary-flawed-front-runners-generating-little-excitement.html"
"Equally worrisome, the latest Fox News poll confirms the findings of several other surveys that Hillary has a trust problem. Some 58 percent of respondents say Clinton’s natural instincts lean more toward “hiding the truth” than “telling the truth.”","1329","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/jeb-and-hillary-flawed-front-runners-generating-little-excitement.html"
"It’s hardly shocking that Hillary isn’t firing up the grass roots. She’s been in public life for a quarter century, as first lady, senator, presidential candidate, secretary of State and global celebrity. She’s a Democrat running to succeed another Democrat. And the lack of a major opponent is draining much of the drama from her race. That’s why Elizabeth Warren, not HRC, is on the cover of Time.","1330","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/jeb-and-hillary-flawed-front-runners-generating-little-excitement.html"
"At the same time, even Hillary’s team is said to be concerned that Sanders, a 73-year-old who isn’t even a Democrat and who’s been a bit player in the Senate, could knock her off in Iowa. Or worse.","1331","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/jeb-and-hillary-flawed-front-runners-generating-little-excitement.html"

"Jeb has problems that go beyond Donald Trump. He’s at odds with conservative Republican voters over illegal immigration and Common Core education standards. He’s raised $114 million, but he’s had to talk repeatedly about his brother and why his last name isn’t a liability.","1333","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/jeb-and-hillary-flawed-front-runners-generating-little-excitement.html"
"And while Bush has been solid and substantive in his campaign, aside from his initial Iraq stumble, he has not been a dominating presence. He regularly talks to the press, in stark contrast to Hillary, but makes little news.","1334","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/jeb-and-hillary-flawed-front-runners-generating-little-excitement.html"

"“During one recent phone call with a political ally,” Politico says, “Bush pointedly asked about the surging real estate mogul. What, the friend recalled the former governor wondering out loud, was behind Trump’s antics, and what was he trying to accomplish?”","1336","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/jeb-and-hillary-flawed-front-runners-generating-little-excitement.html"
"Jeb is trying to be the grownup in the room.

"The Donald, meanwhile, speaks of Jeb with open disdain. “He raises 100 million, so what does 100 million mean?” Trump asked. “100 million means he's doing favors for so many people, it means lobbyists, it means special interests, it means donors,"" said Trump. ""Who knows it better than me?” The eventual nominees often seem lackluster during the preseason. I remember lots of political and media grumbling over Mitt Romney, John McCain, John Kerry and Al Gore, whereas the likes of Howard Dean and Newt Gingrich generated more excitement. Those who win their party’s nod have to be acceptable to a broad coalition, which usually means they can’t be fire-breathing insurgents.","1338","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/jeb-and-hillary-flawed-front-runners-generating-little-excitement.html"

"CLASS CLASH: HILLARY TRIES TO HEAD OFF WALKER","1344","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/class-clash-hillary-tries-to-head-off-walker.html"
"Hillary Clinton gave a speech today calling for new regulations and hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending to fight income inequality. The topic was a reaction to the rise of Bernie Sanders, whose socialist platform is catching fire among Democratic activists.","1345","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/class-clash-hillary-tries-to-head-off-walker.html"
"But the timing is about someone else: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.","1346","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/class-clash-hillary-tries-to-head-off-walker.html"
"Walker, finally having birthed a budget in Wisconsin, is making his candidacy officially-official today with a rally in Waukesha. That location is no accident and neither is the fact that Walker’s announcement video starts with him in dungarees and a Harley t-shirt.","1347","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/class-clash-hillary-tries-to-head-off-walker.html"
"The message is that Walker is a middle-class guy with a blue collar background. Much as Clinton’s husband endlessly touted his roots in Hope, Ark., Walker is running as the man from Waukesha. Maybe not so poetic, but not every top-tier presidential candidate gets a shout-out on the sign at the McDonalds where they used to work. (Plus, Bubba really grew up in Hot Springs…)","1348","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/class-clash-hillary-tries-to-head-off-walker.html"
"As Clinton sizes up the Republicans who mean trouble in the general election, she has to account for the name identification and enormous fundraising of Jeb Bush, the generational and historical appeal of Marco Rubio and now, the middle-class message of Scott Walker, the Kohl’s candidate.","1349","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/class-clash-hillary-tries-to-head-off-walker.html"
"Clinton is looking to bracket Walker’s rollout with an appeal to the frustrations of workers left behind by the changing economy: a federal surge aimed at shoring up the battered middle class. Walker, not surprisingly, is expected to attack Washington elitism and centralization of power.","1350","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/class-clash-hillary-tries-to-head-off-walker.html"
"Policy particulars do matter, especially as Walker tries to up his credibility quotient with a skeptical GOP intelligentsia. And Walker faces a double challenge as he tries to win the esteem (or at least acceptance) of the GOP elite: that he is ever more open to claims from other conservatives that he is flip-floppish. Advisers dropping blind quotes to National Journal about prospective pivoting to the center will be great fodder for those who call Walker inconstant. It’s not quite “Etch-a-sketch” but it reflects the same kind of lunk-headedness on the part of process-obsessed advisers.","1351","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/class-clash-hillary-tries-to-head-off-walker.html"
"Biography and attitude, though, generally matter more in politics. Walker’s electability argument is that he as an outside Washington, blue-collar guy can best take on a Democratic candidate seen by many voters as of Washington and-out-of-touch.","1352","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/class-clash-hillary-tries-to-head-off-walker.html"
"But to do that, he will have to face down a full field of Republicans, many whom have little to lose in their attacks on him.","1353","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/class-clash-hillary-tries-to-head-off-walker.html"

"After a one-week hiatus, the 2016 GOP Power Index returns with a scrambled field. The biggest upheaval comes from, who else but Donald Trump. While Trump’s media super-saturation soaked many in the GOP field, hardest hit was the other prominent businessperson in the race, Carly Fiorina. Fiorina has much of the message and attitude that admirers of the current version of Trump have praised: tough on illegal immigration, breaking the back of the federal bureaucracy, bringing business-style accountability to government, etc.","1357","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/class-clash-hillary-tries-to-head-off-walker.html"
"But Fiorina, who manages to state these positions without being accused of racism, is relatively little known while Trump started from a position of fame and has become a media omnipresence in the last three weeks. He will certainly do damage to other candidates in the race, and potentially to the eventual nominee. But the greatest harm will come to those, like Fiorina, who find themselves passed over for media coverage and stand the risk of missing out on the first debate next month on Cleveland.

We still see La Cosa Nostra in the news, so Vice checked in with the experts on the state of America’s most famous organized crime syndicate. Former mobster Louis Ferrante explains that in addition to the supply of potential wise guys being limited by threat of incarceration, breached loyalty oaths and cultural assimilation of Americans of Sicilian ancestry, the need for the Mafia’s services has declined: “Moreover, gambling is legal. Alcohol is legal. And just about anyone can get a loan from a bank. Ordinary people no longer need the Mafia. And with no demand, the organization is unnecessary.”","1369","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/class-clash-hillary-tries-to-head-off-walker.html"

"NEW POLL, NEW TROUBLE FOR HILLARY IN EARLY STATES How far left will Hillary Clinton have to go to placate her party’s base? While Republican frontrunner Jeb Bush has the advantage of his party’s conservative wing fragmenting rather than consolidating, Hillary Clinton is watching the left side of her party coalesce around Sen. Bernie Sanders. The latest Fox News poll shows Sanders still trailing Clinton nationally, with 15 percent to her 61 percent, but in the crucial early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire we see the big gains for the Vermont socialist. A pair of new polls from Bloomberg and local media partners in the states with the first two nominating contests shows Sanders slicing Clinton’s lead. He now boasts a quarter of the vote in New Hampshire and in Iowa. Sanders is perhaps even less likely than newly minted GOP candidate Donald Trump to be his party’s nominee, but Sanders may have a greater effect on the outcome. So far, Democrats are still spurning the entreaties of former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. But Sanders’ strength combined with Clinton’s endless ethical problems continues to show that there is room in the party for a real challenge. While time is running out, there are still probably a couple of months for a person with high name identification to jump into the race – we’re looking at you Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. So how many flops must Clinton flip before her party is satisfied that she will not sprint to the middle in the general election? And on what topics? While Clinton has been a perfect pander bear on social issues, touting her hatred for the Confederate Battle Flag and deep, if newly acquired, support for same-sex marriage, will she be forced to take damaging stances on tax rates, government-run insurance and other items that could do her damage against the eventual GOP nomination? There’s still almost no scenario in which Clinton doesn’t end up as the nominee, but the condition in which she arrives and what new liberal positions she is obliged to pack in her baggage when she gets there are now very much up in the air. THE JUDGE’S RULING: DRAWING THE LINE ON THE CONFEDERATE FLAG Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano talks about the dangers of attributing natural rights to government on the heels of the Confederate Battle Flag debate in South Carolina. The judge rules that giving the government those rights can allow infringement of the First Amendment to the people being governed. Read here. [The Judge gave funny man Jon Stewart a humorous lesson on constitutional law last night on “The Daily Show”. Watch here.] Webb defends - “The Confederate Battle Flag has wrongly been used for racist and other purposes in recent decades. It should not be used in any way as a political symbol that divides us. But we should also remember that honorable Americans fought on both sides in the Civil War, including slave holders in the Union Army from states such as Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland and Delaware, and that many non-slave holders fought for the South.” – Former Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., in a statement. IRS DOCUMENTS DESTROYED ‘MOST LIKELY’ INCLUDE LERNER EMAILS Fox News: “A congressional hearing Thursday morning is expected to reveal evidence was destroyed during the investigation into the IRS targeting scandal, months after the agency was told to preserve documents, Fox News is told. J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, is expected to tell the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee his office found no direct evidence the destruction was intentional. But the destruction nevertheless defied a preservation order, and is sure to raise suspicions over motive. The IG will specifically reveal that IRS employees erased computer backup tapes a month after officials discovered thousands of emails related to the tax agency's Tea Party scandal had been lost. As many as 24,000 emails were lost because 422 backup tapes were erased. George says those tapes ‘most likely’ contained emails to and from former IRS official Lois Lerner…” SUPREMES MAY DROP OBAMACARE RULING TODAY Today could be the day the Supreme Court decides the fate of a major pillar of ObamaCare. With just three “decision” days left in the high court’s term, a ruling that President Obama’s health law as written only allows government subsidies to those Americans who buy health insurance on a state-run exchanges would rock the laws foundations. The fallout could mean approximately 6.5 million Americans who bought insurance on healthcare.gov would suddenly lose federal subsidies, making their ObamaCare-mandated coverage unaffordable. Hold the balloons - WashEx’s David Drucker explores how dealing with the fallout of a ruling against the administration could provoke sparring within the GOP and complicate life for the party’s presidential contenders. “GOP congressional leaders are likely to push legislation that maintains subsidies long enough for affected to Americans to transition to a new system. Voting on such proposals could be politically tricky for the senators running for president, including [Marco Rubio,] Ted Cruz of Texas, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky…. The governors expected to run, including New Jersey's Chris Christie, Ohio's John Kasich and Wisconsin’s Scott Walker could get tripped up by constituents who look to them to create a state exchange in the absence of their ability to access subsidies through healthcare.gov. This would be political kryptonite in a Republican presidential primary.” “Under no circumstances should Republicans in Congress extend ObamaCare…If the Supreme Court concludes that President Obama violated the law, the last thing Republicans in Congress should step up and do is codify his lawlessness and extend the subsidies.” – Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on “Special Report with Bret Baier.” Watch here.

Orwell, who has been lionized by both liberals and conservatives over the past century for his trenchant attacks on authoritarianism, gave us many linguistic gifts, including terms like “Cold War,” “Big Brother,” “thoughtcrime,” and, of course, “Orwellian.” An iconoclast, full of political contradictions, Orwell was always clear-eyed when it came to the abuse of language by politicians. From his essay on “Politics and the English Language,” he gives a biting criticism of political rhetoric saying, “This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political writing. As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed…” Good luck with that in 2016!

"HILLARY OUTRUNNING HER OWN PRIVILEGE Can Hillary Clinton be this bad at running for president and still get away with it? For now, the answer would appear to be yes. But we are starting to see her reaching the tether of the privileges associated with being a president’s wife, her party’s 2008 runner-up and the beneficiary $2 billion campaign apparatus. It’s still her turn on the Democratic side, but an awful lot of Democrats are coming to wish there was another way. The latest Fox News poll shows Clinton losing 10 points of her lead since last month on Vermont socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders still trails by 19 points and isn’t going to be overtaking her anytime soon, but that’s kind of the point. For all her months of working and fighting and pandering, she’s still losing ground to a guy who complained about excessive deodorant choice in the American supermarket. And she certainly gives Democrats ample reason. Clinton, whose conduct as secretary of state is currently the subject of a federal criminal probe, joked in Iowa on Friday “You may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat account,” she said. “I love it. I love it. Those messages disappear all by themselves.” Ugh. The team of writers who worked on that joke should be fired, en masse. Like George W. Bush’s jokes about the search for the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, it wasn’t that it was too soon, it was that it would never be funny. In Clinton’s worldview, her shady email antics are but a distraction. She’s wrong. Given the ethical allegations against Clinton plus the controversies surrounding her time in office, especially her Libya misadventure, hiding emails is serious stuff. And as the poll shows, 58 percent of registered voters believed she lied about having classified material on her private server. Fifty-four percent said doing so put national security at risk. Ha-ha-ha… More telling, though, is what Clinton said to reporters about the widening FBI probe of her security practices. Clinton said she would “let whatever this inquiry is” run its course and not get distracted because that’s not what voters are asking her about. Good grief! So not only does the candidate denigrate the investigation while it is ongoing but also supposes that because of what people pre-selected by her campaign for human interaction say to her it’s not resonating with voters. If they were picking panda bears for her to nuzzle instead of Iowans, one assumes Hillary would be consumed with talk of delicious, leafy tender baby bamboo. Mmmmm, bamboo… If the other candidate of privilege, Jeb Bush, were this bad at running for president he would have already had to quit the race. And anyone else would have had to have fled the country. If Clinton really is this bad as a candidate, there is no amount of money or power that can rescue her. Democrats will instead have to place all of their hopes on a complete Republican meltdown. So at least they’ve got that going for them… Reporter leaves no turn unstoned - Politico reports that the Democratic donors Biden would “need to be viable appear to be ruling him out” based on the responses of people who attended a Hillary Clinton fundraiser on Martha’s Vineyard. The reporter must next be headed to Wrigley Field to see who’s picking the Cardinals for the World Series. 2016 Democratic Power Index: Joe’s back from the beach - 1) Hillary Clinton; 2) Joe Biden [+1]; 3) Bernie Sanders [-1]; 4) Martin O’Malley; 5) Jim Webb; 6) Elizabeth Warren; 7) Lincoln Chaffee; 8) Al Gore [previously unranked] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… One hundred years ago this day, Charles F. Kettering was issued a patent on a gadget that made daily life for Americans less cranky, literally. The DELCO co-founder’s “engine-starting device” was the first electric ignition device for automobiles. As History.com describes, “In the early years of the automobile, drivers used iron hand cranks to start the internal combustion process that powered the engines on their cars. In addition to requiring great hand and arm strength, this system was not without certain risks: If the driver forgot to turn his ignition off before turning the crank, the car could backfire or roll forward...By making cars easier and safer to operate, especially for women, the self-starting engine caused a huge jump in sales, and helped foster a fast-growing automobile culture in America.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

The big winners in the Fox News poll out Sunday were primarily identified as outsiders. Donald Trump remained in first place, but with some suggestion that his support may have peaked as his vote share held steady and respondents who watched the debate judge him to have done the worst. He is also the most disliked among GOP primary voters. With a new immigration policy proposal that makes Mitt Romney’s self-deportation sound like trip to the spa, Trump will continue to shape the race by setting the marker for (presumably) the ultra-restrictive position in the field. But there’s no indication that he’s done much to broaden his appeal. Not so for Sen. Ted Cruz, who is running as a more practical version of Trump. Cruz got back into the top tier for the first time since immediately after his launch and, given his deep pockets, large organization and the failures of competitors like Sen. Rand Paul (down to 3 percent from steady double-digits this spring), it is again possible to imagine the Texas senator being in contention when the GOP gets to the home stretch for the nomination in March. Cruz may have been in politics and government off and on for 20 years, but his torch work in Washington clearly identifies him as an outsider’s insider. However, the candidates who benefitted the most from the exposure of debate night are clearly those with the least political experience in the field: Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina. While candidates like Trump and Jeb Bush came to the process already famous, Carson and Fiorina are little known in the political space. Having tens of millions of people tune in has limited upside for candidates already known to all, but as Carson and Fiorina show, big potential for those they are getting to know and might just like. As for those who are following a more traditional path to the nomination, including Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Marco Rubio: August is why you need deep pockets. All three saw their numbers fall as attention shifted to the biggest lights from the debate. But as pressure grows on candidates like Rick Perry, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal and Lindsey Graham to abandon their bids for the good of the party, the field should sort itself out to the advantage of Bush, Walker and Rubio.

Ads are scheduled to begin in Iowa and New Hampshire on Sept. 15, in South Carolina a week later and then run continuously through the end of the year. The plan, shared by the group with The Associated Press prior to Monday's buy, is the first evidence of Right to Rise USA's major strategic spending of the roughly $100 million it had on hand last month.” [Fox News colleague Serafin Gomez reports that Bush will get the endorsement of a dozen Medal of Honor recipients in South Carolina today.] Trump targets Walker in Iowa - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “Billionaire businessman Donald Trump launched another attack against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker Saturday during a campaign stop at the Iowa State Fair. Trump, who has overtaken Walker as the front-runner in the crucial state in recent polls, slammed the Republican governor and his record in Wisconsin, saying ‘there's tremendous dissension all over the state.’ The real estate mogul said that economic growth under Walker has been ‘terrible.’ Trump's comments echoed attacks he has made against Walker in recent weeks. Until recently, polls showed Walker as the front-runner in Iowa and several other crucial early primary states. But several polls released in the wake of the first GOP debate have shown Walker dropping and Trump surging into a strong lead. ‘His growth is terrible in terms of the state,’ Trump said. ‘There's tremendous dissension all over the state.’” Will it wash? - Walker and Fiorina are both on the Des Moines Register soapbox at the Iowa State Fair today. [The first jury pool with a hot tub - Donald Trump today arrives for jury duty in Manhattan.] “It’s not clear to me that Donald Trump is a Republican.” – Carly Fiorina in an interview with ABC News. Carson’s Sunday strategy paying off - Des Moines Register: “Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson spent his Sunday morning at the church of a Des Moines civil rights activist. The former pediatric brain surgeon shared stories of his rise from inner-city poverty and posed solutions for a more promising future for America's youth. The Rev. Keith Ratliff, former president of the Iowa & Nebraska branch of the NAACP, called Carson an inspiration for the youth in his community. He also said Carson, the lone African-American among 15-plus viable GOP candidates, could reverse negative views some minorities hold toward the Republican Party.” Kasich snags Alabama Gov. Bentley’s backing - The Alabama Media Group had the scoop on Gov. Robert Bentley’s endorsement today of his Ohio counterpart, John Kasich. While Kasich is no favorite to win the state’s March 1 primary (Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich were first and second in 2012) Bentley’s backing shows a surprising Deep South strength for Kasich and might help garner some delegate count next year. Alabama Media also had this detail, which will make both men more unpopular in 48 other states: “Bentley, a University of Alabama graduate and huge Bama fan will present Kasich with a signed UA football by coach Nick Saban. Kasich, a graduate of The Ohio State University, in turn will present Bentley with a football signed by Ohio State coach Urban Meyer.” [Kasich heads to South Carolina where he will officially file to appear on the state’s Republican primary ballot.] Huck heading back to Israel - Far from walking back his comments about President Obama marching Israel to “the doors of the oven” with his Iran nuclear deal, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is highlighting his connections to the Jewish state with a trip this week. Huckabee told CNN he was heading to Tel Aviv on Tuesday for fundraising and meetings with officials. Home game - Huckabee’s campaign points out that they are deeper and wider on the ground in early states than most. Huckabee’s daughter and campaign manager, Sarah Sanders, told Fox News First that while Jeb Bush’s campaign has gotten lots of attention for an expansive Iowa staff, Huckabee has more: 71 county chairs and 139 “grassroots leaders” across the state. In South Carolina, the campaign touts similar numbers. You can get the full rundown here. SHUTTLECOCKS NOT FASCISM!

"FIRST IN FOX NEWS FIRST: POLL SHOWS HILLARY WAY UNDER WATER IN SWING STATES In a poll of voters in the six make-or-break swing states, Hillary Clinton now trails a generic Republican opponent by 13 points – a jump from last month’s 8-point deficit. The poll, which will be released later today, was conducted for the pro-GOP group American Crossroads by pollsters Vox Populi. The telephone survey included 1,908 registered voters in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, and Virginia. While the Republican nominee will certainly have greater liabilities than a generic standard bearer – though likely some advantages, as well – a deficit of this size is bad news for Clinton as she looks to head off other potential intra-party rivals. Clinton’s best argument for the nomination is her own inevitability. If she is seen as a potential loser with the general electorate, Democrats could easily be forgiven for backing a candidate they like and trust more. The reason for Clinton’s decline with the swing-state general electorate is not hard to discern. Trust for Clinton waned notably since last month’s survey. In July, 41 percent of respondents expressed at least some degree of trust for the former secretary of state. This month, that’s fallen to 37 percent. Distrust of Clinton, which clocked in at 56 percent last month has climbed all the way to 60 percent. It’s bad enough to be 23 points underwater on trustworthiness in general but maybe worst of all is that 47 percent this month said they “completely distrust” Clinton. Clinton’s net favorability fell sharply, too. She was 15 points below the beam last month. This time, it’s at negative 21 percent. That doesn’t necessarily reflect her potential vote share since people will sometimes (albeit rarely) vote for a candidate they do not like or trust, but -23 on trust and -21 on favorable is a dog’s breakfast of an attribute set even at this early date.

CANDIDATES SWARM IOWA FAIR Political junkies, loosen your belts! On today’s docket, former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., has the stage to himself today at the Iowa State Fair as the only presidential candidate on the soapbox. Amid the hay bales that heard Mitt Romney declare“corporations are people,” Bush will look to win over Evangelicals who still are not too keen on him. Jeb lost 40lbs recently on the paleo diet so he may have some wiggle room on the calorie front, but his need to address Iowans’ concerns over his conservative creds remains a challenge. Some 20 presidential candidates are slated to make pitches over the course of the fair. On Saturday, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., former Gov. Lincoln Chafee, D-R.I., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., take to the soapbox. Sunday will bring Ben Carson, and former Gov. George Pataki, R-N.Y., to the stage. Look out for other candidates milling about the grounds taking a look at how voters in the first caucus state are ranking their deep-fried politicking. [Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are expected to be at the Iowa State Fairgrounds Saturday, though neither is on the speakers’ schedule.] Trump hires hands - WaPo: “The groundwork laid by Trump’s sizable Iowa staff, with 10 paid operatives and growing, is the clearest sign yet that the unconventional candidate is looking beyond his summer media surge and attempting to win February’s first-in-the-nation caucuses….‘I see them as a major threat to all the other campaigns because of the aggressiveness of their ground game,’ said Sam Clovis, an Iowa conservative who leads former Texas governor Rick Perry’s campaign. ‘You cannot swing a dead cat in Iowa and not hit a Trump person,’ Clovis continued. ‘It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen.’” Sounds like Hillary’s campaign and the press - “After much cajoling and corralling – and a little rump-slapping – Big Mac finally bolted into the weighing chute, prompting one of his handlers to sprint to shut the front gate…” – The Des Moines Register reporting on the Trump-backing prize boar of the fair. Jeb says brother’s Iraq ‘mission was accomplished’ - Bloomberg: “Speaking at a national security forum in Davenport, Iowa, on Thursday, the Republican presidential candidate acknowledged that his brother's record on prosecuting the war and its aftermath wasn’t perfect as he tried to balance his own outlook and reconcile the implicit connection he has to some of his brother’s unpopular decisions. ‘I think people have every right to be critical of decisions that were made,’ the former Florida governor said. ‘In 2009, Iraq was fragile, but secure.’ The ‘mission was accomplished’ when it came to Iraq’s security at the end of his brother’s time in the White House,’ Bush said.” Rubio bashes Obama’s Cuba reset, Iran deal - With Secretary of State John Kerry in Havana today to raise the American flag over the U.S. embassy and the president pressing Congress to approve his Iran nukes deal, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., warns Obama’s diplomacy with dictators threatens America’s safety, security. New in Fox News Opinion: “These two dangerous developments represent the convergence of nearly every flawed strategic, moral, and economic notion that has driven President Obama’s foreign policy, and as such are emblematic of so many of the crises he has worsened around the world.” [As part of a speech in New York today detailing his policy on Cuba and Iran, Rubio says he’ll invite political dissidents of repressive government to his inauguration.] Walker plans policy rollout - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Coming off a routine debate performance and a dip in the polls, Wisconsin Gov.

A spokesman for the New York City Police Department said Marquise Evans, 21, dislodged a manhole cover on a street in Brooklyn late on Wednesday and allowed two other men to climb inside. Witnesses called police, and responding officers and firefighters, outfitted in protective garb, followed the men but could not locate the pair, the spokesman said. About four hours later, the two men, identified as David Hannibal, 45, and Damion Nieves, 35, emerged and were taken into custody, police said.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"It’s REALLY more like ‘Jeb?’ Than ‘Jeb!’ The biggest disadvantage that Jeb Bush has isn’t his last name, but rather the relative quality of the Republican field he is facing. That’s not to say that being George W. Bush’s little brother is an unalloyed positive for the former Florida governor. But as polls have shown, it is (no surprise) less of a problem for GOP primary voters than with the general electorate. Plus, Dubya is mellowing in the cask of public opinion, especially as President Obama flails about over Iraq. The younger Bush obviously understands the liabilities involved with his family name and the basic American resistance to dynasties. Otherwise, he wouldn’t pick a logo that emphasizes a nickname that sounds as if it were ringing across the tennis courts at Andover. But don’t let them kid you. If you wanted to be president and could choose whether to be the son and brother of presidents or be the son of a small-town preacher or a Miami bartender, you know what you’d pick. Bush was born on third base; everybody else had to hit a triple. But still, as he launches his official candidacy, Bush is struggling to assert his dominance. Bush is probably a better establishment-backed candidate than either of the two after his brother, and both John McCain and Mitt Romney won by comfortable margins. Yet, this time seems different. Part of it is technique. While Hillary Clinton has lowered the bar dramatically for forthrightness, accountability and probity, Bush’s decision to invoke his Right to Raise unlimited sums for six months before actually declaring hasn’t exactly set him up to run as the tribune of the people. But the biggest part is that Bush is facing serious competition. In 2008, Romney had to keep other viable establishmentarians out of the field, particularly then-Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Once the field was set, Romney had only one real threat: then Texas Gov. Rick Perry. But Perry was a bust. Everything after was just delaying the inevitable. This time, Bush has at least two rivals in Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., whose talents and positions make them real alternatives. Remember, the way the previous two candidates put away the nomination: Mainstream Republicans blanched at the thought of nominating candidates seen, fairly or not, as one-dimensional, social issue grinds. Neither Walker nor Rubio is that kind of candidate. If either makes it into the home stretch with Bush, the surge is more likely to come for the underdog rather than the current frontrunner. Unless Walker and Rubio succeed in destroying each other and leaving the way open for a riskier pick, Bush will not have the advantage of declaring his final foe electorally toxic. Jeb Bush is a better candidate in many ways than Romney or McCain were. But unfortunately for him, his chief rivals are furlongs ahead of the 2008 and 2012 pack. [Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Campaign Carl Cameron reports on Jeb’s announcement live from Miami.] 2016 GOP POWER INDEX: RUBIO NICKS WALKER, PERRY UP, KASICH KRUMBLES 1) Jeb Bush; 2) Marco Rubio [+1]; 3) Scott Walker [-1]; 4) Carly Fiorina; 5) Ted Cruz; 6) Rand Paul; 7) Rick Perry [+3]; 8) Ben Carson; 9) Mike Huckabee [-1]; 10) John Kasich [-4] On the Radar - Chris Christie, Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki Scott Walker still has the clear advantage in polling, but give Marco Rubio the edge this week for the political jujitsu move of the month. Rubio made the most of an error in a NYT piece pummeling him for dicey financial moves as a younger man – that described his fishing boat as a “luxury speed boat.” Now, an $80,000 pleasure boat is not exactly a cocker spaniel, but Rubio’s jackhammering of the Times has a bit of Richard Nixon’s “Checkers” speech to it. Reporters who want to take issue with Rubio’s finances will have to make it about way more than watercraft from here on in. That no doubt helped Rubio as he was auditioning for Romney’s money men in Utah at Camp Mitt this weekend. These are people who spend $80,000 on boat storage, not boats. The only other candidate or crypto-candidate who right now meets the credibility threshold to beat Bush would be Ohio Gov. John Kasich. But with Kasich’s choice of a campaign team that specializes in double-dog-daring primary voters to back their candidates, he seems unlikely to seek broad-based appeal. Kasich seems instead to be picking a trajectory in which he and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will be battling coffee-shop-by-coffee-shop for a Huntsmanian third-place finish in New Hampshire. Rick Perry, despite having the worst-ever campaign song in the history of recorded music, is showing that in addition to a newfound humility he is also packing a superior campaign organization this time around. Perry’s focus on the military and foreign policy will also serve him well on the trail.

WATCH HERE. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Next time you categorize something as a failure don’t be so quick to write it off. Sometimes it just takes a couple of centuries…The Magna Carta, arguably one of the most important documents in history, was very nearly lost to history. In 1215, King John needed a means to regain support after many of the barons rebelled against him, and he faced a growing threat of invasion from France. To ensure support at home the king drafted a charter called the Magna Carta, a peace treaty protecting barons from monarchical abuse, in addition to other rights listed. Within a month, King John broke the treaty, however, and the Magna Carta was considered a failure. But in 1642 when civil war broke out in England, Chief Justice Sir Edward Corke used the document as proof of limiting monarchy power, leading to his dismissal from the bench and charges of treason. Leap ahead another 100 years or so and the Magna Carta was once again used in the American Revolutionary War. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

While Hillary Clinton channels Elizabeth Warren and cozies up to the base by tweaking President Obama on trade, Bernie Sanders has clamped down hard on the Democratic frontrunner in a series of sharp attacks. Sanders’ steady barrage – shining a spotlight on Clinton’s vague policy positions and a record that makes the left nervous – has touched a nerve and drawn in large crowds on the trail. Sanders grasp of the megaphone stands in clear contrast to the quiet traverses of early primary states by O’Malley, Webb and Chafee. So Bernie’s earned a bump up to number two in the Democratic index. Big draw - Des Moines Register: “Sanders continues his streak of attracting large, loud crowds in Iowa. The audience of mostly professionals and older adults, mixed with some college-age and younger attendees, rewarded him with applause more than 100 times.” [Watch Fox: Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry reports on Hillary’s New Hampshire sweep live from Concord, N.H.] “I helped lead the effort in the Senate against the Keystone pipeline…Secretary Clinton has been very quiet on this issue.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on CBS ‘Face the Nation” Bubba says his wife had to do two jobs - Former President Bill Clinton said Sunday that Hillary had to get involved in economic diplomacy because there wasn’t a commerce secretary during much of her time as secretary of state. WaPo’s fact check says, “For three out of the four years, there was a Senate-confirmed commerce secretary sitting near Hillary Clinton at Cabinet meetings. Moreover, the secretary of state is supposed to engage in economic diplomacy…But Clinton’s assertion that if not for Hillary Clinton, ‘nobody would have been doing’ economic diplomacy is quite a stretch, given the dominant role of the Treasury Secretary on international economic issues.” Hillary laments mean-spiritedness after attack-filled campaign re-launch - At her first Iowa rally after Saturday’s New York re-launch, Clinton talked mean-spiritedness of today’s political dialogue saying, “Did they not go and hear the same lessons I did in Sunday school?

Hintz said he was simply trying to get her home, not detain her. ‘I just treated her the way I would've wanted somebody to treat my mom,’ said Hintz. He ended up escorting the woman home, letting her drive as fast as the scooter would go, which is 6 miles per hour.

"FIRST IN FOX NEWS FIRST: WALKER OPENS IN FIGHTING STANCE Scott Walker is laying the groundwork for Monday’s presidential announcement with the story that first introduced him the GOP voters. In a video set to be released by his campaign today, we never hear from Walker himself but rather his supporters and critics from his 2011 budget battle and failed 2102 recall effort. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., -- or at least archival footage of the 2102 GOP vice presidential nominee – plays a starring role. Walker has yet to endorse Walker, his home state governor, or any candidate, but Ryan was an ardent ally of Walker during his fight against government worker unions and in the subsequent recall election. Ryan’s line, “courage is on the ballot” sounds like a ready-made Walker slogan. But the closing of the spot goes to Walker’s fiercest critics at MSNBC. The final line is from Rachel Maddow who says “This election night may have just been one recall election, for one governor. What happens as a result of this could be the biggest politics story of all.” It’s the first major move by Walker’s campaign since the Wisconsin governor informed the Federal Elections Commission last week that he was readying a presidential campaign. You can watch the video here. MITT AND JEB BREAK BREAD Mitt Romney and his wife dined with Jeb Bush at the Bush family’s compound in Kennebunkport, Maine. Former President George H.W. Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush also attended. No leniency for Snowden, says Jeb - In a tweet Monday night, Bush commented on former Attorney General Eric Holder’s remark that “possibility exists” for Edward Snowden to come back to the U.S. if the Justice Department could cut a deal with him. Bush responded, “Snowden broke the law, recklessly endangered nat’l security, & fled to China/Russia. He should be given no leniency.” RUBIO STARTS POLICY ROLLOUT Sen.

CAMPAIGN DAYBOOK Carly Fiorina continues her six day New Hampshire tour. Ben Carson participates in Politics and Eggs in Manchester, N.H. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., huddles with Edgefield County Republicans in South Carolina WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… WaPo: “After causing quite a stir over the weekend and putting scientific observations on hold for three days, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft seems to be recovering. On July 4, NASA reported that New Horizons -- which is just days away from a historic encounter with Pluto after nine years of travel -- was experiencing an anomaly. The craft went into safe mode and lost communications with Earth for an hour. The $728 million mission is meant to give us our first real observations of Pluto, the mysterious dwarf planet that sits on the edge of our solar system. It’s been zipping toward its goal since 2006, and the end -- July 14 -- is in sight. By July 15, the public should have access to an image of Pluto on par with shots of Earth taken from space. But this hiccup is a reminder that no space mission is a guarantee -- and the July 14 flyby will require all the stars to align.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Hillary Clinton. Sanders latest big draw comes amid word of a “worried” Clinton campaign hearing footsteps as her rival from Vermont closes in. Maybe it’s Sanders’ sexpertise - The attention is cutting both ways for Sanders though, as deeper dives on self-described socialist’s past emerge. The latest, in a NYT weekend write on Sanders’ revolutionary roots, describes an article on health he wrote in the 70s for the leftist paper The Freeman: “…[I]n which he cited studies claiming that cancer could be caused by psychological factors such as unresolved hostility toward one’s mother, a tendency to bury aggression beneath a ‘facade of pleasantness’ and having too few orgasms. ‘Sexual adjustment seemed to be very poor in those with cancer of the cervix,’ he wrote, quoting a study in a journal called Psychosomatic Medicine.” It’s not the first time in this campaign Sanders early writings have raised eyebrows. And while the Donald Trump’s present pronouncements have branded him an outlier, Sanders past has the potential to douse the Bern and cause consternation for Democrats. Clinton aide blocks access to environmental group - WashEx: “An environmental group whose request for records related to the Keystone Pipeline was reportedly hampered while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state is considering taking the case to court for the second time. Ben Schreiber, climate and energy program director at Friends of the Earth, said his group has weighed the option of relitigation in the weeks since learning that Clinton’s chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, had interfered in the agency’s handling of Freedom of Information Act requests for Keystone documents.” Hillary chides Israel boycott push - The Hill: “Hillary Clinton is taking a strong line against the ‘BDS’ movement that calls for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel. In a letter to major Democratic donor Haim Saban that was released publicly, Clinton asks for advice on how to fight the BDS movement, which she argues is seeking to ‘isolate and delegitimize Israel.’” [Clinton is back in Iowa for a couple of grassroots organizing events and will give her first network interview of her campaign.] BENEFIT FOR CHARLESTON A benefit for the families of those killed at Mother Emanuel AME Church will be held in Washington on Wednesday. The event, hosted by the South Carolina Business Council and the South Carolina State Society, is set to start at 6 p.m. at 101 Constitution Ave NW. Among those attending are Assistant Democratic Leader, Jim Clyburn, Senator Tim Scott and U.S. Senate Chaplain Barry Black. RUN FOR YOUR LIVES. THAT IS ALL. WCCO: “A grizzly bear at the Minnesota Zoo repeatedly slammed a 50-pound rock into the glass wall of its enclosure, cracking the thick pane separating the bears from surprised zoo-goers. Director of Animal Collections Tony Fisher says the custom-made, laminated safety glass safety glass did what it’s supposed to do — only one of its five layers shattered…Zoo staff are not certain which of the three grizzlies picked up the rock, but they believe it was Kenai, the middle-size brown bear. The zoo says on its website that he likes to wrestle and ‘when it comes time to new things, he’s most likely to be the first to try them.’ Fisher says the bears weren’t being aggressive or trying to escape, they were just playing…The bears have been taken out of their exhibit until a replacement pane can be installed.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “This is a fake campaign. This is a woman, this is a candidate who is going to be the nominee. We all know it, for all of the Bernie momentum stuff. That’s a side show. But you have to go through fifteen, sixteen months of a ritual of actually campaigning. There is no campaign. There is not going to be a debate. There isn’t a challenge. So she is stuck for these fifteen or so months pretending to be a candidate and what you get are pretend events.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"HILLARY’S HOWARD DEAN PROBLEM Hillary Clinton is in New Hampshire for a day of semi-retail politicking to try to tamp down enthusiasm for her rival, Bernie Sanders. But if she wants to do that, a better place to be might be Phoenix, where the annual Netroots Nation conference is being held. Clinton, who touts her large number of small-dollar donors, still relied on the plutocratic caste for her substantial quarterly haul. Simply put, she has a problem with her base, and it seems to be persistent. Not unlike Mitt Romney facing a field of political impossibilities, Clinton can be confident that she can eventually defeat her own party. But that, of course, doesn’t set one up for general election success.","1507","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/hillarys-howard-dean-problem.html"
"And the GOP knows it, for sure. The Republican National Committee is taunting Clinton for her absence, dropping a punishing briefing book on Clinton later today. Within it is a damning collection of Clinton flips and flops, base disagreements and chilly poll numbers.","1508","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/hillarys-howard-dean-problem.html"
"The Netroots movement is hallowed ground for Democrats. This was where the movement to block establishment favorite John Kerry was born in 2003. It was also where the lessons learned from that defeat were shaped into the successful strategy that suffocated Clinton’s shock-and-awe campaign in 2008. There would have been no Obama presidency without Netroots. Clinton relies on big donations that fund a campaign that uses social media to cram messages that are meant to appear organic. But there’s little online activists hate more than phony online activism. And we see today another example of the perils of dropping the establishment hammer too hard on the Democratic base. Under fire for allegedly breaking a compact with other AFL-CIO to withhold their endorsements until Clinton had staked out sufficiently liberal positions, American Federation of Teachers boss and longtime Clintonista Randi Weingarten told Politico that the surprise weekend endorsement wasn’t to help shore up Clinton’s weakening left flank but rather because of the overwhelming support Clinton has received in two town halls and a poll conducted by the union. Tell that to the thousands of dissidents who are backing a petition to have the union rescind its endorsement. But Weingarten was dismissive. “Everybody loves Bernie, just like George McGovern, just like Howard Dean,” she said. Er, that’s kind of the point. McGovern and Dean both did serious damage to Democrats. Dean’s turgid rhetoric helped push eventual nominee Kerry to the left and helped brand the party as reckless in a time of war. And the hard feelings of Netroots member insurgents that launched the Dean campaign denied Kerry the chance to move to the middle. Nobody thinks Sanders is bound for the Democratic nomination, but a protest movement is growing and could leave Clinton with even less flexibility when she moves to, as she promised, “a nice, warm purple space” for the general election. At the very least, Dean’s fellow Vermonter Sanders represents a similar threat to Clinton. But to invoke McGovern is just wild. Who’s Hillary Clinton in that comparison? Edmund Muskie or Hubert Humphrey? Yeesh. Dean himself has been co-opted by the Clintons. But the energy and anger he represented is more real than ever. If Clinton tries to blow past her base with some well-constructed issue pandering and a lot of cash, she will be made to pay a dearer price. Hillary’s camp spends big bucks on polls - Weekly Standard: “Hillary Clinton has already spent nearly one million dollars on polling. According to the Democratic presidential candidate’s first Federal Election Commission disclosure report, the campaign has already spent $904,915.00 on polling…The Hillary for America campaign, the Clinton campaign's official title, has already spent $18,699,814.02. So far the campaign has raised $47,549,949.64. Clinton has $28,850,135.62 cash on hand.” Bernie is about Bernie, not Hillary - Or at least that’s what FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver says. “The Bernie Sanders surge, in other words, has a lot more to do with Bernie Sanders than with Hillary Clinton. More specifically, it has to do with his left-populist politics.” Read about his math to back it up here. [Donors for Bernie include Ben & Jerry’s ice cream founders, celebrities, and everyone in between. Read the eclectic list here.] OBAMA’S IMPERIAL PRESS CONFERENCE President Obama was not pleased by the questions offered at one of his rare press conferences.","1509","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/hillarys-howard-dean-problem.html"
"CBS reporter Major Garrett’s question, asking whether the president was “content” with a deal that left American hostages in Iranian hands, was met with a scathing “you should know better.” The president then told Garrett what he should have asked. Later, Obama seemed to be wrapping up as he deflected a question about accused rapist Bill Cosby’s presidential medal by saying that he was intolerant of rape in general. But then Obama, as is not his usual practice, opened the floor to questions rather than sticking to a preselected list of reporters. But Obama only wanted questions relating to his Iran deal: “I just want to make sure that we’re not leaving any stones unturned here.” There were many, many stones that were never touched, let alone turned over. What does the president think about the scandal consuming his longtime benefactor, Planned Parenthood? Is his administration reconsidering its policies on sanctuary cities? How does he account for the meagre success in training fighters against ISIS? Does he have concerns about the revelations that Hillary Clinton used campaign operatives to plot policy on Libya? Does he regret his Libya policy given the unraveling of that country subsequent to U.S.-backed regime change? Does he believe that the government’s data is secure in the wake of the most devastating hack in history? Does he hope that Vice President Joe Biden does indeed mount a presidential campaign? What advice has he given or would he give Biden? You get the idea… A press conference is when a public figure opens himself or herself to questions from reporters, not a verbal press release with reporters present as props. And for reporters who didn’t like this new low-water mark for presidential accountability, keep a close eye on the 2016 frontrunner who, with the help of Obama’s communications team, is plumbing new depths. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… WSJ: “French President Charles de Gaulle once complained it was impossible to govern a country with 246 kinds of cheese. If France has managed to thrive despite de Gaulle’s misgivings it’s probably because there are rules for everything, including cheese. When it comes to serving le fromage, there are precise prescriptions for quantities (always uneven numbers), choice (a least one soft, one hard and one blue) and the geometry skills required to cut perfect portions. All of which can be intimidating to foreigners who get invited to French homes, or happen to visit the all-you-can-eat cheese cave at renowned restaurant Baud et Milletin Bordeaux. As a rule of thumb, you should never cut off the ‘nose’ of cheese: Cutting a slice parallel to the rind is a big no-no in French cheese etiquette.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, at the billionaire’s eponymous tower in Manhattan. Trump said ahead of the meeting he didn’t know why the Texas senator wanted to meet with him. Cruz, meanwhile, has expressed positive sentiment toward Trump since Trump began his presidential campaign despite his controversial comments. In another move towards building alliances within the GOP, Cruz’s campaign also sent a memo to the other GOP campaigns asking them to oppose the polling standards for Aug. 6 Fox News debate in Cleveland, Ohio. Cruz’s pollster suggested requirements that would disqualify every current public poll according to the memo obtained by Politico. “You know, I like Donald because he is brash, he is bold and he speaks the truth. He stands up to Washington. It's what I have tried to do in my time of public office…and I in particular salute Donald Trump for focusing on the problem of illegal immigration.” – Sen.

That’s the maximum donation a candidate can receive for the primary election. By contrast, Bush received just $368,000 from donors who contributed $200 or less — or a little more than 3% of his total haul.” Hope they don’t surcharge - TIME: “During a rollout of her economic plan Monday, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton took companies like Uber to task for not giving drivers benefits. On Friday morning, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush plans on hailing an Uber in San Francisco to show his support for the ride-sharing company and others like it.” Walker explains opposition to gay scoutmasters - NYT: “‘The protection was not a physical protection,’ [Walker said], but rather about ‘protecting them from being involved in the very thing you’re talking about right now, the political and media discussion about it, instead of just focusing on what Scouts is about, which is about camping and citizenship and things of that nature.’” As he heads to the Granite State - Folks in the First in the Nation Primary state are none too pleased with Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., says WMUR, due to his minimal presence in the state. Granted, Walker only announced his official candidacy on Monday, and was engaged in a rabid budget fight back home, but if he’s looking to compete in New Hampshire he’ll need visit more often. [Speaking of which, Walker plans on touring a Harley-Davidson store in North Hampton, N.H. followed by a fundraiser in Boston.] Rubio cash deets - Miami Herald: “In all, [Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.,] spent $2.3 million and raised about $12.9 million -- about $2 million of that from donors who gave $200 or less -- counting $3.2 million from his Senate re-election campaign that transferred over. He had to refund more than $821,000 to individuals and other PACs who had maxed out to his Senate account.” [Watch the highlights of Rubio’s town hall with veterans in New Hampshire here.] OH, DEER Mirror: “A [Scottish] farmer has come up with an unusual way of keeping pesky deer away from his turnips - by using a blow-up doll as a scarecrow. David Gray says the [$7.50] inflatable woman has proven more effective than traditional methods. The Joker, 50, said: ‘She has made a much better job of it than my last scarecrow, which was made from a carrier bag on the end of a stick.’ David explained that he was fed-up with wild deer coming into Glenhead Farm in Banton, near Kilsyth, north Lanarkshire, and destroying the crops. He wanted something that looked more like a real person to keep them away so he ordered the risqué doll on Amazon and drove her to the field on the back of his quad bike last week. As well as guarding the site, the doll – who is yet to be named – has caused a bit of a stir with locals in the village, reports the Daily Record. David said: “The reaction from people round here has been great “We have had loads of people stopping to look at her when they are going past.’” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “We have no idea if the inspections are going to work…We have no idea what’s going to happen with the embargos but we know one thing.

"THE DONALD UNDONE? Apologize? Drop out of the race? Hardly. Donald Trump’s answers to a deluge of criticism from Republican rivals and the national party over his attack on Sen. John McCain’s standing as a war hero and the Arizona Senator’s record on veterans: “They’re very upset that I’m leading the polls,” and by the way, “the news media are also distorting my words.” In the latest round of barbs, Trump doubled down on his criticism of McCain’s record in a USAT OpEd, and balked at competitors scorn saying, “I do not need to be lectured by any of them.” [He knows best - NYT: “[His] improvised fit of pique…exposed the biggest vulnerability of Mr. Trump’s campaign for president: It is built entirely around the instincts and grievances of its unpredictable candidate — and does not rely on a conventional political operation that protects presidential hopefuls from themselves.”] The past 48 hours have seen a number of reports that Trump’s comments have passed a tipping point. Others have surfaced questioning the billionaire’s service deferments during the Vietnam war. But the fact remains he continues to draw oxygen from a crowded GOP field, particularly the likes of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Carly Fiorina. With the first debate just 17 days away and another candidate about to join the group that oxygen is becoming precious, especially for those on the debate stage bubble. So far, name recognition and strong poll numbers have enabled Trump to throw his verbal grenades and to an extent channel them into issues that find some resonance in the party. Whether he can do the same with his latest blast, or if he has dropped this one too close to his feet remains to be seen. The rapid Republican backlash may point to the beginning of the end of a Trump pageantry. The Donald’s response clearly shows he thinks he has by no means reached his undoing. [Asked on MSNBC’s Morning Joe if Trump owes him an apology, McCain responded: “No, I don’t think so. But I think he may owe an apology to the families of those who have sacrificed in conflict and those who have undergone the prison experience in serving their country.”]","1515","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/donald-undone.html"
"But that wasn’t the worst of it - Wash Ex’s Byron York says that bashing McCain wasn’t Trump’s worst mistake in Iowa this weekend. He writes, “Instead, Trump’s casual and disengaged characterization of religious faith may have made a far worse impression on the mostly evangelical conservatives who came to hear Trump and other Republican hopefuls speak.” JEB TAKES ON ‘MOUNT WASHINGTON’ In a variation on theme he used as Florida’s governor to rein in spending, Jeb Bush outlines his presidential priorities in a speech today from the state’s capitol. From excerpts: “We used to call this city ‘Mount Tallahassee’ because it was so remote from the people, so caught up in the settled ways of a comfortable establishment….Should I win this election, you will not find me deferring to the settled ways of ‘Mount Washington,’ either. The overspending, the overreaching, the arrogance, and the sheer incompetence in that city – these problems have been with us so long that they are sometimes accepted as facts of life. But a president should never accept them, and I will not. We need a president willing to challenge the whole culture in our nation’s capital –and I mean to do it!”","1516","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/donald-undone.html"

Scott Walker is scheduled Monday to sign a bill banning abortions at or beyond 20 weeks of pregnancy.

"[Program note: Chris Stirewalt returns next week with his latest version of the Fox News First’s 2016 Power Index.] EPIC, BRAH! AP: “State police say a man escaped injury after being run over by a freight train while sleeping in the middle of railroad tracks in an upstate New York town. Troopers say 38-year-old Aaron Collins of Stillwater was highly intoxicated when he went to sleep Wednesday night on tracks in the Rensselaer…20 miles north of Albany. Police say a Pan Am freight train more than a mile long approached around 10:30 p.m. The conductor spotted Collins on the tracks and stopped the train, but not before the first two engines passed over him. Troopers say the engines were separated and the first engine was moved forward to free Collins, who was uninjured but still drunk.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"She reached this decision after an internal debate and the move is supported by many top campaign officials, along with her husband, Clinton insiders say.","1533","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"“She’s all on board,” Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign’s communications director, told me in an interview. “America will see more of her.”","1534","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"Palmieri played down the notion that the interviews, along with plans to take more questions from reporters on the trail, amount to a risky strategy. “She does fine,” Palmieri says. “That was not a concern.”","1535","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"The danger, Clinton insiders tell me, is that in today’s Twitter culture, a single misstep or badly chosen phrase can be taken out of context and go viral, drowning out anything else that Clinton is saying. They are also worried that some reporters, given Hillary’s global fame, might try to boost themselves by creating a “gotcha” moment.","1536","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"But a consensus has formed around the notion that allowing more routine access will drain the drama from each encounter. “The more media interviews you do, the less any one interaction matters,” Palmieri says.","1537","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"The former president and first lady, as well as campaign chairman John Podesta and others, are said to recognize that keeping the press at arm’s length has damaged her campaign. They concede that her long periods of silence in the face of swirling questions about her private email, speaking fees and Clinton Foundation favor-seeking have hurt her on the crucial issue of public trust.","1538","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"

"For two months after her campaign launch, Clinton took virtually no questions from her traveling press corps, a strategy symbolized by her impromptu stop at a Chipotle. After her kickoff speech on Roosevelt Island, she sat down with a handful of local reporters in key states, but that was about it on the interview front.","1540","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"The distancing approach creates a news vacuum that is often filled by stories about the latest release of her emails or questions about the family foundation. It contributes to a backlog of negative questions that can erupt each time reporters have a chance to shout questions at the candidate. And it provides a sharp contrast with Bernie Sanders, who is generating headlines for both his populist rhetoric and the size of his crowds.","1541","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"But Palmieri says Clinton thought long and hard about how to campaign after her 2008 loss. “She thought about what she does best with voters, which is a big deal—the one-on-one interaction.” That, she says, is why the campaign began in Iowa and New Hampshire with small events at which the former secretary of State mostly listened. Meanwhile, journalistic frustration mounted and began a running theme in the Hillary coverage.","1542","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"“I’m always trying to balance letting the press have access but not having that get too much in the way of what she needs to do in her campaign,” says Palmieri, a former communications director in the Obama White House. In the end, “This is her campaign.”","1543","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"If Hillary coasts to the Democratic nomination, the insiders say, her only real opponent would be the media. But even then, she needs some capital in the bank for when major controversies erupt—capital that can be earned by developing relationships with the journalists who cover her.","1544","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"This may help only at the margins, the sources say. But it might help with the problem that most people have a brittle image of Hillary, rarely glimpsing her more engaging side--a longstanding frustration in her inner circle.","1545","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"

"WHAT WILL SHE SAY? HILLARY HEADS TO HILL AS IRAN DEAL DROPS Hillary Clinton’s long-scheduled visit to Capitol Hill today was intended as still more base stroking by the Democratic frontrunner – outreach to the Balkanized ethnic caucuses that comprise the party’s minority in the House and reassurances to liberals that she really will play rough with her friends on Wall Street. But instead, Secretary of State John Kerry has dumped a tureen of foreign policy in her lap. Whatever the deal announced today with Iran is – a historic achievement, an over-hyped nothingball, a capitulation to Islamists, the start of an arms race in Armageddon’s designated zip code – it is a headache for Clinton. Public opinion polls on an Iran deal are a seeming paradox. Voters want a deal with Iran, says the administration. That’s true. But voters are also pretty sure that this one won’t work. Citing public support for a deal in general as support for this deal in specific would be like saying that almost everyone likes pizza to argue for support for your order of a large with anchovies and onions. That’s complicated enough for any politician, but for Clinton it’s a spider web. Obama’s former secretary of state has sounded supportive but cautious about the negotiations, and some of her hawkish supporters have even hinted that she is opposed. There’s even a little overlay with the scandals that have dogged her campaign. As we saw with Clinton’s vote for the Iraq war but then against the troop surge there, she is ever mindful of the political consequences of her foreign policy choices. If Clinton sounds sour about Obama’s deal, mistrustful doves may back away. But if Clinton backs a deal that turns out to be a botch, she will have further damaged herself on foreign policy, which was supposed to be her strong suit in this cycle. Ugh. The deal, which appears to be a five-month test drive in which sanctions are lifted, money flows to Tehran and the regime there allows nuclear inspectors into its facilities, faces real opposition from lawmakers in both parties. The president has threatened to veto any effort to block the deal, but that would hardly reinforce its legacy-building clout for him. It’s becoming increasingly easy for Democrats to part company with the lame-duck president on difficult issues. Especially this one. Obama is trying to make it easy by reminding members of his party that all that is required is to do nothing, which is the long suit for members of Congress. They can express worries and concerns, but as long as they vote right, it will be fine. It’s not so easy for Clinton. While she will certainly play cuttlefish today on Iran – praise diplomacy, express cautious optimism, promise to carefully review; lather, rinse, repeat – even she is likely to have to take a position. And from that new establishment Democratic orthodoxy, no dissent can be tolerated. Consider the case of Gov. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H. Hassan is worrying over whether to challenge to Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., who is a defense hawk in a state that appreciates that sort of thing. Last week, Clinton condemned the effort by American liberals to boycott Israel. But Hassan’s church, the liberal United Church of Christ, recently voted last month to boycott Israel. When pressed on where she stood, Hassan sided with her party’s presumptive nominee rather than her denomination. Now that’s clout. Imagine that kind of pressure applied to something more than just symbolic votes by church elders, like say support for a nuclear Iran. [“I think we now have enough information to understand that Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State has engaged in gross dereliction of duty. She has engaged in a cover up, and she has blood on her hands.” – Carly Fiorina on “The Kelly File” Watch here.] HAIRY EYEBALLS ON POPULIST PITCH Hillary Clinton’s high-price-tag economics speech, laced with swipes at 2016 Republican rivals Bush, Rubio and Walker, was notable for being – as FiveThirtyEight observed – “light on specific proposals” and “sound[ed] familiar to anyone who’s been listening to President Obama over the past eight years.” Politico notes: “[S]he left out many hard specifics on tougher tax policy toward the rich and corporate America. And she offered limited pledges to crack down on big Wall Street banks while hitting her strongest notes promising to toss rogue bankers in prison while ripping recent worker-productivity comments from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.” Yet for all her veering to the liberal base, what Clinton left out of her speech, Bloomberg finds, is drawing fire from that quarter: “Clinton’s language on the financial industry was carefully calibrated as she positioned herself as tough on Wall Street but not a slash-and-burn critic.” [Not Bernie - WaPo looks at four ways Clinton distanced herself from rival Democrat Bernie Sanders] Bernie says economic growth is overrated - WaPo: “He’s saying that America’s leaders shouldn’t worry so much about economic growth if that growth serves to enrich only the wealthiest Americans. “Our economic goals have to be redistributing a significant amount of [wealth] back from the top 1 percent,” Sanders said in a recent interview, even if that redistribution slows the economy overall….It is this kind of unorthodoxy that has helped galvanize liberal voters in New Hampshire and Iowa and elevate Sanders in early polls. It is also represents a sharp challenge to front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton, who wants to maintain broad appeal even as she expands her support among liberal Democrats.” Not feeling the Bern - CNN: Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley isn't worried about Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' recent surge in the polls because, in his view, the Vermont senator is the candidate of the summer, not the eventual winner. After speaking at the National Council of La Raza in Kansas City, O'Malley told reporters that Sanders' recent surge is because ‘this is the summer of anger and discontent,’ casting the liberal senator as more of a flash in the pan. [O’Malley hosts a roundtable today at the New York Immigration Action Fund in Manhattan, where he will unveil his proposals for immigration reform.] Team O’Malley banking big on Iowa - AP: “O'Malley's team says that Iowa offers his best path to 2016 relevance. ‘The caucus process is uniquely suited to give Governor O'Malley an opportunity to make his case to Iowa caucus goers,’ reads a campaign memo shared with The Associated Press that describes the Iowa summer strategy as ‘going all in.’” SANCTUARY CITIES RELEASED 8,000 FACING CHARGES Wash Ex: “Some 276 ‘sanctuary cities,’ nearly 50 percent more than previously revealed, released over 8,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records or facing charges free despite federal requests that they be turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation, according to an explosive new report…those releases from cities that ignored federal demands came over just eight months and are just part of an even larger release of 17,000 illegals with criminal records.” Victim’s brother slams White House - Fox News Insider: “On ‘The Kelly File’ [Monday night], Kate Steinle’s brother opened up about the tragic incident that took his sister’s life and also slammed the controversial sanctuary city policy…He also told Kelly that the policy of sanctuary cities is overreaching. He said it ‘essentially rolled out the red carpet for a convicted felon’ to come into the city.’” “And unfortunately, because of the lack of structure and just the lack of people taking a stand for what’s right and getting things right, I think the system has failed my sister miserably.” – Brad Steinle talking on “The Kelly File” last night about his sister, Kate Steinle, who was murdered by an illegal immigrant in San Francisco last month.

Rolling Stone headlined their article on Walker “America’s Top Union Leader Just Destroyed Scott Walker in Six Words.” Well, considering Walker’s major policy triumph in Wisconsin was ending the collective bargaining rights for unions it’s understandable that the head of the unions wouldn’t be his biggest fan. And the quote that supposedly destroyed Walker? “Scott Walker is a national disgrace.” Okay… But Richard Trumka, head of AFL-CIO isn’t the only liberal with a rallying cry on the evils of Walker. Hillary Clinton said in her economic speech Monday that Walker made his name, “stomping on workers’ rights.” But some liberals took a different tactic. Instead of igniting over Walker others tried to diffuse his entry by saying he wasn’t that important anyway. The New Republic said that, “Scott Walker is the most boring presidential candidate ever.” Whatever words they use to describe Walker, all these reactions show one thing: he poses enough of a threat that Democrats feel the need to stamp him down before his campaign even takes off. [Walker begins his early state sweep in Nevada today where he will meet with voters.] Hit from the right, too - The fulminations were not just on the left. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum warned social conservatives that Walker’s wife was problematic. Her tender sentiments about a gay relative could mean Walker could flinch on same-sex marriage. “Spouses matter,” Santorum told the Daily Caller. Working blue in a red crowd - As part of the intro for Gov. Scott Walker’s announcement Monday, Rachel Campos-Duffy, a television personality and wife to Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wisc., took a jab at former President Bill Clinton over what he is most remembered for. Campos-Duffy said, “Scott has been married to Tonette for 24 years.

"JEB HITS BACK AT HILLARY OVER JOBS Des Moines Register: “‘Hillary Clinton has attacked me in the last few days. Which by the way, for the record: Bring it on,’ [Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla.] told an audience of about 200 at a Story County GOP dinner at Prairie Moon Winery in rural Ames on Monday evening. ‘This warms my heart that she’s upset that I’m saying that 6½ million people in this country are working part time when they want to work full time,’ said Bush, a former Florida governor. ‘The workforce participation rates are abysmally low and our economic growth is not enough.’” Hot in the Hamptons - NYDN: “We’re told that [Woody Johnson] who signed on as Bush’s national finance chairman in May, was so pleased with the Maine fund-raiser [in Kennebunkport last week] that he thinks his candidate can continue to raise money in the left-leaning Northeast. That includes potentially squeezing the green out of blue bloods in the Hamptons who fancy themselves socially liberal and fiscally conservative. Since the beginning of his campaign, Bush has raised more than $100 million. He has nearly two dozen fund-raisers on his calendar between now and mid-September.” [Bush has a meet and greet in Council Bluffs, Iowa today.] What Rubio’s cash haul means – Sen. Marco Rubio’s, R-Fla., $12 million campaign fundraising effort, combined with his supported PAC money, gives him nearly $45 million fighting for the 2016 nomination. This puts Rubio in the top bracket of fundraisers, and makes him a notable contestant for fellow Floridian Jeb Bush. As Walker looks to compete with Bush, Rubio looks to end him. And now he’s got the funds to pose a stronger threat than previously believed. NYT responds to Cruz controversy - In a statement released Monday night the head of NYT Communications, Eileen Murphy, said the controversy over leaving Texas Sen.

"HILLARY: TRUMP, REPUBLICANS ALL ALIKE Under the battle cry that all Republicans are Trump, Hillary Clinton fired a shotgun blast at her GOP rivals Monday saying, “While what Donald Trump said about Megyn Kelly is outrageous, what the rest of the Republicans are saying about all women is also outrageous.” The Democratic frontrunner has consistently sought to lump all Republicans together in a renewal of her party’s claim of a GOP war on women. This time the target was Sen. Marco Rubio on abortion. “When one of their major candidates, a much younger man, the senator from Florida, says there should be no exceptions for rape and incest, that is as offensive and as troubling a comment as you can hear from a major candidate running for the presidency,” Clinton said. Rubio wasted no time slamming back with a statement which said in part, “Hillary Clinton supports abortion even at the stage when an unborn child can feel pain…Hillary Clinton holds radical views on abortion that we look forward to exposing in the months to come.” While Clinton’s move to tar her Republican rivals with a broad brush is aimed at shoring up a base that has seen erosion in support among white women, it is also a reflection of her campaign’s concern over Rubio, who a recent a swing state poll showed is a top threat in a head-to-head matchup. [But I really don’t know Trump ‘that well’ - “I didn’t know him that well. I mean, I knew him. I knew him and I happened to be planning to be in Florida and I thought it’d be fun to go to his wedding, because it’s always entertaining…Now that he’s running for president, it’s a little more troubling,” said Clinton at a New Hampshire press conference.] Hillary’s nets a mil from who-knows-who? - Doubling down her recent criticism of “the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money,” this election cycle, AP reports that Clinton got a big dollar bounce from anonymous donors. “[T]he main super PAC backing her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination accepted a $1 million contribution that cannot be traced. The seven-figure donation, made June 29 to the pro-Clinton Priorities USA Action, came from another super political action committee, called Fair Share Action. Its two lone contributors are Fair Share Inc. and Environment America Inc., according to records filed with Federal Election Commission. Those two groups are nonprofits that are not legally required to reveal information about their donors.” Hillary vows all the emails are out there - NYT: “Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement filed under oath in federal court on Monday that she had provided to the State Department all of the work-related emails that were on the personal email account she used exclusively while she was secretary of state.” [Déjà vu: State to miss Hillary email deadline - WashEx: “State Department officials will not publish the required number of Hillary Clinton’s emails at the end of August, marking the second month in a row that the agency has failed to meet a court-ordered benchmark for the production of the records.”] Hillary lays out college plan: No loans for public schools - USA Today: “The multi-pronged plan includes giving grants to states to make them partners in a pledge that no student should have to take out a loan to pay for tuition if attending a four-year public college in their state. It would require students to help pay their way through school by contributing based on what they earn from 10 hours of work per week. And, echoing a plan already proposed by President Obama, students would be able to attend community college for free.” [Hillary and Jeb waged a daylong Twitter-photoshop battle over the plan: Mashable has the deets] Nurses side with Bernie - WSJ: “A major union of nurses endorsed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for president Monday, posing a hurdle to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton as she works to lock down support from key elements of her party’s base. The endorsement—the first Mr. Sanders has received from a national union—marked a big win for the candidate and comes after Mrs. Clinton last month won the backing of the American Federation of Teachers.” [More big crowds for Bernie - over 70,000 in three speeches Bloomberg reports.] Laura Ingalls for Congress! No really… - Detroit Free Press: “Actress Melissa Gilbert, best known for her portrayal of Laura Ingalls Wilder on NBC’s “Little House on the Prairie” in the 1970s and ‘80s, said Monday she will run for Congress in Michigan’s 8th District -- though her campaign will have to tamp down questions about a tax bill.” TAKE FIVE: WHAT DO YOU SAY?

You have ancient Rome to thank for the concept, reports CTV. Street food vendors come from a need to feed nearly 50 million people leading very busy lives (sound familiar?). And Ancient Romans did not play around when it came to food. Emperors could be toppled over a lack of proper sustenance for their people, and Romans were known to center their days around several feedings, including snacking. Food-on-the-go became a necessity and, in such a vast expanding place, returning home was not always an option.

Jeb Bush, R-Fla., is taking the gloves off in a speech at the Reagan Library today that not-so-subtly accuses Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, of contributing to the rise of ISIS. Name-checking Clinton, Bush says that early withdrawal from the Middle East, and a continued refusal to acknowledge Islamic extremism, allowed the radical group free reign over the region. In pre-released remarks Bush says, “ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat. And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the president himself, she had opposed the surge…then joined in claiming credit for its success … then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away.” SOUND OFF: READER RESPOND TO 2016 GOP POWER INDEX “To have Jeb Bush as the front runner is a joke, because the only people that want him in office is the entrenched establishment, people like Karl Rove.” – Mark Ritsig “In time, those on the radar will eventually fall OFF completely, joined by Huckabee, Carson, Paul, and hopefully Trump.

Appearing on the Hugh Hewitt Show Monday, Fiorina clarified that, ‘If you’re going to run as a Republican in a primary, then you need to be clear that you are actually a Republican.’ Fiorina continued with, ‘Uniting the party after a nomination contest, so that we can beat our opponent is the most important thing.’” Cruz bus tour draws crowds in Tennessee - [Nashville] Tennessean: “Sen. Ted Cruz…revved up members of his Middle Tennessee base with a preacher’s energy Monday afternoon during a talk that drew about 1,600 sign-toting, button-wearing supporters to The Factory at Franklin…It was one of four stops that Cruz was set to make throughout the state.” [Watch Fox: Chief Political Correspondent Campaign Carl Cameron has the latest on the road from Ted Cruz’s Southern state bus tour.] Perry peoples’ pay plight - WaPo: “[Perry]…has stopped paying his staff at the national headquarters in Austin as well as in the early caucus and primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, according to a Republican familiar with the Perry campaign. [Former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas] campaign manager Jeff Miller told staff last Friday, the day after the first Republican presidential debate, that they would no longer be paid and are free to look for other jobs -- and, so far at least, most aides have stuck with Perry -- according to this Republican.” [Pro-Perry Opportunity and Freedom PAC tweeted out, “We’ve got plenty of money...The super PAC is not going to let Rick Perry down.”] CLUB FOR GROWTH PICKS FAVE FIVE WSJ: “The five candidates for which the Club will officially bundle campaign contributions are: Sens.

The pilot, 19 year old Tice Ledbetter, apparently was able to land the drone without damaging it.

"Buzz Cut: • It’s a bling thing: Trump and Hillary two of a kind • Hillary courts union bosses, but base loves Bernie • Walker raids Jeb’s home turf • Take Five: Keystone State rock solid • So, about situational ethics, honey…","1613","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/30/its-bling-thing-trump-and-hillary-two-kind.html"
"IT’S A BLING THING: TRUMP AND HILLARY TWO OF A KIND They’re both mega-rich New Yorkers with famous hairdos and big baggage, but Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have much more in common than that. They are both clear frontrunners for the political parties’ presidential nominations who are in the dumps with the general electorate. A new national poll from Quinnipiac University says that Clinton’s lead among Democrats is smaller than in the spring, but she still trounces her closest competitor, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., by a stout 38 points. Her biggest worry for the primary run is the sudden bump in backing for Vice President Joe Biden, who is weighing a late-summer launch. But compared to Trump’s perilous perch, Clinton is as solid as the octopus carpaccio at the 21 Club. The Republican frontrunner continues to gobble up vote share from every candidate other than establishment fave Jeb Bush, who held steady from May with 10 percent, and Scott Walker, who actually managed to gain 3 points amid the Trumptation of the GOP to 13 percent and second place. The only other significant gain was Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who muscled his way into the pack at 5 percent. And a closer look at Trump’s support tells us why his 7 point lead is so flimsy. While he is tops among self-described “very conservative” respondents, he is also number one with self-described “somewhat conservative” voters as well as moderates and liberals. The good news for Trump is that he draws support from multiple channels, as opposed to a candidate like Walker who lags with liberals and moderates. Trump even draws responses from potential voters who otherwise wouldn’t take part in a GOP primary poll. Quinnipiac doesn’t say if the ideological proportions shifted post-Trump, so we don’t know how much his arrival has changed the composition of the electorate The favorites among moderates and liberals prior to Trump’s name being added to the list were Marco Rubio and Chris Christie, who are now specks in the rearview mirror of Trump’s limo. So, some of Trump’s support among the middling-minded is no doubt at the expense of others. But – and this is just a guess – Trump’s fame and bombast is bringing in people who normally wouldn’t vote in a Republican primary or identify themselves as primary voters to a telephone pollster. And history tells us that such voters are an unreliable bet come Election Day. Clinton’s primary support, by comparison, is anything but unsettled. It’s downright stodgy. Democrats are coming to terms with Clinton, and she shows no signs of bringing new voters into the process. That’s bad in many ways, but good for predictable primary polling. But those same polls tell us something very dangerous for Clinton: voters neither like nor trust her. And that’s where she and Trump go together like Cristal and a Hamptons clambake. She is seen by voters as neither honest nor trustworthy by 57 percent of voters while Trump cards an equally abysmal 56 percent.","1614","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/30/its-bling-thing-trump-and-hillary-two-kind.html"
"By way of further comparison, Clinton trails Biden on honesty and trustworthiness among all voters by 21 points and by 11 points among Democrats. Woof. Clinton’s unfavorability rating is only 8 points better than Trump’s 59 percent, but she does have stronger core support, which explains why the poll shows her beating him badly – 12 points – in a hypothetical general election matchup. But, for the aforementioned reasons, Trump isn’t going to the big dance. So how does Clinton do against the contenders? She’s essentially tied with both Bush and Walker. That’s a particularly bad sign as it relates to Walker, given how much better known she is than the Wisconsin governor. And here’s the kicker for Clinton: Biden does as well against Walker and Bush as Clinton. When Sheriff Joe sees those numbers, he might decide to saddle up after all. HILLARY COURTS UNION BOSSES, BUT BASE LOVES BERNIE Hillary Clinton is in suburban Washington today to seek the backing of labor unions at the AFL-CIO’s executive council meeting. An easy get for the Democratic frontrunner, right? Maybe not. Union chieftains, some already leery of Clinton’s Wall Street ties, face the fact that her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to wow the party base and has strong appeal among workers. Hillary gets an hour to address the union bosses who, represent 12.5 million workers, as did Sanders Wednesday. Then leaders will debate their endorsement privately, with a two-thirds majority needed to carry the day.

The Journal reports that the bank also lent $32 million through entrepreneurship and inner-city loan programs it launched in association with the foundation, while paying former President Bill Clinton $1.5 million to participate in a series of corporate question-and-answer sessions with UBS Chief Executive Bob McCann.” Hillary handler turns in some emails - Politico: “Long-time Hillary Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines handed the State Department 20 boxes of work-related emails taken in part from a personal email account, State officials said Wednesday, calling into question the extent to which top aides to the former secretary of state also engaged in controversial email practices. State Department top document official John Hackett, who heads Freedom of Information Act requests for the agency, told a federal judge in a court hearing…Reines sent over the document boxes with a cover letter, suggesting they contained a hodgepodge of work related items also mixed with personal messages.” The Judge’s Ruling: Getaway plan gone awry - Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano brings down his gavel on Hillary Clinton’s claim she did not send or receive classified data using her personal email account to task. “Why did she lie about all this? Because she thinks she can get away with it.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Unlike other relics of past times, language does not leave a fossil or trace of existence. It cannot be analyzed and studied, and as a result is often times forgotten. Time tells the story of a 1930s linguist on a quest to document languages of Native American tribes in Louisiana. The Chitimacha fascinated researchers since only two native speakers, Benjamin Paul and Delphine Ducloux, revitalized the language. Upon their death, the tribe made it a mission to teach the language and spread it throughout their tribe. Today, the Chitimacha language is taught and spoken in school so children can all be fluent in their ancient tongue. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Rubio readies delegate strategy for long fight - David Drucker takes a look at Rubio’s delegate strategy to mount a late-game comeback: “The Florida senator’s growing empire of state campaign chairmen and designated grassroots supporters stretches from Maine to Alaska, and is populated in between with volunteer teams in Connecticut, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont and Wyoming. Victory in those states could win Rubio roughly 300 delegates of the approximately 1,200 he needs to be crowned the GOP presidential nominee next July.” [e.g. - Star Tribune: “Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson endorsed Marco Rubio for president on Wednesday and will be Minnesota state chairman for the Florida senator's presidential campaign.”] Cruz stands by Obama terror charge - Sen.

Scott gave Ellrich the choice of whether to issue her father, the driver, a warning or a speeding ticket. And Ellrich was on the trooper’s side; she said ticket.

"HILLARY DRAWS RED LINE FOR REPORTERS Hillary Clinton can now say that she has been asked questions by a national reporter, but she sure can’t say that she’s answered them. In her first national interview since her April campaign launch, the Democratic frontrunner didn’t exactly get murder-boarded. But even the limited inquiries aimed her way by CNN were waved away. Perhaps the richest moment in the interview came when Clinton was asked about allegations of payola during her tenure as secretary of state. Clinton’s response? She’s not going to talk about that. Oh. Well in that case, let’s do talk about John Podesta’s footwear. The interviewer here should have at least made Clinton reiterate her lengthy no comment and perhaps have declined to proceed to any topic unless Clinton answered. The closest thing one could discern to a theme from Clinton – other than her grim insistence about how much fun, fun, fun she is having – was that questions about her secret email server in office, destroyed emails, previously undisclosed overseas donations and other ethical problems were strictly the province of kooks and crackpots. This is an approach that politicians, including Clinton, have long pursued but that has come to the fullest flower in the Obama era. Part of the purpose is to denigrate the stories for the news-consuming public. But the larger purpose is to make sure reporters stay away from these topics. And asking about them will be the brand of an enemy combatant. It’s not just that a particular line of questioning or an angle is inappropriate or unfair, but that entire topics, including the most important one in her campaign, are verboten. It was a short fall for Clinton from the candidate who wanted Americans to get out of their “partisan bunkers” and get into a “purple space” to the candidate who is rallying Democrats to shout down questions and relying on bunker-mentality partisanship to bring her the presidency. It is not a coincidence that Clinton is rolling out a new economic plan next week. Feeling pressure from her left and, as this interview demonstrates, embracing a divisive and galvanizing partisan strategy Clinton is running headlong into full-blown Obamism. And that’s a very risk bet in a country in which voters are eager for change. [Scooby got an upgrade - Republican group America Rising got video of Clinton getting aboard a private jet in Iowa.] Whiteness problematic - Clinton’s team yanked a tweet on Tuesday of the candidate shaking hands with a young man with prosthetic legs. The caption read in part, “I think we are a nation that really believes in a helping hand.” All good, right? …until users zoomed in on the tattoo which read “WHITE.” [On a trip to Ireland last week, House Speaker John Boehner says he was mistaken for former President Bill Clinton. Not sure who should be offended here.] Bernie plots Mass revolt - Boston Herald: “Bernie Sanders is planning a major offensive in one of Hillary Clinton’s favorite haunts — Massachusetts — in a bold move to shock his rival in a potentially crucial faceoff, a top Sanders strategist told the Herald. ‘I think Massachusetts could be a really pivotal, important battleground this year,’ Sanders campaign senior adviser Tad Devine said in an interview. ‘We’re going to try to put together a real organization there.’ A Sanders upset in the Massachusetts primary, scheduled for March 1, would be a major blow to Clinton, whose support is so strong here that the late Ted Kennedy dubbed it “Clinton Country” during Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign….The state also could have added juice because of home state U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a liberal darling whose decision to take a pass on 2016 helped Sanders gain a foothold. Warren has so far kept her distance from Clinton, even heaping praise on Sanders last weekend.” Power Play: Bernie and Joe - Do the crowds and the flood of ink on Sanders mean he’s a serious challenge to Hillary Clinton or does it portend other developments in the Democrats 2016 field? Chris Stirewalt surveys the Sanders scene, in just 60 seconds. WATCH HERE.

The Greeks’ neighbors to the north in Macedonia are being supportive on fiscal questions, but certainly not about Alexander the Great. The LAT looked at the still-intense debate over which country can claim the man who more than 300 years before the birth of Jesus briefly ruled an empire that stretched from the Himalayas in the east to the borders of modern-day Romania and Libya in the west. Despite being the son of Philip of Macedon and being born in the Macedonian capitol of Pella, Greeks claim Alexander as their own on the grounds that that was actually a Greek province which was invaded by Macedonians. The article quotes a Greek governmental official saying, “Aristotle taught Alexander the Great, and they were both Greek. They would shiver in their graves today at the idea that [Slavs] who migrated to the vicinity of their region seven centuries after them, belonging to a completely different civilization, would try to change history in order to give allure to their own culture.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Rick Perry fired back at Donald Trump today in a video response. Trump has made himself the target of many GOP candidates for his comments about illegal immigrants from Mexico. Presidential candidates like Perry sent tweets and made public statements declaring their disagreement with Trump, who then took to Twitter swiping back at each candidate by name. For Perry, Trump said in part, “He needs a new pair of glasses to see the crimes committed by illegal immigrants.” Perry, speaking directly to “Donald,” touts his 14-year record of dealing with immigration issues as Texas governor and defends Mexican Americans who have fought in conflicts from “the Alamo to Afghanistan.” Perry says, “Your remarks might make for good reality TV, but they are out of touch with reality.” [Watch Fox: Perry appears on ""The Real Story"" in the 2 p.m. ET hour.] JEB, HILLARY SPAR ON IMMIGRATION On the heels of Hillary Clinton’s first sit-down interview Tuesday, the Bush campaign wasted no time hitting back. The two frontrunners in their party nominations have each taken to calling each other out by name, making this feel a lot like July 2016 instead of July 2015. In her CNN interview, Clinton claimed Bush didn’t support a pathway to citizenship, and called Republicans hostile towards immigrants. Spokesperson for former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., hit back in a statement to the Tampa Bay Times writing, “Hillary Clinton will say anything to get elected and her numerous flip-flops on immigration prove it,” also adding Bush, “believes in a conservative legislative solution to fix our broken immigration system that includes earned legal status for those currently in the country after they pay fines and taxes, learn English, and commit no substantial crimes while securing our border.” Roll tape - A web video posted featuring former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., attacks Hillary Clinton for her lack of action as a U.S. senator. He says that she was in the Senate eight years and only sponsored 3 bills that became law. Meanwhile, he says he knows how to take action. Watch the video here. [Bush holds an evening town hall in Hudson, N.H.] BIG WIN FOR WALKER BACK HOME Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “With just a few minutes to midnight, Senate Republicans passed the two-year $72.7 billion state budget Tuesday after voting to repeal salary minimums for workers on local government projects but abandon proposals that would have gutted the state’s open records law…It now goes to the Assembly, which will take up the budget Wednesday, just days ahead of Walker's presidential campaign announcement scheduled for Monday in Waukesha.” [WaPo’s Dan Balz visited Madison to chat with the members of Walker’s team on their strategy.] Rubio stresses high ed changes, tax cuts, immigration reform in economic plan - Miami Herald: “[Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.] also advocated for his tax plan — which would cut the corporate-tax rate to 25 percent but has been slammed by some conservatives as doing little to spur the economy — and for rewriting immigration laws to give priority to workers needed in the economy rather than to family reunification.” [Rubio has four events in Iowa today capped by a summer gathering hosted by State Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Iowa.] A Timesman today - While Rubio continues his feud with the NYT over coverage, he did give the paper an op-ed on the Obama administration’s decision to open an embassy in Havana. The junior senator from Florida was not impressed. “No Communist police state has ever unclenched its fist just because a McDonald’s has opened or an embassy has been established,” he said. Carly gets a hand in Nevada - The Las Vegas Sun reports, that former state Senator Sue Lowden will run Fiorina’s Nevada campaign operations, including a fundraiser next week. Lowden is best known for running the Republican primary for senate in 2010 where she would have faced Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., but lost to Sharron Angle. No third party for the Donald… probably - WashEx’s Byron York talked with Donald Trump on whether he might run as a third party candidate. He hasn’t. As Trump told York, “My sole focus is to run as a Republican…because of the fact that I believe that is the best way we can defeat the Democrats.” Kasich talks Iran - Sitting center seat last night, Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, talked about the Iran deal and why he thinks this administration’s tactics could have bad outcomes. “I feel that it’s very dangerous to fall in love with your own idea. And I think the administration has probably fallen in love with the fact that they want to get an agreement, and when people are hyperventilating and unable to get one, sometimes they go and they sign something that they shouldn’t.” Watch the segment from “Special Report with Bret Baier” here. [Kasich campaigns in the South Carolina coastal communities of Hilton Head Island and Bluffton today.] WINNER IN PRIMARY FOR SCHOCK SEAT AP: “State Sen.

LaHood heads into the Sept. 10 special general election heavily favored to succeed Schock after defeating anti-establishment conservative writer Michael Flynn.” SHE DOESN’T GET IT FROM HER MOTHER WAFF: “A vehicle crashed into a Huntsville [Ala.] driver’s license office Tuesday. According to troopers at the office on Church Street, a teenager had just finished taking a road test on the vehicle with no apparent issues.

"DOCILE DEMOCRATS DARE NOT MENTION HILLARY’S GREATEST WEAKNESS There’s at least one thing Democrats can agree on when it comes to foreign policy: They don’t want to talk about it. And that, right now, is the very best news for their presumptive nominee. In his speech on Memorial Day, President Obama remarked that this was the first “in 14 years that the United States is not engaged in a major ground war” because he had ended “combat operations” in Afghanistan. It would be a more significant milestone if the U.S. didn’t have thousands of troops in Iraq, the ongoing air war in Iraq and Syria, the U.S. involvement in the Yemeni civil war… oh yeah, and the nearly 10,000 troops still in Afghanistan. So, some minor ground wars, a couple of medium-sized air campaigns, a few drones – just as long as they are not called “combat operations.” If you take this logic to its absurd conclusion, no Americans have died in a war in 70 years because Congress hasn’t declared any wars in that time. But political semantics make no real difference for those who were killed in a “police action,” a “peacekeeping mission” or “combat operations.” The president has been trying hard to “turn the page” because he maintains that the “tide of war” has been “receding” for the past five years. This is to match his vision of a closing act to his presidency focused on increasing domestic spending and taxes on top earners. But the world is not obliging the president. Obama’s plan for containing ISIS and empowering Shi’a Iran as a counterbalance to Sunni dominance in the Middle East was predicated on the idea that Americans would tolerate Iraq existing in the same post-nation-state chaos that has consumed Somalia and Yemen. But the threat ISIS poses is different, as is the attachment Americans feel to a place where thousands of their countrymen died fighting. We read a damning indictment of the administration’s war plan against ISIS today in the NYT. The rules of engagement designed to prevent civilian casualties are also preventing ISIS casualties and leaving the jihadi army thereby able to endure, regroup and then get back to flushing U.S.-backed Iraqi forces. It seems all but certain that the war will still be very much on when voters start heading to the polls in February. Given the trend of the past nine-months, there’s plenty of reason to think that the theater of war will have expanded with more intense fighting, inch by inch and bomb by bomb. Hillary Clinton has had some disagreements with her former boss on foreign policy, but unfortunately for her they are not of the useful kind. The most notable is that she urged Obama to attack the Syrian government and arm rebel groups and then blamed Obama for the rise of ISIS because he refused to intervene earlier. A Democrat who sounds like Lindsey Graham is not what the party’s base has been hankering for. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., will have his official campaign kickoff in his hometown of Burlington today. He can be expected to talk about income inequality and other domestic issues that currently animate the party. But on those fronts, Clinton has already shown a gymnastic skill for taking new positions. She and her party only currently disagree on the rate, volume and means of redistribution. What Sanders is unlikely to mention is the way in which he and his fellow liberals find Obama’s foreign policy distasteful and Clinton’s even more so. Clinton’s Libya misadventure – from which we have now learned that her inner circle was seeking to personally profit – is the encapsulation of the liberal complaint about U.S. foreign policy. It was unauthorized, unaccountable and produced a worse outcome than the status quo. And yet… crickets. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley is expected to make the jump later this week. Here’s the way to tell whether he’s serious or not. If O’Malley quibbles on trade policy and velocity of redistribution he’s running for a cabinet seat. If he hits Clinton on her greatest weakness, he might be in it for real.

The Wisconsin governor put the hammer down in a speech at Oklahoma’s Southern Republican Leadership Conference touting his record of successful duels with powerful unions and blue-state Democrats. The speech, which Tim Carney called “spot-on and well delivered,” helped Walker to a strong second-place finish in the event’s straw poll. Rubio, who is fundraising in Florida today for influential Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, had to pass up the SRLC confab for votes in Washington. Ohio’s John Kasich moves up, passing Mike Huckabee, who had an uneven week. Kasich delivered a strong Sunday show appearance pushing his “deep experience” as chief executive running a big state and as a former leader in Congress.

Instead of standing with our ally, the president is making bad deals with a country that wishes to wipe Israel off the map,” Walker writes. Rubio looks to lock up Palmetto State - National Journal looks at Sen. Marco Rubio’s stranglehold strategy in South Carolina. “Rubio… quickly identified South Carolina as the home base for his eventual presidential effort….snatching up the state's top talent for his political operation, cultivating personal relationships with influential people on the ground, and making repeated trips to keep tabs on his burgeoning circuit of supporters in the state. As a result, Rubio has quietly achieved something in South Carolina that no Republican candidate can claim in Iowa or New Hampshire: an organizational lock on one of the most important states en route to the GOP nomination.” Paul wants room for ponytails and tattoos - “I talk about a lot of issues I think would make the Republican Party bigger.

SENATOR MARRIES STAFFER HE DENIED DATING, WILL REMAIN ON GOVERNMENT PAYROLL (Jackson, Miss.) Clarion-Ledger: “U.S. Senator Thad Cochran married his longtime aide Kay Webber in a private family ceremony in Gulfport on Saturday, according to a one-sentence statement released by his office Monday. Cochran's relationship with Webber became the topic of much speculation and intrigue during last year's Republican U.S. Senate primary. Supporters of challenger Chris McDaniel accused Cochran of carrying on an affair with Webber. Cochran's office denied any kind of affair. … Senate and campaign staff defended the relationship between Cochran and Webber during last year's campaign in light of news detailing travel overseas and back to the district that included Cochran and Webber. A campaign spokesperson at the time said Webber ‘is a member of the staff and a trusted aide, and any other suggestion is silly gossip.’ Cochran spokesman Chris Gallegos said Monday that Webber would remain on the senator's staff.” McCain draws Dem opponent - Roll Call: “Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz., will challenge GOP Sen. John McCain for Senate, according to a source with knowledge of Kirkpatrick’s plans, giving Democrats a top recruit in a potential pick-up opportunity in 2016…Her bid also opens up Arizona’s 1st District, a GOP-leaning seat that 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney captured by a 3-point margin in 2012…In the Senate contest, McCain, 78, is the heavy front-runner in his quest for a sixth term. But he faces a potentially strong challenge from the right flank of his party that could imperil his re-election bid.” PUTTIN’ SOME PHALLUS BY THE PALACE Turkmenistan strongman Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov unveiled a gold statue of himself astride a horse in Turkmenistan’s capitol city of Ashgabat, ahem, thrusting 69 feet above the city.

"This is, well, standard operating procedure. Both sides spend a fortune conducting polls and focus groups and honing messages that will be most effective in tearing down the opposition candidate. Hillary’s campaign will do it, and so will the liberal PACs that are supporting her.","1633","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/14/vilifying-hillary-clinton-new-york-times-wary-conservative-oppo-research.html"
"What’s more, the Times knows full well that the liberals do the same thing: “Republicans are acutely aware that early attacks labeling Mitt Romney as elitist were impossible for him to shake in 2012, and they view these next several months as critical in laying the groundwork to taint, and ultimately defeat, Mrs. Clinton.”","1634","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/14/vilifying-hillary-clinton-new-york-times-wary-conservative-oppo-research.html"
"And who did those early attacks on Mitt come from? President Obama’s campaign and the Democratic establishment. You might even say they were vilifying him.

"So let’s fire up the Google machine and see how the Times handled it when Priorities USA went after Mitt. Here’s a piece that said the group was “highlighting a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and suggesting that Mitt Romney’s plans would raise taxes on the middle class while cutting them for the wealthy.” Here’s another one on how the Priorities commercials —“including the ‘coffin ad,’ featuring workers laid off from a plant acquired by Bain Capital, Mr. Romney’s former firm — helped define Mr. Romney early in the campaign.” See? Romney wasn’t vilified by a liberal PAC, he was “defined.” The Times says American Crossroads found, for example, that Hillary’s comment about she and her husband having been “dead broke” when they left the White House did not play well in the focus group. But most pundits could have told you it was damaging the moment she said it during last year’s book tour.","1636","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/14/vilifying-hillary-clinton-new-york-times-wary-conservative-oppo-research.html"
"The story did spotlight an interesting note: “One problem in developing negative messages about Mrs. Clinton, Republican strategists have found, is that she and her husband have survived so many controversies by dismissing them as partisan attacks. So the Republican organizations are seeking to develop lines of attack that resonate more deeply or raise unsettling questions about Mrs. Clinton’s character.”","1637","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/14/vilifying-hillary-clinton-new-york-times-wary-conservative-oppo-research.html"
"Meanwhile, Time magazine has a glowing cover story on Elizabeth Warren, touting her liberal agenda and the way she’s moving the Democratic Party to the left. There is nary a critical sentence about the Massachusetts senator. Why put her on the cover when she’s not running for president and hasn’t done anything particularly new? Why not Bernie Sanders, who is running for president and has embraced essentially the same populist, break-up-the-banks agenda? Probably because Elizabeth as the cover girl sells more copies. Time recently included Warren on its 100 Most Influential People list. And who wrote the accompanying piece on how she “never lets us forget that the work of taming Wall Street’s irresponsible risk taking and reforming our financial system is far from finished”? Hillary Clinton.","1638","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/14/vilifying-hillary-clinton-new-york-times-wary-conservative-oppo-research.html"

"Buzz Cut: • 2016 GOP Power Index: Fiorina still rising, Paul survives • Jeb heads where Bush foreign policy is an asset • Hillary’s sins of omission • Power Play: NRSC, DSCC spox spar • Sleeping bull","1643","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/08/2016-gop-power-index-fiorina-still-rising-paul-survives.html"
"2016 GOP POWER INDEX: FIORINA STILL RISING, PAUL SURVIVES 1) Jeb Bush; 2) Scott Walker; 3) Marco Rubio; 4) Carly Fiorina [+1]; 5) Ted Cruz [-1]; 6) Rand Paul [+1]; John Kasich [-1]; 8) Ben Carson; 9) Mike Huckabee; 10) Rick Perry [previously unranked] Scott Walker is right: Jeb Bush is still the frontrunner despite Walker’s increasing strength in national and early state polls. Bush’s expected financial advantages and name identification are enough to keep him in the top slot, but as he prepares to make his official announcement his grasp is getting more tenuous. The big weekend in Iowa reinforced the trend: Bush in his family clique and Walker the leader of the rest of the pack. And despite some dim polling news, Marco Rubio is still pretty clearly ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of his ability to make a broad appeal across party divisions But Rubio ought to keep his eye on Carly Fiorina, who is building up some momentum. Despite starting from flat-line name identification, Fiorina has consistently impressed on the stump and recently returned from what is said to have been a successful West Coast fundraising swing. Fiorina still lags in the horse race, but if she keeps doing what she has done in early states, Rubio will have to start thinking about her as a threat. While she still struggles to be seen as a top-of-the-ticket choice rather than a running mate, she is gaining an influential following. Rand Paul is the other gainer this week, snapping back after his domestic surveillance brinksmanship. The very best news for Paul after his Senate high-wire act last week was that nothing happened – no attacks, no lengthy interruptions of surveillance capacity, etc. Having proved to his base that he’s still their man, Paul can get back to an effort to broaden his appeal.

Send your thoughts to FOXNEWSFIRST@FOXNEWS.COM Fiorina wows crowd, stays for retail - Des Moines Register: “Unlike six other candidates at Saturday's event, the former software CEO [Carly Fiorina] waited until after her 10-minute speech to mingle with the audience. An enthusiastic group met her moments after she stepped off stage and snapped photos in front of a trailer stacked with hay bales.” [Fiorina begins a four-day swing through New Hampshire with a fundraiser in Londonderry, N.H.] Rubio makes JFK comparison explicit - National Journal: “But it was a new line he began road-testing in Iowa that stood out. Rubio presented the 2016 campaign as a generational pivot point, likening his vision for a ""New American Century""—the tagline of his campaign—to Kennedy's 1960 challenge to the nation to embrace a ‘New Frontier.’” Cruz, Santorum take a pass - Rather than compete with Walker and other top-tier candidates for attention, two candidates with big Iowa aspirations stayed away from Ernst’s event. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was campaigning in North Carolina and 2012 Iowa winner former Sen. Rick Santorum was in Texas.

This week, he will take a whirlwind spin through the capitals of Germany, Poland and Estonia before officially kicking off his White House bid on June 15. Bush faces an additional, unique test — differentiating his views from the foreign policies of his father, President George H.W. Bush, and his brother, President George W. Bush.” [After going over the border to attend mass in New Hampshire Sunday, Bush is in Maine today for his mother, Barbara Bush’s 90th birthday gala.] “Moving Soviet Union to its dissolution so fast without a shot being fired was not as easy as it looked. And solving the budget problem the way he did was not as easy as it looked. I think it was an extraordinary presidency by a man willing to spend all of his political capital for the sake of the country.” – Former Gov. John Sununu, R-N.H. on “Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace” discussing his time as President George H.W. Bush’s chief of staff. Watch here. Walker doesn’t rule out troops in Iraq - Bloomberg: “Probable Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker says he wouldn’t rule out a full-scale American re-invasion of Iraq ‘if the national interests of this country are at stake.’ Appearing on ABC’s This Week on Sunday, the Wisconsin governor initially demurred when interviewer Jonathan Karl asked if he'd rule out a ‘full-blown U.S. re-invasion of Iraq and Syria…I don’t think we should ever send a message to our foes as to how far we’re willing to go,’ Walker said. He doesn’t think it's necessary to send U.S. troops now, he said, but he ‘would not rule out boots on the ground.’” “It’s interesting for the president, who called ISIS the ‘JV squad’ and Yemen a ‘success story,’ should tell someone to bone up on foreign policy.” – Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., to ABC News. Perry keeps military front and center - After a quick stop in New Hampshire Sunday, former Texas Gov. Rick Perryheads to South Carolina today for a tour of the South Carolina military museum. Later he has a town meeting at the U.S.S. Yorktown in Mount Pleasant, S.C. Perry is accompanied by Afghan war hero Marcus Luttrell. Graham lets it rip - Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was pole-axing conservative sacred cows at every turn in an appearance on CNN Sunday. His base bucklers included openness to raising taxes and a call to action on what he says is man-made climate change. But Graham had special enthusiasm for Caitlyn Jenner saying that he couldn’t, “walk in her shoes,” but wishes her well. “If Caitlyn Jenner wants to be safe and have a prosperous economy, vote for me. I’m into addition… I can only imagine the torment that Bruce Jenner went through…I hope she has found peace. I’m a pro-life, traditional marriage kind of guy, but I’m running to be president of the United States. If Caitlyn Jenner wants to be a Republican, she is welcome in my party.” – Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on CNN. [Graham heads home to South Carolina today to speak at the Upstate Chamber Coalition Presidential Series.] Christie’s bridge headache not over yet - NYT: “The players at the center of the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal are not finished causing headaches for Gov. Chris Christie. The latest indication comes in a sworn statement by David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official and the admitted mastermind of the access-lane closings, that describes Mr. Christie breaking the law as he exercised a heavy hand over state politics from the front office…His statement says he has emails and further ‘documents to be produced for inspection.’” [Christie holds a Town Hall meeting in Goffstown, N.H.] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Being online can feel like falling down a rabbit hole, right? Wrong. The New Yorker takes a look at the origin of rabbit hole and how it has developed from its original meaning into something different entirely. Rabbit hole as Lewis Carroll described in “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” meant to fall into a new world or reality. Today, most people use the term as a synonym for a lengthy-distraction like a Netflix binge, or internet search that goes on for hours. There are some modern day versions of Alice’s journey into the rabbit hole, think Twitter, or Reddit, places that take us from our reality into another until we no longer remember how we got there.

Nah. The Journal reports,“[w]ith the Affordable Care Act in place, Mrs. Clinton isn’t expected to focus on health care, once a signature issue. Nor is she planning a big speech on K-12 education, where her teacher union supporters are at odds with other Democrats who want to increase teacher accountability. Advisers say she also won’t focus on foreign policy in the coming months, perhaps devoting one speech to the subject…” “If you run a campaign trying to appeal to 60 to 70 percent of the electorate, you’re not going to run a very compelling campaign for the voters you need.”- Former Obama campaign strategist David Plouffe to NYT on Hillary’s campaign strategy. More questions from the foundation - The Clinton Family Foundation, a smaller, charitable entity separate from the Clinton Global Initiative, donated $100,000 to a New York Times charitable fund in 2008, the same year the paper endorsed Hillary Clinton, according to documents obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. The endorsement surprised many due to reports the paper was leaning towards backing then-Sen. Barack Obama. What’s that? - Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich said Sunday that his former boss President Bill Clinton “has to stop the paid speeches” and start disclosing everything. “She has got to, and her husband as well, got to just put everything out, Reich told ABC News. “I mean more disclosure than any other candidate.” [Fewer CEOs at CGI - The Clinton Global Initiative America conference, hosted Bill Clinton and Chelsea Clinton, kicks off today in Denver. While organizers say that “controversies about the propriety and reporting of foreign government donations to the Clinton Foundation aren’t having an impact…there are fewer high-profile corporate faces on the conference panels,” Bloomberg reports.] Hillary fails to win majority, Sanders close second in Wisconsin Dem straw poll - San Francisco Sun Times: “Hillary Clinton may have won the Wisconsin straw poll over the weekend, but her margin of victory was much closer than her lead in any of the national polls. At the Wisconsin Democratic Party convention on Saturday, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had an impressive second place showing, finishing with 41 percent of the votes. Clinton won with 49 percent, but failed to get the majority. Out of the 511 delegate votes, Clinton received 252, while Sanders had 208.” Nader says Hillary a hawk to compensate for gender - Repeat presidential candidate and Corvair foe Ralph Nader told PJMedia in an interview that he believed Clinton had become a militarist because of her gender: “Instead of taking the tradition of women of peace, and turning into a muscular waging of peace of conflict and prevention, she [Clinton] did the reverse…” [Clinton has a fundraiser in Bethesda, Maryland today at the home of at the home of Susan Ness.

According to WSB-TV, the townspeople used a backhoe to dig a bigger hole so the bull could safely walk out. While the humans were pleased with their rescue efforts, the bull was not impressed. The 1,500 pound animal named Boy turned out to have been asleep the entire time. When the crew had finished the animal took his sweet time coming to and getting out of his predicament.

"PANDER BEAR: HILLARY GETS PRESS PASS ON FLIP FLOPS If a candidate reverses a long-held position is it a “flip-flop” or someone who is “not afraid to run as her own woman?” That seems to depend on who’s doing the flopping. In the three weeks since the official launch of her second presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton, has been moving left in a hurry. In response to riots in Baltimore, the presumptive Democratic nominee came forward to disown tough-on-drugs policies she had previously touted. While conditions have certainly changed since the end of the crack wars those policies were enacted to stop, so too have the politics. In 2008, Clinton was upended by a little-known African-American candidate. And since then, the issue of those Clinton-era drug laws has become enormous for black Democrats. It’s the same story for the trade policies that Clinton three years ago called “the gold standard” but today, with a wary eye on her left flank, says are worrisome. When a politician suddenly reverses themselves to a more politically advantageous position we call it “flip-flopping” or “caving” or even “pandering.” When Mitt Romney reversed himself on abortion and global warming, he was widely seen as either bowing to pressure from his base or being morally flexible in pursuit of power. There was not so much talk about how times had changed. Quite the opposite. Other than John Kerry, who once managed to complete a full flip-flop in a single sentence – “I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.” – Democrats are given a far wider berth for policy switches. The reason perhaps is that people are more inclined to forgive politicians who change directions in ways with which they agree, and the press slants… well, you know which way the press slants. It would be hard not to see President Obama as having pandered to his base with a reversal on same-sex marriage ahead of the 2012 election. But he “evolved” on a social issue while Romney “pandered.” So will Clinton get a pass? For now, probably yes. Clinton and her husband have a decades-long track record of ideological flexibility and a penchant for political expediency. And so long as she is moving leftward, her party and the press will mostly cheer. Gender plays a role here, too. Commentators who see Clinton repudiating the policies of her husband and the current Democratic president see something of the feminist mystique – a woman unencumbered by the men who previously controlled her. She is now free to be herself. And if that happens to coincide with what the pollsters and the focus groups say, well, you can’t blame a gal for being lucky… The danger for Clinton is later. Her reversals and legalese will make plenty of good fodder for Republican ads next year. The gang at America Rising is probably already making the Hillary super-cut of all super-cuts. But for now, she can be happy in the embrace of a party and press that wants to believe that she’s finally living her best (and most liberal) life. If Hillary is the Democrats’ Romney, is Bernie her Ron Paul? - John Dickerson explains why Hillary Clinton is just ducky with having Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., as a sparring partner: “When pressed about donations to the Clinton foundation, Sanders said it concerned him before quickly changing the subject to the Koch brothers and how much worse their influence is in politics. That is what Clinton allies do. If this continues to be the Vermont senator's approach, Sanders will be more of a help to Clinton's presidential chances than he will be to his own. … In 2012 Rep. Ron Paul and Mitt Romney had a symbiotic relationship in the Republican campaign. Paul elevated his own profile and gave his voters an outlet, but he never pointed out the yawning gaps between what he claimed to believe so deeply and the positions of the man who was on his way to being the party's inevitable nominee.” [Sanders will be in New Hampshire this weekend for an AFL-CIO rally in North Conway.] Gowdy: Hillary could stop email probe - USA Today: “‘If she were, under some theory, able to say, ‘yes, I can promise you under penalty of perjury you have every single document you're entitled to,’ that would probably shut off that line of inquiry,’ he told Capital Download. ‘If she can, then it will be a short conversation.’” Power Play: In Hillary we trust? - Hillary Clinton says she’s running to restore trust in government – a novel approach for a candidate ensnared in a scandal.

When threatened, they combine chemicals in an explosive chemical reaction chamber in their abdomen to simultaneously synthesize, heat and propel their defensive load as a boiling hot spray, complete with ‘gun smoke.’… ‘By having a pulsed delivery, these small beetles produce a relatively large amount of defensive spray, which they can aim precisely and with great force and speed,’ [Professor Wendy Moore] said. ‘This is truly one of the most remarkable and elegant defensive mechanisms documented to date.’” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

THIS WEEKEND [Charleston] Post and Courier: “Five Republican presidential hopefuls, including early front-runner Jeb Bush, will be in Columbia this weekend for the GOP state convention, providing the largest in-state audience of the year in the race for the White House. In addition to Bush, presidential contenders scheduled to attend all or part of the weekend events include U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas; former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania; and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. About 1,500 delegates and other attendees from around the state will take part in party events, which kick off Friday night with the party’s Silver Elephant fundraising dinner.” Jeb stands by stance on common core, immigration - WSJ: “Mr. Bush also sought to set himself apart from the rest of the Republican field by defending his support for policies largely opposed by the conservative base: the Common Core national academic standards and legal status for undocumented workers. ‘You think I’m wrong on immigration and I think you’re wrong,’ he said. ‘Maybe I’m stubborn.’ The former governor argued that economic growth will be stymied without an overhaul of immigration law. He also pointed to the political ramifications, saying that President Barack Obama flogs Republican immigration hardliners to push Hispanic voters away from the GOP...On Common Core, Mr. Bush said instituting high standards and measuring whether children are meeting them is the best way to improve student achievement and compete in the global economy.”","1686","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/pander-bear-hillary-gets-press-pass-on-flip-flops.html"

WashEx’s David Drucker and National Journal’s Josh Kraushaar join Chris Stirewalt to discuss the risks and potential rewards of the tactic. WATCH HERE. Jeb nabs Rubio’s former campaign manager - Politico: “Marco Rubio’s longtime friend and 2010 Senate campaign manager is about to be hired as a Hispanic-outreach adviser for the senator’s likely Republican 2016 rival, Jeb Bush, sources familiar with the decision tell POLITICO. Jose Mallea’s hiring by Bush’s Right to Rise political committee is a one-two punch for the former governor: It underscores the depth of loyalty Florida Republicans have for Bush and it shows his intense interest in turning out the Latino vote.” Graham hits Rubio on Iran deal - WaPo: “The presidential hopeful is at the center of a standoff over a carefully crafted Iran bill, as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) used a procedural tactic Thursday to try to force up-or-down votes on amendments that he and Rubio have been pushing…That didn't sit well with senators trying to shepherd the bill to passage without alterations that could derail it. ""I think that's probably made it harder to get more amendments because we can't move forward,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a potential presidential candidate. Graham said that while he agreed with the substance of the Rubio's amendment - requiring Iran to acknowledge Israel’s ‘right to exist’ -- he is not interested in changes that could cause the agreement, which took weeks of wrangling from both parties, to fall apart...Rubio, as he has been running for president, has sought to portray himself as a staunch national security hawk. His alliance with Cotton is the latest sign that he is determined not to get outflanked by his opposition.” Christian book’s sales soar after Walker mention - Religion News Service: “Standing before more than 1,000 people at the Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition, the Wisconsin governor used part of his time to read from ‘Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence,’ a Christian devotional written in the first-person voice of Jesus by missionary-turned-author Sarah Young...According to reports, the crowd was ‘rapt.’ In the days after [Walker’s] talk, the book shot to the top of a couple of online retailers’ best-seller lists, including Amazon. Not that the book needed Walker’s help…‘Christian publishing has had a massive hit on its hands ever since ‘Jesus Calling’ was published in 2004’ [said recent religion reviews editor Marcia Nelson].” Huckabee sets serious tone announcement video - Former Gov. Mike Huckabee’s new announcement video highlights his decades-long battle with the Clinton machine in Arkansas. The dramatic depiction of populist issues show black and white images, while also highlighting Huckabee’s folksy charm. When talking of his leadership skills Huckabee says, “…any drunken redneck can walk into a bar and start a fight. A leader only starts a fight that he’s prepared to finish.” Huckabee is expected to make his officially announcement May 5. Fiorina PAC name poses a problem - WSJ: “Republican Carly Fiorina’s official campaign committee will be called Carly for President when she launches Monday. Her super PAC is called Carly for America. Its executive director, Steve DeMaura, said the committee’s unambiguous name was picked because Carly for America would function as an auxiliary to the official campaign, not just as a mechanism to air negative TV ads. The [Federal Election Commission] bars super PACs from including the names of declared candidates in their names…[FEC spokesman Christian Hilliand] said Carly for America should expect to receive a letter from the FEC asking that it change its name shortly after Mrs. Fiorina formally launches her presidential campaign Monday.” Carson sets faith as cornerstone ahead of launch - Detroit News: “In Michigan on Monday, Carson will pray with a group of pastors at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History before officially launching his bid for the Republican presidential nomination before supporters at the Detroit Performing Arts Center. He chose to launch his campaign in his hometown, and his afternoon is booked with events across Iowa. Faith has permeated Carson’s personal, professional and now his public life.

[Kasich is in Washington today for a Christian Science Monitor breakfast then participates in the National Review Institute Ideas Summit.] BUDGET VOTE HOT SEAT FOR BLUE STATE GOP The Republican budget plan passed Thursday by the House and headed for the Senate next week opens a political dilemma for some GOP members of the upper chamber. Facing the prospect that voters in the blue states they represent might give them the boot in 2016, vulnerable Republican Senators are on the spot. Senators like Mark Kirk, R-Ill., Ron Johnson, R-Wis., Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., Rob Portman, R-Ohio and Mike Toomey, R-Pa., will weigh how the budget blueprint – which boosts defense spending, slashes social welfare programs and targets ObamaCare – will play at home. With potential challengers and Democratic opponents ready to exploit incumbent voting records, the politically charged GOP plan is just one of many tests they face over the next 17 months. For those most vulnerable (Kirk tops the list) arm-twisting by Senate leadership will likely fall flat. And while some get-out-of-jail-free passes will allow politically pinched Senators to buck the party, how many and who gets them is up to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. THE NEWS IS STILL GOOD, BUT… An item in Thursday’s Fox News First incorrectly identified the date on which Dana Perino’s book “And the Good News Is…” will crest a wave of excellence atop the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list. It will be May 10 when Jasper needs to fetch a few extra copies. THE GETAWAY PLAN WAS LACKING WNBC: “A woman flying from Los Angeles to New York after appearing on ‘Judge Judy’ has been arrested on charges she stole a crew member's iPad and a passenger's passport and bank card, the latter of which she allegedly hid in her underwear. A spokesman for Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police said Thursday that 26-year-old Melissa Perez was charged with grand larceny and possession of stolen property. Authorities say the Bronx woman was flying American Airlines to John F. Kennedy Airport Wednesday when a crew member noticed her tote pad, which contained an iPad among other items, was missing...Perez was brought in to be questioned by Port Authority officers after the flight landed, and officers found the passenger's bank card and passport in her underwear, authorities said. She also allegedly had a prescription bottle containing about 10 grams of marijuana in her possession, authorities said.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"DISLIKE FOR HILLARY INTENSIFIES Hillary Clinton’s lead in the Democratic nominating contest keeps on sliding and a new poll today from Quinnipiac University shows the trend is intensifying. Clinton’s lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is down 15 points from last month. While she might not have to worry too much about Sanders given her 23-point advantage, her 10 point slip from July seems largely attributable to increasing interest in Vice President Joe Biden, who is mulling a campaign. The best selling point for Biden backers: Clinton runs considerably worse in head-to-head matchups with potential Republican opponents than Biden. She runs 4 points ahead of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, while Biden doubles that. Even socialist Sanders beats Jeb Bush by more than Clinton. And surely by now you know the reason why. Views of Clinton have turned intensely sour in recent weeks as her ongoing email scandal has left her and her campaign in a defensive crouch. Clinton’s net favorability rating among all voters – a more valuable general election metric in the early going than horse-race numbers – is now a dreadful negative 12 points. That puts her in the same neighborhood as Rick Santorum and Martin O’Malley. Probably not the company she expected to be keeping just now. Clinton’s numbers have come to look a lot like those of her GOP counterpart, Trump. They are the best known candidates, with 92 percent of voters having formed opinions about each of them, and those opinions are not good. Fifty-four percent of voters think ill of Trump, compared to 51 percent for Clinton. Clinton’s advantage over Trump is that she faces much less resistance in her own party. Three quarters of Democrats have favorable views of Clinton – 10 points less than Biden, but still sturdy. Trump, on the other hand, is seen negatively by nearly a third of GOP voters. Only 11 percent of Democrats said they would “definitely not” back Clinton compared to 26 for Trump with the GOP. Third-place GOP candidate Bush can be happy that a quarter of his party is keeping an open mind, but the grim news is that more than twice as many respondents would never consider supporting him (18 percent) than are currently backing his candidacy (7 percent). Only 9 percent of GOP respondents are waiting to hear more about Trump before making up their minds. The poll shows continued good news for Ben Carson. He’s pulled into second place behind Trump in the race for the GOP nomination and he has the best overall favorability score of any candidate in the race. The best liked candidate among GOP primary voters, though, is Marco Rubio, viewed favorably by 72 percent of his fellow Republicans. Carson is second in the GOP with 62 percent favorability. Message: ‘I get it’ - WSJ: “Appearing before cameras after a speech in Iowa, she said she understands the concerns. “I know people have raised questions about my email use as secretary of state, and I understand why. I get it,” she said Wednesday. She went on to give a familiar explanation: her arrangement was legally permissible at the time, she’s turned over 55,000 pages of email, she has given her computer server to authorities investigating the matter and has plans to testify before a congressional committee.” [Clinton holds a campaign event in Cleveland before holding a fundraiser in the tony suburb of Bratenahl.] Biden gets personal with party officials about run - NPR: “Confirming rumors that he is seriously considering jumping into the 2016 presidential race, Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged that he is indeed weighing whether to get into the contest. But in a closed-conference call with Democratic National Committee officials, he noted that he and his family are trying to decide ‘whether or not there is the emotional fuel at this time to run.’ Biden's son Beau died of brain cancer in May. ‘If I were to announce to run,’ Biden said, ‘I have to be able to commit to all of you that I would be able to give it my whole heart and my whole soul, and right now, both are pretty well banged up. ... I've given this a lot of thought and dealing internally with the family on how we do this.’” [Donors ready to deploy - The Hill: “…A number of big donors with ties to Biden have not thrown their support to the Democratic frontrunner.”] Ouch: Hillary backer Harkin says she might give Biden a job if he doesn’t run - Former Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said that Biden shouldn’t make the leap, even suggesting that he could find work in Clinton’s administration, albeit in a diminished role: “With Hillary as president, I can see him being secretary of state or ambassador to the United Nations,” Harkin said. The Judge’s Ruling: Sweater weather - From failed operations in Libya and Syria to unsecured email on her private server, Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano asks whether Hillary Clinton has been pulling the wool over our eyes for years. “What if Clinton just doesn’t care whether she has broken any federal laws, illegally caused the deaths of thousands of innocents, and profoundly jeopardized and misled the American people? What if the American people do care about all this? What will they do about it?” Read here. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Every year at the Autumnal Equinox on Easter Island, chiefs of the native Rapu Nui tribe had a contest to see who could collect the first-laid egg on a nearby islet. The various clans within the tribe would gather at the same spot to select their representative. Contestants had to scale down a cliff and swim through rough surf and shark-infested waters in order to reach the islet. When the first person found the egg he had to bring it back intact. Why? Rough Guides explains: “The new birdman would first have all the hair shaved off his head; he would then live in strict seclusion for a whole year in a sacred house at the foot of Rano Raraku, eating only certain foods, and forbidden to bathe or cut his nails. His kin-group, meanwhile, was endowed with a special, high status, which was often taken as an excuse for members to dominate and bully their rival groups.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Trump’s top hire in Iowa got busted in emails leaked to the Des Moines Register trashing his now-boss. In messages written as recently as last month, new Trump national co-chairman, Sam Clovis, who abandoned the struggling campaign of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry this week to work for Trump, calls the New York billionaire “a cancer on conservatism” and a man with “no foundation in Christ.” Clovis said in one message that as a veteran he was “offended by a man who sought and gained four student deferments to avoid the draft and who has never served this nation a day — not a day — in any fashion or way.” Clovis copped to the nastygrams, but said he had become convinced of Trump’s merits and sincerity after he got the chance to “look [Trump] in the eye and ask him the tough questions.” Meanwhile...

"UNCOVERED AUDIO: HILLARY WAS ‘ADAMANTLY AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS’ The RNC today is shelling presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in her bunker with newly uncovered audio from a 2003 radio interview she gave as a senator. Apparently asked about the issue of illegal immigration, which was a hot button in the state at the time, Clinton swung hard: “I am, you know, adamantly against illegal immigrants.” Clinton, on the campaign trail in Nevada Wednesday, promised to push for citizenship for those in the country illegally. She also vowed to go beyond President Obama’s executive amnesty for an estimated 5 million illegal immigrants if Republicans do not acquiesce. Obama’s order has so far been blocked by federal courts. In the audio from the RNC of what the committee says is Clinton’s interview with radio host John Gambling, Clinton calls for more border security and for employers to stop hiring illegal immigrants. “Come up to Westchester, go to Suffolk and Nassau counties, stand in the street corners in Brooklyn or the Bronx,” she is heard to complain “You’re going to see loads of people waiting to get picked up to go do yard work and construction work and domestic work.” CLINTONS GET CREATIVE ON CAMPAIGN CASH: IF DISCLOSURE ‘LOOKS BAD,’ DON’T DISCLOSE If you thought that Hillary Clinton would be more bashful about buckraking given the current scandals surrounding her family finances and those of its foundation, you haven’t been paying attention. Clinton is vacuuming up money in California this week, but behind the scenes her campaign is busy blurring lines on campaign cash. First, Clinton will do what Democrats once reviled and raise cash for her super PAC. President Obama endorsed his super PAC, but stopped short of plumping for checks. (Candidates can’t legally make the ask, but they can probably stand next to the guy with his hand out – wink-wink, nudge-nudge – and swear up and down that they are not coordinating their efforts.) Second, Clinton is so far not disclosing the identities of the bundlers, the mostly wealthy partisans who collect checks from their friends for campaigns. You know – bundlers. Releasing the names is not a legal requirement, but it has been standard practice for presidential candidates of both parties. You’d think Clinton would want to be more forthcoming about where her money comes from these days. But as her husband said​, “Any kind of disclosure is a target” that it “looks bad.” So the answer to the lengthening list of questions for the candidate and her campaign is less disclosure and more blurry fundraising lines. Who made varsity this season? - A memo obtained by Bloomberg gives all the names of Clinton’s campaign A-team this time around. Not a lot of familiar faces, signaling a desire for change in this election cycle. No pictures allowed, Clinton Foundation guests gather in Morocco - ABC News: “When ABC News producers attempted to take pictures of guests arriving at the front entrance, Moroccan police threatened their arrest. The foundation’s spokesman initially professed not to know where the reception was being held, and the location was among the only not included on schedules handed out to the media and published online.” Hillary personal email use ‘not acceptable’ says State Dept. - The Hill: ""Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email account run through a private server was 'not acceptable' and happened without officials’ knowledge, a top State Department record-keeper said on Wednesday. 'I think the message is loud and clear that that is not acceptable,' Joyce Barr, the State Department’s assistant secretary for the Bureau of Administration, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee."" TRADE ROILS BOTH PARTIES AS AIR OBAMA HEADS TO NIKE As he laces up to tout his trade deal at Nike’s Oregon headquarters – an intriguing choice given the company’s sweat-shop past – President Obama’s push for fast track authority is proving to be far from a slam dunk in Congress. Indeed, with Obama pressing reluctant Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker John Boehner are trying put a buzzer beater. But opposition to the deal is stiff on both sides of the aisle and the pact is no more popular with Sixteeners of both stripes. Breaking with GOP frontrunners who support the deal, presidential candidate Mike Huckabee trash-talked the trade pact, warning that American workers could “take it up the backside” under the current proposal. “Fast-track means nobody’s paying attention,” Huckabee said. Among Democrats, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Gov. Martin O’Malley are strongly opposed. And where is Hillary Clinton in all this? On the bench, where she says she’s “watching closely.” Bernie heckles - “Nike epitomizes why disastrous unfettered free-trade policies during the past four decades have failed American workers, eroded our manufacturing base and increased income and wealth inequality in this country,” Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., penned in a letter to the president Tuesday. “Just don’t do it,” Sanders wrote. Why Nike? - National Journal takes a detailed look at the apparel giant, which is headquartered in the U.S. but does most of its business overseas: “Nike made $12.4 billion in profits last year, thanks in large part to 1 million subcontracted workers at factories primarily in low-wage countries in Asia. For years, the company has faced allegations that a number of those factories use sweatshop conditions and illegally low wages to produce sneakers and clothes that Nike then sells in much wealthier countries.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… One of the most famous photographs in sports journalism is of the 1965 game between rival schools Deerfield Academy and Mount Hermon in which the game went on before full stands as a huge fire consumed Mount Hermon’s science building right behind the bleachers. Would you like to know the story behind the famous photo? NYT has the details: “Halftime came. Officials conferred about how to handle the nettlesome situation. In a decision that surely would not be made in today’s safety-conscious, litigious world, they decided it would be better if the teams just carried on. ‘We were told to suck it up and play,’ [one Mount Hermon player] recalled.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

THE WHALE IS GETTING READY TO SURFACE As three more fish joined the growing school of Republican presidential candidates this week, the whale in the race, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has be staying far below the surface. Bush has been quiet lately, with no public events and an under the radar op-ed in the Chicago Tribune. Some advisers told the WaPo not to expect an announcement for at least a month. But others have told Fox News First that the official announcement will be sooner than that and done in a low key manner – as might befit a candidate with 99 percent name recognition among Republican voters. (While a candidate like Scott Walker, still unknown to 1 in 5 Republicans in the latest WSJ/NBC News poll needs a lift from his eventual launch, Bush will be risk-averse.) So when does the whale of a candidate come to the surface? Perhaps his speech at Liberty University’s commencement this Saturday will be just that spray. How Jeb sank Christie - National Journal: “From the time a Bush candidacy started looking more likely, the wind came out of [New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s] presidential sails to the point when he was effectively dead in the water. It was mostly because Bush filled a void that Christie planned to fill in himself. The bridge mess was just icing on the cake.” [Gov. Christie starts another two-day tour through New Hampshire today.] Rubio snags top-drawer Nevada state director - Las Vegas Review-Journal: “U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio on Wednesday gained a strong ally when Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison announced would be the Florida senator’s presidential campaign director in Nevada…[Hutchinson] noted Rubio’s family ties to the Silver State, having lived in Las Vegas for six months while growing up. His father was a bartender and his mother a maid.” Paul pays up for his own name - National Journal: “Days before [Rand Paul] launched his bid for president, his campaign shelled out more than $100,000 to a domain-buying firm to purchase a ‘domain name.’ Soon after, RandPaul.com, which had previously been a pro-Paul site run by his fans, emerged as the official portal for the campaign. Federal campaign records show Paul used his Senate reelection committee to pay $100,980 to Escrow.com, a domain service, on March 27.” Carson meets with community leaders in Baltimore - Baltimore Sun: “Dr. Ben Carson, the former Hopkins neurosurgeon who announced his candidacy for president this week, will visit with Baltimore faith and community leaders on Thursday...A spokeswoman did not respond to a request to clarify if Carson's visit is related to the Freddie Gray case. Carson is also set to speak to at a Maryland Right to Life banquet later Thursday evening in Woodlawn.” “And we have to re-instill that can-do attitude that is so important in our nation. It's what drove this nation from no place to the pinnacle of the world, and the highest pinnacle anybody else had ever reached. And it doesn't have anything to do with one's ethnicity. It has to do with the American spirit.” – Ben Carson on “The Kelly File.” Huckabee strategy: Focus south and skip New Hampshire - Union Leader: “That Huckabee question looms large as the GOP field expands and the former Arkansas governor is reported to be concentrating on the first caucuses in Iowa and the southern primaries in the weeks after New Hampshire’s leadoff contest…Huckabee received 26,916 votes in the New Hampshire primary in 2008. Chuck Norris is again on the Huckabee bandwagon. How many of his old friends in the Granite State will say the same?” As he cuts a deal with a former rival - The ad man famous for producing the “Willie Horton” ad in 1988, and working with Gov. Mitt Romney, R-Ma., in 2007 will host a Huckabee fundraiser in Phoenix on May 14, political strategist and producer Floyd Brown confirms to Bloomberg. [Day two of Huckabee’s “Factories, Farms and Freedom” tour includes meet & greets at Charlie’s American Grill in Sioux City and the Pizza Ranch in Cedar Rapids.] Perry defends tuition for illegal immigrants - Dallas Morning News: “[Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry] then had another chance to explain his support of the so-called Dream Act after a speech that focused on foreign policy. In answering a query from Jorge Baldor, founder of the Latino Center for Leadership Development, Perry said it made sense to educate children brought to the state illegally, but ‘through no fault of their own’…‘The fact is you’re either going to have givers or takers,’ Perry said, ‘If you’re not going to educate, and allow these kids to go through that process and become a giver, because they’ve been educated, then I would suggest you’ve been focused on the wrong issue.’” Santorum announces he’s announcing – Former Sen.

Rick Perry, R-Texas, also uses New Hampshire to show his connections with voters. Gov. Mike Huckabee’s video focuses on commitment to family and faith.

President Obama and Republicans agree on the renewal, but should they? Read here for the judge’s take. CAN CAMERON COME OUT AHEAD IN U.K. KERFUFFLE? Voting is in full swing in Britain and polls won’t close until 5 p.m. ET. What will happen? No one seems to know except that result will be messy as either of the two major parties are likely to need the help of at least one smaller group – liberals, Scottish separatists, anti-European Unionists, etc. – to build a majority coalition. Lacking an executive branch, Britain’s system gives control of the entire government to the party which wins a vote equivalent to the vote for speaker of the House of Representatives in the U.S. With polls showing neither the Labour nor Conservative parties likely able to win the 326 seats necessary to win an outright majority, control of the government for America’s most important ally will hinge on deal making with the niche parties. Can Prime Minister David Cameron and his Tories cling to power? Will Scots have their revenge by helping Ed Miliband and Labour topple the current ruling coalition? It is quite likely to be a mess. Lucky for you then that SkyNews will have all of the details. Bibi survives with last-minute deal - AP: “Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday completed the formation of a new coalition government, reaching a last-minute deal with a nationalist party just before a midnight deadline.

But it set the stage for the formation of a narrow coalition dominated by hard-line and religious parties that appears to be on a collision course with the U.S. and other allies.” BIG NAMES LINE UP FOR MEMORIAL DAY PARADE The list of participants and entertainers for the May 25 National Memorial Day Parade on the National Mall is out this morning: Actors Gary Sinise and Joe Mantegna; television chef Robert Irvine; musicians Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins, Caleb Johnson from American Idol and country singer Beau Davidson; Miss America 2015 Kira Kazantsev, TNA Wrestling stars including Army vet Chris Melendez; and martial music and displays from the Marine Corps Equestrian Color Guard, the U.S. Army Band and marching platoons from all service branches.

BUT THE CAUCUSES WERE REALLY SOMETHING Reuters: “The Australian Sex Party, a tiny party known for its salacious name and election day antics, said on Thursday that it had been deregistered after the country’s election watchdog ruled it did not have enough activists. Co-founder Robbie Swan said in a statement that the party would ‘vigorously’ appeal a decision handed down by the Australian Election Commission (AEC) that removed its official status following a review of its membership. Under Australian law a political party must have either an elected representative in the federal parliament or 500 members to keep its registration. The Sex Party has one lawmaker in the Victoria state legislature, but none at federal level.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “[President Bill Clinton] said there was a guy who said he put the information in the wrong box, and now he says we have no idea how this information was left out. It’s sort of amusing. It reminds you of what they said about a lot of other stuff they lied about consistently in the ‘90s. And this is just a guarantee that if we elect Hillary, we’re going to get this for another eight years.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"UPSIDE DOWN IN THE EARLY DEBATE CLEVELAND – At Thursday’s 9 p.m. debate with the 10 candidates at the top of the polls there’s lots of risk for the frontrunners. If Donald Trump sounds too politically correct, he could leave supporters in a lurch. If Jeb Bush looks sluggish he could turn off skeptical supporters. If Scott Walker equivocates, he will give fodder to other conservatives eager to call him soft. But what about the folks at the debate that starts at 5 p.m.? The risk/reward ratio looks pretty different for them. While all of the seven invitees would have surely preferred to be on the stage later, the 5 p.m. debate is not without opportunity. Two candidates, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and businesswoman Carly Fiorina, have perhaps the most upside. Both are viewed favorably by Republican voters but neither has been able to garner the vote share to break into the top tier. Perry obviously needs a good debate performance more than anyone else in the field, and it may benefit him to do so in a space where the will be fewer fisticuffs. Given the lack of animosity among the early debate participants, one would assume that there will be pile ups, which would give Perry the chance to show off the policy chops he’s been working on for much of the past year. Fiorina also has a chance to tackle her main challenge head in. Republicans often speak of Fiorina as a strong potential running mate but aren’t buying in for the top of the ticket. If Fiorina can replicate her strong stump showings in the debate format, she will have the chance to show herself in a new setting. If viewers buy her as commander in chief, the debate could be the launch pad she’s been looking for. JEB GOES FOR DO-OVER ON WOMENS’ HEALTH USA Today: “Jeb Bush says he goofed Tuesday when he suggested major cuts in women’s health programs, another gaffe that Democrats quickly pounced on. ‘With regards to women’s health funding broadly, I misspoke, as there are countless community health centers, rural clinics, and other women’s health organizations that need to be fully funded,’ Bush said in a written statement following his comment. Earlier, in arguing that the federal government should defund Planned Parenthood over the abortion issue, Bush said ‘I’m not sure we need half a billion dollars for women’s health issues.’ Within minutes, Bush’s comment brought attacks from Democrats, including a tweet from Hillary Clinton: ‘You are absolutely, unequivocally wrong.’” Bucks get bucks from Walker next week - FOX6: “FOX6 News has learned Governor Scott Walker will sign the Milwaukee Bucks arena funding bill next week — on Wednesday, August 12th at State Fair Park. The Wisconsin Assembly passed the bill to have taxpayers pay $250 million to help pay for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena in downtown Milwaukee on July 28th.” [Sen.

Trump gets pollsters after all - WashEx: “The wealthy Republican presidential candidate has said repeatedly that he’s immune to donor pressure and won't hire pollsters.

In July, those numbers moved in the wrong direction for Mrs. Clinton: Only 34% of white women saw her in a positive light, compared to 53% who had a negative impression of her, the poll found… For Team Clinton, the latest poll numbers are a worrisome development. Mrs. Clinton is unlikely to match the African-American turnout that propelled Mr. Obama to two presidential victories, so she has to make up the difference somewhere else.

She’s fared well among voters with a similar background in past polls, but this month’s survey shows that’s no longer the case.” [Clinton continues her cash caravan today, holding fundraisers in three Western states.] FBI starts email probe - Fox News: “The FBI has begun investigating the security of Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server…. The probe, which was first reported by The Washington Post, comes days after watchdogs from the State Department and the intelligence community asked the Justice Department to explore whether classified material was improperly shared or stored on the former secretary of state’s private e-mail account….The Post first reported the FBI contacted Clinton attorney David Kendall about the security of a thumb drive he possesses that contain copies of work emails sent by Clinton during her time as America’s top diplomat. The paper also reported that the FBI had contacted a Denver-based technology firm that helped manage the server.” Sanders in ‘dead heat’ with Hillary in New Hampshire - Wash Ex: “Sen. Bernie Sanders has pulled within six points of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire according to the latest WMUR Granite State poll, which…has Clinton leading Sanders just 42 percent to 36 percent…WMUR reported, ‘The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.9 percent, prompting the pollster to call the race a statistical tie.’” ‘Draft Biden’ courts L.A.

The latest showdown was set Tuesday, when a former top aide to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, Katie McGinty, declared she would seek the party’s nomination for Senate in a race that already includes former congressman and 2010 nominee Joe Sestak. The Pennsylvania race joins a list of intraparty showdowns that already includes Ohio, where former Gov. Ted Strickland is trying to fend off a young city councilman from Cincinnati, and Illinois, where Rep. Tammy Duckworth faces the former president of the Chicago Urban League. In Florida, the most high-profile fight of all awaits, when outspoken Rep. Alan Grayson takes on Rep. Patrick Murphy.” TAKE FIVE: WHAT DO YOU SAY?

He came in very late, he holds down the left-wing of the GOP, he’s a bleeding heart conservative like Jack Kemp and he’s there.

"“I suspect we tend to underestimate the downside of running for president.

And to recap: Perry said ‘oops,’ Huntsman’s campaign never took off and he lost his ambassadorship to China, Bachmann isn’t even in Congress today, Santorum hard-won second place finish hasn’t set him up well for 2016, Cain was ripped apart after a sex scandal, Paul (and Bachmann!) had serious issues with the FEC, and Newt lost his think tank. ‎ “You tell me—are they better off now than they were four years ago?”","1742","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/08/why-long-shots-and-also-rans-run-for-president-its-media-stupid.html"

"But Lewis insists on accentuating the negative, especially “people who have to give up a job to run—like, say, a Fox News gig. And if you have a positive—or possibly inflated—reputation, you’ll likely watch that evaporate as well. Even if the opposition researchers and the media don’t get you (see Herman Cain), there’s a chance that you’ll slip up, amid the sleep deprivation and the glare of cameras and bright lights. There’s always the potential you could be exposed as someone who isn’t as charismatic or knowledgeable as everyone suspected.

"DEMS CONFRONT PAST FAILURES ON GUN CONTROL “When I ran in 2008, I in fact did not say I would fix it. I said we could fix it.” –President Obama at a Beverly Hills fundraiser discussing the mass murder at a Charleston, S.C. church. The only really clear mandate after President Obama’s 2012 re-election was to not be Mitt Romney. Obama had won more in spite of his policies than because of them, but had successfully convinced voters that Romney was too risky a pick. After the grindingest grind of an election in presidential political history, Obama had won another term of what, exactly? Endless battles with the GOP House on taxes and spending? Foreign policy headaches? More scorched earth fights protecting ObamaCare? Blech. But at that very moment, a meteor crashed into American public life: The senseless slaughter of 20 children and six educators at a Connecticut elementary school less than two weeks before Christmas. A fatherless, mentally ill 20-year-old had killed his mother, stolen her guns and laid waste to a group of students at a nearby school, all aged 6 and 7. Obama wept in private and shed tears in public, as most parents must have. He also found new purpose for the second term of his presidency. Two days after the murders, Obama would make a mighty vow: “In the coming weeks, I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens … in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.” As an orthodox liberal, Obama had always been a proponent of gun control. But it had hardly been a top-drawer concern. For example, when a gunman killed 13 people at an immigration center in Binghamton, N.Y. in April of 2009, Obama called it “senseless violence,” but did not demand that the Democratic-controlled Congress push through gun control. The Connecticut killings, different in nature and coming as they did when Obama was looking to do more than just defend his legacy, spurred him headlong into the divided Congress with demands for the most sweeping gun control legislation since the Clinton era. Even though the legislation wouldn’t have prevented the shooting had it been in place, gun violence became the animating issue for the Democratic Party. The legislation was cued up and public pressure was enormous. The daily shouts from television, social media and elsewhere were for action, action, action. But before too long, Democrats lost their nerve. Then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ended up killing even a compromise package that would have required background checks at gun shows and for private sales. All the thunder came to naught. And here we are again. This time it is nine Christians at worship at a historic church in Charleston, S.C. The place that once heard the exultant cries of freed slaves heard the anguished ones of murder victims. It would be wholly unfair to say that the legislation proposed by the president would have in any way prevented the killings. But one wonders why a party and a president who believed that more gun regulations would save lives gave up so easily. [Watch Fox: Correspondent Rich Edson is in Charleston with the latest on the shooting.] “Can government save you? Can government be the be-all end-all?

Rand Paul, R-Ky., at a meeting of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. “I hope we, the American people, can come to the understanding that we are not each other’s enemies.

The source said Blumenthal has been working with Media Matters, American Bridge and Correct the Record…. Though it's unclear exactly what Blumenthal was paid to do, Politico reported his work entailed giving high-level strategy and messaging guidance, and the Benghazi debate was likely part of that. The groups above have busily defended then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from GOP broadsides.” Clinton doubles down on executive amnesty – USA TODAY: “Speaking Thursday before the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, Clinton [said]… she would fight for comprehensive immigration reform that includes ‘a real path to citizenship’ for the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants who have settled in the United States…oppose any move to deport the young immigrants known as ’Dreamers’ or to undo President Obama’s executive actions that are shielding millions of immigrants from enforcement action. And that if Congress continues to balk at acting on immigration reform, ‘as president I will do everything possible under the law to go even further than what President Obama has attempted to achieve,’ she said.” [Clinton continues to rake in the West Coast cash with fundraisers in the Los Angeles area. President Obama is also in the state fundraising for the DNC.] Hillary breaks left on trade - Fox News: “After being coy for weeks on her position, Hillary Clinton on Thursday clearly broke with President Obama on his trade push -- despite having supported the trade deal he wants as secretary of state. The now-Democratic presidential candidate made her position clear in an interview with veteran Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston.

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… In a culture that doesn’t flinch at grown women wearing ill-fitting yoga pants to travel on an airplane or adult men wearing tennis shoes to work in an office, what’s the point of “dressing up?” In a society where vulgarians are everywhere ascendant, what’s the point of being polite? And in a world where perfect strangers think nothing of calling adults, even their elders, only by their first names, what’s the point of courtesy? Being formal today is often seen as not just pointless but also priggish. So parents and others weary sentinels on the frontier between civilization and idiocracy often struggle with the “why” of keeping social order.

The 35th state is the only one born of the bloodshed of the Civil War, rending itself from the rest of Virginia when the mother state left the Union. Although incorrectly considered part of the South by the Census Bureau, West Virginia is very much Appalachian in nature, as reflected in the state motto: Montani Semper Liberi (“Mountaineers are Always Free”). Signed, sealed, delivered - This commitment to freedom is illustrated on the state seal, the most interesting part of which may be the most inconspicuous. A hat at the center of the two crossed rifles referred to as the “liberty cap” comes from ancient Rome, and was given to slaves when their owners granted them freedom. The liberty cap, called the Phrygian cap in ancient Rome, is also worn by the Magi that follow the star to the birth of Christ in most depictions, and is worn by the freedom statue at the top of the Capitol building in Washington. Any who celebrate the triumph of freedom over slavery ought to take a moment to observe West Virginia Day on Saturday. [For those who don’t know what a blessing it is to be a West Virginian, the indispensable Hoppy Kercheval has a brief meditation that is very much worth reading.] AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “I’ve argued for a long time that since we changed our laws on incarceration and involuntary hospitalization of the mentally ill, we’ve had an increase in these crimes.

And I think we really ought to show a little respect for some things which are not soluble by law.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"TRUMP THREATENS THIRD PARTY BID The odds of Donald Trump mounting a third party run for the White House would “absolutely” increase if he felt he was being unfairly by the Republican National Committee, Trump told The Hill. “‘The RNC has not been supportive. They were always supportive when I was a contributor. I was their fair-haired boy,’ the business mogul [said] ... Pressed on whether he would run as a third-party candidate if he fails to clinch the GOP nomination, Trump said…‘I’ll have to see how I’m being treated by the Republicans,’ Trump said. ‘Absolutely, if they’re not fair, that would be a factor.’” Trump, who was asked by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus to tone down his rhetoric earlier this month and was rebuked by the RNC for being critical of Sen. John McCain’s status as a war hero, said the GOP establishment doesn’t like him because he’s “not one of the gang.”","1777","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/23/trump-threatens-third-party-bid.html"

But the disclosure is unlikely to stem the ongoing debate over [Donald Trump’s] net worth. Last week, Trump claimed that his net worth for 2015 had reached more than $10 billion.

Rubio sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which will hold the first of what’s expected to be several hearings to examine the agreement, announced July 14.

Scott Walker’s biggest individual Wisconsin financial backers as are the political action committees affiliated with Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. and the parent companies of We Energies and Blue Cross Blue Shield. Reiman, formerly of Reiman Publications in Greendale, and Brenton contributed $10,000 each this year for the period ended June 30, according to a report filed Monday by the Friends of Scott Walker with the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board.” [Walker and former Gov.

With the rise of the digital age, however, punctuation has seemingly lost its use. Text, email, tweets, all encourage the lack of punctuation since it takes up another “character” in the letter. Time Higher Education reporter Poppy Corbett gives an analysis of Jeff Scheible’s book “Digital Shift: The Cultural Logic of Punctuation,” which makes the case that punctuation is not only important, but has its own personality. For example, Corbett writes, “The period is surely the Mafia overlord of punctuation marks: its ubiquitous firm presence, helpful indication to breathe when reading aloud and ‘dot’ in the ‘dot-com’ all point towards a character that knows it’s the boss. Its spherical shape conjures images of completeness. However, Scheible suggests that the period may no longer inscribe finality across visual culture. Its role is shifting: ‘ongoing, architectural, and less conclusive’.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

"Helping open up ""Saturday Night Live"" this weekend in support of Tracy Morgan's return to the comedic stage, ""Seinfeld"" co-creator and Curb Your Enthusiasm star Larry David absolutely nailed a Bernie Sanders impression during a sketch mocking the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas. Arguably, David's impression overshadowed Alec Baldwin's impression of democratic candidate Jim Webb.","Published October 19, 2015","1823","http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/10/18/larry-david-channels-bernie-sanders-in-hilarious-snl-sketch.html"
"At one point, David went off on a Seinfeld-like rant about email. Making fun of the email-related exchange between Sanders and Clinton at the recent Democratic debate, David said ""What's the deal with emails, anyway? I forgot my password the other day, so they say they will email you a new one. But I can't get into my email to get the password!

"Making an appearance on ABC's ""This Week With George Stephanopoulos"" on Sunday morning, Sanders was asked what he thought of David's impression. Sanders jokingly responded ""I think we'll use Larry at our next rally. He does better than I do."" Other quips in the sketch included David claiming that he only owned one pair of underwear, while all the billionaires on the stage owned four pairs.","1826","http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/10/18/larry-david-channels-bernie-sanders-in-hilarious-snl-sketch.html"
"Of course, David isn't a stranger to ""Saturday Night Live."" Davis was a writer on the sketch comedy show between 1984 and 1985. However, he expressed frustration working on the show as he was only able to get one sketch on the air during his entire time working as a writer and it aired at the final 12:50 AM time slot.","1827","http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/10/18/larry-david-channels-bernie-sanders-in-hilarious-snl-sketch.html"
"After ""SNL,"" David went on to co-create ""Seinfeld"" with Jerry Seinfeld and help run the show for nine seasons. After the success of Seinfeld, he went on to create another critically acclaimed comedy, ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."" That first aired on HBO fifteen years ago and may return for an additional season or perhaps a movie according to the latest rumors.","1828","http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/10/18/larry-david-channels-bernie-sanders-in-hilarious-snl-sketch.html"

"In the Democratic debate last month, Mr. Sanders said voters were ""sick and tired"" of the focus on Mrs. Clinton's ""damn emails.""

"This comes as the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) recently pulled back plans for an early endorsement of Clinton, hoping to gain added leverage on her economic agenda.

"Union membership rates have been diving in the private sector for years. Nationwide, across the public and private sectors combined, only 11 percent of employees are members of a union. The conservative majority on the Supreme Court could end mandatory union dues – the foundation stone for powerful union contributions to Democrats – as early as next year.","1858","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-and-desperate-quest-for-union-endorsement.html"

"In 2008, Clinton’s loss of several union endorsements to Obama, then a first-term senator representing Illinois, proved damaging to her campaign. Now her camp has a similar fear of losing union backing to Sen.

"Last week, Clinton made a major move to get in line with the AFL-CIO’s agenda.

"“In terms of Wall Street,” Sanders said last week, “three out of the four largest banks today are bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail...

"Clinton personally traveled to NEA headquarters in Washington and did a 90-minute question-and-answer event with the NEA board. Clinton and her Democratic rivals have shunned an invitation to an education reform forum because it was sponsored by former CNN anchor Campbell Brown. Brown is a supporter of charter schools, and an activist on the issue. She has also questioned why public school teachers have tenure protection even if their students fail to learn.","1876","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-and-desperate-quest-for-union-endorsement.html"

"Clinton, though, is having to work much harder for her fundraising. The bulk of Clinton's total came from fundraisers hosted by big donors across the country, many held in the traditionally Democratic treasure-chests of Manhattan and Hollywood. She raised at least $19 million from about 60 events where admission typically costs $2,700, the biggest donation allowed by law.","1944","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/01/sanders-nearly-matches-clinton-in-latest-fundraising-haul.html"
"Sanders, meanwhile, is spending very little time crisscrossing the country for such fundraisers.

"The nearly $20 million decline is partially attributable to the typical summer fundraising slow-down. Some donors are also waiting to see if Vice President Joe Biden joins the race.

"Previous Fox News polls included several Democratic contenders who are now out of the running, most notably Vice President Joe Biden. Even so, we can compare the new results to how things stood before the first Democratic debate and Clinton’s Capitol Hill testimony on Benghazi.

The next closest is Cruz at 10 percent, while 9 percent say Carson, 7 percent Rubio, and 5 percent each for Bush and Kasich. Fiorina, a former CEO, garners just 3 percent.","2087","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/04/fox-news-poll-gop-nomination-race-coming-into-focus.html"

"With Hillary and Bernie broadcasting in advance that they wouldn’t attack each other personally and Anderson Cooper vowing there would be no “gotcha” questions, many folks envisioned a snoozefest.

"In what sounded a bit like reading the talking points, Hillary kept saying she would be the first woman president—both in response to questions about whether she’d run Barack Obama’s third term and why the country shouldn’t elect an outsider. It was her get-out-of-jail-free card.

"Foreign policy was difficult terrain for Sanders. He challenged Clinton’s idea for a Syria no-fly zone as dangerous and kept defaulting to the fact that he had opposed the Iraq war—with the clear implication that Hillary did not. The senator was finally forced to declare “I am prepared to take this country into war” if necessary.","2107","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/13/hillary-moves-left-bests-bernie-with-just-two-email-questions.html"

"But there's that Biden factor again. Biden -- who is not a declared candidate -- pulls 22 percent in South Carolina.

"Begging Joe Biden to run should be a no brainer for Democrats, as his candidacy can only help the party’s chances. Why?","Published October 19, 2015","2232","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"There are three general scenarios where the 2016 Democratic nominee is the likely loser to a credible GOP presidential ticket.","2233","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"1. Senator Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. The self-described “Democratic Socialist” and his platform are too easily painted outside the mainstream.","2234","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"2. Hillary Clinton wins the nomination but only after moving consistently further left in her political positioning to ward off the Senator’s challenge.","2235","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"3. Clinton is the Democratic nominee but too wounded politically to recover due to future events, such as consequences from her email mess.","2236","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"It is problematic right now whether Republicans will nominate a credible ticket. Their path to 270 Electoral College votes is not simple. The must-win swing states for the GOP are Florida and Ohio; and probably Virginia too. The most credible candidates to win those states, Floridians Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, as well as Ohioan John Kasich, remain far behind the current leaders in preference polls.","2237","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"Donald Trump continues to lead the GOP field even though he is the most unpopular candidate in either political party with even a fanciful hope for winning the White House.","2238","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"Dr. Ben Carson has a resume unlike any previous president. His success in polls continues, however. It suggests that many GOP primary voters are determined to find a non-politician.","2239","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"Of the others in the large GOP pack, Ted Cruz seems to be slowly gaining money and supporters based on a strategy pitching him as the most ideologically rigid Senator running for the GOP nomination since Barry Goldwater in 1964 suffered the biggest loss of any Republican in history.","2240","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"Carly Fiorina has gained traction but her nomination seems a fantasy. The other contenders are not taken seriously yet by GOP voters.","2241","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"The top tier are all likely to lose badly unless one of the three troublesome Democratic scenarios is present. The advantage to Democrats in Biden running should therefore be self-evident: his being on the field gives them protection against the party’s three big vulnerabilities. Why?","2242","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"Democratic presidential nomination fights are ultimately about winning a majority of the delegates to the party’s National Convention. Delegates are apportioned to the states and awarded by a formula basically giving a candidate the same rough percentage of these elected delegates as he or she got in the state’s primary or caucus vote.","2243","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"In a competitive three way race, it is going to be almost impossible for either Biden, Clinton or Sanders to win anywhere near a majority of the elected delegates. For Sanders to win the nomination, he would either need to cut a deal with Hillary or Joe, since the party’s Super Delegates, representing the Democratic Party Establishment, would never vote for him.","2244","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"Such a deal isn’t possible, and he knows it. Therefore Biden’s candidacy takes scenario one off the table.","2245","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"In a three fight, Clinton would also have less need to “me too” Sanders. Biden’s candidacy therefore largely if not wholly moots out scenario two.","2246","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"The last potential calamity, scenario three – the Democrats being stuck with fielding a fatally wounded Hillary – is likewise erased by Biden running.","2247","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"Thus the Party’s not-so-subtle attempt to thwart a Biden run is short-sighted. Suppose Sanders, in a two way contest with Clinton, wins both Iowa and New Hampshire. The next big primary – South Carolina – will be 18 days away. Presidential nomination history says this period will be defined by positive stories about Sanders’s surprise surging campaign and negative articles wondering what is wrong with establishment candidate Clinton.","2248","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"Party leaders believe Clinton’s support from African-Americans, especially women of color, will allow the six Super Tuesday Southern primaries on March 1 to stave off Sanders’s challenge. But the presidential campaign momentum driven historically by news stories about winning and losing will give Sanders a big tailwind even if he loses South Carolina three days before. There is a good chance the “firewall” will not knock Sanders out of the race. This means the fight will go all the through the last primaries in June.","2249","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"Bottom line: This leaves months for any of the three bad scenarios to germinate. But there would not be time for Biden to make a late entry in the race to effect the delegate math.","2250","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"
"When viewed from the prism of what is best for the Democratic Party and its supporters, a Biden candidacy therefore could be a life-saver. Those claiming his late entry is unfair to the party and thus pleading with him not to run might want to reconsider.","2251","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/19/why-democratic-party-wins-if-biden-runs.html"

"The Clinton plan is bound to cost more than the $35 billion per year over 10 years projected by her campaign. This is because more students would probably switch to public universities on the potential to graduate without debt, raising costs for the government and potentially leaving many modestly endowed private institutions in the lurch.","2323","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/13/ap-fact-check-clinton-sanders-revise-history-in-dem-debate.html"
"The potential of a debt-free education would also depend on states providing reliable money streams and controlling costs -- both major sources of uncertainty. But the Clinton plan would also expose a sharp generational divide. New college students would be helped, but the 40 million Americans who already owe a combined $1.2 trillion in education debt would receive little aid other than refinancing at lower rates.","2324","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/13/ap-fact-check-clinton-sanders-revise-history-in-dem-debate.html"

"Economists have long debated the impact of raising the minimum wage, and some recent research has found that modest increases don't actually cost many jobs.

It would also be far above the minimum wage's previous peak of just under $11, adjusted for inflation, in 1968.","2329","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/13/ap-fact-check-clinton-sanders-revise-history-in-dem-debate.html"

"The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party’s presidential primary races.

"O’Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.” The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.","2457","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"

"Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley.

"Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding.

"DIGITAL DRAGNET CLOSING IN ON HILLARY EMAILS Fox News: “The FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email has now expanded to include obtaining data from a second tech company, which is fully cooperating with the FBI probe that has threatened Clinton’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Fox News has learned. A source familiar with the investigation told Fox that the FBI contacted Connecticut-based Datto, Inc. in September and asked them to preserve all data they had which may be connected to Clinton. Datto was hired to help back up data in May 2013 by Platte River Networks, the Colorado-based tech company that managed Clinton’s server and has already been cooperating with the FBI investigation.” What’s so shady, lady? - McClatchy: [Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc.] offered the first public confirmation that Clinton or her representatives had arranged for a backup of her email server after she left office in early 2013. His letter also cited internal emails recounting requests in late 2014 and early 2015 from Clinton representatives for Colorado-based Platte River Networks, the firm managing Clinton’s primary server, to direct Datto to reduce the amount of her emails it was backing up. These communications led a Platte River employee to air suspicions that ‘this whole thing really is covering up some shaddy (sic) shit,’ according to an excerpt of an email cited by Johnson.” Power Play: Hillary’s bid to beat the rap - Hillary Clinton is using an attack ad to paint Republicans investigating her scandals as politically-motivated bad guys. What’s behind her strategy and will it work? Chris Stirewalt has the lowdown, in just 60 seconds. WATCH HERE. Pro-Biden PAC launches ads ahead of Dem debate - Fox News: “The super PAC urging Vice President Joe Biden to run for president is launching its first television ad. Draft Biden says it's spending upward of $100,000 to air the 90-second ad on national cable networks. The ad uses audio from a speech Biden gave in May at Yale University. Biden recalls the car crash that killed his wife and daughter just after he was first elected senator in 1972. Biden says he found redemption by focusing on his sons…The ad ends with white lettering that reads: ‘Joe, run.’” Hillary hedging on trade deal - WSJ: “Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership as secretary of state but now finds it abhorrent to some inside her party and rejected by her closest challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. She is undecided now. Campaigning Tuesday in Davenport, Iowa, Mrs. Clinton said she would be ‘diving into that [Tuesday night]’ and discussing the agreement with advisers.” HILLARY, TRUMP UP IN PRIMARIES, BUT SWING STATE VOTERS NOT IMPRESSED First, the good news for the GOP and Democratic frontrunners: A new Quinnipiac University swing state poll finds Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton expanding or maintaining their leads among primary voters. Now the bad news: Both Trump and Clinton are slipping with general election voters in the key states of Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. In every state polled, Trump maintains at least a 5 point lead over his next closest competitor Ben Carson. Trump blows away former home-state favorites Gov. John Kasich in Ohio and former Gov. Jeb Bush in Florida. Bush now runs fourth in Florida and Kasich has slipped to third place in Ohio. Similarly, Clinton has expanded her leads over closest competitor, Vermont socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and potential candidate Vice President Joe Biden. But assuming the two ended up the winners of their respective parties’ nominations, how would things go? Both are broadly disliked among the general electorate, but Clinton (as well as Sanders and Biden) would have the edge on Trump in a head-to-head matchup. The top-tier GOP candidates that would fare best against Clinton appear to be Carson and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. And while Trump fares worse than the rest of the GOP pack against Clinton, It’s Joe Biden who the GOP might really want to worry about. Biden crushes the GOP frontrunner Trump by more than 10 points in all three states. As with Clinton, Carson and Rubio do best of the GOPers tested in a Biden matchup. And it’s no wonder. Voters in all three states have strongly unfavorable views on the two party frontrunners. Only Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie approach Clinton and Trump’s sky-high negative scores. Oh, there’s one other category in which Clinton and Trump are alike: They are seen as the least honest and trustworthy candidates in the field, though she’s got the edge on her Republican rival. In Ohio, only one third of voters said they trusted Clinton, while Trump was closer to 40 percent. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… It was on this day 14 years ago that then-President George W. Bush announced the beginning of the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan with a midday speech from the White House. His famous lines from those remarks – “We will not waiver. We will not falter. We will not tire. We will not fail.” – sound different these days. On Tuesday, the new U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Campbell, painted a grim picture in testimony about the state of the Afghan military and the future of the country after the end of the U.S. military presence there. But for a brief time in an otherwise brutal and chaotic history, Afghanistan saw a hopeful mirage of a modern future before plunging back into the darkness. Look at this Atlantic collection of photos of Midcentury Afghanistan and you’ll better understand the scope of that national tragedy. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 45.5 percent//Disapprove – 49.3 percent Directions of Country: Right Direction – 27.2 percent//Wrong Track – 62.3 percent GOP CAMPAIGNS PREPARE FOR CONVENTION CHAOS David Drucker explains how the large nominating field could push the fight through the early states and into late-in-the-game primaries. Drucker writes, “Multiple party operatives said in interviews that it’s legitimately possible that two or more viable candidates could be competing for the nomination in March or April. In a close quarters fight, unbound delegate…and those newly uncommitted because the winner of a previous primary or caucus lacked support and dropped out, could prove pivotal to the outcome.” [Cruz knows - Politico lays out Sen. Ted Cruz’s planned path to the nomination and explains why he’s courting voters in overlooked spots on the primary map.] Trump: eminent domain ‘wonderful’ - GOP frontrunner Donald Trump sat down on “Special Report with Bret Baier” and made some controversial comments on the use of eminent domain, a right of government to take private property for public use with compensation. Trump said, “I think eminent domain is wonderful if you’re building a highway and you need to build as an example, a highway, and you’re going to be blocked by a hold-out…I think eminent domain for massive projects, for instance you’re going to create thousands of jobs and you have somebody that’s in the way. Eminent domain, they get a lot of money… I think eminent domain is fine.” Watch here. Trump’s campaign book: ‘Crippled America’ - WaPo: “Central to the fall strategy is the release later this month of a book that will serve as a campaign manifesto. During the interview, Trump showed off the cover and title, ‘Crippled America,’ and held up pages of the galleys, which he was editing by hand.” Jeb praises Trump: Moving toward the ‘right place’ - WashEx: “Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush thinks Donald Trump has moved closer to the right direction as the presidential campaign has moved into October. Bush reportedly told Fox Sports 1’s Clay Travis that Trump was making much needed progress. He said he would vote for Trump if he became the GOP nominee. ‘I’m a conservative, I know Hillary isn’t,’ Bush said. ‘That’s one thing we know for sure. It’s not to say that she’s not capable of being president, but I think her world view is not the right one. And Trump’s views are evolving, at least, towards the right place.’” Candy Carson talks about husband Ben’s run - On Tuesday’s “The Kelly File” Candy Carson appeared alongside her husband, Ben Carson, who’s been spending a lot of his time on the campaign trail. Mrs. Carson said, “After giving up my husband for 40 years to medicine, I really don’t want to give him up to our country. But then again, when I look at our grandchildren and you think of that deficit that we have…To saddle them with that kind of debt? We're the first generation in the history of this country to make it worse for the next one.” Watch here. Christie launches new video ahead of New Hampshire swing - Gov. Chris Christie released a video ahead of his return to the Granite State today. The video is part of Christie’s effort to highlight the dysfunction in Washington. PACS SURGE FOR AYOTTE NH1: “A new pro-Republican third party group is spending big bucks to run TV commercials in New Hampshire defending GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte’s record on women’s healthcare. The organization, One Nation, Thursday will launch a 17-day $1.4 million broadcast, cable, digital and radio ad campaign in the Granite State, ad buying sources told NH1 News on Tuesday. The ad campaign, dominated by a 10-day $1.2 million broadcast and cable buy (including WBIN-TV) was later confirmed to NH1 News by One Nation.” [According to a new poll from WMUR, Ayotte starts close race with a slight edge.] Bolton PAC boosts Ayotte - Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton is getting in the mix for Ayotte as well. His super PAC is chipping in more than $50,000 for targeted online ads backing the freshman Republican. MCCARTHY TRIES TO COAX CRITICS The three Republicans vying to replace John Boehner as House speaker made pitches to a coalition of the chamber’s most conservative members in a closed door meeting Tuesday night. Fox News: “Lawmakers who attended the forum said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the current favorite to become speaker, pledged changes to the House. ‘I think McCarthy’s pitch was “I’m not John Boehner, I’m going to run things differently, I’m my own man,”’ said Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas… Reps. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Daniel Webster of Florida, also addressed the group. Chaffetz told Fox News he would support whoever emerged as the Republican nominee in Thursday’s secret ballot…The full House votes for a new speaker in open session on Oct. 29.” [WaPo: “House Republicans are poised to create a special committee to investigate a wide range of practices related to abortions and fetal tissue procurement in the latest and perhaps most lasting consequence of an activist campaign targeting Planned Parenthood.] THANK GOD SHE DIDN’T SAY IT WAS KALE (Morris County, N.J.) Daily Record: “Not many people will say that eating bacon every day is the key to a long life, but the world’s oldest woman swears by it. Susannah Mushatt Jones, 116, keeps a steady diet of bacon, eggs and grits for breakfast. A sign in her kitchen reads: ‘Bacon makes everything better.’ … Jones credits her longevity to ‘lots of sleep,’ Guinness said. … Jones was born in a small farm town near Montgomery, Ala., on July 6, 1899. She was one of 11 siblings and attended a special school for young black girls. When she graduated from high school in 1922, Jones worked full time helping family members pick crops. She left after a year to begin working as a nanny, heading north to New Jersey and eventually making her way to New York.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “When he started out, [Donald Trump] wandered into a lot of Twilight Zone places – the deportation of the 12 million, the thing with John McCain. He didn’t do that [in his interview on ‘Special Report’]. He was a lot more disciplined.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"Buzz Cut: • Email news wipes Hillary’s second reset • Biden ridin’ high in new poll • Carson drills ‘P.C. culture’ while Trump ducks • ¿Qué? Jeb says multiculturalism ‘wrong approach’ • Oh yeah, then where was his goatee?","2720","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/23/email-news-wipes-hillarys-second-reset.html"
"EMAIL NEWS WIPES HILLARY’S SECOND RESET Hillary Clinton’s furious effort to refocus her struggling campaign on something other than the scandals that have dogged it from the start just ran smack into a brick wall. First, the WaPo reported that Clinton had misrepresented why she turned over emails from her private server. It wasn’t routine records keeping as Clinton claimed, but the discovery of her secret email server more than a year ago that triggered the request for her documents and her eventual compliance. That dropped just as Clinton hit the Des Moines Register for a meeting with editors and she was caught flat-footed. The shambles of her initial claims about her email is nearly complete. Pro tip: When you are busted being shady, don’t be shady in your explanation. Clinton was hoping to get back to her new focus: trying to paint herself as more liberal than the Obama administration (seriously!) as she pushes for a huge increase in refugees from the Syrian civil war and for – quite suddenly – the rejection of a new oil pipeline from Canada. Clinton’s goal is to paint herself as left of Vice President Joe Biden. It’s revealing that Clinton has set her new ideological position in the space between Biden and the Democrats’ version of Ron Paul, Sen. Bernie Sanders. That’s a weird space, dude. And it’s one in which a general election bid would have a cramped launch pad, to say the least. She must really be worried about defeating a historically weak field to torch so many general election votes. Transparent, rapid-fire pandering is usually bad news, but it’s still better than being reduced to legalistic dissembling in front of a gaggle of reporters. Yet there Clinton was, watching the second reset of her second campaign fall apart like cheap shoes in a rainstorm. But her bad day wasn’t over yet. Not by a long shot. Bloomberg was about to report that the FBI probe into Clinton’s handling of secret documents as secretary of state had unlocked the more than 30,000 documents that Clinton in March had declared destroyed. The sounds of heads exploding in Brooklyn could be heard across the land. Remember that Clinton took the brazen step of destroying evidence she said would exonerate her. She claimed she handed over all official emails and destroyed the rest in the interest of her family’s privacy. It would clear her name against allegations of ethical and national security misconduct, but she didn’t want anyone nosing around her and her husband’s emails. It sounded absurd, but hey, if the server was “wiped” or shredded, cooked on high in a microwave for an hour and then dumped into the Marianas Trench, there wasn’t anything that could be done about it. Unless Clinton was foolish enough to have deemed the emails gone when they really weren’t and when the server itself wasn’t in her custody. Which now, it appears, was the case. She was bluffing. As Stephan Dinan reports, though, the FBI isn’t exactly advertising its findings. The agency is refusing even to discuss the investigation with the State Department, which was ordered by a judge to try to collaborate with the Justice Department to determine what might be recovered from Clinton’s email. How, when and if the contents of the once-secret server are made public are all open questions. But, if the emails Clinton said she ordered be destroyed have been recovered and if that discovery is confirmed, the emails can be had by congressional investigators. It goes like this: The first and most immediate threat to Clinton’s campaign and, potentially, her freedom is the possibility of criminal prosecution for knowingly mishandling state secrets. If she is even charged with a crime for her email practices, she’s toast. And if the emails she said would “remain private” reveal any sensitive government business, she’s burnt toast. But even if the emails Clinton wanted destroyed yield no charges for her or her intimates, they will certainly be sought by the House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi terror attack. And that’s where the risk of the discovery of something not criminal but politically devastating comes into play. Outside of the real, but still unlikely chance that Clinton would get popped for national security violations, the existential threat to her bid to return to the White House is in her and her husband’s convoluted and ethically dubious moneymaking practices of the past decade. If the committee gets evidence that supports the claims that Clinton did inappropriate favors for patrons while in office, that’s probably a death knell, depending on how gross of a violation. And then there’s the embarrassment factor of what was said by Clinton and her top aides in unguarded conversations. Gulp… BIDEN RIDIN’ HIGH IN NEW POLL A Bloomberg News poll out today shows Vice President Joe Biden in a strong position if he does indeed mount a challenge to his party’s once-inevitable frontrunner. Biden was the pick of 25 percent of Democratic voters, just 8 points behind Clinton, who announced her candidacy nearly six months ago. Biden is one point ahead of left-wing heartthrob Sen. Bernie Sanders. But the worse news for Clinton is the poll also shows Clinton at her lowest favorability rating yet among the general electorate – 38 percent, down 10 points from April – with Biden riding to a new high of 49 percent. Biden is seen more favorably by Democrats, too. Seventy percent said they had a favorable opinion of Clinton compared to 80 percent for Biden. Power Play: Hillary’s boxing out Biden - With all the buzz about a Joe Biden challenge, Hillary Clinton has been launched some preemptive strikes in his direction. What’s behind Hillary’s not so welcome wagon? Chris Stirewalt has the answer, in just 60 seconds. WATCH HERE. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… America is mourning today the passing today of one of its true originals, Yogi Berra.

The NYP collected some of his best malapropisms, jokes and bits of wisdom, including the very best when one is facing uncertainty with difficult choices in life: “When you come to a fork in the road, take it.” How many of us have been sorry we failed to choose when we had the chance?

All release on “Special Report with Bret Baier” 6 p.m. ET] CARSON DRILLS ‘P.C. CULTURE’ WHILE TRUMP DUCKS Ben Carson is riding a wave of new support following his unapologetic refusal to support a hypothetical Muslim candidate for president. Carson, who remained adamant in an interview Tuesday with Megyn Kelly, says he is seeing a surge in contributions. Meanwhile, the candidate Carson is chasing in the polls, Donald Trump, is ducking questions surrounding his own Islamocentric controversy. Appearing on “The Tonight Show,” Trump continued to refuse to respond to questions about whether he still believes President Obama is lying about being American-born. Trump has steadfastly refused to comment on the president’s nativity or whether Obama is a secret Muslim since an audience member in New Hampshire last week declared Obama Islamic and referenced Trump’s onetime status as the leading proponent of a conspiracy theory that the president had covered up the location of his birth. Though Trump in another interview seemed to defend the question as legitimate – or at least the part that relates to Muslims in America “being a problem” – he is so far dodging questions on his own beliefs. This has created a considerable opening for the already surging Carson, who isn’t afraid to tackle the topic, perhaps owing to not toting any birther baggage of his own. While Carson says he is trying to “fix the P.C. culture,” Trump suddenly seems to be trying to abide by it. The frontrunner instead is doing his best to revive old feuds and start new ones in hopes that personality conflicts will overshadow his recent troubles. ¿Qué?: Jeb says multiculturalism ‘wrong approach’ - DMR: “Bush offered a sharp rebuke of the notion of multiculturalism in America during a diner stop [in Iowa]. ‘America has done immigration so much better than other countries because it’s a set of values that people share that defines our national identity, not race or ethnicity or where you come from,’… He added that the ‘assimilation process’ in America has been ‘retarded’ by instances in which immigrant groups have remained isolated from broader communities and emphasized the need for new Americans to learn English. ‘A common language is important. We need to get back to that,’ he said. “We’re creeping toward multiculturalism and that’s the wrong approach.’” [Bush is in Washington today where he and his wife Columba will attend a Mass celebrated by Pope Francis.] Rubio bucks pope on economy - Sen. Marco Rubio said on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that he believes Pope Francis is off-target when it comes to the economy. When he “pronounces himself from the chair of Peter,” the Pope speaks with “incredible authority” on moral issues, Rubio, who is a Catholic, told Baier. “I have a difference in opinion with him on economic models,” Rubio said, “We have the same goal, of providing more prosperity and upward mobility. I just honestly believe free enterprise is a better way of doing it.” Watch here. Fiorina: nix the China dinner - AP: “The former Hewlett-Packard CEO said…she still would meet privately with [Chinese President Xi Jinping]. But she said she would cancel the dinner as just one step in a new hard line against Beijing…Fiorina identified China, together with Russia and Iran, as aggressors that she would curtail if elected. Obama has dealt meekly with the three nations, Fiorina argued, comparing the trio to misbehaving children. ‘What happens If you let your teenager do bad stuff over and over again, what do they do? Bad stuff,’ she said, drawing a mix of laughter and applause at The Citadel military college in Charleston. ‘Well, it’s true of China and (others).’” [Fiorina officially files for South Carolina Primary ballot as she continues a three day tour of the Palmetto State.] OH YEAH, THEN WHERE WAS HIS GOATEE?

The (Allentown) Morning Call reports 34-year-old Steven Felton, of Emmaus, was sentenced to 62 to 124 years on Monday. Lehigh County Judge Kelly Banach said she was offended by Felton’s arrogance. A jury last month convicted Felton in the 10 robberies in the Lehigh Valley, all of which occurred during the fall of 2012. Most of the heists were caught on video, which clearly showed Felton’s face as he wielded a pellet gun. Chief Deputy District Attorney Matthew Falk asked for a long sentence, saying some traumatized clerks are unable to return to work due to Felton’s ‘reign of terror.’” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"HILLARY FALLS, BIDEN RISES AGAINST GOP FIELD If Thursday’s Iowa poll didn’t panic the Clinton camp, then the new the head-to-head matchups against leading Republicans definitely will. In a CNN poll’s hypothetical general election contest, Hillary Clinton falls to both Jeb Bush and Ben Carson by 2 and 5 points, respectively, and ties Donald Trump. Adding insult to injury, not only does potential rival Vice President Joe Biden beat Trump and Bush, but he beats them by a wide margin. Biden, however, still falls to Carson by 2 points. This poll continues to damage Clinton’s implicit argument that she is the only Democrat who can win. Power Play: Hillary fading - First in New Hampshire, now in Iowa. Hillary Clinton has seen her frontrunner status slip away and now polls show her trailing Bernie Sanders in both key early states. What’s happened? GOP strategist Lauren Claffey and Democratic consultant Chuck Rocha hash it over with Chris Stirewalt. WATCH HERE. Biden gets emotional on Late Show - On “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” Vice President Joe Biden said, “‘I don’t think any man or woman should run for president unless, number one, they know exactly why they would want to be president and two, they can look at folks out there and say, ‘I promise you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion,’ Mr. Biden said…‘And, and, I’d be lying if I said that I knew I was there …’” Hillary swipes Walker, Trump in first campaign stop to Wisconsin - Star Tribune: “Clinton took special aim at Wisconsin’s Republican governor, going after him over legislation that weakened unions and moves to defund Planned Parenthood. Clinton said Walker has tried to cast himself as ‘a tough guy on a motorcycle.’ She went on to say he ‘gets his marching orders from the Koch brothers,’ referencing Charles and David Koch, the wealthy industrialists who support various conservative causes.” Bernie ‘stunned’ over new poll results - Sanders said on CNN, “Yes, I’m stunned…Look, we have a message that I believed from day one was going to resonate with the American people. ... Did I think (the issues) would resonate as quickly as they have? The answer is no.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… If you’re a parent, you may want to give yourself a moment after you read this and watch the video. WPIX: “Among the thousands trying to escape the crumbling twin towers on Sept. 11, 2001, were small children from the Children’s Discovery Day Care Center and 5 World Trade….Some were merely infants. Daycare workers like Karen Caycedo carried a few, and others held hands and simply ran… Communication was virtually non-existent in the aftermath of the attack. Art Chang and his wife, Allison, were left frantically looking for their 16-month-old son, Ben, who was a student at the Children’s Discovery Center. … Hours passed before the Changs were told Ben was found and safe. ‘All the kids were lying in their cots, with their blankets taking their nap as if nothing had gone wrong,’ Chang smiled. ‘And we just sat in this dark room and listened to the kids breathe and just have this experience of being together and feeling alive.’ Karen and the Changs stayed in touch through social media, but haven’t seen each other face to face for 14 years. 16-month-old Ben is now a teenager. Just days before this year’s anniversary, PIX11 cameras brought Karen, Art and Ben together, reunited at the 9/11 memorial.”","2754","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/11/hillary-falls-biden-rises-against-gop-field.html"

Walker, who grew up in Iowa, is now at 3 percent, ranking him in 10th place, according to a news release Friday morning. Trump tops another list, said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. Twenty-five percent of caucusgoers say they would ‘definitely not support’ Trump for the GOP nomination. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is next highest on this list with 23 percent, followed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 14 percent.” [The tally: Trump, 27 percent; Carson, 21 percent; Cruz, 9 percent; Bush, 6 percent; Carly Fiorina/John Kasich/Marco Rubio, 5 percent; Mike Huckabee/Rand Paul, 4 percent; Walker, 3 percent; Bobby Jindal, 2 percent; Christie/Lindsey Graham/Rick Perry/Rick Santorum, 1 percent] Power Play: Trump’s multi-front war - After weeks of successfully taunting and trolling Jeb Bush, Donald Trump has turned his attacks on Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina.

Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: • Jeb shifts attacks to Rubio • Power Play: Freaky Florida • Sanders and Carson cash in, Hillary and Jeb lower expectations • Classified emails pile up, weigh down Hillary • The fastest gondola JEB SHIFTS ATTACKS TO RUBIO Under pressure, Jeb Bush is hitting harder than ever against Sen. Marco Rubio, as Bush’s onetime protégé surpasses him in the polls. On the trail in New Hampshire Wednesday, Bush compared Rubio’s campaign message to that of President Obama and warned of a similar result if Rubio was elected. Pressed on his comments today in an interview with MSNBC, Bush went further. Bush said Rubio lacked the “leadership skills” and said that Rubio would not be able to “fix things” in Washington. It comes at a difficult moment for Bush as Russian strongman Vladimir Putin has, ahem, “reset” the 2016 presidential race. Russia’s offensive in Syria is a threshold moment that history will long record. Rather than just the ongoing efforts to reestablish “Great Russia” through the subduction of weak neighbor states and veiled (if thinly) military maneuvers, this is open aggression in a contested territory in the worst neighborhood in the world. And Putin’s military began the operations by targeting American-backed forces. When Moscow targets American proxies in a Third World hellhole, you know we’re all the way back to the bad old days. But as history collides with the venality of the 2016 presidential contests, it means particular problems for certain candidates, Bush among them. While he has recently embraced the idea that he is best situated to lead U.S. foreign affairs because he is “a Bush,” sorting out his brother’s Middle East legacy has proved, so far, intractable. As Bush comes to closer embrace his brother’s foreign policy, discussing how best to escalate a ground war in the region is a huge problem. Painting Rubio as unready and unsteady won’t be an easy task for Bush, though. He’s on the record from 2012 explicitly saying Rubio was more experienced than Obama and pushed Rubio as Mitt Romney’s running mate. But Bush’s shift from trying to engage with frontrunner Donald Trump to fourth-place Rubio is likely necessary given the worries that Bush’s early backers may abandon him for the ascendant Rubio. Rubio responds to Trump claims that Russian action is ‘wonderful’ - Sen. Marco Rubio responded to GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s claims that Russian leader Vladimir Putin fighting ISIS in Syria is “wonderful.” On Wednesday’s “The Kelly File” Rubio said, “Well, he’s wrong about that. And it’s just a misunderstanding about the reality of this. The purpose of what the Russians are doing is not to defeat ISIS. I mean, they ultimately -- they needed to defeat ISIS in Syria in order to protect Assad. But the purpose of this is to prop-up Assad.” Watch here. “I’m putting the people on notice that are coming here from Syria as part of this mass migration. If I win, they’re going back. They’re going back. I’m telling you. They’re going back.” – Donald Trump campaigning in New Hampshire [Trump customer data hacked - Time: “Hackers have infiltrated the Trump Hotel Collection in locations across the United States and Canada and perhaps stolen a year’s worth of credit card data.] Rand may get dumped from main stage for next debate - WSJ: “CNBC on Wednesday released its criteria for deciding which candidates will be allowed to participate in the Oct. 28 primetime debate, and which will be relegated to the earlier event. Candidates who average 3% in national polls conducted by NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, CNN and Bloomberg between Sept. 17 and Oct. 21 can join the top tier event…Candidates who rank at 2.5% or above in the polls have their numbers rounded up to 3%.

Drucker writes, “The RNC says it now has over 150 paid staff and 10,000 campaign volunteers scattered in key electoral battlegrounds and other states. Now, the national party wants to find out if its investment in manpower, technology and strategy development pays off in the form of a well-oiled political machine. The test, details of which were shared with the Washington Examiner, lasts throughout October… A few battleground states have been selected for extra attention and more detailed testing of the RNC plan, including Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia.” POWER PLAY: FREAKY FLORIDA GOP guru turned Georgetown Professor Brad Blakeman gives his take of the five seats most vulnerable to flip from red to blue.

You will not find her hawking cheap dishes at a discount store or hosting some game show that puts cupcake bakers in a culinary version of “The Running Man.” You will find her enjoying the tar out of life and offering, for the price of a cookbook, you permission to do the same. The food site Eater has a loving and surprising profile of “The Barefoot Contessa” as she prepares to take her 10th book to press. (She’s sold 10.6 million of the first nine installments.) And it’s really a love story. “It’s like when she saw [husband Jeffery], and ran towards a life they could make completely for themselves.

Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 45.3 percent//Disapprove – 49.4 percent Directions of Country: Right Direction – 26.8 percent//Wrong Track – 62.5 percent SANDERS AND CARSON CASH IN, HILLARY AND JEB LOWER EXPECTATIONS The end of the fundraising quarter hit Wednesday, and the totals aren’t looking good for either party’s establishment frontrunner. Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders shows a surge in money in this quarter. Sanders’ camp reports totals exceeding $26 million, with around $25 million in ‘cash on hand,’ according to the NYT. On the GOP side, Ben Carson not only continues a strong performance in the polls, but also announced a cool $20 million sum for his campaign this past quarter. With the online activist corps churning up giant sums for insurgent candidates, the establishment better show its clout, right? Uh-oh… Hardest hit was Hillary Clinton. Her campaign raised $28 million this fundraising quarter, a major drop from the record $47.5 million of last quarter. Her campaign explained to USA Today that donors aren’t as active in August with everyone taking the last of summer vacations. Woof. What’s bound to be even more worrisome for Clinton is the news that Sanders has passed the 1 million donor mark in online donations; that’s faster than then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008 who didn’t reach 1 million donors until the middle of primary season. This must feel like the replay of a nightmare for Clinton: starting the race as the obvious frontrunner only to find an insurgent from nowhere usurping what is rightfully yours. And this is without Vice President Joe Biden even in the picture… But things look just as worrisome for Jeb Bush, whose campaign is already seeking to lower expectations. Although ‘people involved with the campaign’ tell WSJ that they expect Bush to ‘surpass’ last quarter, when he raked in $11.4 million, they fail to mention that Bush was only an official candidate for six-weeks of that quarter. This fundraising deadline will be a far more important test for Bush, who continues to struggle in the polls, as he tries to persuade donors that he can gain some stable support. If Bush’s final number isn’t big enough to scare donors away from the rising Marco Rubio, his chances to dispatch his single most dangerous rival will quickly winnow. As other campaign totals roll in, a clearer narrative of the 2016 race will really start to take shape. Debate performances have been all over the map, and most of the top-tier have had their moments of shine and falter, but fundraising totals will tell if Carly Fiorina has the cash to make it through the primaries and how real Rubio’s threat is to Bush. This excludes Donald Trump who said he’s funding his own campaign, at least for now. Financials have a way of doing what the debates have been trying to do: weed out those with staying power from those who are merely a distraction. Many who fall in the latter category have hung in there with the hopes of catching fire, but ultimately it takes cash to pay the bills and those who don’t have it may have no choice on whether they can continue in this race. Puny numbers for candidates under the 5 percent line can quickly end long-shot hopes. Hillary disciplines donors - NYT: “After months of voicing doubt about a challenge from the vice president, Clinton campaign operatives are viewing Mr. Biden’s entry into the contest as a serious possibility and are trying to rally the party’s apparatus and its donors to her side. They have flooded uncommitted Democrats with emails, phone calls and a plea for them to sign a letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times.” CLASSIFIED EMAILS PILE UP, WEIGH DOWN HILLARY Fox News: “Dozens of emails in the State Department's latest release of Hillary Clinton emails contain information now deemed classified by the department. The release includes nearly 3,900 new emails. Of them, more than 200 have a ‘B1’ marking, which means they contain classified information. More than 100 of the messages were marked as ‘B5’ classification, which refers to internal deliberations by the Executive Branch and are exempt from disclosure to Congress and the public. However, some of the messages marked as such may be duplicates.” Jarrett swipes Hillary: She was warned on email - Top Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett ever-so-gently backed the bus over Hillary Clinton when asked at a think-tank chin wag whether the administration provided Clinton with instructions on email hygiene. “Yes, there were. Yeah, absolutely. … [T]here was guidance given that government business should be done on government emails, and that if you did use a private email, it should be turned over.” Pro-Republican group America Rising has the clip. In 2011, Hillary opposed nod to same-sex families, feared Palin - NRO: “An email included in the latest tranche of Clinton documents released by the State Department on Wednesday shows the then-secretary of state exploding at her staff over plans to replace ‘Mother’ and ‘Father’ with ‘Parent One’ and ‘Parent Two’ on passport application forms, complaining about the decision and refusing to defend it in the face of partisan opposition…[Clinton wrote:] ‘I could live w letting people in nontraditional families choose another descriptor so long as we retained the presumption of mother and father. We need to address this today or we will be facing a huge Fox-generated media storm led by [Sarah] Palin et al.’” THE JUDGES RULING: TOWARD A MODERN PAPACY? While many see Pope Francis’ new approach as a way to open the Church to non-believers Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano rules that this could actually damage the Church writing, “What if this papacy of novelty is as unsuccessful as Vatican II and churches soon empty because the Church changes with the wind, embraces the cult of personality and is disinterested in the Truth?” THE FASTEST GONDOLA UPI: “Police in Rome shared a snapshot of a man who was given a warning for cruising the Tiber River in an unusual boat -- a modified vintage Maserati car. The 40-year-old Italian man was stopped Sunday on the Tiber by Rome police and investigators confirmed his boat was a former sports car outfitted with an outboard motor and an open top to allow the man to stand while steering. Police said the man, who they determined had been warned by police numerous times in various locations for riding in his Maserati boat without proper authorization, told officers he started his journey in La Spezia and was trying to get to Venice.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “The United States is told by Russia one hour earlier that they’re going to go and attack ISIS. The Soviet Ministry announces they hit ISIS targets. Everyone knows it is a lie. Like all the lies that were issued in the Ukraine.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"The political events of 2015 are a brutal reminder about how far this country is from embracing libertarianism and how alien those ideas are even to the purported shock troops of the freedom movement.

"The collapse of the Rand Paul campaign speaks volumes. In a 15-person field, Paul is the only candidate who looks even remotely libertarian (social tolerance, foreign policy restraint, and limited government). He started the campaign with decent name recognition, a seat in the United States Senate, lavish media attention, a serious will to win, and a battle-tested, national political operation inherited from his father, Ron.","2763","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/02/collapse-rand-paul-and-libertarian-moment-that-never-was.html"

"The secret of Trump’s appeal to Paul’s base is that a large segment of the “Ron Paul Revolution” leavened its libertarianism with a pony keg of crazy. Birthers, 9/11 Truthers, a wide assortment of conspiracy theorists (many of whom believe the Federal Reserve to be a modern manifestation of the Illuminati), and naked racists rivaled the number of reasonably sober libertarian-ish voters among the faithful.","2768","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/02/collapse-rand-paul-and-libertarian-moment-that-never-was.html"

"According to a survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute, more than half the Tea Party is made up of the religious right while only 26 percent—the smallest ideological bloc within the group—can be loosely described as Libertarian.

Two percent.","2773","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/02/collapse-rand-paul-and-libertarian-moment-that-never-was.html"
"Sure, one can argue that Paul has run a sub-par campaign and that a more adroit effort would have produced better results. But given the above, it is hard to argue, as some do, that Paul would have done better had he run as more of a libertarian.","2774","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/02/collapse-rand-paul-and-libertarian-moment-that-never-was.html"

"The most thorough search for libertarian sentiment was conducted last year by the Pew Research Center. They asked 10,013 adults 23 questions about a variety of social and political issues and then used cluster analysis to sort respondents into homogeneous groups. Pew found that Americans who “resembled libertarians” form a group that is “too small to analyze”: no more than 5 percent of those surveyed.","2779","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/02/collapse-rand-paul-and-libertarian-moment-that-never-was.html"

"It has been noted, for instance, that 59 percent of the American public is, broadly speaking, libertarian in that they answer “yes” to the question “Would you define yourself as fiscally conservative and socially liberal?” Political scientists and campaign strategists, however, almost universally dismiss self-identification and general sentiment surveys as functionally meaningless. Both academic investigation and hard-earned political experience tell us that attitudes about specific governmental programs are far more telling than asking people what labels or characterizations describe them best.","2781","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/02/collapse-rand-paul-and-libertarian-moment-that-never-was.html"
"Libertarians, however, can take heart from the fact that political sentiment is moving their way in some areas. Gay rights, drug decriminalization, increasing outrage over heavy-handed police tactics, growing concern over an unjust legal system, disgust over crony capitalism, and opposition to military deployments abroad all suggest that libertarian arguments can have political force. But just because people buy libertarian arguments when it comes to civil liberties or foreign policy does not mean they are more likely to buy them on taxes, spending, or regulation. If they were, then Bernie Sanders Democrats would be Rand Paul Republicans.","2782","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/02/collapse-rand-paul-and-libertarian-moment-that-never-was.html"

"Until libertarians acknowledge that market verdict and re-think either what they’re selling, how they’re selling it, or both, they will remain on the margins of American political life.

"CNN’s chief political analyst Gloria Borger praised Clinton for having performed “extraordinarily well” and made herself “so adept at making herself the candidate of both experience and change.” In reality, both Clinton and Sanders probably helped themselves.

"POLL: WITH WOMEN, HILLARY’S IN THE DUST Hillary Clinton’s wagon train pulls into Iowa today as she looks to shore up support among women. And no wonder. While the campaign may have imagined they’d be rolling along by now with that key voter contingent, a new poll shows the wheels are wobbling badly and in danger of falling off. Losing “significant ground” over the past two months as she struggles with her email scandal, the Washington Post/ABC News national poll says that while Clinton still leads the field of Democrats, “…for the first time her support has dropped below 50 percent in Post-ABC surveys, with the biggest decline coming among white women.” The news comes on the heels of another poll out this weekend that shows her falling behind rival Bernie Sanders in Iowa, as she has in New Hampshire. [Florida diss? - Amid reports that the Clinton campaign is bolstering its efforts in the South, The Hill took a look at how some Palm Beach County Dems are feeling left out.] The WaPo-ABC poll, taken as the Clinton campaign set about its latest reset, shows her trajectory continuing to spiral downward. Leading 42 percent to Sander’s 24 percent among Democratic and Democrat-leaning voters, Clinton has seen a drop in support of 21 points since July, while Sanders has picked up 10 points. “She has lost ground with most demographic groups, but the sharpest drop has come among women and particularly white women,” [the poll says] “In July, 64 percent of white women said they supported Clinton; today, it is 31 percent, the same level of backing as Sanders, whose support has doubled among this group.” [She’ll ‘take that to heart,’ really - On the advice of a pastor to heed scripture, Clinton said at a church service Sunday she’ll be nicer to the press.] Women are a must-have for Hillary and the campaign knows it. But any reset or re-branding of a candidate with Clinton’s name recognition is a dubious prospect to begin with. Throw in the continued drip of her email mess and it’s hard to fathom how more humor and heart can reverse an erosion of support rooted in another key vulnerability: 56 percent of those in the WaPo-ABC poll say Clinton is not honest and trustworthy. With her campaign stuck on such a rutted road there’s little wonder the Sanders surge and talk of Joe’s revival continue to reverberate among Democrats. Biden meets big Obama bundler - Bloomberg: “…Fewer than 12 hours after the Colbert interview aired, Biden partook in a meeting that signaled something entirely different…It was held in secret at his hotel in Midtown Manhattan and lasted for more than 90 minutes: a private, one-on-one session with one of the most prominent and powerful fundraising stars in the Democratic firmament—a mega-bundler who happens to be, at least for now, publicly committed to Hillary Clinton. The bundler in question was Robert Wolf: the former chairman and CEO of UBS Americas, a prodigious buck-raker on behalf of Barack Obama in two successive campaigns…” Socialist Sanders takes campaign to Christian school - USA TODAY: “Sanders, a Vermont independent running for the Democratic presidential nomination, may test the limits of his appeal Monday when he speaks at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell. “I’m still looking hard for something he and I agree on,” school president and Falwell’s son, Jerry Falwell Jr., said with a laugh during a recent interview. “I’m pretty conservative but I think some of the things he said about the middle class being destroyed in this country, I think that is a problem. He and I may not agree on how to fix that, but I’m open to hearing what he’s got to say.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Mermaids have fascinated human beings since the earliest voyagers set to the seas. Often illustrated in Greek mythology as a “siren,” the depiction of a mermaid combined a woman’s seductive charms with the dangers of early ships landing on foreign coastlines, often leading to shipwrecks. Sirens, or mermaids, were blamed for these disasters as they supposedly used there charms to lure men of the seas into danger. Tales spread and the image of mermaids changed from dangerous sea nymphs to Daryl Hannah washing ashore in “Splash,” but audience’s fascination with mermaids continues to create a high demand in today’s entertainment industry. As Fast Company explains, “Today, there are close to 1,000 full-time mermaids and mermen in the United States, according to the estimates of various experts I spoke with in the mer-community. These merfolk spend their days modeling in shimmering tails, performing for audiences in underwater tanks, and delighting children by making surprise appearances at their pool parties…The mermaid economy is positively booming.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

At a town hall meeting in Las Vegas, Walker will propose eliminating unions for employees of the federal government, making all workplaces right-to-work unless individual states vote otherwise, scrapping the federal agency that oversees unfair labor practices and making it more difficult for unions to organize. Many of Walker’s proposals are focused on unions for workers at all levels of government, while others would also affect private-sector unions. Labor law experts said such an effort, if successful, would substantially reduce the power of organized labor in America. While Walker could enact some of the proposals via presidential executive order, others would require an act of Congress or changes in federal regulations. The goal, Walker said, is ‘to achieve fairness and opportunity for American workers.’” Walker PAC beefs up Iowa game - WaPo: “Ahead of President Obama’s visit to Des Moines on Monday afternoon, a super PAC supporting Scott Walker’s run for president took out a full-page ad in the Des Moines Register…The ad touts three of Walker’s achievements as governor in Wisconsin: replacing a budget deficit with a surplus, cutting taxes by $2 billion and cutting the state’s unemployment rate in half. The bottom of the ad reads: ‘Tired of President Obama? Stand with Scott Walker -- the only conservative running for President who’s defeated him.’” And he’s got his staff everywhere…literally - The [Eastern Iowa] Gazette: “Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has announced campaign leaders in every one of Iowa’s 99 counties as he continues to build his organization in the lead-up to the first-in-the-nation precinct caucuses Feb. 1…securing grass-roots leadership in all 99 counties is even more valuable, according to Walker, because ‘the Iowa caucuses are the ultimate grass-roots organization exercise.’” Rubio pulls out all stops in Iowa ahead of Obama education visit - In a Des Moines Register op-ed, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., name-checks President Obama over higher education reform arguing that high school students should have options besides a four-year degree including a path to a good-paying job. Rubio also has a new web video which focuses more on choice in the pre-K through high school years. Jeb vows to come out swinging - Reuters: “[Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla.] plans to take a more aggressive tack at the debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. ‘If someone comes at me, bam! I’ll come back at ‘em,’ he said in Salem, smacking a fist into a palm. ‘I’ll campaign hard.’ Bush has mocked Trump, branding him a Democrat in disguise with past positions favoring higher taxes and past expressions of admiration of Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. [In the crease - Jeb 2016 is running a full-page hockey-themed ad in the New Hampshire Union Leader, highlighting Bush’s conservative governing record. The ad compares Bush’s “hat trick” as the #1 Tax Cutter, #1 Spending Cutter and #1 Job Creator to the rest of the major Republican candidates in the field who have served as governors.] Latino group counterprograms Trump in Texas - USA Today: “Latino activists in Dallas are planning a rush-hour ‘Dump the Trump’ march Monday evening to counter an expected massive city rally for GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump, Texas media reported. Local chapters of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and other area activist groups said they planned to bus protesters in from as far away as Houston to ‘march against hate,’ said Domingo Garcia, a Dallas lawyer and president of LULAC Council 102. Trump is scheduled to speak at Dallas’ American Airlines Center at Victory Park… The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that the rally’s 20,000 free tickets were gone by Friday afternoon…” Carson dials down Trump faith flap - In an interview with WSJ, Ben Carson explained why he felt the need to apologize to Donald Trump. He said, “I said something that sounded like I was questioning his faith. I really wasn’t, I was really talking more about mine. But it was said in an inappropriate way, which I recognized and I apologized for that. It’s never my intention to impugn other people.” [Programming Note: Chris will be back with the GOP and Democratic Power Index next Monday.] A NEW STANDARD OF ‘SELF’ UPI: “Bhanu Prakash, 24, recently quit his full time job as a research assistant at a hospital to become a record-breaking selfie taker. Prakash said he was inspired by the achievements of Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, who took 105 selfies in three minutes in May. The current world record holder is American football player Patrick Peterson, who managed to take 1,449 selfies in one hour. Prakash also negates claims that selfies are ‘just a girl thing.’ He further claims his personal record is currently 1,700 but seeks to raise the number to 1,800. Prakash also says he is keeping up with hand and wrist exercises, essential to being able to hold a phone for so long. Initially apprehensive, Prakash’s family now supports his dream. Prakash will formally attempt to break the world record on Sept. 18.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

"MYTHICAL CREATURES ABOUND ON GUN CONTROL One of the reasons that business is so good for false prophets in politics these days is that it works so well – at least when it comes to raising money and winning elections. And when your prophecies don’t come to pass, the way out is simple. You just point at the unicorn barn. That’s where the other guys – the bad guys who are too scared, too stupid or too corrupt – keep the solutions locked away. Republicans won’t agree to an unconditional increase to the debt limit? Mint a $1 trillion coin, Mr. President. Supreme Court rules against conservatives on same-sex marriage? Simple: Just ignore the court. Any criticism of the plans can be brushed away by calling for another unicorn release (FYI: they eat mostly Frankenberry and pepperoni pizza Combos): “winning the messaging war” or similar claptrap that imagines an unpopular point of view will garner more support in the midst of a vicious public struggle. Or that shame somehow still exists in American civic life. None of this is to say that politicians don’t sometimes fail because they are scared (often), stupid (sigh) or corrupt (occasionally). Stipulated. But the unicorn wranglers are the ones who exploit the failing system by making impossible promises. Last week, President Obama rustled up a whole herd of unicorns on the issue of gun control. To listen to the president, one would have assumed that there was a piece of legislation or a serious proposal under consideration that would have prevented the most recent campus killings. In this version, Republicans are too scared, stupid and corrupt to allow this “common sense” legislation to advance. But that’s not the case. In recent years, Democrats have focused mostly on closing loopholes in federal background checks – especially on private sales. But in none of the recent mass shootings that spur these occasional surges in media interest in gun control has the so-called “gun-show loophole” been a factor. There were lapses in the application of existing laws and failures to report obvious mental illnesses, certainly, but not one used a private sale to circumvent the law. We had a similarly disjointed conversation after the 2012 massacre in Newtown, Conn. Then, the focus was on banning certain weapons, and reinstating the lapsed “assault weapons” ban. But that turned out to be false prophecy, too. So the movement moved back to the background check argument. The president knows about these disconnections. But, he argued Thursday, it is appropriate to politicize the moments that refocus public attention on the issue of gun laws. Well, maybe. It’s certainly fine to use a searing incident to advance legislation to prevent its recurrence. But it’s neither wise nor appropriate to exploit a tragedy for achieving a substantially unrelated goal. There’s no way to know how many or how few of the more than 11,000 homicides committed with firearms in 2013 (the most recent data available) were facilitated by a private sale. If you want to close the loophole, then find the victims of it and make martyrs of them. But don’t placate your political base and stoke contributors on the grounds that you have a solution. And certainly don’t do so with the deaths of citizens as props. But who wants to tell voters a sad story about complicated public safety in a world where pistols outnumber functional families, of unraveled communities and the pharmacological palliatives pasted on top of them? Calling to regulate the firearms industry more sure sounds better. There is one plan that might arguably prevent mass shootings. The president made passing reference to something in the vein when he mentioned that Australia had changed its laws in response to a mass shooting there. What he was referring to was a 1996 law that enacted a sweeping ban on many firearms, including existing ones, and set rigid requirements for gun licenses. A ban and mass confiscations might work (or it might not) but at least it is on topic. But is the president really ready to lead the fight for a constitutional amendment to allow such a thing? Or wreck the remainder of his presidency in a legal fight over the Second Amendment he would surely lose? Most likely, Obama will blame the bad guys in the other side and then fill the feedbags with Frankenberry. On to the next fundraiser, guys. And now we know what Hillary Clinton is going to do, too. Giddyup. 2016 Democratic Power Index: Flagging frontrunner - 1) Hillary Clinton; 2) Joe Biden; 3) Bernie Sanders; 4) Martin O’Malley; 5) Jim Webb; 6) Elizabeth Warren; 7) Lincoln Chafee KNOWN UNKNOWNS: BIDEN BACK AND FORTH ABOUT RUN Chris Cillizza ably describes the terrain as Vice President Joe Biden makes a final decision about a presidential run. One Democratic strategist who has talked with Biden insiders about the run told Fox News First that it seemed the team was trying to “get to yes” and that many had already made up their minds. Cillizza asks the right questions about a hypothetical Biden run: “But what happens from there? Are undecided Democratic voters reminded of the things — his tendency to just say stuff, his long years spent in official Washington, etc. — that made Biden less than appealing as a candidate for the big job during his past two bids? Or would a Biden candidacy lead to a reevaluation of Clinton by many establishment types who have stayed with her simply because they can’t imagine backing Sanders? Could Biden, under this scenario, trigger a full-scale revolt against Clinton by some (or many) of the establishment building blocks of her candidacy?” Bernie crowds break records again - Byron York checks the temperature on the Bernie Sanders movement in Boston. The answer: “In 2007, candidate Barack Obama, drawing rockstar crowds on his way to the White House, held a rally on Boston Common that drew 10,000 people. It was the biggest political gathering in Massachusetts in decades. On Saturday Bernie Sanders brought more than twice that number, an estimated 24,000, to the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center -- close to 20,000 inside the cavernous building and the rest watching a big screen outside.” IT’S OFFICIAL: HASSAN CHALLENGES AYOTTE Roll Call: “Gov. Maggie Hassan announced Monday she is challenging GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte for Senate in the Granite State, rather than seek a third term as governor. It’s a move Democrats say gives the party its best shot at picking up a seat that will prove critical to Senate control…. In recent months, a handful of polls found Hassan and Ayotte tied in a head-to-head match-up. And Democrats say Hassan will be a strong fundraiser with a proven history of winning statewide in New Hampshire. But Ayotte starts the race with a significant cash on hand advantage and the power of incumbency, giving her a slight edge more than a year from Election Day.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… National Geographic: “In a study published recently in the journal Animal Behaviour, [Kaeli Swift] found that American crows associate people seen handling dead crows with danger, and can be wary of feeding near such people. At the start of her two-year experiment, Swift put out food at over a hundred sites where in Washington State, which attracted breeding and nesting crows. Swift then had about 25 human volunteers don masks and asked them to stand near the food for 30 minutes, in clear view of the crows…Each volunteer was either holding a dead crow, standing near a dead red-tailed hawk—a crow predator—or standing near a dead red-tailed hawk holding the dead crow…As the control variable in the experiment…there was either no volunteer present or one who was empty-handed. Almost universally, the crows responded to seeing the people and dead birds by ‘scolding’—or putting out an alert call to other crows.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

This week’s Power Index reflects the shifting ground in two of those states. Especially in New Hampshire where this month’s NBC/WSJ Marist poll shows Carly Fiorina making a 10-point leap: from 6 percent last month to 16 percent this month. She still trails frontrunner Donald Trump, but her Granite State surge shows a potential path for Fiorina who has been mostly surfing the national zeitgeist. The bad news was for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, whose numbers receded after a media blitz from his super PAC helped get him to the top tier there. He now sits in seventh place behind fellow all-or-nothing-in-New Hampshire candidate Gov. Chris Christie. But if anyone has a reason to breathe a sigh of relief at this poll it’s Jeb Bush who gained 3 points and finished in third place, but not enough to offset continuing national woes. Bush spent the weekend weathering the fallout from saying “stuff happens” about a recent mass shooting. It may not have an immediate effect on Bush’s polling, but now is certainly not the time that Bush can afford to look wobbly before skeptical donors. The early state verdict on poll-leading Trump: he led both surveys but showed new weakness, especially in New Hampshire where Trump saw a 7-point decrease. 1) Ted Cruz; 2) Carly Fiorina [+1]; 3) Marco Rubio [+1]; 4) Jeb Bush [-2]; 5) Donald Trump; 6) Ben Carson; 7) Chris Christie [+1]; 8) John Kasich [-1]; 9) Mike Huckabee; 10) Bobby Jindal [previously unranked] On the radar: Rand Paul, Rick Santorum,Lindsey Graham, George Pataki, Jim Gilmore What would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index we will share the best and brightest with the whole class. Send your thoughts to FOXNEWSFIRST@FOXNEWS.COM [Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins “The Real Story” in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who’s up and who’s down in the 2016 Power Index.] Jeb may call in big brother to save South Carolina - NYT: “Tim Miller, Jeb Bush’s communications director, suggested that the campaign was open to having George Bush appear at rallies for his brother before the [South Carolina’s] primary in February. ‘To the extent it makes sense on the campaign, we’re going to be happy to have his support, and I know President Bush is willing to help,’ Mr. Miller said…As for the danger of the former president’s undermining his brother’s prospects in a general election, supporters of Jeb Bush believe the Democrats will try to link the two regardless of whether George Bush engages more in the contest.” Hits keep coming: Media mangles Carly - The Daily Beast found that the group that manages Carly Fiorina’s philanthropic fund also has clients that direct donations to Planned Parenthood. So what? One could argue that by the same logic that Republicans use to say that taxpayer funding for the group’s non-abortion-related activities, Fiorina’s patronage of the firm generates revenues that facilitate its overall operations, thereby indirectly supporting the Planned Parenthood contributions of others. You wouldn’t know that from the lede of the story, which is part of the ongoing media irradiation of the only female GOP contender, but that’s the crux: “Asked if Fiorina has a problem with Ayco distributing funds to Planned Parenthood, and if she’s ever lobbied them to stop, [campaign spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores] said, “Carly has no control over those clients and their giving preferences.” Asked why Fiorina doesn’t just find a donor-advised fund that vows never to give money to Planned Parenthood on behalf of anyone, Flores didn’t respond.” [But along with the press lashing, Fiorina’s rise has given her the chance to make her case to deep-pocketed donors in the Koch network. Or so says Reuters.] POWER PLAY: TWO-FRONT WAR ON PLANNED PARENTHOOD Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge is locked in a fight in her state over defunding Planned Parenthood, and making a push for the Supreme Court to reconsider Arkansas’ struck-down ban on abortions after the first trimester. She tells Chris Stirewalt how the battle is going. WATCH HERE. NEWT, RYAN RALLY TO MCCARTHY Presenting himself as a uniter, Jason Chaffetz, R- Utah, announced his bid Sunday to become the next House speaker, challenging next-in-line Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and vowing to “bridge the divide” that has roiled the chamber’s Republican caucus. “I’m offering myself as an alternative,’ Chaffetz told “Fox News Sunday.” Chaffetz’s entry may be uniting Republicans, but perhaps not as he had intended. McCarthy appears to have the support of a majority of House Republicans – making him the likely winner of a closed-door election set for Thursday. While neither McCarthy nor Chaffetz appear to have a clear path to the necessary 218 votes from the full House later this month, McCarthy is rallying. He now has support from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich calling McCarthy “far and away the best man to be Speaker” Scalise claims he’s got the votes - WaPo: “Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) said Sunday he has secured enough votes to be elected House majority leader in elections scheduled for Thursday, putting him in position to move a rung up on the GOP leadership ladder. Scalise, the sitting majority whip, made the announcement in an evening conference call with supporters. He said he won the commitment of his 124th supporter in recent days, giving him the requisite margin in the 247-member House Republican Conference, according to three people familiar with the call.” [Despite a push by some members to delay the elections, Boehner’s office tells Fox News’ Chad Pergram “All leadership elections remain on Thursday.”] Tweetstorm - Deriding the media’s framing of Speaker’s race as a “[R]eductionistic choice: small-ball Establishment vs wild-eyed Visigoths who want to burn govt to ground,” Nebraska’s junior Sen. Ben Sasse had an unexpected nomination for the lower chamber’s leadership. OH, IN THAT CASE… Yahoo!: “A driver will not be facing criminal charges for having a brown bear in the back of his car - because the animal was apparently wearing a seatbelt. The astonishing images were caught on camera in Yekaterinburg, Russia, earlier this month. Stunned motorists couldn’t believe their eyes when they spotted the bear lounging in the rear of the Volga. They even saw it playfully sticking its head out of the window…Local police said it was not illegal to transport bears in this way - as long as they wore a seatbelt, in accordance with the Russian road traffic laws. They did not specify whether they had spoken with the driver or how they had verified that the bear was wearing a seatbelt. But officers confirmed they would not be taking any legal action against the driver.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

"WELL OF COURSE HILLARY WON Hillary Clinton certainly won the first Democratic debate. But if she couldn’t have beaten that forlorn bunch she should have suspended her campaign immediately. On stage were five candidates with a median age of 65, and the only current office holder isn’t even a Democrat, but rather an independent socialist who called for “political revolution” – and was seconded! Here was Clinton facing an even weaker field than Mitt Romney in 2012 – which is saying something – with the added advantage that her supposed rivals spent as much time praising her as they did offering oblique, usually embarrassed, criticisms. While Sen. Bernie Sanders’ fans no doubt liked what they heard about redistributing the stuffing out of Wall Street and moving toward a Scandinavian-style system (seriously), his biggest moment of the night came when he absolved Clinton of her current scandal surrounding secret servers, hidden emails and classified information – rendering it dead and buried as a consideration for her primary rivals. But they may not even be rivals anymore, if they ever were. The former senators, Lincoln “The Block” Chafee and Jim “Father Time” Webb, were at the wrong debate. Webb was talking about the benefits of coal, gun rights and battlefield valor in Vietnam and Chafee playing up spending controls and tax cuts – they might as well have been speaking Mandarin. Martin O’Malley tried to confront Clinton, but appeared instead to be running for America’s assistant principal, exuding his disappointment in a condescending tone. Depending on what O’Malley’s campaign costs to run and what he can raise, he can presumably hang in until the Iowa caucuses hoping for the weather to change. But we were not looking at the man who was going to break the Clinton machine. Unless Vice President Joe Biden gets into the race – which looks less likely after the thumping Clinton delivered to her foes and her recent uptick in the polls – Clinton is getting back on the coronation track. But how she’s going about it matters. Clinton’s central talking point of the night was her own gender. Americans want an outsider not an insider? She’s outside the male gender, amirite sisters? Her difference from Obama: XX chromosome, y’all! Why was she late getting back from the potty? Lady stuff, Anderson. You wouldn’t understand… So that’s not going to cut it. Like Romney in 2012, she lacks the trust or passion of her party’s base. So like him, she has to shackle herself to unpopular or electorally dangerous stances on issues in a bid to secure a win. There was plenty of loose talk about topics – gun control, global warming, crime and bank regulations, to name four – that would be fine fodder for general election attack ads and talking points. And most of all, Clinton embraced the idea of running for a third Obama term. That helps keep Biden on the sidelines, but will be a drag with persuadable voters next year. If things are coming to a quick conclusion, she still has time to un-flip some of the flops, or at least scale them back. But if Biden burns more time on the clock and Sanders and his army keep the pressure on – and one can expect they will – she will have to wait awhile. And the longer she has to wait to pivot, the more ungainly it will be. Bernie rakes in $1.3 million post-debate - WaPo: “The presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said it raised $1.3 million Tuesday in the four hours after the Democratic debate began. Sanders appears to have successfully parlayed his most-talked about moment during the debate — telling Hillary Rodham Clinton that ‘the American people are sick and tired of talking about your damn e-mail’ — into a sharp uptick in donations.” [Watch Fox: New Fox News poll numbers release on President Obama’s job rating during “Special Report with Bret Baier” 6 p.m. ET] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Hear, hear! New Yorker: “Like many canonized works, [Henry David Thoreau’s ‘Walden’] is more revered than read, so it exists for most people only as a dim impression retained from adolescence or as the source of a few famous lines: ‘I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately.’ ‘If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.’ ‘Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity!’ Extracted from their contexts, such declarations read like the text on inspirational posters or quote-a-day calendars – purposes to which they are routinely put. Together with the bare facts of the retreat at Walden, those lines have become the ones by which we adumbrate Thoreau, so that our image of the man has also become simplified and inspirational. In that image, Thoreau is our national conscience: the voice in the American wilderness, urging us to be true to ourselves and to live in harmony with nature. This vision cannot survive any serious reading of ‘Walden.’” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

In the latest Fox News poll, Fiorina saw a dip in support since the September poll – dropping 4 points to sixth place overall. As New Analytics predicted in Friday’s edition of The Edge, press and public interest in Fiorina had plummeted as the glow of her debate victory faded. But Fiorina ranks in the top five candidates of those people would “definitely vote for” at 30 percent, with 22 percent saying they need more information about her before deciding. She also hits a high mark of people who “might vote for” her at 35 percent. Fiorina still has room to grow, and voters like her. And with the campaign announcing they raked in $6.8 million, outpacing Sen. Marco Rubio, she will have the funds to do it. Fiorina lands in third place for fundraising totals among totals released so far. And her campaign is spending carefully. She even flies coach. Fiorina ends her hot streak with more money, better poll position and stronger organization than she began it. If she gets another good run in this month’s debate, she could really be ready to capitalize. And best of all for her, her boom was not followed by a bust as is so often for candidates in the early going. Jeb gets top N.H.

David Drucker wonders:“Have Republicans given up on getting rid of Obamacare? It’s a poignant question when Donald Trump, the GOP presidential front-runner, supports the concept of nationalized, government-administered health care. Meanwhile, candidates with detailed plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have gained little traction for their effort. One, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, remains a long shot in the race; another, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, dropped out for lack of support soon after unveiling his proposal. ‘I would put Obamacare at the top of a list of issues that are simmering below the surface,’ Jindal campaign pollster Wes Anderson said Tuesday. ‘It’s going to be an issue.’ That appears to be the consensus of Republicans working in the trenches — that GOP primary voters will eventually get around to prioritizing where the 2016 contenders stand on President Obama’s landmark overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system.” POWER PLAY: RYAN, HOUSE GOP BALK AT SHOTGUN WEDDING As Rep.

"HILLARY HOPES TO BEAT THE RAP ON A TECHNICALITY Have you ever watched a courtroom drama in which the judge dramatically declares that a whole swath of evidence is inadmissible because its origins were tainted? That’s what Hillary Clinton is hoping Democrats do for her today with her first television ad. The new spot no doubt will add further anguish to Republicans contemplating the speakership of Kevin McCarthy. And it will, no doubt, certainly help frame the former secretary of state’s testimony later this month about the deadly raid of 2012 in Benghazi, Libya. But the point here is primarily about locking up a primary which has proved remarkably difficult for Clinton. She should not be trailing the 74-year-old socialist senator from Vermont anywhere, not even New Hampshire. And Vice President Joe Biden’s bubble should’ve popped a long time ago. While the two of them have certainly had their disagreements, she and Biden represent essentially the same part of the Democratic Party. Remember: that’s why Barack Obama picked Biden as his running mate in 2008. Her problems certainly stem from her acknowledged struggle to interact with human beings. A manful effort by her media partners at NBC for the past week notwithstanding, Clinton still struggles with empathy. But Clinton’s biggest problem is the same one that her establishment counterpart on the Republican side has: electability. Usually the domain of underdogs and outsiders, it is the runners in the inside lanes who have the electability woes in this topsy cycle. For Jeb Bush, his electability problems don’t relate to him as much as they relate to his last name (though he certainly is making an effort to be his own man in that regard, too). For Clinton, the reason she is faring so poorly against her would-be general election rivals is that Americans broadly mistrust her and there is baggage still to unpack. Given her misleading, obfuscatory and facile answers to the persistent scandals that have dogged her candidacy, Democrats have good reason to believe that there is more to come. With Clinton comes of possibility of catastrophic failure. That’s true of any candidate. But in Clinton’s case the percentage possibility is just too high that her campaign for the White House could end with a press conference in a U.S. attorney’s office or the release of emails so politically damaging that she has to pull the plug on her own campaign. Even if it were only a 10 percent chance of total meltdown, it would be too high for most Democrats. So what Clinton is trying to do is get off on a technicality – to rule much of the evidence against her inadmissible. No one would know about the server, or the classified emails if it wasn't for those pesky kids in Congress. And while it might seem a little too rich to have one of the most politically calculating operators in recent memory complaining about political calculation in others, it won’t take much to convince Democrats that the Republicans are out to get her. The revival of the impeachment-era effort to declare facts void because of their provenance may in fact help Democrats rally to her side in this time of need, but it will be the evidence that is revealed that will damn or save her campaign. It’s what is revealed over the next year that counts, whatever context in which Clinton places it. So just to recap what ought to cause Democrats worry, regardless of how the scandal sled got going: Monday revealed long-time Clinton aide Philippe Reines misled reporters about his own use of private email at the State Department when reports surfaced that he had corresponded with reporters about official business on his own private email. Another Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, triple-dipped while working for the State Department, Clinton Foundation, and consulting firm Teneo simultaneously. Documents pertaining to her will come out later this week. Clinton claimed that she willingly turned over all of her emails to be transparent, but… nope. She also promised the public (and her party) that her server would remain private and that potentially embarrassing emails had been destroyed, but it’s now being combed through by the FBI. And speaking of that server, Clinton also claimed she didn’t send any classified material. Oops. REPORT: BIDEN LEAKED SON’S DYING WISH It’s getting rough out there... In a story that must thrill Team Hillary, Politico reports that “…it was Biden himself who talked to [NYT Columnist Maureen Dowd], painting a tragic portrait of a dying son, Beau’s face partially paralyzed, sitting his father down and trying to make him promise to run for president because ‘the White House should not revert to the Clintons and that the country would be better off with Biden values.’” [Milbank: “Finally, it can be reported: Joe Biden is running for president, unless he isn’t. He will announce his decision this weekend, unless he doesn’t.”] Trade deal squeezes Hillary - Monday’s announcement of a Pacific trade pact puts Hillary Clinton in a tight predicament: please her liberal base or risk the wrath of her former boss. Sen. Bernie Sanders came out fast, calling the trade deal “disastrous,” and with union support in the balance Clinton can ill-afford to add to the erosion on the left. But with chaffing points on issues like Syria and the Keystone XL pipeline already raw, an open break by Clinton on a key Obama legacy policy could result in the president nudging Joe Biden to run. Clinton’s ambiguous wait-and see position on the trade deal presumably at an end, pressure to cease the waffling is quickly building. Bernie’s gun conundrum - WaPo: “Sanders (I-Vt.), said Monday that his campaign is assembling a ‘comprehensive package’ of measures to address gun violence and that he believes there is a way to bridge the country’s deep political divisions over the issue…Gun control remains a challenging issue for Sanders, who by nearly every other measure has the most progressive record in the Democratic field. But Sanders represents a largely rural state with a strong hunting tradition and relatively few restrictions on firearms, and he has a mixed voting record that includes opposition to the landmark Brady Bill in 1993 and support of legislation in 2005 that shielded gun manufacturers from lawsuits.” [Watch Fox: Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner joins Gretchen Carlson on “The Real Story” at 2 p.m. ET.] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… The Telegraph: “The sketches and paintings, if proved to be authentic, would be worth an estimated [$785,701,000]. Experts said that after two years of rigorous analysis, they had found ‘remarkable similarities’ between the newly-discovered works, kept in a castle in Milan, and the known works of Caravaggio. But the announcement came out of the blue, caused an immediate storm in the art world and raised as many questions as it answered. The historians apparently managed to keep their research a secret for two years, but on Friday their findings will be published in a lavish, two-volume, 600-page e-book in four languages. The works are believed to date from Caravaggio’s earliest years as a painter, when he was a young apprentice under Simone Peterzano, a mannerist painter in Milan, from 1584 to 1588.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Fiorina feels the attacks will continue because she is conservative, she said on [‘The Kelly File’] Monday night. ‘There are a lot of liberals who find me kind of scary right now, because I am doing really well in the polls and – horror of horrors – I am a conservative woman,’ Fiorina said, referring to a recent attack by MSNBC against her for allegedly mismanaging money and failing to pay vendors for their work on her 2010 California Senate campaign. The former Hewlett-Packard CEO explained that those debts were paid, and then called out the media for failing to make a story out of Hillary Clinton’s campaign debt, which she held for over four years that was roughly 40 times the size of Fiorina’s.” It’s like Uber, but for presidential campaigns - Sen. Marco Rubio addresses a crowd in New York today on the challenges government and business face in the “sharing economy.” In an advance look at his remarks, Rubio says, “And it’s not just the fact that the economy is changing; it’s the fact that it’s changing faster than ever. It took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users. It took CandyCrush one year! Yet while our economy is changing, our government is not. And both parties are to blame.” [Senior National Correspondent John Roberts takes an inside look at Rubio’s family life and time on the trail. Watch here.] Cruz’s Nevada team looks beefy - Las Vegas Sun: “Nevada Assembly Majority Whip Jim Wheeler … is backing Ted Cruz for president…Wheeler is the second prominent Nevada leader to endorse a presidential candidate in two days after Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker backed out of the race two weeks ago.” Walker mega-donor backs five GOPers- WaPo: “Stanley Hubbard, a major financial backer of Scott Walker before his campaign for president fizzled, recently made the maximum allowable contribution to Jeb Bush’s campaign … he gave to former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.” Jeb sticking with Iowa effort - Ahead of an Iowa sweep this week, Jeb Bush is out with a new video highlighting his record as Florida governor. Bush starts his three-day trip today in the Quad Cities. BAIER TRACKS: TRUMP TIME ON ‘SPECIAL REPORT’ “Donald Trump is seemingly omnipresent in the media – but tonight he makes his first-ever appearance on ‘Special Report’ since he joined the race in June. (It’s also the first time Trump will sit down with any of the three moderators from the Fox News debate in August.) We are 118 days away from the Iowa Caucuses and while Trump still leads big in almost every poll - the race seems on the cusp of a shift as his opponents jockey for position behind him. I plan to ask about foreign policy and domestic policy as well as his brand of presidential politics… plus some things that he has not been asked before. Tune in tonight at 6 pm ET.” - Bret Baier. [What now? - Watch Chris Stirewalt on “The Kelly File” lays out Trump’s potential paths forward as public opinion shifts.] READERS REACT: 2016 GOP POWER INDEX “Ted Cruz’[s] #1 Power Ranking should put fear into the hearts of Republicans who actually want to win the 2016 general election. The nomination of either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz will assure a Democrat in the White House – Trump has huge negatives in surveys among all voters…” – Jim Hartman “You are liberal republican fantasy purveyors. The more [T]rump is denigrated, the more respect he will get. Trump or 3rd party for non-country club establishment [R]epublicans!!!!!!!” – Roy Upton “Doesn’t anyone listen to Marco Rubio! So far I have not heard him trying to get brownie points by trashing anyone. By far he is the most eligible to be the next president. Just listen to what he has to say. Fiorina has done her homework as far as knowing what to say, but not enough knowledge to be president.” – Peggy McCormack WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS… WILL PROBABLY BE THOUGHTFUL, ERUDITE The American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution will host another pre-debate panel, this time in Las Vegas ahead of the first Democratic showdown on Oct. 13. The lunchtime panel will discuss demographic changes in 2016 with a special emphasis on the Mountain West. Data gurus Ruy Teixeira and Karlyn Bowman will both be in the mix.

A LIGHT BLUE TOWEL WITH BLOODSHOT EYES IS WANTED FOR QUESTIONING The Youngstown Vindicator: “[Austintown, Ohio] police were called to a home Friday night by a man who complained he was ‘too high’ after smoking marijuana. According to a police report, authorities were called … by a 22-year old male who had smoked the drug. The officer who responded to the home could hear the man groaning from a room. The officer then found the man lying ‘on the floor in the fetal position’ and ‘was surrounded by a plethora of Doritos, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish and Chips Ahoy cookies,’ the report said. The man also told police he couldn’t feel his hands. A glass pipe with marijuana residue, two packs of rolling papers, two roaches and a glass jar of marijuana were recovered from the man’s car after he gave the keys to police. The man declined medical treatment at the home Friday night. Austintown police have not charged the man in the incident as of late Monday morning.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “What [Hillary Clinton] is counting on – which I think actually works – is that the public is not going to follow each of these statements.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.
