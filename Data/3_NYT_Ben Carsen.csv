"Late in February, Dr. Ben Carson, the celebrated pediatric neurosurgeon turned political insurrectionist, was trying to check off another box on his presidential-campaign to-do list: hiring a press secretary. The lead prospect, a public-relations specialist named Deana Bass, had come to meet him at the dimly lit Capitol Hill office of Carson’s confidant and business manager, Armstrong Williams. Carson sat back and scrutinized her from behind a small granite table, as life-size cardboard cutouts of more conventional politicians — President Obama, with a tight smile, and Senator John McCain, glowering — loomed behind each of his shoulders. (The mock $3 bill someone had left on a table in Williams’s waiting room undercut any notion that this was a bipartisan zone; it featured Obama wearing a turban.)","MARCH 17, 2015","1","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Bass seemed momentarily speechless, and not just because no one had warned her that a New York Times reporter would be sitting in on her job interview. Though she knew Williams — a jack-of-all-trades entrepreneur who owns several television stations and a public-affairs business and who hosts a daily talk-radio show — through Washington’s small circle of black conservatives, the two hadn’t spoken in years until he called her two days earlier. He had been struggling to come up with the perfect national spokesperson, he told her. Then, at the gym, her name popped into his head; Williams was fairly certain she was the one. Sitting across from a likely candidate for president, Bass was adjusting to the idea that her life might be about to take a sudden chaotic turn.","2","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"“It’s like getting the most random call on a Monday that you simply do not see coming,” she said. “Oftentimes, that is how the Lord works.”","3","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Carson concurred: “It’s always how he works in my life.” Carson is soft-spoken and often talks with his eyes half closed, frequently punctuating his sentences with a small laugh, even if the humor of his statement is not readily apparent. Bass told Carson that she had been a Republican staff member on Capitol Hill then worked for the Republican National Committee. In 2007 she started a Christian public-relations firm with her sister. She enjoyed working on the Hill, she said, but the pay wasn’t as high as the hours were long. “We figured that we worked like slaves for other people, and we wanted to work for ourselves.”","4","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Carson stopped her. “You know you can’t mention that word, right?” Carson waited a beat, then laughed, and Williams and Bass joined in. He was getting to the point; he needed a professional who could help him check his penchant for creating uncontrolled controversy just by talking.","5","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"The Ben Carson movement began in 2013, when Carson, a neurosurgeon, whose operating-room prowess and up-from-poverty back story had made him the subject of a television movie and a regular on the inspirational-speaking circuit, was invited to address the annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. With Barack Obama sitting just two seats away, Carson warned that “moral decay” and “fiscal irresponsibility” could destroy America just as it did ancient Rome. He proposed a substitute for Obamacare — Health Savings Accounts, which, he said, would end any talk of “death panels” — and a flat-tax based on the concept of tithing. His address, combined with the president’s stony reaction, was a smash with Republican activists. Speaking and interview requests flooded in. Carson, then 61, announced his planned retirement a few weeks later, freeing his calendar to accept just about all of them. In the months that followed, his rhetoric became increasingly strident. The claim that drew the most attention, perhaps, was that Obamacare was “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.”","6","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Bass’s own use of the word prompted Carson to ask her what she thought about that incident. She considered for a moment.","7","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"“If you want to reach people and have them even understand what you’re saying, there is a way to do it, without that hyperbole, that might be. . . . ” She paused. “I just think it’s important not to shut people off before they —”","8","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Carson jumped in. “That doesn’t allow them to hear what you’re saying?”","9","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Bass nodded.","10","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Likening Obamacare to slavery — and slavery was incomparably worse, Carson said — had its political advantages for a candidacy like his. It was the kind of statement that stoked the angriest of the Republican voters: conservative stalwarts who can’t hear enough bad things about Obama. This, in turn, led to more talk-radio and Fox News appearances, more book sales, more donations to the super PAC started in his name, more support in the polls. (The day before the meeting, one poll of Republican voters showed Carson statistically tied for first place with Jeb Bush and Scott Walker.)","11","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Rhetorical excess was good for business, but Carson now wants to be seen as more than a novelty candidate. He has come to learn that such extreme analogies, while true to his views, aren’t especially presidential. They alienate more moderate voters and, perhaps even more damaging, reinforce the impression that he is not “serious” — that he is another Herman Cain, the black former Godfather’s Pizza chief executive who rose to the top of the early presidential polls in 2011 but then bowed out before the Iowa caucuses, largely because of leaked allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied but from which he never recovered. Cain lingers as a cautionary tale for the party as much as for a right-leaning candidate like Carson. The fact that Cain, with his folksy sayings (“shucky ducky”) and misnomers (“Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan”), reached the top of the national polls — much less that he was eventually followed there by the likes of Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, who all topped one or another poll in the 2012 primary season — wound up being a considerable embarrassment for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney, and for the longtime party regulars who were trying to fast-track his way to the nomination.","12","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Carson liked Bass and, without directly saying so, made it clear the job was hers for the taking. Carson’s campaign chairman, Terry Giles — a white lawyer whose clients have included the comedian Richard Pryor and the stepson of the model Anna Nicole Smith and who helped reconcile the business interests of the descendants of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. — had assembled a mostly white campaign team, including many from the 2012 Gingrich effort, and Carson wanted a person of color to speak for him. Bass said she would have to mull it over, pray about it. Carson nodded approvingly. “Pray about it,” he said. “See what you think.”","13","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Williams knew the party was intent on protecting the eventual 2016 nominee from the same embarrassment Romney suffered. Already, suspiciously tough articles about Carson were showing up in conservative magazines and on right-wing websites. “They’re protecting these establishment candidates,” Williams said. “This is coming from within the house. This is family.” At the very least, he wanted to make sure that Carson didn’t do their work for them. (Carson would commit another unforced error a week later, when he told CNN that homosexuality was clearly a choice, because a lot of people go in prison straight and “when they come out, they’re gay”; he later apologized.)","14","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"“We need somebody to protect him, sometimes, from himself,” he told Bass — laughing, but only half kidding.","15","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"A candidacy like Carson’s presents a new kind of problem to the establishment wing of the G.O.P., which, at least since 1980, has selected its presidential nominees with a routine efficiency that Democrats could only envy. The establishment candidate has usually been a current or former governor or senator, blandly Protestant, hailing from the moderate, big-business wing of the party (or at least friendly with it) and almost always a second-, third- or fourth-time national contender — someone who had waited “his turn.” These candidates would tack predictably to the right during the primaries to satisfy the evangelicals, deficit hawks, libertarian leaners and other inconvenient but vital constituents who made up the “base” of the party. In return, the base would, after a brief flirtation with some fantasy candidate like Steve Forbes or Pat Buchanan, “hold their noses” and deliver their votes come November. This bargain was always tenuous, of course, and when some of the furthest-right activists turned against George W. Bush, citing (among other apostasies) his expansion of Medicare’s prescription drug benefit, it began to fall apart. After Barack Obama defeated McCain in 2008, the party’s once dependable base started to reconsider the wisdom of holding their noses at all.","16","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"This insurgent attitude was helped along by changes in the nomination rules. In 2010, the Republican National Committee, hoping to capture the excitement of the coast-to-coast Democratic primary competition between Obama and Hillary Clinton, introduced new voting rules that required many of the early voting states to award some delegates to losing candidates, based on their shares of the vote. The proportional voting rules would encourage struggling candidates to stay in the primaries even after successive losses, as Clinton did, because they might be able to pull together enough delegates to take the nomination in a convention-floor fight or at least use them to bargain for a prime speaking slot or cabinet post.","17","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"This shift in incentives did not go unnoticed by potential 2012 candidates, nor did changes in election law that allowed billionaire donors to form super PACs in support of pet candidacies. At the same time, increasingly widespread broadband Internet access allowed candidates to reach supporters directly with video and email appeals and supporters to send money with the tap of a smartphone, making it easier than ever for individual candidates to ignore the wishes of the party.","18","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Into this newly chaotic Republican landscape strode Mitt Romney. There could be no doubt that it was his turn, and yet his journey to the nomination was interrupted by one against-the-odds challenger after another — Cain, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Ron Paul; always Ron Paul. It was easy to dismiss the 2012 primaries as a meaningless circus, but the onslaught did much more than tarnish the overall Republican brand. It also forced Romney to spend money he could have used against Obama and defend his right flank with embarrassing pandering that shadowed him through the general election. It was while trying to block a surge from Gingrich, for instance, that Romney told a debate audience that he was for the “self-deportation” of undocumented immigrants.","19","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"At the 2012 convention in Tampa, a group of longtime party hands, including Romney’s lawyer, Ben Ginsberg, gathered to discuss how to prevent a repeat of what had become known inside and outside the party as the “clown show.” Their aim was not just to protect the party but also to protect a potential President Romney from a primary challenge in 2016. They forced through new rules that would give future presumptive nominees more control over delegates in the event of a convention fight. They did away with the mandatory proportional delegate awards that encouraged long-shot candidacies. And, in a noticeably targeted effort, they raised the threshold that candidates needed to meet to enter their names into nomination, just as Ron Paul’s supporters were working to reach it. When John A. Boehner gaveled the rules in on a voice vote — a vote that many listeners heard as a tie, if not an outright loss — the hall erupted and a line of Ron Paul supporters walked off the floor in protest, along with many Tea Party members.","20","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"At a party meeting last winter, Reince Priebus, who as party chairman is charged with maintaining the support of all his constituencies, did restore some proportional primary and caucus voting, but only in states that held voting within a shortened two-week window. And he also condensed the nominating schedule to four and a half months from six months, and, for the first time required candidates to participate in a shortened debate schedule, determined by the party, not by the whims of the networks. (The panel that recommended those changes included names closely identified with the establishment — the former Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, the Mississippi committeeman Haley Barbour and, notably, Jeb Bush’s closest adviser, Sally Bradshaw.)","21","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Grass-roots activists have complained that the condensed schedule robs nonestablishment candidates — “movement candidates” like Carson — of the extra time they need to build momentum, money and organizations. But Priebus, who says the nomination could be close to settled by April, said it helped all the party’s constituencies when the nominee was decided quickly. “We don’t need a six-month slice-and-dice festival,” Priebus said when we spoke in mid-March. “While I can’t always control everyone’s mouth, I can control how long we can kill each other.”","22","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"All the rules changes were built to sidestep the problems of 2012. But the 2016 field is shaping up to be vastly different and far larger. A new Republican hints that he or she is considering a run seemingly every week. There are moderates like Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and former Gov. George Pataki of New York; no-compromise conservatives like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania; business-wingers like the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina; one-of-a-kinds like Donald Trump — some 20 in all, a dozen or so who seem fairly serious about it. That opens the possibility of multiple candidates vying for all the major Republican constituencies, some of them possibly goaded along by super-PAC-funding billionaires, all of them trading wins and collecting delegates well into spring.","23","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Giles says his candidate can capitalize on all that chaos. Rivals may laugh, but Giles argues that if Carson can make a respectable showing in Iowa, then win in South Carolina — or at least come in second should a home-state senator, Lindsey Graham, run — and come in second behind Bush or Senator Marco Rubio in their home state of Florida, he could be positioned to make a real run. But that would depend on avoiding pitfalls like Carson’s ill-considered comments on homosexuality. Rather than capitalizing on the chaos, Carson may only contribute to it.","24","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Ben Carson is, in many ways, the ideal Republican presidential candidate. With a not-too-selective reading of his life story, conservative voters can — and do — see in him an inspiring, up-from-nowhere African-American who shares their beliefs, a right-wing answer to Barack Obama. Before he was born, his parents moved to Detroit from rural Tennessee as part of the second great migration. His father, Robert Solomon Carson, worked at a Cadillac factory. His mother, Sonya — who herself had grown up as one of 24 children and left school at third grade — cleaned houses. When Carson was 8, Sonya discovered that Robert was keeping a second family. She moved, with her two sons, into a rundown group house. It was in a part of town that Carson described to me as crawling with “big rats and roaches and all kinds of horrible things.” Sonya worked several jobs at a time and made up the shortfall with food stamps. (Carson has called for paring back the social safety net but not doing away with it.)","25","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Carson recounts this story in his best-selling 1990 memoir, “Gifted Hands,” which also became the basis for a 2009 movie on TNT, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carson. Raised as a Seventh Day Adventist, Carson realized that he wanted to become a physician during a church sermon about a missionary doctor who, while serving overseas, was almost attacked by thieves but found safety by putting his faith in God. When Carson, then 8, told his mother his new dream, “She said, ‘Absolutely, you could do it, you could do anything,’ ” he told me. Forced by his mother to read two extra books a week, he made it to Yale, then to medical school at the University of Michigan, where he decided to specialize in neurosurgery. He was selected for residency at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, where he was named director of pediatric neurosurgery at 33, becoming the youngest person, and the first black person, to hold the title. He drew national attention by conducting a succession of operations that had never been performed successfully, most famously planning and managing the first separation of conjoined twins connected through major blood vessels in the brain.","26","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Carson, a two-time Jimmy Carter voter, traces his conservative political awakening to a patient he met during the Reagan years. During a routine obstetrics rotation, he found himself treating an unwed pregnant teenager who had run away from her well-to-do parents. When Carson asked her how she was getting by, she informed him she was on public assistance; this led him to ponder the fact that the government was paying for the result of what he did not view as a “wise decision.” The incident, he says, fed his growing sense that the welfare system too often saps motivation and rewards irresponsible behavior. (When we spoke, he suggested that the government should cut off assistance to would-be unwed mothers, but only after warning them that it would do so within a certain amount of time, say five years. “I bet you’d see a dramatic decrease in unwed motherhood.”)","27","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Carson’s friends at Hopkins say they do not remember him being particularly outspoken about his conservatism. He devoted most of his public engagement to urging poor kids in bad neighborhoods to use “these fancy brains God gave us,” through weekly school visits, student hospital tours and, ultimately, a multimillion-dollar scholarship program. “His issues were always medical care for the poor, education for the poor, equal opportunity — helping the less fortunate and really inspiring them as an example,” a mentor who named him to the chief pediatrics-neurosurgery post at Hopkins, Dr. Donlin Long, told me.","28","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Even when Carson got the chance, in 1997, to speak in front of President Bill Clinton, at the national prayer breakfast, he mostly discussed the lack of role models for black children who were not sports stars or rappers. (There was possibly an oblique reference to Clinton’s sex scandals, when he told the audience that, if they are always honest, they won’t have to worry later about “skeletons in the closet.”)","29","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"In 2011, Carson’s politics took a strident turn, mirroring that of many in his party during the Obama years. “America the Beautiful,” his sixth book, which he wrote with Candy Carson, his wife of 39 years, included a get-tough-on-illegal-immigration message and offered anti-establishment praise for the Tea Party. It suggested that blacks who voted for Obama only because he was black were themselves practicing a form of racism. (Earlier this year he admitted to Buzzfeed that portions of the book were lifted directly from several sources without proper attribution.) His prayer-breakfast performance in 2013, and the extremity of his remarks in the months afterward (Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery; the United States is “very much like Nazi Germany”; allowing same-sex marriage could lead to allowing bestiality), left some of his old friends bewildered. Students at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine protested his planned convocation address there in 2013, and he eventually backed out. When I asked Carson about the view at Hopkins that he had changed, he said his themes are still the same: “hard work, self-reliance, helping other people.” If he had become more overtly political, he said, it was only because the Obama years had led him to believe that “we’re really moving in a direction that is very, very destructive.”","30","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"None of this went unnoticed by campaign professionals. In August 2013, John Philip Sousa IV and Vernon Robinson, each of whom professes to be a virtual stranger to Carson, and who had previously been active in the anti-illegal-immigration movement, started the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee. Sousa was just coming off a campaign to defend the sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, Joe Arpaio, from a recall effort, and he told me that he found Carson’s lack of political experience refreshing. “We have 500 guys and gals with probably a collective 5,000 years experience, and look at the mess we’re in,” he said.","31","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Many others in the party feel the same way. Carson’s PAC finished 2014 with more than $13 million in donations, more than Ready for Hillary. Much of its money has gone toward further fund-raising, but Sousa — the great-grandson of the famous composer — points out that their effort has already built far more than just a war chest, organizing leaders in all 99 of Iowa’s counties. Regardless, Carson credits the fund-raising success of Sousa and Robinson with persuading him to enter the race.","32","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Very early the morning after the job interview, Carson was in a black S.U.V., heading from Washington to the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Oxon Hill, Md., where he was to give the opening candidate speech of the Conservative Political Action Conference. The event, which functions as an early tryout for Republican presidential contenders, tends to skew rightward in its audience, drawing many of the same sorts of people who shouted at Boehner in Tampa. As such, it tends to favor anti-establishment candidates, but the news leading up to this year’s event was that Jeb Bush hoped to make inroads there.","33","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"It was still dark when we set out, and I joked with Carson about the hour, telling him he’d better get used to it. He retorted that his career in pediatric brain surgery made him no stranger to early mornings. This is a big theme of Carson’s presidential pitch: that neither the rigors of the campaign nor those of the White House can faze a man who held children’s lives in his hands. His life in brain surgery has prepared him for the presidency, he maintains, better than lives in politics have for his rivals. At the very least, he says, it conditioned him against getting too worked up about any problem that isn’t life threatening. “I mean, it’s grueling, but interestingly enough, I don’t feel the pressure,” he said.","34","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"At the convention hall, we were quickly surrounded by admirers. Two women were already waiting to meet him — white, middle-aged volunteers for Carson’s super PAC, who had traveled from South Carolina. One of them, Chris Horne, was holding a dog-eared and taped Bible. A founding member of the Charleston Tea Party who went on to work for Gingrich’s successful South Carolina primary campaign in 2012, Horne lamented over the attacks that Carson was sure to face. “You served us, you served the Lord, just don’t let them steal that from you,” she said. Her friend told him, “You’ve got God behind you!” Such religious evocations trailed Carson constantly while I walked the CPAC floor with him. Evangelicals are impressed not only with his devotion to their politics but also with his career path; as one of them told me, what’s more pro-life than saving babies?","35","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"During our ride to the conference, Carson told me his speech was not looking to “feed the beast.” When his appointed time came, he kept his remarks as tame as promised. “Real compassion” meant “using our intellect” to help people “climb out of dependency and realize the American dream,” he said. The national debt is going to “destroy us,” Obamacare was about “redistribution and control,” but Republicans better come forward with their own alternative before they repeal it, he said.","36","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Because his speech was first, and it started several minutes early, the auditorium was slow to fill. Still, the first day saw a crush of people seeking autographs and pictures as he roamed the hall. The Draft Carson committee’s 150 volunteers swarmed the auditorium, collecting emails and handing out “Run Ben Run” stickers. After a quick interview with Sean Hannity, the conservative-radio and Fox News host — his second in two days — Carson was off to Tampa.","37","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"In the hours that followed his talk, the hall offered a view in miniature of what the next 12 to 14 months might hold for the party. Chris Christie, sitting across from the tough-minded talk-radio host Laura Ingraham, boasted about his multiple vetoes of Planned Parenthood funding, his refusal to raise income taxes and his belief that “sometimes people need to be told to sit down and shut up.” Cruz, an audience favorite, warning his fellow Republicans against falling for a “squishy moderate,” declared, “Take all 125,000 I.R.S. agents and put ’em on our Southern border!” Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, surging in polls, boasted that if he could face down the 100,000 union supporters who protested his legislation limiting collective bargaining for public employees, he could certainly handle ISIS. The next day, the traditional CPAC favorite Rand Paul spoke, packing the hall with his supporters who chanted “President Paul.” He warned, counter to the overall hawkish tenor of the event, that “we should not succumb to the notion that a government inept at home will somehow become successful abroad.” But he also vowed to end foreign aid to countries whose citizens are seen burning American flags. “Not one penny more to these haters of America.”","38","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Perhaps the defining moment came near the end of the conference, when Jeb Bush spoke. In a neat trick of political gamesmanship — and a show of establishment muscle — his team had bused in an ample cheering section for the dozens of cameras on hand for his appearance. But a small contingent of Tea Party activists and Rand Paul supporters staged a walk out. When Bush began a question-and-answer session, they turned and left the auditorium to chant “U.S.A., U.S.A.” in the hallway, led by a man in colonial garb waving a huge “Don’t Tread on Me” banner. Plenty of other detractors stayed in the hall and peppered Bush’s remarks with booing as he stood by positions unpopular with the conservative grass roots: support for the Common Core standards and an immigration overhaul that provides a “path to legal status” for undocumented immigrants. Bush took it all in good humor, but finally seemed to give up.","39","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"

"Bush strategists told me they would not repeat Romney’s mistakes. Of course they would love to glide to an early nomination, they said, but they are prepared for a long contest and won’t be wasting any energy bending under pressure from a Paul or a Cruz or a Carson.","41","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"

"It may seem far too early to make such bold pronouncements, with nine months to go until the Iowa caucuses and with only two candidates formally in the race.

"These fundamentals — the amount of support from party elites and the potential to build a broad coalition — can be hard to measure.

"No factor has proved more important to a candidate’s chances than the loyalty of party elites.

"From this perspective, the Upper East Side fund-raisers, the Washington interest group conferences and the Alexandria dinner parties that you may have read about over the last few months have already shaped the contours of the race.

"The candidates who have taken meaningful and early leads in invisible primaries all entered the race widely known throughout the party, with loyal circles of established supporters. Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Mr. Dole, Mitt Romney and now Hillary Clinton were the runners-up in the prior nominating contests. Walter Mondale, George H.W. Bush and Mr. Gore were sitting or former vice presidents. Then there are the direct family members of a former president: Mrs. Clinton in 2008, George W.

"The invisible primary leaders usually lead in fund-raising, often by a wide margin. They rack up more endorsements than their opponents, often more than all of their opponents combined. Few question whether they’re acceptable candidates, even if some harbor doubts: The candidates agree with, or accede to, the party’s consensus on the most important policy issues. All of these factors culminate in sustained and serious free media attention, along with the resources necessary to mount an effective campaign.","82","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"There isn’t always a clear invisible primary winner, especially when there isn’t a candidate with elite support built from the preceding contest, as in the 1988, 1992, and 2004 Democratic primaries — or in the 2008 Republican primary. Even in these instances, the invisible primary still plays a crucial role in the nomination process, since viable candidates need to attract substantial elite support. “Candidates without party support have never won,” said John Zaller, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and one of four authors of “The Party Decides,” an influential 2008 book on the role of parties in the nominating process.","83","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"When clear leaders emerge, the whole field feels it. The other candidates, particularly those with political identities similar to the invisible primary winner, struggle to gain a foothold among voters. Candidates are often forced to position themselves in opposition to the invisible primary leader, even if it’s not their natural message. Think of John McCain in 2000, a candidate who was as conservative as George W. Bush but who nonetheless was cornered into running as a moderate.","84","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"This could be one of those years without a clear invisible primary winner. The runner-up of the last nominating contest, Rick Santorum, has no appeal to party elites. A number of candidates, like Mr. Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker, all appear to have at least some support from influential donors, activists, operatives and officials.","85","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"Of all these candidates, Mr. Bush seems to have amassed the most support from the party’s establishment. He started an aggressive, even pre-emptive effort to secure elite support, and there are plenty of signs that he is succeeding. His strength discouraged Mr. Romney from seeking the nomination again. Other ideologically similar candidates — Mr. Rubio and Mr. Christie — have struggled to gain traction in the polls and to match the donors and operatives Mr. Bush has attracted. The expectations for Mr. Bush’s fund-raising are tremendous: Some have even suggested his super PAC could raise $100 million in the first quarter.","86","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"Whether Mr. Bush will prove to have a large enough lead among party elites to warrant inclusion in this category remains to be seen. Will he outraise his opponents by a wide margin, or will other candidates have nearly as much money? How far does his support extend beyond the party’s wealthy donors? We’ll have a better idea of his strength after he declares his candidacy and after endorsements begin to stream in — or trickle in.","87","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"But even if he does earn a spot in this category, all hope is not lost for the other candidates: An early invisible primary leader does not always win the nomination. The invisible primary never really ends, and elites could sour on Mr. Bush, or another candidate could earn their affection — even if the opportunities available to those candidates will be influenced by Mr. Bush’s strengths and weaknesses.","88","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Bush will have plenty of weaknesses. Political parties are coalitions of factions, and winning the nomination requires candidates to build a broad coalition that boxes out potential rivals. By this measure, Mr. Bush is vulnerable. Factions of his party have expressed serious reservations about him, as they did about Mr. Romney in 2012, and as Democratic factions did about Mrs. Clinton in 2008.","89","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"The limit of Mr. Bush’s appeal is in part a product of his weaknesses as a candidate. There is doubt about whether the party should nominate another Bush, or someone with his views on immigration and Common Core educational standards. But it is also a reflection of today’s Republican Party. As the Democrats were in the 1980s, the Republican Party today is deeply factional, split between a relatively moderate establishment and various populist groups, including the religious right, the Tea Party and libertarians, all of which distrust the establishment. These factions might eventually find Mr. Bush acceptable, but they will not immediately acquiesce to his nomination.","90","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"

"The easiest route for a mainstream option to the nomination is when there isn’t a clear invisible primary winner. In this case, several mainstream options enter the race and attract enough support to be strong contenders for the nomination. Eventually, one outlasts the others on the campaign trail and consolidates the support of party elites in the process. This is how Bill Clinton won the nomination in 1992 — and the path might not have been open to him had Mario Cuomo run and consolidated support within the party. John Kerry, in 2004, and Michael Dukakis, in 1988, took similar paths. So did John McCain in 2008.","97","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"The mainstream options are in a much tougher spot when there is an invisible primary winner. They need to be extremely well positioned to navigate a path to victory. They need to have the political identity suited to exploit the main weakness of the invisible primary winner. They need to be compelling enough as candidates to marginalize potential factional favorites who might erode what would have otherwise been a winning coalition. Most will need to overcome a deficit in resources and name recognition. And then they need to outlast the invisible primary winner in what will generally be a protracted contest.","98","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"President Obama’s victory in 2008 is instructive. He consolidated the factions naturally opposed to Hillary Clinton, then had the broad appeal necessary to defeat her in the primaries. He did not run as a factional candidate — an antiwar candidate like Howard Dean in 2004; an anti-party candidate like Gary Hart in 1984; a social justice candidate like Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988 — but he managed to win the voters who might have otherwise supported such candidates without moving out of the party’s mainstream.","99","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"

"Mr. Walker is the best-positioned candidate to pull it off. He became a hero to conservatives by triumphing over public employee unions in a high-profile battle over collective bargaining rights, then survived a recall election.

"Mr. Walker has won three elections for governor in a state that has voted Democratic in every presidential election in the last 30 years. He has earned the support of several experienced Republican operatives, including alumni from the Republican National Committee. He seems to be raising substantial amounts of money. He surged to the lead in polls of Iowa, and he is tied in national polls as well, even though many Republicans still don’t know enough about him to formulate an opinion about him.","103","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"Whether Mr. Walker can win the nomination will greatly depend on how he performs in the visible primary: the public exhibitions and competitions, like debates, interviews and speeches. Compared with Mr. Bush or even Mr. Rubio, Mr. Walker is an unfamiliar candidate. He has not auditioned on the national stage. Many donors and officials might adopt a wait-and-see approach, ultimately rallying behind him if he proves to be as strong on the campaign trail as he is on paper. Something similar happened to Mr. Obama, who received only a few endorsements before winning the Iowa caucuses.","104","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Rubio, in contrast, is a more familiar candidate. Fewer donors and operatives will have serious questions about his ability to compete in national politics. But unlike Mr. Walker, Mr. Rubio is not well positioned against Mr. Bush. Mr. Rubio is acceptable to conservative voters who make up the natural opposition to Mr. Bush, but he will have a hard time becoming their first choice. His support for immigration reform cost him among the conservative rank and file, who might prefer factional candidates like Mr. Cruz or Mike Huckabee, even if Mr. Walker faltered. They might even ultimately prefer candidates like Mr. Jindal or Mr. Perry.","105","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Rubio’s preferred path to the nomination involves keeping Mr. Bush from winning the invisible primary by a wide margin, and outmuscling Mr. Bush for many of the same people who might have otherwise supported him. It’s not impossible to imagine: Mr. Rubio is a talented speaker with an appealing biography. He is a young candidate with a new brand, and he would appeal to those who don’t want another Bush. He has also spent much of the last four years cultivating the party’s Washington establishment.","106","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"

"Consider the 1988 Democratic primaries, a race without a runaway winner of the invisible primary. Michael Dukakis took a commanding lead for the nomination after Super Tuesday, when he won six primaries and Jesse Jackson and Al Gore split the South. Had Mr. Jackson not run, Mr. Gore might have won all 10 Southern primaries and had a real chance at winning the nomination. His path could have looked much like Bill Clinton’s four years later. Mr. Clinton won only three of the first 14 contests in 1992, but he took a decisive lead after his dominating performance in the South on Super Tuesday.

"Or consider the 1980 Republican primary, when John Anderson, who would ultimately run as a third-party candidate, ran alongside George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.

"Factional candidates seem poised to play a big role in the 2016 Republican contest, in part because the party is so splintered and also because this year’s factional candidates are compelling. Ted Cruz, Chris Christie and the younger Mr. Paul all count among them. Two factional stars of previous contests — Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum — are mulling a return. Then there is Ben Carson, a candidate who has never won a single election or run a large organization but who nonetheless draws strong support from conservative activists. Exactly how Mr. Carson goes on to lose could be one of the most interesting story lines of the cycle.","116","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"It may seem surprising to see so many of the party’s young stars listed alongside a candidate like Mr. Carson or Mr. Santorum. But Mr. Paul and Mr. Cruz, both relatively young, ascended in national politics as factional figures, Rand Paul as the scion of Ron Paul and Mr. Cruz as an anti-establishment candidate who won a Senate seat as a Tea Party favorite. In Washington, he has, if anything, gone out of his way to alienate the party’s establishment by leading a government shutdown.","117","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Paul has made more of an effort to appeal to the party’s mainstream officials and voters than his father or Mr. Cruz. But the same policies and views that rally his base — a less interventionist foreign policy and a relaxation on drug sentencing — limit his appeal. He may wish he were a mainstream option in a way that his father never did, but he is not.","118","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Christie is a different case. He adopted moderate views on guns, immigration and Medicaid expansion in part as a matter of electoral necessity — to win in New Jersey — not just because he is a truly factional candidate. Like Mr. Paul, he has made considerable effort to appeal outside his natural base of support. But in a March NBC/WSJ poll, 57 percent of Republicans said they couldn’t see themselves supporting him. At this stage, he is more like Jon Huntsman, hardly a paragon of broad appeal, than Jeb Bush.","119","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"In the past, perhaps truly factional candidates could be completely written off. But before we rule out this year’s factional candidates, it’s worth spending a moment recalling Howard Dean. Every once in a while, a factional candidate does find himself with a plausible path to the nomination. Mr. Dean, the Vermont Democrat, nearly pulled it off in 2004, basing his candidacy on opposition to the war in Iraq. He faltered mainly because of his failings as a candidate, not because a candidate of the antiwar left couldn’t have won the 2004 nomination.","120","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"There aren’t analogies to Mr. Dean — let alone to Herman Cain or Michele Bachmann — in the 1980s and 1990s. The rise of Internet fund-raising and organizing, and the advent of super PACs, has made it easier for a candidate to build a viable campaign without broad support among party elites.","121","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"Twenty years ago, a candidate like Ted Cruz, who has virtually no support from party elites and is outright detested by much of the party’s establishment, would have had no chance to raise a substantial amount of money. But the Cruz campaign raised nearly $4 million in the eight days after he announced his campaign, and 95 percent of it came from contributions of less than $100. On the opposite end of the spectrum, four super PACs aligned with Mr. Cruz announced that they had raised $31 million. Mr. Cruz, with the help of a tiny number of wealthy benefactors and grassroots support, outstripped the $25 million that Mr. Obama raised in the first quarter of 2007.","122","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"But super PAC money isn’t everything. Elites shape public opinion by touting or criticizing the candidates on television or to reporters. They make up the rank and file of a large, effective campaign organization. There’s a case that no realistic amount of money could save Mr. Cruz from the widespread elite judgment that he’s unelectable and unpresidential.","123","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"For more plausible candidates, though, the additional financial support could be decisive. In today’s highly factionalized Republican Party, where factional candidates have a decent chance of building a modest base and of competing in early states, it would be unwise to discount the possibility that a strong factional candidate could carve a narrow path to the nomination.","124","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"
"This year’s factional candidates are particularly impressive, after all. Mr. Christie and Mr. Paul enter the contest with substantial bases of support and obvious fund-raising potential. If they campaign well enough to win voters in early states, the party might be able to come to terms with an insurgent’s success. Each of these factional candidates has a year to assuage the concerns of their skeptics and try to graduate to the mainstream alternative category — although they also have incentives to rally their factional bases to prevail over a divided field.","125","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/upshot/-2015-04-10-2016-elections-upshot-the-gop-presidential-field-looks-chaotic-its-nothtml.html?_r=0"

"What is more likely is that these strong factional candidates will shape the opportunities available to more viable options. A strong Mr. Cruz or Mr. Huckabee — or even a Mr. Carson — would be bad news for Scott Walker in Iowa, where evangelicals and self-identified “very conservative” voters make up around half of the likely electorate. A strong Mr. Paul or Mr. Christie could pose a problem for Mr. Bush, who probably needs a strong showing in New Hampshire.

"Those of us who are conservative and deeply concerned about the damage inflicted on the country by the president but don’t share this doom-laden view are labeled by some on the right as cowardly and unprincipled.

"Conservatism, for starters, is rooted in human experience. It appreciates the complexity of human society. It believes in a givenness to human nature and in enduring principles, yet it has the capacity to apply those principles to changing circumstances. And because it isn’t a rigid ideology, it leaves itself open to self-examination and self-correction. Authentic conservatism has a high regard for things empirical, for facts that can lead us to better apprehend the truth.","217","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/opinion/conservatives-in-name-only.html?_r=0"
"Conservatism is famously anti-utopian, understanding life’s imperfections and the limitations of politics. Knowing this, those on the right shouldn’t become enraged or forlorn when the world itself doesn’t fully conform to their hopes. Conservatism considers one of the cardinal virtues to be prudence. And no conservative — certainly no one familiar with the magnificent history of the Constitution — should be opposed to compromise per se. Whether or not accommodation is wise depends on whether an agreement nudges things in the right direction.","218","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/opinion/conservatives-in-name-only.html?_r=0"
"This doesn’t mean that conservatives shouldn’t fight passionately for liberty and justice. Today’s Republicans, for example, should advance a policy agenda that systematically transforms welfare-state programs into a market-friendly safety net. Nor does it mean that conservatism is merely a disposition, unconnected to a political theory. It simply means that conservatives should make their case with an urgency balanced by practical wisdom, equanimity and a sense of proportion. Their passion should also be balanced by gratitude.","219","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/opinion/conservatives-in-name-only.html?_r=0"
"In a marvelous 1976 essay, the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb contended that the key word to describe the conservative disposition was “enjoyment.” Unlike those who are “always lusting after something that is not,” the conservative tends to find delight in the achievements and blessings we have.","220","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/opinion/conservatives-in-name-only.html?_r=0"

"One’s disposition speaks to something far deeper than merely tone and style. It influences when and how we act, including the fights (or deals) we are drawn to or away from. It determines not just what our priorities are but how we interpret the world. Our lives, then, are determined in large part by our intellectual and psychological predispositions. Think of the difference in attitude between the resentfulness of Richard Nixon and the sunny optimism of Ronald Reagan.

"Fairly or not, there are some widespread negative impressions of the Republican Party: opposed to change, too extreme and inflexible, unwilling to compromise.

"But the instant backlash from fellow Republicans that prompted Jeb Bush, the son of Mr. Baker’s best friend, to distance himself underscored just how much their party has changed on the issue of Israel.

"“If you’re a Republican and you hedge on your support on Israel, it’s viewed as having a flawed foreign policy,” said Ron Bonjean, a party strategist who has worked for Republican leaders in Congress. “It’s a requirement for Republicans these days to be very strong on Israel if they’re going to be taken seriously by primary voters.” Any deviation on that, he said, leads to inevitable questions: “If you’re not supporting Israel, then who are you supporting?

"The shift in the party’s attitude toward Israel stems from several factors, according to Republicans — a greater sense of solidarity in the fight against Islamic extremism since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks increased support for the Jewish state among evangelical Christians and the influence of wealthy donors like Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate. And the more Mr. Obama feuds with Mr. Netanyahu, the more Republicans feel motivated to come to the Israeli leader’s defense.","354","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/us/politics/republicans-criticize-james-baker-for-speech-on-benjamin-netanyahu.html?_r=0"

"Mr. Kristol, emailing from Israel where he was meeting with Mr. Netanyahu, described the shift as a result of broader underlying trends in American politics as the political left grows more “European” and the political right grows more “Reaganite.” He added that “the conservative belief in American exceptionalism is akin to Zionism.” And he said the contrast between Mr. Obama’s friction with Mr. Netanyahu and former President George W.

For decades, throughout the Cold War especially, Republican leaders were viewed as close to anti-Communist Arab allies and the oil industry.

"Voting for president is a political act, but it’s also a relational one.

"The court’s decision two years ago in United States v.

"He enters the fray with surprisingly low support. Despite four years of national prominence, he has averaged 6 percent of the vote in primary polls over the last few months. That’s the same or worse than five candidates who are thought to have a much smaller chance of winning the nomination: Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie. Mr. Rubio is acceptable to many but, so far, the first choice of few.","510","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Rubio’s struggle to break through is a powerful reminder that winning a presidential primary is not just about skill as a politician. It’s about positioning, and Mr. Rubio, at the moment, is in a much worse position than many assessments of his political talent would suggest. In basketball terms, he’s boxed out.","511","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"
"His central problem is that Jeb Bush has found considerable support from the party’s mainstream conservative and moderate donors in the so-called invisible primary — the behind-the-scenes competition for elite support that often decides the nomination.","512","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Rubio is competing for many of the same donors and operatives as Mr. Bush. Both not only come from the same state but also from similar ideological wings of the party. Despite the initial insurgent bid against Charlie Crist that made him a Tea Party hero, Mr. Rubio has always been an establishment-oriented candidate. The reporting about Mr. Rubio’s time in Washington suggests that he has followed an elite-driven path, following all the rules, seeking the guidance of the conservative intelligentsia, and trying to lead the party toward a compromise on immigration reform — the preferred means of the establishment-business wing of the party to expand the party’s general election appeal.","513","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Bush’s pre-emptive bid to build elite support has denied Mr. Rubio the opportunity to consolidate the center-right wing of the party. Perhaps this wouldn’t be a big problem if Mr. Rubio were a favorite of the conservatives skeptical of Mr. Bush’s candidacy, but the field is full of candidates who are equally good or better fits for many conservative voters.","514","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"
"Scott Walker, who took on unions and won in Wisconsin, is a conservative hero. Ted Cruz is a favorite of the Tea Party. Mike Huckabee is a favorite of evangelical Christians. Then there is a long list of other conservative candidates — like Ben Carson, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal — who might compete for votes.","515","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Rubio’s failed effort at immigration overhaul exemplifies the challenges he faces. He held 20 percent of the vote in primary polls at the beginning of 2013, but his standing collapsed along with immigration and has never recovered. His ill-fated effort may not be on the minds of most voters today, but he lost the support of many on the right. And in later renouncing his own reform effort, he lost credibility with much of the center-right. In the end, he was on the side of no one.","516","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"
"Exceptional candidates could overcome a tough starting position. They could carve a niche for themselves — voters from disparate factions would be drawn to their compelling message, while elites would recognize their potential appeal and even like them personally.","517","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"
"But the Republican Party is a deeply factionalized place, and that makes it much harder for a broadly appealing candidate to emerge. Mr. Rubio is not the obvious leader of any major faction of the party, and his message isn’t obviously oriented toward any wing of the party, either.","518","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"
"The challenge for Mr. Rubio is heightened by the first two nominating contests, Iowa and New Hampshire, which are better understood as factional winnowing contests. The Iowa caucuses are deeply conservative — 47 percent of caucus-goers in 2012 identified as “very conservative” — and even more evangelical: 57 percent identified as born again or evangelical Christians. New Hampshire, on the other hand, is among the most moderate contests in the country: 47 percent of New Hampshire primary voters were self-identified moderates four years ago. It is not surprising that a candidate with broad but shallow appeal, like Mr. Rubio, has struggled to gain a strong foothold in either state.","519","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"
"The easiest path for Mr. Rubio will be if Mr. Bush proves less formidable than early reports suggest. In this situation, a large number of party elites would grow skeptical of Mr. Bush’s chances in the general election, or question whether he could win the primary. They would find Mr. Walker ill-prepared or unelectable, and decide that Mr. Rubio was the best option. He would compete hard in Iowa but ultimately hope for a win in New Hampshire, where many of the party’s conservative candidates will struggle.","520","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"
"If Mr. Bush doesn’t falter, Mr. Rubio will need to muscle his way to victory. It’s a tougher path than if Mr. Bush did not run, but not impossible. And if you believe that Mr. Rubio is a great candidate, a great communicator and a youthful contrast to Mr. Bush, then perhaps it’s even likely.","521","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"
"However, Mr. Rubio has yet to prove himself an exceptional candidate. In today’s digital era, one would expect truly exceptional candidates to distinguish themselves fast. Mr. Obama, after all, already held 25 percent support according to polls by this time eight years ago. Mr. Rubio’s 6 percent pales in comparison, and it’s less than the amount held by all but one of the 13 candidates who have won their party’s nomination since 1980. The one exception, Bill Clinton, faced a weak field in a late-developing race.","522","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Rubio is not a stealth candidate. He is well known and has had ample opportunities to earn the trust of Republican voters. He might be in third place in his own home state. At a certain point, one wonders whether he is like the first-round draft pick who doesn’t make the All-Star team after four years. His form might look perfect, but, for whatever reason, he just doesn’t perform the way many thought he might. Fans can be forgiven for continuing to hold out hope that he might break out. No one would be stunned if he ultimately did so, but maybe it’s no longer the likeliest outcome.","523","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/marco-rubio-is-talented-but-out-of-position.html?_r=0"

"As Mr. Walker builds a presidential run on his effort to take on unions four years ago, he is poised to deliver a second walloping blow to labor. After saying for months that an effort to advance so-called right-to-work legislation would be “a distraction” from dealing with larger issues like the state’s economy and job growth, Mr. Walker is now preparing to sign a measure — being fast-tracked through the Republican-held State Legislature — that would bar unions from requiring workers to pay the equivalent of dues.","650","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/us/politics/walker-is-set-to-deliver-new-blow-to-labor-and-bolster-credentials.html?_r=0"

As the results were announced and senators left the chamber, protesters chanted “Shame” from the balcony. The State Assembly is expected to take up the measure next week. Where Mr. Walker’s earlier high-profile strike against labor cut collective bargaining rights for most public-sector unions, this one is aimed at workers in the private sector. And where Mr. Walker led the drive in 2011, he has taken a far less publicly forceful role this time, saying only that he will sign a bill. Yet the political effect will be the same, burnishing Mr. Walker’s record as an unafraid foe of Big Labor, who has been able to prevail in a state where Democrats have won presidential elections.","651","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/us/politics/walker-is-set-to-deliver-new-blow-to-labor-and-bolster-credentials.html?_r=0"

Leaders of some unions say membership has dropped by more than half since 2011. It would seal Wisconsin’s place on the issue, even as other states — like Missouri, where lawmakers are considering a similar provision — have moved more slowly. As roughly 2,000 union supporters protested outside the Capitol for a second day and a few people interrupted proceedings in the state Senate with angry objections, some seemed resigned to what was ahead.","652","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/us/politics/walker-is-set-to-deliver-new-blow-to-labor-and-bolster-credentials.html?_r=0"

Mr. Walker was only weeks into a first term as Wisconsin’s governor, when he proposed cuts to collective bargaining rights and increased contributions from public workers for health care and pensions. In a state that had prided itself on polite political debate across partisan lines, furious opponents moved into the Capitol, chanting and beating drums, and would not leave.

"Mr. Walker’s boldness drew national attention, and a recall effort against him sealed his support from conservative donors around the nation. As he sought a second term as governor last fall against a liberal Democrat, he was often asked whether he might next advocate new limits on private sector unions.

"The measure would allow private-sector workers who choose not to join unions to avoid paying the equivalent of dues, known as “fair share” payments, which union leaders say are reasonable for anyone who benefits from union contracts.

Neither provision would apply to police officers and firefighters.","657","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/us/politics/walker-is-set-to-deliver-new-blow-to-labor-and-bolster-credentials.html?_r=0"
"Supporters of the measure say it would give workers choices, while opponents say its intent is to shrink union membership and political power. In the Senate, Republicans pushed back against Democratic efforts on Wednesday first to return the bill to committee, then to add a series of amendments.

"Brooke Sammon, a spokeswoman for Rubio, said, “Senator Rubio believes that a two-state solution should remain the ultimate goal and would be the best outcome for both Israelis and Palestinians.” But, she added, “Given the deteriorating security situation that Israel faces in every direction, now is not the time for the United States to be pressuring Israel to make concessions toward a Palestinian leadership that time and again has shown itself more interested in spewing vitriol about Israel and associating with terrorists than in truly pursuing peace.”","683","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/magazine/will-republicans-still-support-a-two-state-solution-even-if-netanyahu-doesnt.html?_r=0"

The most important Republican Jewish donor in the country, Sheldon Adelson, is passionately opposed to the formation of a Palestinian state, which he has compared to playing “Russian roulette” with Israel’s existence.

So far, the two-state solution has been “the least bad option” for any American president, as Aaron David Miller, an adviser on the Middle East in the Reagan, Clinton and both Bush administrations, told me. “Campaigning is one thing; the realities of governance is another,” he said. “The predicament for Democrats and Republicans is that they’re stuck between a two-state solution that’s too hard to implement and too important to abandon.”","691","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/magazine/will-republicans-still-support-a-two-state-solution-even-if-netanyahu-doesnt.html?_r=0"

"But it adds that “there may be times when the president or the secretary of defense may determine that it would be appropriate for the U.S. military to conduct cyberoperations to disrupt an adversary’s military related networks or infrastructure so that the U.S. military can protect U.S. interests in an area of operations. For example, the United States military might use cyberoperations to terminate an ongoing conflict on U.S. terms, or to disrupt an adversary’s military systems to prevent the use of force against U.S. interests.” That last phrase seemed to leave open the door for pre-emptive cyberattacks.","827","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/politics/pentagon-announces-new-cyberwarfare-strategy.html?_r=0"

"Mr. Carter, questioned by Amy Zegart, a political science professor who directs Stanford’s cyberinitiatives, defined a major cyberattack as “something that threatens significant loss of life, destruction of property or lasting economic damage.” That could cover myriad daily attacks, but Mr. Carter acknowledged that in the biggest case to date — the attack on Sony last November — the president chose to respond with sanctions on North Korea, “not in cyberspace.”","829","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/politics/pentagon-announces-new-cyberwarfare-strategy.html?_r=0"

"“Deterrence is partially a function of perception,” the new strategy says. “It works by convincing a potential adversary that it will suffer unacceptable costs if it conducts an attack on the United States, and by decreasing the likelihood that a potential adversary’s attack will succeed. The United States must be able to declare or display effective response capabilities to deter an adversary from initiating an attack; develop effective defensive capabilities to deny a potential attack from succeeding; and strengthen the overall resilience of U.S. systems to withstand a potential attack if it penetrates the United States’ defenses.”","831","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/politics/pentagon-announces-new-cyberwarfare-strategy.html?_r=0"

"CHICAGO — Expecting significant budget shortfalls this year and in the years ahead, Bruce Rauner, Illinois’s new Republican governor, on Wednesday proposed more than $6 billion in cuts in state spending on universities, health care, local governments and other areas and called for sharply reducing pension benefits for state workers.","FEB. 18, 2015","885","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/us/politics/illinois-governor-proposes-6-billion-in-cuts-and-reducing-pension-benefits.html?_r=0"
"Though many of his cuts are likely to face opposition in the Democratic-led legislature, his proposal for solving the state’s crippling pension crisis may be the most contentious. He called for most public workers covered by the state’s pension system to be moved in the coming months into a plan with lower benefits — a move that he said would save the state $2.2 billion in the coming budget year and more than $100 billion over the next three decades.","886","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/us/politics/illinois-governor-proposes-6-billion-in-cuts-and-reducing-pension-benefits.html?_r=0"
"“This budget is honest with the people of Illinois, and it presents an honest path forward,” Mr. Rauner said as he laid out what he deemed a “turnaround budget” before lawmakers in Springfield, the state capital. “Like a family, we must come together to address the reality we face.

"The fate of Mr. Rauner’s $31.5 billion spending plan, however, is uncertain, particularly given that Democrats hold veto-proof majorities in both chambers of the legislature. Democrats said it would harm middle-class families and the poor, while asking little more from wealthy residents. The proposed budget calls for no tax increases or new taxes.","888","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/us/politics/illinois-governor-proposes-6-billion-in-cuts-and-reducing-pension-benefits.html?_r=0"
"“Governor Rauner’s plan includes proposals that will undermine access to health services, child care, affordable college and retirement security for working- and middle-class families,” said John J.

"On Wednesday, Mr. Rauner’s aides said that his plan to move longtime workers into a second-tier system with lower benefits created several years ago for new employees complies with the Constitution.

Critics and Democratic lawmakers, though, questioned the legality of the move, and said it, too, would surely be challenged in court.","894","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/us/politics/illinois-governor-proposes-6-billion-in-cuts-and-reducing-pension-benefits.html?_r=0"
"Exempt from the pension change, Mr. Rauner said, would be police officers and firefighters. Under his proposal, longtime workers would also be permitted to take a “buyout option,” in which they would receive a lump sum and a defined contribution plan, like a 401(k), in exchange for lower cost-of-living increases.","895","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/us/politics/illinois-governor-proposes-6-billion-in-cuts-and-reducing-pension-benefits.html?_r=0"

(TMC) BOYHOOD (2014) Starting in 2002, Richard Linklater began to film four characters — a boy (Ellar Coltrane, left), then 6; the boy’s sister (Lorelei Linklater, Mr. Linklater’s daughter); and their parents (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) — over 12 consecutive years, composing the script as the movie progressed. “What emerged from those dozen years is a series of meticulously textured and structured scenes set to the rhythm of life,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times. Siblings argue. A mother struggles with men, bills and earning several degrees. A father roars into his children’s lives in a 1968 GTO. “The story in ‘Boyhood’ is blissfully simple: A child grows up,” Ms. Dargis added. “This, along with the modesty of its physical production — its humble rooms, quiet moments, ordinary lives — can obscure Mr. Linklater’s ambitions and the greatness of his achievement.” But, she wrote: “He both captures moments in time and relinquishes them as he moves from year to year. He isn’t fighting time but embracing it in all its glorious and agonizingly fleeting beauty.”","1373","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday.html?_r=0"

"For Republicans in states like Iowa and New Hampshire that hold the first primaries and caucuses, the trend is troubling. They fear candidates are too focused on getting on television to enhance their poll standing, when they should be out meeting voters in town halls and greasy spoons.

"The scramble shows the degree to which the Republican Party is still struggling to exert control over the debate process after the last election cycle, in which a series of debates — 20 in all — seemed to exasperate party leaders and, occasionally, candidates too.

And they point out that they have long used national polls to narrow who gets on the debate stage. CNN has set up a two-tiered debate for Sept. 16, with the lower-polling candidates participating in a segment that will air before the main event.

"At issue is how to stage a substantive discussion that is fair to viewers and the campaigns. The party has little appetite for a forum so thick with candidates that it allows for not much more than an extended “lightning round” of questions.

"IOWA CITY — College students supporting Rand Paul for president were out in force going door to door in this university town recently, using their iPad Minis to help identify Republicans committed to voting for the Kentucky senator in next year’s Iowa caucuses.","JULY 7, 2015","1482","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/politics/super-pacs-take-on-new-role-organizing-voters.html?_r=0"
"And when Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana visited the state the same week in June for town-hall-style meetings in Waukee, Council Bluffs and Sioux City, his supporters collected voters’ names and emails with an eye toward caucus day.","1483","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/politics/super-pacs-take-on-new-role-organizing-voters.html?_r=0"
"But the Paul and Jindal campaigns were not behind these time-honored grass-roots organizing efforts. Instead, in a twist that shows how even retail politics is being transformed by a flood of loosely regulated big money, the two candidates’ courtship of voters is being carried out by “super PACs,” which are using their abundant war chests to move into the nuts and bolts of campaign operations.","1484","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/politics/super-pacs-take-on-new-role-organizing-voters.html?_r=0"
"In previous election cycles, super PACs — which can raise unlimited donations from corporations and individuals alike — largely channeled money from wealthy donors into political advertising. But now they are branching out into what had seemed a fundamental function of a campaign committee: organizing voters one at a time.","1485","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/politics/super-pacs-take-on-new-role-organizing-voters.html?_r=0"
"Candidates “are pushing as much of the stuff as they can over to the super PACs because that’s where the real money is,” said Terry Giles, who recently quit as the campaign manager for Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, to start a super PAC that will support him.","1486","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/politics/super-pacs-take-on-new-role-organizing-voters.html?_r=0"
"The practice of having super PACS, which can be entirely financed by a single billionaire, take over such operations allows campaigns, which may raise only $2,700 from any one donor, to outsource the costly, labor-intensive work of recruiting activists and building lists of supporters.","1487","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/politics/super-pacs-take-on-new-role-organizing-voters.html?_r=0"
"It could also allow second-tier candidates to be more competitive, prolonging the nominating process. And in the general election, a Republican nominee whose organizing is paid for by a super PAC might level the playing field with Democrats, whose allies in labor have traditionally given the party an edge in mustering volunteers to help turn out voters.","1488","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/politics/super-pacs-take-on-new-role-organizing-voters.html?_r=0"

"“As a campaign, you have absolutely no idea” how you’re doing, said Nick Ryan, the president of a super PAC supporting Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor. “That would scare me to death.

"Tina Goff, who recruited leaders in all 99 Iowa counties on behalf of a super PAC supporting Mr. Carson before he even declared his candidacy, turned down an offer of a job with his campaign. “It would have been great to travel around with Dr. Carson,” she said, “but I felt like I had created an infrastructure here and I wanted to continue what I was doing.” She said she was now hiring 25 people to knock on doors in Iowa after paying $40,000 for a list of Republican caucusgoers from the state party.","1491","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/politics/super-pacs-take-on-new-role-organizing-voters.html?_r=0"

"In Iowa, where Jeb Bush faces stiff resistance from conservatives, a senior Republican strategist said that before Mr. Bush announced his candidacy, his team discussed leaving some of the field organizing to a super PAC established by his aides.

"So far, only super PACs supporting Republicans appear to be organizing the grass roots, although outside groups that back Democrats, including labor unions and nonprofits, have long performed tasks like registering voters and canvassing neighborhoods.

"“It’s no surprise that super PACs would at some point evolve into the organizational side of politics,” said Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to Mr. Paul. He called it a predictable outgrowth of an era that since 2002 has banned unlimited donations to party committees, and in which wealthy donors have rechanneled support to outside groups, which are less accountable.","1497","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/politics/super-pacs-take-on-new-role-organizing-voters.html?_r=0"
"Ms. Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, may have turned over more traditional campaign tasks to a super PAC than any other candidate: lining up endorsements, answering reporters’ questions about her business career and opening field offices in early primary states like South Carolina.

She reported pulling in just $1.4 million in May and June.","1498","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/politics/super-pacs-take-on-new-role-organizing-voters.html?_r=0"

"The group organizing for Mr. Paul, Concerned American Voters, has pledges of “multiple millions” from wealthy donors in Silicon Valley, said Jeff Frazee, its president.

"But that effort illustrates the potential for duplication and clashing agendas between super PACs and campaigns. Mr. Paul already had a network of activists in Iowa, many of whom supported campaigns by his father, Ron Paul. Asked about the super PAC, the campaign’s state director, Steve Grubbs, said in a text message: “Not commenting on this.

"Concerned American Voters is separate from another super PAC backing Mr. Paul, called America’s Liberty PAC, which the senator officially endorsed.

"For top candidates, it’s an audition for party elites, moneyed supporters and, secondarily, voters. The goal isn’t to wow the crowd or surge in the polls, but to reassure — to confirm their ability to win and handle the presidency. For less serious or low-profile candidates, it’s an opportunity to break out — to cause party elites to reconsider or get voters to coalesce behind them.","1522","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/bush-and-trump-arent-among-the-gop-debate-winners.html?_r=0"

"From this point of view, the “winners” and “losers” of the debates can end up looking a lot different than what you see on Twitter. A candidate who gets by without much notice could be a winner; a candidate who gets the most attention might, in doing so, have denied himself the elite support it ultimately takes to win.","1524","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/bush-and-trump-arent-among-the-gop-debate-winners.html?_r=0"
"With that in mind, I suspect most pundits will conclude that Jeb Bush did not do well, no matter how one looks at it. Did he make any great errors? No. He even did well at times, and probably grew stronger as the debate went on. But he did not always nail tough but predictable questions, like on the war in Iraq.","1525","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/bush-and-trump-arent-among-the-gop-debate-winners.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Bush is less conservative than many other candidates. If he doesn’t show that he can be an especially strong candidate in the general election, and if there are equal or better and more conservative alternatives, it’s hard to imagine today’s conservative Republican Party ultimately coalescing behind him.","1526","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/bush-and-trump-arent-among-the-gop-debate-winners.html?_r=0"

"Mr. Rubio, the senator from Florida, has a good case to be considered the debate’s top performer. A weaker Mr. Bush probably benefits Mr. Rubio as much as anyone, and if Mr. Bush raised questions about whether he would be a great general election candidate, then Mr. Rubio added yet more reason to believe he could be a good one. Mr. Rubio still has the challenge of figuring out how to break through a strong field in a factional party.","1528","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/bush-and-trump-arent-among-the-gop-debate-winners.html?_r=0"
"With so little time having passed after the debate, it’s impossible to know whether the media will deem him the sort of overwhelming winner who will get the attention necessary to make a big jump in the polls. But even if this is not the moment he breaks through, he surely advanced his case among the many electability-minded and conservative party elites with reservations about the abilities of both Mr. Bush and Mr. Walker.","1529","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/bush-and-trump-arent-among-the-gop-debate-winners.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Walker won by not losing. In a lot of ways, the moderators’ tough, specific questions played to Mr. Walker’s weakness. He didn’t have much time to emphasize his fight against unions in Wisconsin. But he handled several tough questions — on abortion; on relations with Arab nations; what he would do after terminating the Iran deal; race; and his employment record — without appearing flustered or making a mistake. His answers were concise and sharp.","1530","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/bush-and-trump-arent-among-the-gop-debate-winners.html?_r=0"
"His ability to handle tough questions — not his ability to earn the support of conservatives — was the big question facing Mr. Walker entering the debate, and he at least passed the test. He probably didn’t do so well as to completely dispel these concerns, but he didn’t set back his case and may have advanced it.","1531","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/bush-and-trump-arent-among-the-gop-debate-winners.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Walker’s uneventful performance, however, still poses risks. For him, the danger is that it will provide an opening for a more dynamic conservative to eat away at his support on the right.","1532","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/bush-and-trump-arent-among-the-gop-debate-winners.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Kasich also advanced his cause. He entered as a largely unknown candidate outside of Ohio, where he is governor. But he was backed by a supportive audience, he deftly handled tough questions, and he had a solid answer on a question about attending same-sex weddings. His answer might not resonate among many Republicans, but it will resonate in New Hampshire — the state where he needs to deny Mr. Bush a path to victory and vault to the top of the pack.","1533","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/bush-and-trump-arent-among-the-gop-debate-winners.html?_r=0"
"It was Donald Trump, though, who might have had the weakest performance. No, it may not be the end of his surge. But he consistently faced pointed questions, didn’t always have satisfactory answers, endured a fairly hostile crowd and probably won’t receive as much media attention coming out of the debate as he did in the weeks before it. If you take the view that he’s heavily dependent on media coverage, that’s an issue. Whatever coverage he does get may be fairly negative — probably focusing on his unwillingness to guarantee support for the Republican nominee.","1534","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/bush-and-trump-arent-among-the-gop-debate-winners.html?_r=0"
"Others in the field — Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ben Carson, Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee — probably didn’t bolster their cases. Few made mistakes. All had their moments, especially Mr. Carson on race and Mr. Cruz on ISIS. Many of those moments might have been good enough to earn credit among their natural supporters. But I doubt any of them did so well as to earn the media attention or grass-roots energy necessary to move from the middle to the top of the pack.","1535","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/bush-and-trump-arent-among-the-gop-debate-winners.html?_r=0"

"According to David Rothschild, who runs the prediction market aggregator PredictWise.com, the top three candidates remain Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker. Long odds are available for all the other candidates. No contender saw his or her odds move by more than four percentage points. Movements this small are sometimes not even meaningful, as they reflect the ebb and flow of money for or against a particular candidate.","1539","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/an-influential-debate-not-if-you-trust-prediction-markets.html?_r=0"

"Donald Trump remains the No. 4 favorite. He began the night with a 9 percent chance, and his chances fell as low as 6 percent, before stabilizing at 8 percent. The debate didn’t help him, but Megyn Kelly, the Fox moderator who asked him tough questions, appears not to have delivered a knockout blow.","1542","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/an-influential-debate-not-if-you-trust-prediction-markets.html?_r=0"
"John Kasich’s relatively strong performance didn’t surprise the markets, which had rated him the fifth-most likely nominee before the debate began, and that assessment remains unchanged.","1543","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/an-influential-debate-not-if-you-trust-prediction-markets.html?_r=0"
"To the extent that there was a winner, it was surely Carly Fiorina, whose performance on the undercard debate helped distinguish her from the other also-rans. Prediction markets have upgraded her odds of winning from less than 1 percent to 3 percent.","1544","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/an-influential-debate-not-if-you-trust-prediction-markets.html?_r=0"
"Although that’s enough to put her on the map, she still remains a fringe candidate, and the latest odds only just put her in the top 10. Rand Paul’s odds also improved slightly, but his price has been sufficiently volatile that I wouldn’t read too much into it. Prediction market odds below 10 percent are often volatile and quite unreliable.","1545","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/an-influential-debate-not-if-you-trust-prediction-markets.html?_r=0"
"All told, the markets are telling us that not much has changed. Perhaps that’s a rational reaction to a hard-fought draw, or if not a draw, to the absence of a clear Perry-esque “Oops!” moment. It is also possible that the debate may have shifted public opinion, but it is not yet clear for whom, or by how much. On this score, I think it’s well worth watching Mr. Trump’s polling numbers very closely in the next week or so for evidence of change.","1546","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/an-influential-debate-not-if-you-trust-prediction-markets.html?_r=0"
"But the more mundane reality may simply be that with so many more months of campaigning ahead of us, and 10 more debates to go, last night was just one small piece in the larger puzzle of how this race will turn out. Pundits are prone to overreact, but markets move in more measured steps.","1547","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/upshot/an-influential-debate-not-if-you-trust-prediction-markets.html?_r=0"
"Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential campaign has been slow to harness the fund-raising power of the Democratic Party’s legions of grass-roots donors, according to reports filed Wednesday, a weakness that her campaign is racing to combat.","JULY 15, 2015","1548","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=A8A59E55FDCF6FB424CCC9DC7DA3BE38&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"
"Of the $47.5 million that Mrs. Clinton has raised, less than one-fifth has come from donations of $200 or less. That is a far smaller proportion than that of her Democratic and Republican rivals who have excited grass-roots donors on the left and right, such as Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ted Cruz of Texas. While Mr. Sanders raised far less than Mrs. Clinton over all — about $15 million, including money transferred from his Senate account — about four-fifths of that amount came from smaller donors.","1549","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=A8A59E55FDCF6FB424CCC9DC7DA3BE38&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"
"The slow response of grass-roots donors is a consequence, Mrs. Clinton’s aides and advisers said, of the deliberately low-key approach she has taken on the campaign trail — with few of the big rallies and campaign events that can help build voter lists and drive donations — along with the challenge in persuading some donors that Mrs. Clinton, who is far ahead in primary polls, needs their money.","1550","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=A8A59E55FDCF6FB424CCC9DC7DA3BE38&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"
"The deficit could represent a financial and strategic liability for Mrs. Clinton if she were to win the nomination. The pool of Republican donors willing to write the maximum $2,700 check has grown so large that no Democrat, not even Mrs. Clinton, is likely to be able to match a mainstream Republican nominee on high-dollar fund-raising over the long term. In 2012, President Obama and his party were able to match the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, only by raising far more money than Mr. Romney from small donors.","1551","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=A8A59E55FDCF6FB424CCC9DC7DA3BE38&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"

"Campaign officials said that operational hurdles and administrative delays also have impeded her outreach to small donors. On the day that Mrs. Clinton sent out emails in April announcing her presidential bid, a campaign official said, many of the messages bounced back. Fewer than 100,000 of the 2.5 million email addresses collected during her 2008 campaign, it turned out, were still active. The campaign did not gain access to a huge list of supporters, built over two years at substantial expense by a pro-Clinton “super PAC,” Ready for Hillary, until a month and a half after Mrs. Clinton’s announcement.","1553","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=A8A59E55FDCF6FB424CCC9DC7DA3BE38&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"
"Some of Mrs. Clinton’s allies acknowledge that Mr. Sanders has done a better job of engaging small donors on the left. “The small donors right now are very much attracted to what Bernie is saying,” said Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and a Clinton supporter.","1554","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=A8A59E55FDCF6FB424CCC9DC7DA3BE38&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"
"Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has responded with a new program, the Hillbuilder Initiative, intended to build a more robust online presence and harvest the grass-roots money and enthusiasm that can come with it.

"Relying more heavily on large donors could also present an unwanted contrast not only to other candidates, like Mr. Sanders, but with Mrs. Clinton’s own statements about fighting for those who feel locked out of the economy. Mrs. Clinton has attended 46 fund-raisers since she entered the campaign, many of them for donors giving the largest possible check.

"Some Democrats privately said that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign fund-raising is less impressive than it appears. Aside from Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, who reported raising $2 million for his campaign, Mrs. Clinton has no competition for the Democrats’ big-donor establishment, which handed out a combined $80 million to a crowded Democratic primary field during the equivalent fund-raising period in 2007, the last open primary.","1564","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=A8A59E55FDCF6FB424CCC9DC7DA3BE38&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"

"While some Clinton allies say they are not concerned about the campaign’s potential to excite small donors, the difficulty that Mrs. Clinton has faced presents a paradox of her position as a kind of de facto incumbent in the fight for the Democratic nomination.

They can break with party tradition and abandon the position that there should be significant tax-rate cuts for top earners.

In general, these candidates have floated rates in the teens, though Mr. Carson has said he might set a rate as low as 10 percent.","1574","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/upshot/can-republicans-avoid-the-romney-tax-trap.html?_r=0"
"What would a flat tax mean for the middle class? That depends what deductions are allowed. A flat tax could be devised to give a tax cut to many middle-income households through a large personal exemption, even if they currently pay an effective tax rate lower than the proposed single rate.","1575","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/upshot/can-republicans-avoid-the-romney-tax-trap.html?_r=0"
"However, a single-rate tax under 20 percent will necessarily mean a large tax cut for people with high incomes, since the current top federal income tax rate is 39.6 percent on married couples earning over $464,850. Such a tax must do one of two things: raise the tax burden on the middle class (for example, by offering a very limited personal exemption) or significantly reduce the overall tax collected by the federal government.","1576","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/upshot/can-republicans-avoid-the-romney-tax-trap.html?_r=0"
"In general, flat-tax proponents try to elide this problem. But Mr. Carson has been open about the fact that his plan would raise taxes on some lower earners.

"While flat taxes have long been a favorite of the conservative wing of the Republican party, establishment candidates have preferred to tinker with the existing system of graduated tax rates so as not to raise anybody’s taxes. This is the tradition of George W.

"But President Bush did so when the federal budget looked flush and it was politically possible to offer a deficit-increasing tax cut.

"Gov. Chris Christie, who is not yet a candidate but sometimes acts like one, gave a speech in New Hampshire last week in which he called for a tax plan similar to the one Mr. Romney ran on three years ago.

"Mr. Christie eased off Mr. Romney’s revenue neutrality pledge, saying his plan would not “materially increase the deficit” after combining with other measures.

"WASHINGTON — A Senate committee on Wednesday closed a two-year investigation with unanimous agreement that mismanagement at the Internal Revenue Service led it to improperly target conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.

"“This bipartisan investigation shows gross mismanagement at the highest levels of the I.R.S. and confirms an unacceptable truth: that the I.R.S. is prone to abuse,” Senator Orrin G.

"The two parties’ differences of interpretation left them where they began more than two years ago, after Republicans and conservative groups first accused the I.R.S. of singling out applications of Tea Party-affiliated organizations seeking tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny and delays.

"The controversy and the ensuing investigations — at the Capitol, inside the I.R.S. and at the Justice Department — have roiled the agency for years.

"Congress’s subsequent budget cuts have impeded the I.R.S.’s ability to serve taxpayers and have reduced its audits to ensure tax compliance.

"The allegations against the I.R.S. surfaced in May 2013, when Ms. Lerner told an audience of the American Bar Association that her unit, in gauging whether applicants had engaged in excessive political activities, would examine those with names that included terms like “Tea Party” or “patriots.”","1658","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/us/politics/senate-report-cites-irs-mismanagement-in-targeting-of-tea-party-groups.html?_r=0"

"The White House and Republican leaders hope to reverse the vote on trade assistance, although aides to Mr. Obama acknowledged the path was not clear.

"Carson has a penchant for over-the-top statements, such as that Obamacare is “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.” His assertions that Jews were slaughtered in Europe because they didn’t have guns, or that we need guns in the home today to defend ourselves from Islamic militants — well, “kooky” is a polite way to describe those views.","1693","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/opinion/sunday/ben-carson-is-inspiring-but-not-for-president.html?_r=0"

In an election contest with a dozen or more candidates, it doesn’t make sense to just look at who is winning the horse race. Using this alternative approach, we have Donald Trump leading Mr. Carson, 30.6 percent to 23.4 percent, but that leaves out what nearly half the other likely voters think of these two. Marco Rubio’s 10.7 percent to Jeb Bush’s 8.0 percent ignores how the other 81 percent of respondents would choose between them.","1739","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/upshot/ben-carson-beating-all-comers.html?_r=0"

"The idea of looking at all pairwise contests was first proposed by the French political theorist Marquis de Condorcet over 200 years ago.

A candidate strong enough to beat all comers was the one most likely to reflect the will of the people.","1741","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/upshot/ben-carson-beating-all-comers.html?_r=0"

"Here’s how we did it. With the help of Google Consumer Surveys, which samples individuals who respond to surveys to gain access to premium content on selected websites, we surveyed 6,072 people who report themselves as being either very likely to or will definitely vote in a Republican primary. These individuals were given a chance to rank their top six candidates. Our survey was taken Oct. 21-22 and we’ve weighted the Google survey results so that the participants match the age and gender balance seen in the 2012 Republican primary.","1744","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/upshot/ben-carson-beating-all-comers.html?_r=0"
"With that ranking in hand, we voted for them in all the pairwise matchups — 66 of them. In a contest between someone’s second and fifth choice, we presumed he or she would pick No. 2 over No. 5.

"The reason Mr. Carson does so well in the head-to-head contests is embedded in voters’ second-place choices (and beyond). It is little surprise that 36.4 percent of Mr. Trump’s supporters would shift to Mr. Carson if Mr. Trump were to drop out. But Mr. Carson’s supporters don’t quite return the favor. Only 24.2 percent of them would move to Mr. Trump, while another 13.4 percent would switch to Mr. Rubio and 15.3 percent to Carly Fiorina.","1747","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/upshot/ben-carson-beating-all-comers.html?_r=0"
"A surprise for us is the extent to which Mr. Rubio’s supporters break for Mr. Carson (21.9 percent), more so than to Mr. Bush (16.2 percent), Mrs. Fiorina (13.4 percent) or Mr. Trump (6.2 percent). Indeed, Mr. Carson gets the most second-place votes from all but John Kasich, Lindsey Graham and Bobby Jindal supporters.","1748","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/upshot/ben-carson-beating-all-comers.html?_r=0"

"Some people have assumed that Mr. Trump is no one’s second choice. That’s not true. He’s the top second choice of Mr. Carson’s supporters, and Mr. Trump follows Mr. Carson with supporters of Rand Paul (15 percent), Mike Huckabee (14 percent) and Mr. Jindal (12 percent).

"Another way to see this is to predict what will happen after many of the candidates have dropped out. That has to happen at some point. A note of caution before we continue this speculative exercise. As candidates drop out, the strategies of the remaining candidates will change; the patterns of media attention and coverage will also respond to the altered political environment.

"What happens if Mr. Jindal, Mr. Graham, Chris Christie, Mr. Huckabee, Mr. Kasich and Mr. Paul were all to drop out?

"When we decide to take one or more candidates out of the race, those choices are somewhat arbitrary and the race may not shake out as we suppose. Instead, if we look at pairwise competitions, it is as if all the candidates but the two under question are out of the race. And by looking at all 66 pairwise combinations, we can see the depth of each candidate’s strength.","1758","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/upshot/ben-carson-beating-all-comers.html?_r=0"

"Among those who watched no debates, Mr. Carson is way out ahead of Mr. Trump, 53.2 percent to 46.8 percent. Among those who watched one debate, it’s too close to call. For those who watched both debates, Mr. Trump is ahead, 51.1 percent to 48.9.

"We also see that there is a large gender gap in the support for Mr. Trump. Among men, Mr. Trump beats Mr. Carson, 52.5 percent to 47.5 percent, and beats everyone else, too. The problem for Mr. Trump is that he loses to Mr. Carson, 45.8 to 54.2, among women.","1761","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/upshot/ben-carson-beating-all-comers.html?_r=0"

"Our main goal in presenting these numbers goes beyond finding a Condorcet winner. We want to change the way political surveys are done.

"Yet if Mr. Carson’s potential for bringing black voters into the Republican primary illustrates a unique possibility, his efforts to win them over highlight his limitations as a candidate. Though he raised over $20 million during the third quarter of this year and primary votes will be cast in less than three months, his campaign operation has not caught up to his standing in the race. He has, for example, yet to hire a staff member dedicated to turning out black voters.","1933","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/us/politics/ben-carson-black-voters-republican-primary.html?_r=0"
"It is a position Mr. Carson will probably need to fill given the effort required to turn out voters with little history of participating in Republican primaries.

"When the 2012 Republican primary race came to South Carolina, a state that is 28 percent black, just 1 percent of the voters were black, according to exit polls. That was a year in which there was no Democratic primary and in a state where voters can cast ballots in either party’s primary.

"Like the original plan, his new one would include health savings accounts, meant to encourage people to pay for their medical care directly.

On Thursday, Kyle Cheney and Jason Millman at Politico described that plan, including critical voices from Republican health policy analysts, who worried that ending the popular Medicaid and Medicare programs would be both politically and practically problematic.","1993","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/upshot/ben-carsons-health-care-plan-new-and-more-confusing.html?_r=0"
"“No, that — that’s the old plan.

"Mr. Carson would do away with tax incentives that encourage employers to offer insurance to their workers, a big government expenditure that is the underpinning of the country’s current system. When asked by a reporter at an Iowa event on Saturday about the tax exclusion, he said, “I actually am going to be looking at getting rid of all tax deductions and loopholes.” The elimination of that benefit for the 151 million Americans who are covered in the employer-based system amounts to a loss of approximately $2,200 for each person, according to estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation.","1996","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/upshot/ben-carsons-health-care-plan-new-and-more-confusing.html?_r=0"
"The plan will still include some sort of health savings accounts. Mr. Carson has been consistent about seeking to eliminate the middleman between patients and doctors, and he says that asking people to finance more of their health care using cash will encourage them to seek bargains and use the health care system more wisely. People would be encouraged to use a portion of the savings to buy a very high-deductible “catastrophic or bridge insurance” plan.

"How health savings accounts would be funded, and by how much: Before this weekend, Mr. Carson had long been saying that the federal government would give every American $2,000 every year from birth to death, money that could be spent only on health care, but could be shared among family members. For context, $2,000 is much less than the government spends annually on health care for most Americans. The federal government currently spends, on average, more than $11,000 per year for every Medicare beneficiary; around $1,900 for an average child; around $12,000 for an average disabled beneficiary in Medicaid; an average of more than $3,200 for middle-income people subsidized through the new Obamacare exchanges; and about $2,200 in forgone taxes for people covered through the employer system.","1999","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/upshot/ben-carsons-health-care-plan-new-and-more-confusing.html?_r=0"
"Altogether, the average American’s health care costs more than $9,200 every year, though not even Bernie Sanders, who recommends a single-payer health care system, suggests the government ought to pick up the entire bill.","2000","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/upshot/ben-carsons-health-care-plan-new-and-more-confusing.html?_r=0"
"Now Mr. Carson is saying that the government wouldn’t necessarily fund the health spending accounts for everyone. “That is off the table,” he told Mr. Wallace. “We’re not having the government do that. I don’t want a big government program.” But he also said that people with Medicare or Medicaid coverage could get the money currently being spent for them in their account.

"What would happen to Medicare and Medicaid: Mr. Carson says that once people see the advantages of the health savings accounts, they will freely choose them instead of the 1960s social insurance programs for the poor, elderly and disabled. He says that he wouldn’t abolish the government programs, but that Americans would voluntarily give them up in favor of the health spending accounts.","2002","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/upshot/ben-carsons-health-care-plan-new-and-more-confusing.html?_r=0"
"As is the case with most insurance programs, there’s a wide range of health spending among people in those programs. Medicare, for instance, includes some hale 65-year-olds with few medical needs, and some people with complex health problems near the end of their lives. Medicaid covers poor children and childless adults, many of whom have low medical costs, and people with disabilities or long-term care needs, whose care typically runs more than $10,000 a year.","2003","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/upshot/ben-carsons-health-care-plan-new-and-more-confusing.html?_r=0"
"In a system where people choose between cash or government insurance, healthier people will probably opt for the cash. But that preference is likely to change once they get sick and medical bills start piling up. This tendency of people to wait to join costlier programs until they get sick is a reason most government insurance programs provide financial incentives to get in early and stay in — so that risks and costs can be spread across a broad population. Medicare’s drug program, for instance, charges higher premiums to people who wait a few years to join. And Obamacare imposes fines on anyone who fails to obtain health insurance. Mr. Carson’s new plan, by contrast, appears to pay healthy Americans to stay out of the insurance pool.","2004","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/upshot/ben-carsons-health-care-plan-new-and-more-confusing.html?_r=0"
"His original plan solved this problem by eliminating the more generous insurance programs, so people would be forced to either save in their spending accounts or forgo care. The new plan runs the risk of costing the government more than the current system, since people could game a two-choice system, sticking with a savings account when their spending is low, and switching to a government program once their medical costs rise.","2005","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/upshot/ben-carsons-health-care-plan-new-and-more-confusing.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Carson is not alone in having some gray areas in his health care plan. Jeb Bush has said that he would encourage states to “develop a transition plan” for 17 million people he estimates are currently enrolled in Obamacare, without much discussion of what that transition would be or how it would be paid for. Marco Rubio has offered little more than a short op-ed sketching some health policy ideas. Of the Republican candidates in the race, only Bobby Jindal has published a detailed health proposal.","2006","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/upshot/ben-carsons-health-care-plan-new-and-more-confusing.html?_r=0"
"Doug Watts, a spokesman for the Carson campaign, declined to answer questions about the details of Mr. Carson’s plan, saying only that the Politico report was inaccurate and that the candidate would release a fuller proposal in a few weeks. The answers to some questions raised by the new plan — like who would get government money in their health savings accounts, and how much — may be answered soon. But the basic problem with having two competing systems operating side-by-side may be trickier to resolve.","2007","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/upshot/ben-carsons-health-care-plan-new-and-more-confusing.html?_r=0"

"I’m not talking about the voters, though — I’m talking about pundits and political professionals.

"But if you’re looking for the candidate whose polling surge looks most like a march of voter folly, the Donald and his Trumpistas wouldn’t be the place I’d start.

"Though Carson is running close to Trump in Iowa and rising nationally, he’s attracted a fraction of the scrutiny, and his supporters have earned a fraction of the political class’s scorn. To some extent this is understandable, since Carson is temperamentally nonflamboyant, with none of Trump’s insult-comic style. He’s decent, modest, soft-spoken, devout, with an astonishing biography and an admirable character.","2033","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-evangelicals-and-the-carson-illusion.html?_r=0"
"But the growing evangelical embrace of Carson is arguably a greater folly than Trumpmania. That’s because the Donald, for all his proud ignorance about policy detail, is actually running an ideologically distinctive campaign: He’s a populist and nationalist, a critic of open immigration and free trade and a backer of Social Security and progressive taxation, and he’s drawing support from working-class Republicans who tend to share those views.","2034","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-evangelicals-and-the-carson-illusion.html?_r=0"
"The Trump phenomenon, then, isn’t just a study in celebrity-besotted conservative delusion, or a case of evangelicals betraying their faith to chase a shiny object. (Despite what you may have read, Trump isn’t particularly popular with religious voters.) It’s a class revolt, driven by a sadly-justifiable sense that Republican elites don’t have working-class interests close enough to heart. And it’s already won some (very) modest victories for populism — by prodding Scott Walker to make an economic case against low-skilled immigration, for instance, or by encouraging Jeb Bush to go after hedge fund managers in his tax plan.","2035","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-evangelicals-and-the-carson-illusion.html?_r=0"
"Carson, on the other hand, is running a more content-free campaign. Like Trump, he’s underinformed and prone to wild rhetorical flights, but unlike the Donald he doesn’t have a distinctive platform. He’s offering a collection of pieties and crankery; mostly, his candidacy is just about the man himself.","2036","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-evangelicals-and-the-carson-illusion.html?_r=0"
"And unfortunately evangelical voters have a weakness for this kind of pitch. From Pat Robertson in 1988 through thin-on-policy figures like Mike Huckabee, Sarah Palin, even Michele Bachmann briefly in 2012, the evangelical tendency has been to look for a kind of godly hero, a Christian leader who could win the White House and undo every culture-war defeat. (The resilience of evangelical support for George W. Bush as his presidency went sour reflected a persistent hope that Bush might be this hero in the flesh.)","2037","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-evangelicals-and-the-carson-illusion.html?_r=0"
"Such unrealistic ideas are hardly unique to the religious right. But evangelical culture, as James Davison Hunter notes in “To Change the World,” his magisterial account of recent Christian engagement with American politics, has a particular fondness for the idea of the history-altering individual, the hope that “one person can stand at the crossroads and change things for good.”","2038","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-evangelicals-and-the-carson-illusion.html?_r=0"

"This is part of why evangelical Christians, notwithstanding their numbers, tend to have less influence over actual Republican governance than fiscal conservatives or foreign-policy hawks. They’re always looking for a hero (or heroine), while the party’s other factions focus on staffing decisions and policy commitments, where the real work of politics takes place.","2040","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-evangelicals-and-the-carson-illusion.html?_r=0"
"In this election cycle, though, the evangelical hero quest is particularly self-defeating. With same-sex marriage established nationwide and social liberalism ascendant, religious conservatives have a clear policy “ask” they should be pressing every major Republican contender to embrace. They need guarantees that the next G.O.P. administration will move proactively — through something like Senator Mike Lee’s evolving First Amendment Defense Act — to protect religious schools and charities from losing grants or accreditation or even tax-exempt status because they maintain a traditional position on sexual ethics.","2041","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-evangelicals-and-the-carson-illusion.html?_r=0"

"“Her comments about how three million women dropped below the poverty line in the past seven years, that’s a statistic I hadn’t heard, and I think it’s a hugely important illustration of how much the Democratic policies are failing the people they are making promises to,” she said.","2069","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/us/politics/trump-and-carson-underwhelm-iowa-republicans-in-debate.html?_r=0"
"Another Iowan drawn to Mrs. Fiorina, Lyle Brinegar, who owns a construction and remodeling business in Centerville, was disappointed that Mrs. Fiorina did not have any moments equivalent to ones she had in the two earlier debates, after which her poll numbers spiked, only to slide down again.","2070","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/us/politics/trump-and-carson-underwhelm-iowa-republicans-in-debate.html?_r=0"

"Mr. Brinegar, the Republican chairman of Appanoose County, said he did not believe that either Mr. Trump or Mr. Carson showed that they were ready to be president. Mr. Carson, he said, would “be in way over his head,” Mr. Trump is too divisive to lead. “I have the same impression after each debate: He took advantage of several opportunities to prove he’s an ass,” he said.","2072","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/us/politics/trump-and-carson-underwhelm-iowa-republicans-in-debate.html?_r=0"
"But Mark Olson, a farmer in Wallingford, in northwest Iowa, came away from the debate without thinking any of the candidates had disqualified themselves.

"Mr. Olson has a presidential candidate in his own home: his son Brady, who over the summer drew a flutter of national attention after registering as an independent named Deez Nuts. He drew 7 percent in one early Iowa poll. Brady, 15, did not watch the debate, his father said.

"At one point during Wednesday’s Republican debate, Ben Carson was asked about his involvement with Mannatech, a nutritional supplements company that makes outlandish claims about its products and has been forced to pay $7 million to settle a deceptive-practices lawsuit. The audience booed, and Mr. Carson denied being involved with the company. Both reactions tell you a lot about the driving forces behind modern American politics.","OCT. 30, 2015","2075","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/opinion/springtime-for-grifters.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=C1C949A8616F715A817720EF2ED03FFD&gwt=pay&assetType=opinion"
"As it happens, Mr. Carson lied. He has indeed been deeply involved with Mannatech, and has done a lot to help promote its merchandise. PolitiFact quickly rated his claim false, without qualification. But the Republican base doesn’t want to hear about it, and the candidate apparently believes, probably correctly, that he can simply brazen it out. These days, in his party, being an obvious grifter isn’t a liability, and may even be an asset.","2076","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/opinion/springtime-for-grifters.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=C1C949A8616F715A817720EF2ED03FFD&gwt=pay&assetType=opinion"

"It is hardly the only point of disagreement between Republican leaders who are determined to reorient the party to win in a changing country, and activists who are uneasy about what they see as threats to their way of life.

"“My heart was so saddened to hear those words come out of the mouth of an individual who is seeking the highest office in our land,” said Mahdi Bray, an imam and director of the American Muslim Alliance, at a news conference in Washington. “Not only because it’s inconsistent with the United States Constitution, but what do I tell my kids?”","2125","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/us/politics/without-calming-voice-ben-carson-gop-is-letting-divisive-ones-speak-on-muslims.html?_r=0"
"While Muslims are viewed more skeptically by the American public than are members of any other faith, Republicans are especially uneasy about Islam.

"Mr. Trump’s reaction was strikingly different from that of Senator John McCain, who, in the 2008 presidential campaign, was confronted by a similar voter. “He’s a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues,” Mr. McCain said to a woman who called Mr. Obama “an Arab.”","2130","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/us/politics/without-calming-voice-ben-carson-gop-is-letting-divisive-ones-speak-on-muslims.html?_r=0"
"It was also far removed from Mr. Bush’s response in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. Fourteen years to the day before Mr. Carson’s comments on Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Mr. Bush, in an address to a joint session of Congress, drew a distinction between adherents of radical Islam and peaceful Muslims.","2131","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/us/politics/without-calming-voice-ben-carson-gop-is-letting-divisive-ones-speak-on-muslims.html?_r=0"

"“What’s dangerous about what he said is that it sends the wrong message to the rest of the world,” said Tony Fratto, a former press secretary to Mr. Bush. “That somehow the actions we take for very legitimate national security reasons have anti-Muslim roots.

"The gotcha questions — the Republican candidates define that term very loosely to include challenges on experience, policy positions and the ability to do elementary (but not Common Core) arithmetic — are in the mind of the beholder.

"Take Ben Carson, one of the current front-runners. His solid performance in the Fox News debate owed much to his amusing responses to difficult questions. According to research I carried out with my students Austin Eubanks and Jason Miller on speaking time and audience response at the first two Republican debates, we found that when speaking time was taken into account, the audience laughed at Mr. Carson’s quips comparatively more than they did at Donald J. Trump’s. In other words, not only did Mr. Carson outdo the front-runner at the time by using his speaking time effectively, but he often did so by responding to even difficult, gotcha-style questions.","2320","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/opinion/campaign-stops/in-defense-of-gotcha-questions.html?_r=0"
"Similarly, when he said of Mr. Trump, “He’s an O.K. doctor,” after the latter expressed his views on vaccines and autism, Mr. Carson revealed his calm personality and appeal.

"Of course, the huge debate audiences — the Fox News debate drew almost 27 million viewers, and the CNN debate 24 million — are in large part a result of the presence of Mr. Trump, a reality star, and the conflict he brings with him wherever he goes. From the start, he was the target of the so-called gotcha questions: Consider the discussion when the moderator Megyn Kelly, in the Fox debate, challenged Mr. Trump with his own words: “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.’ ”","2323","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/opinion/campaign-stops/in-defense-of-gotcha-questions.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Trump’s response — “Only Rosie O’Donnell” — won that particular partisan audience to his side, at least briefly. To deflect criticism, he often uses humor, provoking audience laughter, and laughter is actually a reliable indicator of how unified a party is behind a candidate. From our analysis, we found that Mr. Trump has been far and away the greatest provocateur of audience laughter, responsible for nearly 40 percent of it in the Fox and CNN debates.","2324","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/opinion/campaign-stops/in-defense-of-gotcha-questions.html?_r=0"
"It is not unexpected that Mr. Trump would know how to work an audience for greatest effect.

"Humor can be effective in allaying concerns about a party’s candidate, especially outsiders like Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson. But what matters most is not the person telling the joke but the audience’s reaction. Group membership, such as identifying with a political party, finds individuals even more likely to laugh and find humor in comments shared with other group members. As a result, we are much more likely to hear laughter during primary debates, when mostly Republican or Democratic Party members are present.","2326","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/opinion/campaign-stops/in-defense-of-gotcha-questions.html?_r=0"
"Sometimes gotcha questions elicit mixed reactions from the audience by putting a candidate uncomfortably on the spot.

"Again, Mr. Trump is illustrative. Our research found him a highly divisive candidate, eliciting nearly half of all the mixed applause and booing during the first two debates.

Mrs. Clinton began October with more than $31 million on hand for the primary, compared with about $27 million for Mr. Sanders. Mrs. Clinton also reported more than $647,000 in debt.

"“There is tremendous power among these donors,” said John Pudner, a former campaign manager for Representative Dave Brat of Virginia — the conservative who unseated Eric Cantor, then the No. 2 Republican in the House, in 2014 — who now heads a conservative group that looks to empower small donors. “I think they’re realizing that they can be a counterbalance, particularly social conservatives.”","2345","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/us/politics/outsider-presidential-candidates-prove-competitive-in-fund-raising.html?_r=0"
"The reliance on small donors does not always come without a cost. Mr. Carson has relied heavily on expensive direct mail and telemarketing consultants to raise money, driving up his burn rate: Of the $14 million he spent during the third quarter alone, fund-raising costs totaled $11 million, according to his campaign. But Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush spent at an even higher rate, $4 of every $5 raised, in the three months ending Sept. 30. Mr. Cruz raised most of his small-donor money online, according to figures provided by his campaign, suggesting a sustainable financial model for the months ahead.","2346","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/us/politics/outsider-presidential-candidates-prove-competitive-in-fund-raising.html?_r=0"
"Terry Giles, who was Mr. Carson’s campaign manager and now advises super PACs supporting him, said that Mr. Carson and other upstart candidates, including Mr. Sanders on the left, had benefited in their fund-raising from public distaste for establishment politicians.","2347","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/us/politics/outsider-presidential-candidates-prove-competitive-in-fund-raising.html?_r=0"

"The insurgents’ rise is likely to make their rivals even more dependent on super PACs and other groups. While super PACs are not required to disclose updated fund-raising totals until January, groups backing Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush have reported raising at least $140 million in unlimited contributions. Mr. Rubio, reflecting his straitened finances, has relied for television advertising on a nonprofit group, Conservative Solutions, which does not disclose its donors.","2349","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/us/politics/outsider-presidential-candidates-prove-competitive-in-fund-raising.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Cruz is the only one of the candidates emphasizing their outsider status who has succeeded in the super PAC realm: Groups backing him have raised at least $38 million. (Of that, $15 million came from the Wilks family, who earned billions of dollars in the fracking boom and are staunch opponents of abortion and same-sex marriage.) Mr. Carson is now scrambling to catch up: Advisers to his super PAC held a donor gathering at a Texas ranch last weekend, and Mr. Giles said the group expected large financial commitments in the weeks ahead.","2350","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/us/politics/outsider-presidential-candidates-prove-competitive-in-fund-raising.html?_r=0"

"Robert Borosage, a director of the Campaign for America’s Future, a liberal advocacy group, said that Mr. Sanders’s ability to raise money by positioning himself as an outsider reminded him of President Obama’s 2008 campaign, which received millions of dollars in small contributions.","2352","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/us/politics/outsider-presidential-candidates-prove-competitive-in-fund-raising.html?_r=0"

"White House officials announced the start of a nationwide campaign on Thursday to encourage legal immigrants to become American citizens, which could add millions of voters to the electorate in time for the presidential election next year.","SEPT. 17, 2015","2355","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/us/white-house-campaign-legal-immigrants-citizenship.html?_r=0"
"With about 8.8 million legal residents in the country who are eligible to become citizens, White House officials said they were trying to make it easier to complete the final steps to citizenship.","2356","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/us/white-house-campaign-legal-immigrants-citizenship.html?_r=0"
"The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency in charge of naturalizations, will offer practice tests on cellphones for the civics exam that immigrants must pass, but which many find daunting, and will hold preparatory workshops in rural areas. Applicants will also be able to pay the fee, still a hefty $680, with a credit card.","2357","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/us/white-house-campaign-legal-immigrants-citizenship.html?_r=0"
"The White House is working with regional immigrant groups to organize more than 70 citizenship workshops and about 200 naturalization ceremonies in the coming week alone. Four citizenship ambassadors have been named, including Fernando Valenzuela, the Mexican-born former pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers who recently became an American citizen after many years in the United States.","2358","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/us/white-house-campaign-legal-immigrants-citizenship.html?_r=0"

"The officials said they had started the campaign this week because Thursday is Citizenship Day. But the White House is also aware of federal figures showing that about 60 percent of immigrants eligible to naturalize are Latino and about 20 percent are Asian, both groups that voted overwhelmingly for President Obama. Nearly a third of legal permanent residents eligible to naturalize are Mexican.","2360","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/us/white-house-campaign-legal-immigrants-citizenship.html?_r=0"
"The campaign, which includes a blitz of television ads with a welcoming message for immigrants, gives Mr. Obama a chance to set up a contrast with Republicans vying to succeed him. In the Republican debate on Wednesday night, Donald J. Trump, the real estate magnate who has been leading the polls among the Republican candidates, returned to his hard-line proposals that include building a wall along the length of the southern border.","2361","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/us/white-house-campaign-legal-immigrants-citizenship.html?_r=0"
"“We have a lot of really bad dudes in this country from outside,” Mr. Trump said, claiming that undocumented immigrants include many gang members and drug dealers. “First day, they’re going,” he said, referring to Baltimore and Chicago as places where deportations of criminals would begin.","2362","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/us/white-house-campaign-legal-immigrants-citizenship.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Trump said he would deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants, then selectively allow some to return. Ben Carson, the pediatric surgeon in the Republican race who has seen a recent rise in the polls, also said he would consider mass deportation of all immigrants in the country illegally.","2363","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/us/white-house-campaign-legal-immigrants-citizenship.html?_r=0"

"“I think it’s healthy for a democracy for people to become citizens,” said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the American Principles Project’s Latino Partnership. “Sadly, I think the administration went overboard. A full-fledged campaign from the White House telling people to become a citizen, I think it is politicizing the naturalization process.” Mr. Aguilar, a Republican, was head of the citizenship office at the immigration agency for six years under the administration of President George W. Bush. He urged Congress to keep an eye on the campaign to make sure it did not go beyond civics education.","2367","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/us/white-house-campaign-legal-immigrants-citizenship.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Obama’s citizenship campaign is part of a package of executive actions first announced in November. The most ambitious of them, a plan to provide protection from deportation and work permits to about five million undocumented immigrants, was challenged in a lawsuit by 26 states and has been blocked in the courts.","2368","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/us/white-house-campaign-legal-immigrants-citizenship.html?_r=0"
"For now, White House officials have turned to the citizenship drive, which offers nothing for immigrants without legal status. To be eligible for naturalization, immigrants must have been legal permanent residents for at least three years and, in most cases, five years. The officials insisted the effort was nonpartisan.","2369","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/us/white-house-campaign-legal-immigrants-citizenship.html?_r=0"

"“We want to build off the negative energy,” said Tara Raghuveer, policy and advocacy director for the National Partnership for New Americans, a coalition of immigrant groups that is holding dozens of events during the campaign. “People are hearing the hate and racist xenophobia on the national stage from the presidential candidates.
