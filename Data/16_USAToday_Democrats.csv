"This isn’t the first time Barth was rejected by the establishment. When he ran for Congress in 2012, Barth sought support from party honchos. He was told he wasn’t “progressive” enough.

"Gov. Chris Christie has been wrong about a lot of things lately when it comes to pension reform. But he's right about this: Democrats are being irresponsible by simply joining in the union chorus demanding full pension payments without detailing an affordable way to accomplish that.","2:11 p.m. EDT April 27, 2015","500","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/04/27/pension-new-jersey-christie-sweeney/26460997/"

"The crisis at hand is a $1.6 billion payment that a judge has ruled the state owes the pension system right away, within the current fiscal year that expires in two months. That's a whopping chunk of money that New Jersey simply doesn't have and can't readily generate, not with this little time remaining under the current budget.","502","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/04/27/pension-new-jersey-christie-sweeney/26460997/"
"The Christie administration has appealed the ruling, and Democrats have been quick to denounce the governor for cutting the pension payment that had originally been included in the budget, but was sacrificed to cover a revenue shortfall. They say that if Christie had met the state's obligation and followed through with the planned payment, New Jersey would still be successfully sailing along under the provisions of a 2011 reform agreement, which called for gradually escalating state pension payments over several years that would eventually plateau and later decline.","503","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/04/27/pension-new-jersey-christie-sweeney/26460997/"
"Christie and Senate President Steve Sweeney hailed that agreement for supposedly setting New Jersey on a more fiscally solvent path.

"The truth, as so often happens, sits somewhere in the middle of the dueling partisan perspectives. Christie continues to work too hard at squeezing middle-class workers for more contributions and fewer benefits while trying to protect wealthier New Jerseyans. Democrats like Sweeney, however, seem to be far too cavalier about the state's ability to fully fund the escalating payments in the years ahead — or even the imminent $1.6 billion.","505","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/04/27/pension-new-jersey-christie-sweeney/26460997/"
"Democrats have floated a few ideas, like restoring the millionaire's tax, but they only dent the problem. Sweeney has suggested the state can settle for reaching 85 percent of its pension obligations rather than the full 100 percent and still have what would be considered a healthy system. What angered Christie, however, is when Democrats joined in the lawsuit filed by public-worker unions seeking full payment. Christie characterized the move as the Democratic lawmakers essentially suing themselves.","506","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/04/27/pension-new-jersey-christie-sweeney/26460997/"
"He has a point. Democrats can't just sit back and complain about Christie reneging on the deal, as if somehow he can make good on it all by taking money out of his own pocket. It appears Christie and Sweeney were both far too optimistic about that 2011 agreement, perhaps anxious to score some political points and keeping fingers crossed that a quickening economic recovery would make it all work. Democrats bear some responsibility for where we stand, and they can't just sound the trumpets on behalf of the unions without telling the public what a union victory would mean, and how the public would be affected.","507","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/04/27/pension-new-jersey-christie-sweeney/26460997/"

"Democrats were on board for months with the bill, offered by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, that increases legal protections and restitution for domestic trafficking victims. This week, however, they realized that a provision was included that puts abortion restrictions on a new victims' compensation fund.","1054","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/12/senate-sex-trafficking-bill-delayed-abortion/70209150/"

"Democrats contend that because the new fund is paid for by fines paid by convicted traffickers, it is an expansion of the Hyde Amendment and unable to win their support.

"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Thursday afternoon offered Democrats a deal to vote out the abortion provision, but Democrats rejected the offer as they do not have the votes to strip it out.

"With the bill stalled on the Senate floor, it has also become a target for unrelated immigration provisions. Sen.

"UPDATE: The Mississippi Democratic Party on Saturday did not address concerns levied against Chairman Rickey Cole but will take up the matter at a special-called meeting on March 28, according to Vice Chairwoman Vellena Greer.","3:17 p.m. EST March 2, 2015","1168","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"ORIGINAL STORY BELOW:","1169","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"As 2015 statewide elections kick off, Mississippi Democratic Party Chairman Rickey Cole faces complaints from his second in command about spending and raising money, management and failing to follow orders from the party's executive committee.","1170","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"A list of grievances by party Vice Chairwoman Vallena Greer leaked to The Clarion-Ledger suggests a leader who spends party money without proper authorization, disrespects fellow officers and ignores the state's sole sitting Democratic congressman.","1171","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"Cole called the allegations ""without merit"" and the unfortunate byproduct of a personality conflict between him and the party's vice chairwoman. Both were appointed to their positions in 2012 and apparently have clashed since then.","1172","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"""She is vice chair and has pushed this stuff,"" Cole said on Friday, referring to the three-page memo and 22 pages of records, including meeting minutes and photocopies of canceled checks, aimed against him.","1173","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"""I wasn't there,"" Cole said, ""but they had an administrative committee meeting, and a motion was made by her on some of these matters, and she couldn't get a second.""","1174","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson's staff didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.","1175","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"Greer, who admitted writing the grievance memo but did not leak it, denied having issues with Cole's personality. Her concerns, she said, center on his handling of party finances as revealed in a review of bank statements. Those statements, which she said she obtained upon the insistence of fellow party members, show Cole spending $31,020 between November 2013 and November 2014 ""without knowledge or approval by the committees.""","1176","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"Party Treasurer Ryan Brown dismissed Greer's complaints as sour grapes. He said he explained every check at a recent administrative committee meeting and ""it seemed to satisfy her questions.""","1177","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"""I don't think there's anything going on other than (Greer) is miffed because she's been requesting reimbursement for trips to Washington for DNC (Democratic National Convention) meetings that as treasurer I have not approved,"" Brown said. ""I think that money is better spent helping to recruit candidates for the Legislature statewide.""","1178","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"But Democratic Party Secretary Rae Shawn Davis, who also attended the meeting, said Brown didn't adequately answer all the questions. She also said the matter needs to be addressed before the entire party before it can be resolved.","1179","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"Greer, who recently attended two meetings in the nation's capital, said she hasn't submitted a reimbursement request and doesn't plan to because she always pays her own way.","1180","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"She also claimed Brown shares responsibility for the financial issues she raised and which she could raise again at the group's regularly scheduled meeting tomorrow.","1181","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"These are not just my concerns,"" Greer said. ""These are the concerns of the committee members. I became concerned after they wouldn't allow me to get copies of reports from the office. I had to go to the bank to get the reports and was surprised by what I saw.""","1182","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"Cole said he's happy to answer any questions that arise at the party meeting, which Brown said would be business as usual.","1183","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"
"""I don't think it would be a Democratic Executive Committee meeting without some whisper campaign to get rid of Rickey,"" Brown said. ""But it's a whisper campaign from a very small minority, and it never happens.""","1184","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/27/grievances-aimed-dem-leader/24134651/"

"BOB: This election was not about Obamacare; it was about too many Democrats up for re-election in red states, an unpopular Democratic president and a large GOP turnout.

"CAL: Now for 2015. Political divisions between and within each party will intensify, with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party causing problems for the rank and file and the conservative wing of the GOP frustrating its leadership in both chambers. The Pew Research Center has found ""the public is deeply pessimistic about the prospects for healing the nation's deep political divisions."" Only 26% of us are satisfied with the direction of the country, while 71% are dissatisfied. Given the 2016 presidential stakes, that chasm is unlikely to be narrowed in 2015.","1196","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/04/common-ground-2015-predictions-democrats-obamacare-ukraine-russia-gop-presidential-candidates-column/21263371/"

"CAL: I hope you're right about tax reform. Polls show while the public may be split on how to handle undocumented workers, they overwhelming favor securing the border. I predict Republicans will pass a bill to do precisely that and dare Obama to veto it. Republicans I've talked to think if he vetoes it, enough Democrats in both houses will join them to override him.","1198","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/04/common-ground-2015-predictions-democrats-obamacare-ukraine-russia-gop-presidential-candidates-column/21263371/"
"BOB: I agree a bill making our borders stronger will pass Congress, but the Obama administration will insist that any bill must include allowing undocumented workers who do not have criminal records to stay in the U.S., pay fines for entering illegally and support other immigrants who are seeking citizenship and have followed the rules to become U.S. citizens. The bill will put severe restrictions on future immigrants so those already here can be assimilated.","1199","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/04/common-ground-2015-predictions-democrats-obamacare-ukraine-russia-gop-presidential-candidates-column/21263371/"

"CAL: As many as two dozen GOP presidential candidates may announce their intentions in 2015. A front-runner will emerge who will be a governor, or former governor, not a senator.

"BOB: Again we find agreement. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush has announced an exploratory committee.

"BOB: Overseas, 2015 will witness several serious events: The continuing battle with the extremist Islamic State; the potentially more dangerous meltdown of the oil-based Russian economy; the invasion of the rest of Ukraine, or another former USSR territory, by President Vladimir Putin to divert his people's focus from the economy.

"CAL: I predict the U.S. will announce a nuclear deal with Iran, which will not deter that country's fanatical leaders from building a nuclear bomb.

"Abortion foes have found it difficult to pass standalone bills to restrict abortion, so they are increasingly inserting language into popular, unrelated bills, political analysts say. A bipartisan agreement to fight human trafficking is now imperiled and a deal toprevent a dramatic drop in Medicare payments for doctors nearly fell apart over the divisive abortion issue.","1259","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/25/abortion-politics-congress-trafficking-medicare/70322070/"

"The result is often gridlock. Case in point: An anti-abortion provision has led Senate Democrats to block an otherwise bipartisan bill that would strengthen penalties for criminals who engage in human trafficking.

"Abortion foes changed their strategy after a Republican attempt to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy failed in the House in January.

"Any prominent figure in 19th-century American politics would be unlikely to earn naming rights. Even ""the Great Emancipator"" Abraham Lincoln, who happened to be a Republican, was a strong supporter of the American Colonization Society belief that advocated the ""repatriation"" of African Americans to a spot on the coast of West Africa that was not native to most of them.

"There is an awkward term used in academic circles to describe the application of contemporary moral standards to people who lived long ago. It's called ""presentism,"" and it mercilessly subjects history and historical figures to contemporary social enlightenment. It is smug and self-satisfied and pats itself on the back for its own high-mindedness, but it is ignorant of context and erects impossibly high obstacles to which virtually no major figure can measure up. Certainly no one who had to endure the give-and-take of politics and the chore of dealing with people with whom they did not agree. Even the incomparable George Washington owned slaves.

"According to video transcript, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, PPFA’s senior director of medical services, mentions prioritizing the abortion of a “17-weeker” the day before because he or she was “more likely to yield what we needed.” Second trimester abortions, she explained, are the “cases that yield the tissue that you want.” Nucatola noted that one-quarter of Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles abortions occur in the second trimester (3,000 out of 12,000, she said).","1644","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/planned-parenthood-democrats-baby-column/31101983/"

"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats blocked an attempt Monday by Republican leaders to cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood, but the debate is likely to reignite this fall and could lead to a possible government shutdown.","6:09 a.m. EDT August 4, 2015","1675","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/03/planned-parenthood-senate-vote-funding/31058841/"
"Senators voted 53-46 for a bill from Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, that would stop the non-profit group from receiving any federal money from Congress.

"Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virgina and Joe Donnelly of Indiana voted with Republicans to move the bill forward. Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois joined Democrats in blocking the bill. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., switched his vote from yes to no — a procedural move that allows him to bring up the legislation again in the future. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., did not vote.","1677","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/03/planned-parenthood-senate-vote-funding/31058841/"
"The vote was largely symbolic since it was clear that Republicans — who have a 54-vote majority — did not have the super majority needed to move forward. For Republicans, taking on Planned Parenthood could appeal to conservative voters in next year's GOP primaries. For Democrats, defending abortion rights and access to contraception are key issues for their base.","1678","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/03/planned-parenthood-senate-vote-funding/31058841/"
"The issue is likely to re-emerge in the fall as conservatives in the House and Senate vow to block passage of 2016 spending bills unless federal funding for Planned Parenthood is halted. The White House has said it will veto any legislation that would end funding for the organization.","1679","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/03/planned-parenthood-senate-vote-funding/31058841/"

"The latest effort to take away the organization's federal funding came in the wake of the release of controversial videos by anti-abortion activists. Those videos show Planned Parenthood officials discussing procedures for obtaining and selling organs from aborted fetuses for medical research. The group has said it does not profit from the sale of fetal tissue and has done nothing improper nor illegal. Planned Parenthood leaders said opponents of abortion rights are trying to smear the organization.","1683","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/03/planned-parenthood-senate-vote-funding/31058841/"

"Planned Parenthood is already barred by federal law from using any of the $528 million in federal funds it receives each year for abortions. Instead, the group uses the money to provide women with birth control, cancer screenings, annual checkups, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and other services. About 75% of the money the group receives is reimbursement for serving low-income patients enrolled in Medicaid, Planned Parenthood officials said.","1685","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/03/planned-parenthood-senate-vote-funding/31058841/"
"Opponents of abortion rights have long sought to strip Planned Parenthood of federal funding because they say no taxpayer money should go to a group that performs abortions. Many Republicans are irked by the fact that the organization has a lobbying arm that pushes state and federal lawmakers to support abortion rights.","1686","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/03/planned-parenthood-senate-vote-funding/31058841/"

"""This fight may not be over, but we’re ready for it, just like we were in 2011, and in 2009, and in 2007,"" said Cecile Richards, the group's president, referring to past funding battles.

Right before Obama's trade bill cratered in the Senate last week, Obama complained that its chief Senate critic, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., didn't understand the real world. O'Neill then chalked Obama's attitude up to sexism.","1751","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/17/obama-women-warren-naacp-sexist-column/27486597/"

"Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, joined the chorus, also suggesting Obama's remarks were sexist, and then refused to apologize.

"Well, that's fair. The worst aspect of Obama's presidency has been the willingness of some defenders to characterize any and all criticisms of his policy or style as racist. With Warren (despite her denials) revving up for a potential 2016 presidential campaign — and already with Hillary Clinton's effort — we're seeing a new line of argument: That any criticism of a female politician is sexist. Apparently, the only kind of politician you can criticize on the merits in America nowadays is a white male.","1756","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/17/obama-women-warren-naacp-sexist-column/27486597/"
"The Democrats' tendency to argue identity politics over policy is more awkward when it's aimed at other Democrats. As The Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin comments: ""Is the 'war on women' being waged by the White House, or have Democrats become so accustomed to demonizing their opponents that they can't engage in civil debates even among themselves? It does not speak well of the Democrats' ability to persuade and lead.

"In my experience, people argue identity when they don't want to argue policy. And the reason they don't want to argue policy, usually, is that they're wrong. But in arguing that everyone who disagrees with them is a racist, or a sexist, or a tool of Big Money, or whatever, the Democrats run the risk of self-destruction. This is basically what happened to the the Labour Party in Britain: A reliance on easy tropes that please the base but alienate other voters.","1758","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/17/obama-women-warren-naacp-sexist-column/27486597/"
"As Daniel Hannan notes: ""When leftists attack the Tories, they're not just having a go at 300 MPs, or 100,000 party members: They're scorning everyone who has contemplated supporting the party. ... How do you think this sort of thing goes down, not only with anyone who has ever voted Conservative, but with moderate people who, though they haven't voted Tory themselves, have friends and family who have? When you adopt a bullying tone, you find that 1) voters don't like it; 2) you solidify the other side's core support; and 3) some people hide their voting intentions.""","1759","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/17/obama-women-warren-naacp-sexist-column/27486597/"
"Likewise, too many prominent Democrats and supporters have spent the past six years calling everyone who doesn't agree with Obama a racist. Now some of the same folks are gearing up to call everyone who doesn't support Clinton (or, perhaps, Warren, the backup-Hillary) a sexist. For instance, one group of Hillary supporters makes the preposterous claim that saying she is ""out of touch"" or 'insincere"" reflects a sexist worldview. This technique worked pretty well so far for Obama's presidency, but it now seems to be wearing thin, even within the Democratic Party.","1760","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/17/obama-women-warren-naacp-sexist-column/27486597/"

"The Democratic presidential front-runner's favorable rating is down to 39% in a recent Quinnipiac poll, from as high as 48% earlier this year.

"It's a month that's been unkind to other Democrats, too. In August a year before his re-election, President Obama’s approval rating stood at 40%, the low point of his presidency, according to Gallup; the same month in 1995, Clinton's husband, Bill Clinton, was at 46%, 12 points lower than shortly after he was re-elected.","2292","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/30/hillary-clinton-approval-ratings/71310258/"
"Much of the handwringing in the Democratic Party is over the 61% of Americans who now say Clinton is not honest and trustworthy.

"In August 1996, months before they re-elected him, 51% of Americans also said Bill Clinton, was not honest and trustworthy.

"It's a long view of the former first lady’s polling data that explains why it'll take far more adversity before Clinton and her allies sense real danger. As the email controversy drags on, her unfavorable ratings could dial further upward. That’s particularly true as the summer comes to a close, voter interest in the election perks up and Republicans prepare to grill her before a House special committee on Benghazi on Oct. 22.","2297","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/30/hillary-clinton-approval-ratings/71310258/"
"One could also derive inauspicious signs from her current favorability numbers given that both Bill Clinton and Obama stayed above 50% the year before they were re-elected. Most political experts hold that it’s difficult for any presidential candidate to win with a number much below that. Yet, in the current anti-Washington political climate, none of the 2016 candidates cross that threshold, according to Quinnipiac. To boot, several are already in negative territory, including Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Donald Trump, who, despite leading GOP polls, has the highest unfavorable rating of all at 54%.","2298","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/30/hillary-clinton-approval-ratings/71310258/"
"Much of the decline in Clinton’s favorability comes from people who would never vote for her anyway — Republicans and Republican-leaning voters who identify as independent, Witt says. There’s been an average 12-point increase among Republicans and independents.","2299","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/30/hillary-clinton-approval-ratings/71310258/"
"Among Democrats, her numbers haven’t changed much.

"""What you’re seeing is, well, Republicans don’t like her,’’ Witt said. As Clinton served as the nation’s top diplomat, Republican attitudes about her warmed, pushing her ratings as high as 62%. Now, however, she’s back in the political arena where opinions are more polarized.","2301","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/30/hillary-clinton-approval-ratings/71310258/"

"But let's skip ahead. Out of the gate, the Clinton campaign seems solid. The refrain that she's learned from her mistakes seems fair enough. Granting her the benefit of the doubt, she appears to be running an engaged, one-on-one, retail campaign. Indeed, for the fortunes of the Democratic party, her campaign may be too good. Everyday she runs an ever-more well-oiled and responsive organization, the chance, already remote, that others will join the race declines, practically speaking to nothing.

The explanation could be the simple concern that some Democrats have about the other shoe that they fear will drop about private servers or classified emails, the Clinton foundation, or even Benghazi.

"There is no Biden Foundation hoovering up billions of dollars from dubious sources. There is no spouse looming ominously in the background and raising questions about who the real president will be: Dr. Jill Biden is blessedly free of political ambitions. Above all, there is a feeling that the vice president, for all his sometimes over-the-top bonhomie, is a serious guy who has the knack of cutting deals, knows Capitol Hill like the back of his hand, feels comfortable in the company of foreign leaders, and for all of his gaffes and blunders — such as cribbing lines from a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock in 1987 — is mostly a straight shooter.","2397","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/03/clinton-scandals-biden-presidential-campaign-column/31033835/"

It didn't sit well with other big-name Democrats, but it showed him to be a tough and creative negotiator. His personal closeness to President Obama and the president's willingness to delegate important jobs to Biden raise him to the level of the most effective — and consequential — vice presidents.

Unenthusiastic support among women, particularly single women, would be a problem, given their prominent place in the Democratic base. There is no sure corrective for this problem other than a growing concern among Democrats that Clinton has feet of clay, and that rather than deliver the White House to a Jeb Bush with his primeval views on reproductive rights, it might be better to get behind someone like Biden, who is a less-polarizing figure who could draw independents to the party.","2399","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/03/clinton-scandals-biden-presidential-campaign-column/31033835/"
"One would have thought that Ronald Reagan's election in 1980 would have put to rest the concern over the age of a presidential candidate. Biden is just five years older than Clinton and a year younger than Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The extension of life expectancy is one of the most notable features of American life, and a candidate in his early 70s would have a natural appeal to older voters who are most likely to vote.

"HARRISBURG — Democrats can expect to decide a primary contest in nine months to see who will challenge U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican who is seeking his second six-year term in the 2016 election. The seat is expected to be crucial to determining control of the U.S. Senate, and Democrats hope their four-to-three registration advantage in Pennsylvania and heightened voter interest in the presidential election will deliver a victory to their eventual nominee. Here is a look at the race and the candidates:","7:57 a.m. EDT July 27, 2015","2511","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/27/campaign-pennsylvanias-senate-seat/73423204/"
"THE INCUMBENT: Toomey, 53, of suburban Allentown, is running for re-election and has the Republican Party unified behind him. Toomey is a free-market advocate and fiscal conservative who is popular with anti-tax, small-government and business advocacy groups. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has already run a TV ad this summer supporting Toomey's candidacy.","2512","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/27/campaign-pennsylvanias-senate-seat/73423204/"
"Still, Toomey doesn't always agree with business groups or even Republican leaders. For instance, he opposes the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank and he voted in 2013 against legislation to raise the nation's borrowing limit and end the federal government's 16-day shutdown, although rejecting the legislation risked a national default.","2513","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/27/campaign-pennsylvanias-senate-seat/73423204/"
"Toomey is showing that he is not afraid to wade into polarizing social issues: He is listed as a co-sponsor on Senate legislation banning most late-term abortions and he worked with West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin to expand background checks on gun purchases in the wake of the school shootings in Newtown, Connecticut.","2514","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/27/campaign-pennsylvanias-senate-seat/73423204/"
"Toomey's aides tout his willingness to work on legislation with Democrats. For example, in addition to the background checks legislation, Toomey and California Democrat Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill seeking to repeal the corn ethanol mandate in the federal Renewable Fuel Standard.","2515","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/27/campaign-pennsylvanias-senate-seat/73423204/"
"THE CHALLENGERS: Democrat Joe Sestak is returning for a rematch, but it appears he'll have to beat Katie McGinty next April 26 to do it. Sestak was a relatively unknown, second-term congressman and former Navy vice admiral who decided in 2009 to buck party leaders — including President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden — to challenge longtime U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican-turned-Democrat who switched parties to avoid a near-certain primary loss to Toomey. Sestak, 63, beat Specter soundly in the primary — largely thanks to Democratic Party primary voters who had opposed Specter for years.","2516","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/27/campaign-pennsylvanias-senate-seat/73423204/"
"Sestak went on to lose narrowly to Toomey in a strong election for Republicans. But Sestak cemented his reputation with party leaders as a maverick: he did not coordinate his campaign with the wider Democratic Party slate and he prided himself in standing up to party leaders.","2517","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/27/campaign-pennsylvanias-senate-seat/73423204/"
"McGinty, 52, joined the staff of then-U.S. Sen. Al Gore in 1989. She went on to become a top environmental adviser to the Clinton White House, Gore's 2000 presidential campaign and former Gov. Ed Rendell. After a stint in the private sector, the daughter of a Philadelphia police officer ran for governor, finishing a distant fourth in last year's four-way Democratic Party primary. But she made enough of an impression on Tom Wolf, the party's nominee, that he tapped her to head a political action committee that supported his general election candidacy, and then he hired her as his chief of staff. Some Democratic Party leaders remained uneasy with Sestak's repeat candidacy, and sought an alternative, including McGinty. McGinty resigned her post with Wolf on Wednesday and Democrats expect her to announce her candidacy soon.","2518","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/27/campaign-pennsylvanias-senate-seat/73423204/"
"THE COST: Expect tens of millions of dollars to pour into the race, mostly for TV ads. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington, D.C.-based campaign finance watchdog, candidates and outside groups combined spent more than $82 million on last year's Senate race in North Carolina, the most in the election cycle. Pennsylvania's last U.S. Senate election, in 2012, cost about $40 million, when U.S. Sen. Bob Casey beat Republican challenger Tom Smith. The cost of Pennsylvania's 2010 election for U.S. Senate exceeded $50 million. Toomey has a head start: he had more than $8 million in cash through the last federal reporting deadline of June 30; Sestak had just over $2 million.","2519","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/27/campaign-pennsylvanias-senate-seat/73423204/"
"THE MATH: Democrats have two things going for them. They own a four-to-three registration advantage over Republicans in Pennsylvania. The other one is this: Republicans are defending the seats of 24 incumbent U.S. senators in the 2016 election, while Democrats are defending only 10. That gives Democrats more chances to narrow the current Republican majority of 54-46.","2520","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/27/campaign-pennsylvanias-senate-seat/73423204/"

"Citizenship – what is it? According to Senator Bob Graham, ""Citizenship is not just a spectator sport."" What does this suggest? Citizenship is being part of your community, which includes participating in volunteer work. By volunteering for our community, not merely do we make our community an improved place, but we present what it really means to be an active citizen. So, no, citizenship is not just a spectator sport. It's a team sport, and everybody is on the playing field.","2533","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/10/democrats-civics-essay-contest-showcases-citizenship/25604051/"
"I perform countless acts of volunteering to improve my community. I participate in numerous charity functions and events around my community, like delivering groceries to the elderly and events outside my community, such as Surfers for Autism. Devoting my time to aid those in need always leaves me felling triumphant.","2534","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/10/democrats-civics-essay-contest-showcases-citizenship/25604051/"
"When participating in such functions I become immersed in the positive energy of volunteering. It feels like being engulfed in the sensation of knowing that you've accomplished a good deed. The wave of gratitude you receive from the citizens you volunteer for is priceless. Volunteering isn't only for helping out people in need, but for the interesting and rewarding experience.","2535","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/10/democrats-civics-essay-contest-showcases-citizenship/25604051/"
"When I volunteer my time, I recognize another special thing about citizenship, people work together as a team. Citizens know that they have to work together to succeed for a worthy cause. This type of teamwork is another example of citizenship in our community.","2536","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/10/democrats-civics-essay-contest-showcases-citizenship/25604051/"
"In conclusion, citizenship is definitely not just a spectator sport. It is how the people of a community join together to make their community a better place. To me, volunteering is like a story, in the exposition, the problem with the community is recognized, in the climax, the citizens work together to volunteer and solve the problems, and in the conclusion, the community is a better place.","2537","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/10/democrats-civics-essay-contest-showcases-citizenship/25604051/"

"Being an active citizen of any community means putting part of yourself aside in order to help others.

"Volunteering with the Alzheimer Project has helped me develop a working level of compassion. Every minute I'm volunteering, I'm showing the patients that they are our guests and I want to make them happy. Sometimes this involves reading them a storybook or telling jokes. Sometimes it's helping them learn a new game, or refresh an old one like tic-tac-toe. And sometimes, it's just making eye contact and listening to a story they want to tell me. Regardless of the style of my service, it is always based around adding quality to their lives.","2546","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/10/democrats-civics-essay-contest-showcases-citizenship/25604051/"
"Another thing I like about working at the Alzheimer Project is getting to know people who are different from me, in age, race, and life experiences. Some people might think Alzheimer patients have nothing to offer our community, but I don't believe that. The patients at the Project are from all walks of life. They are former professors, waitresses, stay-at-home moms, and athletes who have lived interesting, full lives, and by taking the time to listen to them, I've developed an appreciation for all people.","2547","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/10/democrats-civics-essay-contest-showcases-citizenship/25604051/"
"I recognize that my volunteer time might not change the world and its attitude towards Alzheimer's, but it is my hope that it improves the lives of those who show up every Friday to spend time with their peers. Becoming a better citizen starts at home, in our neighborhood, beginning with the little thing and spreading like wildfire.","2548","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/10/democrats-civics-essay-contest-showcases-citizenship/25604051/"

"Citizenship is being involved in the community to make a positive change. I think that the service learning I do at school has taught me to appreciate what I have and to help out whenever I can.

"WASHINGTON — There is growing agreement among senators that women should have over-the-counter access to birth control pills, but that is where the consensus stops and familiar political battle lines over women's health care emerge.","6:55 p.m. EDT June 9, 2015","2578","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/09/over-the-counter-birth-control-debate/28756861/"
"A group of Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., unveiled a bill Tuesday that would allow birth control pills approved by the Food and Drug Administration to be sold without a prescription.","2579","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/09/over-the-counter-birth-control-debate/28756861/"
"The bill upholds requirements in the Affordable Care Act mandating access to prescription birth control covered by insurance companies, so over-the-counter birth control would be covered without new costs.","2580","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/09/over-the-counter-birth-control-debate/28756861/"

"So do Republicans, according to Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who unveiled a GOP proposal late last month that also aims to make birth control pills available without a prescription. The bill makes good on a campaign pledge by Gardner in his successful election against incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. The race focused almost singularly on women's health care and reproductive rights.","2582","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/09/over-the-counter-birth-control-debate/28756861/"
"Gardner's bill would allow for over-the-counter birth control, and includes a proposal that would allow women to pay for it through health savings accounts.

"Democrats rebuked the GOP plan as a backdoor attempt to undermine the ACA and reinstate financial costs for women seeking birth control. ""Women shouldn't have to pay out of their own pockets for a critical part of their health care just because their insurance didn't cover it,"" Murray said.","2584","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/09/over-the-counter-birth-control-debate/28756861/"
"The GOP proposal does not include specific language bolstering the ACA mandate, although the Gardner proposal includes no language to alter the mandate and would allow for reimbursement from insurance companies for those with health savings accounts.","2585","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/09/over-the-counter-birth-control-debate/28756861/"
"Despite similarities seemingly at the core of the two proposals, reproductive rights groups overwhelmingly rejected the GOP bill, which they cast as a threat to current coverage protections. ""Access to birth control doesn't mean much unless it's affordable access. You can make birth control available over the counter, but if it still costs $600 a year, it will be out of reach for many women,"" said Planned Parenthood head Cecile Richards.","2586","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/09/over-the-counter-birth-control-debate/28756861/"
"Democrats also took issue with provisions in Gardner's bill that would create incentives for drug manufacturers to apply for a prescription to over-the-counter switch, in part by waiving certain application fees. ""We have to be very careful not to put political pressure on the FDA to approve drugs without going through the regular process,"" said Murray, whose proposal includes no industry or FDA incentive language.","2587","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/09/over-the-counter-birth-control-debate/28756861/"

"Women overwhelmingly support expanded birth control access, and the issue is significant motivator for women at the ballot box. A September 2014 Pew Research Center poll ahead of the midterms showed 44% of women viewed birth control issues as ""very important"" to their vote in Congress.","2589","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/09/over-the-counter-birth-control-debate/28756861/"
"Republicans in recent elections have underperformed among women, with the exception of the low-turnout midterms that helped propel Gardner to victory. With a national election on the horizon, Gardner's proposal notably has five GOP cosponsors who are either facing reelection or represent a swing state: Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Dean Heller of Nevada, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina.","2590","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/09/over-the-counter-birth-control-debate/28756861/"

"Nucatola had been caught on an undercover video talking to anti-abortion activists posing as representatives of a biological tissue procurement company. The abortion doctor said, “I’d say a lot of people want liver,” and “a lot of people want intact hearts these days.” Explaining how she could perform later-term abortions to aid the harvesting of such intact organs, she said, “We’ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I’m not gonna crush that part, I’m gonna basically crush below, I’m gonna crush above, and I’m gonna see if I can get it all intact.”","2602","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/21/planned-parenthood-abortion-fetus-parts-kirsten-powers/30426475/"

"This is stomach-turning stuff. But the problem here is not one of tone. It’s the crushing. It’s the organ harvesting of fetuses that abortion-rights activists want us to believe have no more moral value than a fingernail. It’s the lie that these are not human beings worthy of protection. There is no nice way to talk about this. As my friend and former Obama White House staffer Michael Wear tweeted, “It should bother us as a society that we have use for aborted human organs, but not the baby that provides them.”","2604","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/21/planned-parenthood-abortion-fetus-parts-kirsten-powers/30426475/"
"Richards worked to discredit the video by complaining it was “heavily edited.” But the nearly three-hour unedited video — a nauseating journey through the inner workings of the abortion industry — was posted at the same time as the edited video. Richards intoned menacingly that the video was “secretly recorded.” So what? When Mitt Romney was caught by “secret video” making his 47% remarks, the means of attaining the information was not the focus of the story.","2605","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/21/planned-parenthood-abortion-fetus-parts-kirsten-powers/30426475/"
"Planned Parenthood’s public relations firm also portrayed the crushing and organ harvesting as a “humanitarian undertaking,” and tried to tarnish the maker of the video with a white paper that deemed him unfit because he once wrote an article for the “opposition” outlet The Weekly Standard, a well-respected conservative magazine. Let’s talk about anything except the information disclosed by Nucatola.","2606","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/21/planned-parenthood-abortion-fetus-parts-kirsten-powers/30426475/"
"It’s a measure of how damning the video is that Planned Parenthood’s usual defenders were nowhere to be found. There was total silence from The New York Times editorial board and their 10 (out of 11) pro-abortion rights columnists. Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi — both recipients of Planned Parenthood’s highest honor, the Margaret Sanger Award — have been mum. But a few loyalists took up the cause, including Washington Post columnist Petula Dvorak, whose column was headlined: “Planned Parenthood deserves to be supported, not attacked.” Actually, it's fetuses who are under attack. By Planned Parenthood.","2607","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/21/planned-parenthood-abortion-fetus-parts-kirsten-powers/30426475/"
"Dvorak invoked a common defense against the barbarism of late-term abortion: “The details are gruesome, as are many medical procedures and how doctors and nurses tell stories about the operating room.” But nobody is morally repulsed by stories of heart transplants.","2608","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/21/planned-parenthood-abortion-fetus-parts-kirsten-powers/30426475/"
"Mississippi abortion doctor Willie Parker — who was lauded by Esquire for his “abortion ministry” — ran with the trope that direct quotes from a Planned Parenthood doctor constitute a vicious attack, but went a step further: He compared Nucatola to Jesus. “It's no secret that my frame of reference for the work that I do and in terms of generating compassion is related to my religious understanding and, in particular, my Christian religious understanding,” Parker told Cosmopolitan magazine. “I'm thinking about a strong parallel between what's happening to my colleague (Nucatola) and the trial week of Jesus before he was crucified (as) he was marched from place to place, asked to answer allegations.”","2609","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/21/planned-parenthood-abortion-fetus-parts-kirsten-powers/30426475/"

"The committee's Republican chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, has so far refused requests to disclose the transcript of the nine-hour interview last month with Cheryl Mills, who was Clinton’s chief of staff at the time of the attacks.","2793","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/05/democrats-benghazi-panel-release-testimony/73379400/"
"So Democrats, irritated by what they say are selective and inaccurate leaks by the GOP about Mills’ testimony, are going public. In a Monday letter, they gave Gowdy five days to notify them if he believes anything in the transcript should be withheld. In the meantime, Democrats disclosed their favored sections of Mills’ testimony, including statements about Clinton’s response the night of the attacks and her role in the follow-up investigation of the State Department by the Accountability Review Board.","2794","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/05/democrats-benghazi-panel-release-testimony/73379400/"
"“During Ms. Mills’ interview ... she debunked numerous Republican conspiracy theories that have been made for several years — and that continue to be repeated even today — yet Republicans did not make any of that information public,” the Democrats wrote.","2795","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/05/democrats-benghazi-panel-release-testimony/73379400/"

"The letter was signed by all five Democrats on the committee, including Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking member. It was prompted, in part, by controversial comments last week by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy that the committee has succeeded in damaging Clinton’s presidential campaign. McCarthy retracted his comments and defended Gowdy’s work as a neutral fact-finding mission without a political motive.","2797","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/05/democrats-benghazi-panel-release-testimony/73379400/"

"According to the testimony released by Democrats, Mills told the committee in her Sept. 3 interview that neither she nor Clinton tried to influence the direction of the Accountability Review Board’s investigation of the State Department. That backed up testimony from the board's leaders two years ago that neither Mills nor Clinton tried to edit the report.","2799","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/05/democrats-benghazi-panel-release-testimony/73379400/"
"Mills also told the Benghazi committee that Clinton wanted the board to be made up of people who “could give hard medicine if that was what was needed.”","2800","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/05/democrats-benghazi-panel-release-testimony/73379400/"
"“And I felt like, in the end, that team was a team that would speak whatever were their truths or observations to the Department so that we could learn whatever lessons we needed to learn,” Mills said, according to the testimony released Monday.","2801","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/05/democrats-benghazi-panel-release-testimony/73379400/"
"Republicans have challenged the independence of the Accountability Review Board's report, which was released in December 2012 about four months after terrorists overran U.S. facilities in Benghazi and killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. The investigation, led by retired ambassador Thomas Pickering and a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Michael Mullen, found systematic failures by State Department leaders that led to ""grossly inadequate"" security.","2802","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/05/democrats-benghazi-panel-release-testimony/73379400/"
"Mills also was asked about Clinton’s actions the night of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks, and whether Clinton had sought deployment of military assets. In an apparent attempt to refute allegations that Clinton has wanted the military to “stand down,” Mills said that on a secure video teleconference with the Defense Department and other agencies, Clinton said, ""we need to be taking whatever steps we can, to do whatever we can to secure our people.""","2803","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/05/democrats-benghazi-panel-release-testimony/73379400/"
"Immediately after Mills’ testimony, Gowdy said Republicans planned to treat her interview as classified. But Democrats immediately disputed that assessment, saying some staff members present for the interview didn't have security clearances. In their letter sent Monday, they say copies of the full transcript have been shared on unclassified email systems.","2804","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/05/democrats-benghazi-panel-release-testimony/73379400/"
"“Republicans may have their own partisan political reasons for wanting to keep Ms. Mills’ interview transcript out of the public view, but they may not suddenly claim it is now classified merely to prohibit its release to the American people,” according to the letter.","2805","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/05/democrats-benghazi-panel-release-testimony/73379400/"
"A spokesman for Gowdy and Republicans on the Benghazi committee said the panel has not released transcripts from witness interviews for several reasons, including to avoid tainting the recollections of future witnesses.","2806","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/05/democrats-benghazi-panel-release-testimony/73379400/"
"""Serious investigations hear from all witnesses and the testimony of each witness should be viewed in the context of all available information,"" Jamal Ware said.","2807","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/05/democrats-benghazi-panel-release-testimony/73379400/"

"""Of the 50,000 documents to which the committee has gained access, Democrats were interested in zero,"" he said. ""Of the 41 new witnesses interviewed, Democrats suggested zero.

"Barring unforeseen events, Kennedy will become the third sitting octogenarian on the court — Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 82, and Justice Antonin Scalia turns 80 in March. That will mark the first time since George H.W. Bush entered the White House more than a quarter century ago that a president has inherited three justices that old.

"Of all the reasons why the high court will loom large in the presidential election — from a docket brimming with hot-button issues to intensive lobbying campaigns on the right and left — none looms as large as simple arithmetic and actuarial tables.

"In recent years and during the current presidential primary campaigns, Republicans and conservatives act as if they have the most at stake, while Democrats and liberals appear more sanguine — even though the court remains largely conservative. There are several reasons:","2885","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"• Republican presidents have made 12 of the last 16 high court nominations but have yet to win a reliable majority, a record that motivates conservatives. For more than 50 years, Democratic nominees have behaved on the bench as they were expected to behave, causing less consternation on the left.","2886","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"• After seven years of the Obama administration — and 15 of 23 years with a Democrat in the White House — Republicans have a laundry list of grievances. They want to block or reverse President Obama's health care, environmental and immigration initiatives. They want the high court to overturn rulings by federal appeals courts now dominated by Democrats' nominees.","2887","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"• Because she already is 82, there is a perception that Ginsburg will be the next to leave the court. Her refusal to do so while Obama is president gives conservatives hope that they can increase their majority on the court under a Republican president.","2888","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"• No seat is as important as Kennedy's, who sits to Chief Justice John Roberts' left, both literally and figuratively. Conservatives rue the day Reagan nominated him in 1988 after two preferred candidates ran into roadblocks, and they want to ensure a Republican president replaces him. Control of the court will hang in the balance.","2889","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"

"Not since 1991 has a Supreme Court seat changed hands ideologically, when Justice Clarence Thomas replaced Thurgood Marshall. Since then, only conservative Justice Samuel Alito's replacement of the more moderate Sandra Day O'Connor in 2006 affected the balance on the court. The last time a Democratic president was handed such an opportunity was in 1962.","2891","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"These days, it wouldn't be easy for a president to replace a liberal with a conservative, or vice versa. While Senate Democrats in 2013 changed the chamber's rules so that judicial nominees could not be blocked by minority-party filibusters, they didn't include the Supreme Court. That means 41 senators can block a nomination — though even Thomas, confirmed by a bare 52-48 margin, wasn't blocked.","2892","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"Many experts foresee three scenarios for the next Supreme Court nomination battle: Either a Senate controlled by the president's party confirms the nominee by doing away with rules allowing the minority to filibuster, or a Senate ruled by the opposition forces the president to name a moderate or blocks any appointment until the next election. That last scenario could leave the court with only eight members for a protracted period.","2893","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"“It’s very likely that that seat just stays vacant until there’s unified control"" of the White House and Senate, says Ian Millhiser, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund. Blackman, a conservative, agrees. ""We should be prepared to consider leaving a seat vacant,"" he says.","2894","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"The stakes with four aging justices are huge: If a Democrat wins the White House and outlasts Kennedy or Scalia, the result could be a liberal court for decades to come, with an impact on issues such as abortion, campaign financing, political redistricting and voting rights.","2895","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"

Lincoln Chafee, who raised just $408,000 this year (compared with Hillary Clinton’s $77 million) had purchased his seats to attend the JJ, but he likely would have looked outmatched by his better-funded rivals. Former Virginia U.S. Sen. Jim Webb dropped out last week, too.","3012","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/10/25/8-takeaways-iowa-democratic-jefferson-jackson-dinner-sanders-clinton-omalley/74590332/"

"All three campaigns had pre-dinner rallies, but Team Clinton offered the strongest show of force. Pop superstar Katy Perry, who performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in February, recorded a wake-up-call message that all of Clinton’s Iowa staffers received early Saturday morning: “Wake-y Wake-y eggs and bakey.

"Federal officials are heeding the thousands of Iowans who have flooded them with concerns about the state’s plan to privatize its Medicaid program, Democratic legislators said Wednesday.","12:48 p.m. EST November 18, 2015","3328","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/18/iowa-democrats-take-medicaid-concerns-dc/75992064/"
"Three leading Iowa Senate Democrats met Wednesday morning in Washington, D.C., with Obama administration officials who will decide whether to approve Gov. Terry Branstad’s plan. The Iowa legislators want federal officials to at least slow down the shift to private Medicaid management, which is set to take place Jan. 1.","3329","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/18/iowa-democrats-take-medicaid-concerns-dc/75992064/"
"“We were really glad to hear from the folks in the room that they had heard from Iowans,” Sen. Amanda Ragan of Mason City told reporters in a conference call Wednesday morning.","3330","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/18/iowa-democrats-take-medicaid-concerns-dc/75992064/"
"Senate President Pam Jochum of Dubuque said federal administrators’ primary concern is whether the four managed-care companies would have sufficient networks of health-care providers participating in their plans. She said the administrators also want to ensure that the 560,000 Iowans using Medicaid would have consistent care during the changeover. The senators and other critics say neither condition can be met in the next six weeks.","3331","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/18/iowa-democrats-take-medicaid-concerns-dc/75992064/"
"“I’m walking out of the meeting feeling much better than I did when I came to Washington to talk to them. … They get it,” Jochum said. She declined to predict whether the Branstad administration would get permission to shift almost all Iowa Medicaid beneficiaries to private management on Jan. 1.","3332","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/18/iowa-democrats-take-medicaid-concerns-dc/75992064/"
"“We can only be hopeful that it won’t,” she said.","3333","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/18/iowa-democrats-take-medicaid-concerns-dc/75992064/"
"Branstad contends the private management companies could offer more efficient and flexible service for the poor or disabled Iowans using Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments. His staff has predicted the shift would save $51 million in the first six months. He also has repeatedly said that many other states have already made such changes.","3334","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/18/iowa-democrats-take-medicaid-concerns-dc/75992064/"
"Branstad met earlier this month with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell. He described the meeting as “encouraging,” and said his plan would phase in the shift over two years. He also has said Democrats controlling the Iowa Senate essentially agreed to his plan when they included projected savings from it in their annual budget proposal. Democrats dispute the notion that their budget line meant they thought the shift to private Medicaid management was a good idea.","3335","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/18/iowa-democrats-take-medicaid-concerns-dc/75992064/"
"Critics fear any savings to the state and profits for the management companies would come from cuts in services. They also predict the shift to managed care will bring chaos because few hospitals and doctors have signed contracts to participate in the companies’ networks. Medicaid recipients will be expected to choose a managed-care plan next month without knowing whether their health care providers will participate in the networks, critics say.","3336","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/18/iowa-democrats-take-medicaid-concerns-dc/75992064/"
"Jochum said Branstad’s claim about most other states moving to private Medicaid management “is truly misleading.” She said only four other states have shifted their entire Medicaid programs to private management.","3337","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/18/iowa-democrats-take-medicaid-concerns-dc/75992064/"
"Jochum and Ragan were accompanied to Washington by Sen. Liz Mathis of Robins. Ragan and Mathis help lead committees overseeing health care. They said federal administrators plan to be in Iowa the first week of December to meet in person with health care providers and Medicaid recipients.","3338","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/18/iowa-democrats-take-medicaid-concerns-dc/75992064/"
"The Senate Democrats said it would be practical for Iowa to delay the shift to private management, even though state administrators have been moving aggressively to prepare for the change. One complication could be that the Magellan management firm, which has coordinated Iowa’s mental health services for years, is set to have its contract run out Jan. 1. That function could be temporarily picked up by the state, which would pay bills for treatment under the traditional “fee for service” method, the senators said.","3339","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/18/iowa-democrats-take-medicaid-concerns-dc/75992064/"

"U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., who represents a Tempe swing district, is the only member of the state's Washington, D.C., delegation who has yet to publicly disclose how she will vote on the divisive foreign policy issue. A Sinema spokeswoman did not return messages Wednesday.","3459","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/09/09/ann-kirkpatrick-ruben-gallego-iran-nuclear-deal/71960630/"

"Kirkpatrick is likely to face questions about her support on the campaign trail as she seeks the seat of U.S. Sen. John McCain, who spoke against the deal Wednesday on the Senate floor. Around the same time, Republican presidential contenders Ted Cruz and Donald Trump held a rally on the Capitol lawn to protest the agreement.","3462","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/09/09/ann-kirkpatrick-ruben-gallego-iran-nuclear-deal/71960630/"
"Kirkpatrick said the deal is not perfect but is the United States' best diplomatic opportunity to prevent greater conflict. The agreement ""blocks Iran's path to a nuclear weapon, protects Israel and launches a historic diplomatic agreement that prepares us for the future in an increasingly volatile world,"" she said in a written statement.","3463","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/09/09/ann-kirkpatrick-ruben-gallego-iran-nuclear-deal/71960630/"

"In recent weeks, Clinton has crept closer to Sanders on a number of more liberal policies. She came out in opposition to both the Keystone XL pipeline and the Trans-Pacific trade deal — which she previously supported — as she tries to neutralize an unexpectedly potent challenge from the self-described democratic socialist Vermont senator.","3474","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"

"There are still big differences between Clinton and Sanders, and they’ll come into focus during the candidate forum. Sanders wants to break up the big banks, while Clinton would penalize bankers who violate the law. He would also raise the minimum wage higher than she would, to $15 an hour, and expand health care coverage through a major Medicare expansion. She says she wants to improve the Affordable Care Act. Clinton also voted for the Iraq War as a senator, while Sanders opposed it while in the House.","3476","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"

"Rather, she'll need to convince Democratic voters that her recent leftward drift is genuine and not just political opportunism amid the heat of a primary battle.","3478","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"
"In an appearance Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press, Sanders previewed his case against Clinton, the front-runner. ""People have to contrast my consistency and my willingness to stand up to Wall Street and corporations, big corporations, with the secretary,’’ he said.","3479","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"
"""It is going to be tough to walk away from her role’’ as the nation’s former top diplomat on issues like Keystone and trade, said Bill Buck, a Democratic strategist who is unaligned with a candidate. ""She needs to walk a fine line to avoid a mistake.’’","3480","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"
"As for the the other debate participants, O’Malley may have the most at stake, with polls showing him stuck below 1%. A breakout moment may be his only hope of gaining the traction needed to secure the money and endorsements necessary to continue his bid.","3481","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"
"For Clinton, the debate is also a chance to shift the focus away from her use of a private email server while she served as secretary of State, a controversy that’s dragged down her poll ratings, and on to her policy proposals. A weak or strong performance might also tip the hand of Vice President Biden, who is still mulling a decision on whether to enter the race.","3482","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"
"Clinton is trying to demonstrate her commitment to progressives without alienating the wealthy donors her campaign will rely on far more than Sanders, whose financial support comes mostly from small, Internet-based donors.","3483","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"
"For Sanders, the challenge is to convert his populist fire on the stump into a more personal and engaging approach that draws contrasts with Clinton’s past positions without appearing to directly attack her.","3484","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"
"The one issue on which he may find himself on defense is guns. While Sanders now supports expanding background checks, he has a long record of opposing gun control, including the 1994 Brady Law that established mandatory background checks.","3485","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"
"""I would push Sanders hard on guns,’’ said Buck. ""It’s a bigger liability in the primaries than the Iraq War vote.’’","3486","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"
"The debate location, Nevada, is a showcase of sorts for an argument Clinton aides make that the Sanders threat is overblown.","3487","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"
"Once the battle moves from overwhelmingly older and white Iowa and New Hampshire, they say, her grip on the nomination will tighten. In Nevada, the first early-voting state with a large Latino population, Clinton has a 16-point lead over Sanders, according to a recent CNN/ORC poll.","3488","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"
"The advantage widens to 22 points without Biden in the race. Her lead in South Carolina, the first Southern voting primary state, is even wider, at 25 points over Biden and 31 points over Sanders.","3489","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"

"Then Sanders came within $2 million of Clinton’s fundraising totals over the past quarter and has continued to draw large crowds. Even if he’s unlikely to secure the nomination, he’s already succeeded in pushing Clinton leftward on many issues in a race that, several months ago, seemed like it might not be much of one.","3491","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/hillary-clinton-debate-democrats-bernie-sanders/73833196/"

"Hillary Clinton’s mostly surefooted debate performance in the Democrats’ first presidential Tuesday night seemed to help her quite a lot, chiefly by weakening the argument that Vice President Biden should get into the race because the front-runner is dangerously vulnerable.","3496","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/14/democratic-presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-editorials-debates/73909126/"
"Clinton was the best prepared and most deeply knowledgeable of the five Democrats, displaying a mid-campaign form and just enough humor and fire to make her look like the front-runner the polls still say she is. The main arguments for a Biden candidacy have been that Clinton was losing altitude and that the party needed an insurance policy if she continued to decline or if her email troubles spun out of control.","3497","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/14/democratic-presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-editorials-debates/73909126/"
"That could still happen, but perception counts for a lot in politics, and her strong effort Tuesday could help dispel doubts. Biden, meanwhile, is exhausting the party’s patience by continuing to dither about whether he’ll run. Now reports say he’s trying to figure out whether he can wait until November, after Clinton's appearance next week before the House Benghazi Committee, to make up his mind.","3498","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/14/democratic-presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-editorials-debates/73909126/"
"Clinton was hardly flawless Tuesday night. When she got an obvious question she should have been more than prepared for — whether electing another Clinton to the White House would be just stale dynasty politics — she stumbled through an unsatisfactory response about the first woman president being the ultimate outsider.","3499","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/14/democratic-presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-editorials-debates/73909126/"
"Nor did she manage to decisively handle the controversy over the email system she used as secretary of State until rival Bernie Sanders threw her a lifeline by saying, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!”","3500","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/14/democratic-presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-editorials-debates/73909126/"

"In his 1996 State of the Union address, Bill Clinton famously said “the era of big government is over.” Gauging by Tuesday’s debate, this year’s cast of Democratic candidates — including Clinton’s wife — didn’t get the message.","3503","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/14/democratic-presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-editorials-debates/73909126/"
"Like most debates, this one touched on a wide range of topics. But when it focused on issues such as Social Security, Medicare and college tuition, it seemed to have settled on a new slogan: “Spend, baby, spend.”","3504","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/14/democratic-presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-editorials-debates/73909126/"
"The indefatigable Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, of course, led the pack. He pushed his plans to increase Social Security benefits by an average of $65 per month, pay every dime of the cost of students attending public universities, and expand Medicare to make it available to anyone.","3505","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/14/democratic-presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-editorials-debates/73909126/"
"But the others weren’t far behind. Clinton and former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, the most plausible of the three lesser-known candidates, want to expand Social Security. Both would pour money into subsidizing tuition. And O’Malley has a sweeping health plan that makes Obamacare look tame.","3506","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/14/democratic-presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-editorials-debates/73909126/"
"The utter impracticality of all this is impressive. Candidates are pushing enormous new spending at a time when Congress won’t even commit to funding roads for more than a few weeks at a time. They’re pushing new entitlements as the answer when existing benefit programs already account for nearly two-thirds of all federal spending.","3507","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/14/democratic-presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-editorials-debates/73909126/"

"Although income inequality is a serious problem, it would be nice if Democrats could acknowledge that not all problems are caused by Republicans and Wall Street. The country has serious challenges that stem from its wildly inefficient health care system and its appetite for taxing the working to pay for the retired. Rather than spending more, they should demand more results from what is being spent.","3509","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/14/democratic-presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-editorials-debates/73909126/"

"At the two GOP debates that came before the Democrats got their chance in Las Vegas, the candidates generally competed to see who was the most pro-gun and pro-life — and the most anti-illegal immigrant and anti-climate change action.

"Hillary Clinton, who has lurched to the left in her primary race against Bernie Sanders, described herself as “a progressive who likes to get things done” and tries to find common ground. Given Republicans’ long history of animosity toward Clinton, however, it’s hard to see her getting more cooperation from Republicans in Congress than President Obama has gotten.","3513","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/14/democratic-presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-editorials-debates/73909126/"

"The parties' respective debates offer a preview of the stark choice voters will face next fall, when the eventual presidential nominees will square off. They are also a sign of the sharply divided public opinion on issues such as guns, which Sanders rightly pointed out reflects an urban-rural split in addition to an ideological one.","3515","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/14/democratic-presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-editorials-debates/73909126/"

"Prieto said replenishing the trust fund would spur highway construction projects and boost commerce: “That’s the first domino of what we need to be able to tackle taxes in the state of New Jersey because when you put these people back to work, these people then now have money to be able to buy goods and services. That’s a bubble-up economy,” Prieto said.","3980","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/11/20/new-jersey-property-taxes/76124916/"
"Yes, by all means, grow revenue. But the “first domino” of tackling taxes is not raising them. It’s cutting them. It’s remarkable that the Democrats still can’t grasp how the nation’s highest-in-the-nation property taxes are driving people, businesses and jobs out of state, putting even more upward pressure on taxes.","3981","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/11/20/new-jersey-property-taxes/76124916/"
"It should be noted that Prieto, who determines which bills get hearings in Assembly committees, did not sign the Asbury Park Press’ pledge to work to reduce property taxes by 10 percent in the current legislative session.

"Prieto, in addition to his $65,000 salary as Assembly speaker, is a code official for Secaucus and construction official in Guttenberg, reportedly bringing his total salary to more than $200,000.

"Prieto, who has refused repeated invitations to meet with our editorial board to discuss his priorities and property taxes, also has been reluctant to share his views with his own constituents.

"On property taxes, however, he seems at a loss for answers.

"Sorry, “whittling away” isn’t enough. And he hasn’t even done that. We recently dropped off a petition at his office at the Statehouse with 14,000 names on it urging state legislators to cut property taxes. At the same time, we delivered dozens of letters from New Jersey residents pleading for tax relief. Apparently, he doesn’t care, at least not enough to attempt to bring fiscal sanity to New Jersey government.","3989","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/11/20/new-jersey-property-taxes/76124916/"
"He has ignored approximately 190 pieces of legislation introduced this session mostly by Republicans — on the topic of property taxes, some with ambitious cost-cutting goals and others that would “whittle away, little by little.” If Prieto can’t seem to crack the tough property tax nut, we would suggest he take a long look at our “10 ways to slash property taxes,” and the Senate Republicans’ website, which lists more than 30 ways to make New Jersey more affordable.","3990","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/11/20/new-jersey-property-taxes/76124916/"
"Does Senate President Sweeney offer any more hope for strapped taxpayers than Prieto? Sweeney was actually the driving force behind the pension and health care reforms in 2011.

Call her one of the architects of the disaster that has swept the world on her sleepy watch, and had just erupted again on the streets of Paris. Once again her timing was perfect — perfectly awful. For a Democratic president had just told the country and the world that any threat from the Islamic State, aka ISIS, had been contained — when it exploded again, turning the City of Light into a city of horrors.

"“I think there is a difference between mudslinging and issue contrasts,” said Iowa Democratic operative Jeff Link of LinkStrategies in Des Moines. “However, Sanders emerged by doing neither. Instead, he touched a nerve among Democrats by talking about his own positions and ideas for the future. I’m not sure why you would abandon a strategy that grew your base from nothing to about 40 percent.”","4138","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"Sanders has said he feels baited.","4139","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"""I can't walk down a hallway in the nation's capital without people begging me to beat up on Hillary Clinton, attack Hillary Clinton,"" he said Nov. 6 at MSNBC's ""First in the South"" forum.","4140","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"O’Malley’s fresh-faced earnestness has turned into urgent determination as he goes on the offense — after both Clinton and Sanders.","4141","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"“Desperate candidates — like desperate people — are always the most intriguing to watch,"" Burns said.","4142","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"Democratic insiders said they don’t see O'Malley emerging as Clinton’s running mate, so he need not show deference with that in mind.","4143","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"“I think he has to hit Clinton. Go after the queen, so to speak,” Burns said.","4144","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"The best hope for O'Malley might be for Clinton and Sanders to attack each other, said Des Moines Democratic strategist Grant Woodard. ""People may be turned off by both and go to him by default, similar to the 'mutually assured destruction' that took down both Richard Gephardt and Howard Dean in favor of John Kerry and John Edwards in 2004,” he said.","4145","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"Gephardt had the lead at this point in the 2004 Iowa caucuses (27 percent), followed by Dean (20 percent), but Kerry (15 percent) and Edwards (5 percent) climbed to more than 30 percent each on caucus day.","4146","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"Clinton won’t try to stomp Sanders because she won't want to alienate his supporters, politics watchers said. She's keenly attuned to the need for party unity once the nomination is won.","4147","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"“Whatever you care about,” Clinton said in Grinnell on her most recent Iowa trip, “whatever you clap for, whatever you think is important will be at stake in this election. And it is really important that the Democrats win. There is no doubt in my mind that there is no such thing as a perfect candidate, because there is no such thing as a perfect person.”","4148","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"Link said: “She has been making gains by talking about equal pay and exposing the House Republicans for their political motives in the committee hearing. I think she will continue that path.”","4149","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"By opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, the three Democrats are viewed in some quarters as placing their fealty to labor union members over the interests of farmers. That hands Republicans a big issue to use in Iowa in the general election, Burns said.","4150","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a popular former Iowa governor, has declared that the trade pact would be a boon for Iowa-grown grain and pork, Burns noted.","4151","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"After the text of the proposed deal was released on Nov. 5, Vilsack sent out a glowing news release saying this ""high-standard agreement"" would mean great opportunity for the ag industry and ""higher-paying American jobs.""","4152","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"""What can the Democratic presidential hopefuls say? 'We're right on TPP, and Tom Vilsack, who is from Iowa and has led United States ag policy for the better part of a decade, is wrong?'"" Burns said.","4153","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
"It's a trendy strategy for candidates to localize their campaign-trail answers.","4154","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/features/2015/11/13/7-things-watch-democrats-iowa-debate/75729422/"
