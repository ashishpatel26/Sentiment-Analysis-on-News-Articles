"A new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds Republican and Republican-leaning voters scattered among 18 prospective nominees when asked an open-ended question about whom they want the GOP to nominate for president next year. ""Undecided"" finishes first, at 45%, trailed by 2012 nominee Mitt Romney at 16% and former Florida governor Jeb Bush at 13%.","2","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/26/usa-today-suffolk-poll-2016/22344379/"
"No one else gets close to double digits, though potential contenders including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and others make the list of those mentioned.","3","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/26/usa-today-suffolk-poll-2016/22344379/"
"The contrast couldn't be sharper with the other side. A 51% majority of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters name former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton as their preferred nominee; 31% are undecided. Just 5% name Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of progressive activists, and 4% Vice President Biden.","4","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/26/usa-today-suffolk-poll-2016/22344379/"
"The telephone survey of 395 Democrats and 319 Republicans, taken Wednesday through Sunday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points for the Democratic question and 6 for the Republican one.","5","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/26/usa-today-suffolk-poll-2016/22344379/"
"The Republican contest unofficially was launched in Des Moines over the weekend, when a procession of presidential prospects delivered speeches to the Iowa Freedom Summit, a gathering of conservatives. The opening Iowa presidential caucuses are now about a year away.","6","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/26/usa-today-suffolk-poll-2016/22344379/"
"To be sure, a survey this far from the election can be largely a test of name identification. ""The fact is that people are recalling the names they're most familiar with,"" says David Paleologos, director of Suffolk's Political Research Center, in Boston. ""So it has its limitations.""","7","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/26/usa-today-suffolk-poll-2016/22344379/"
"But the survey does spotlight the lack of a front-runner to define the early contest among Republicans. Before the last election, an open-ended question asked in an ABC News/Washington Post Poll in April 2011 also showed Romney at 16% — but that was double the standing of anyone else.","8","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/26/usa-today-suffolk-poll-2016/22344379/"

"Keating, who was among those who met with Jeb Bush in Washington last week, says he's been surprised by the number of Republicans who are waiting to see what happens before lining up behind a candidate. ""People have walked into a brightly lit grocery store and are looking at all the attractive fruits and nuts,"" he said.

"That's not to say Democrats are necessarily happy with their choices. In all, 58% of Democrats say the two parties don't do a good job of representing Americans' political views and say a third party or multiple parties are necessary. That's also the view of 45% of Republicans and 65% of independents.","12","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/26/usa-today-suffolk-poll-2016/22344379/"

"Freshman Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, was tapped to give the official GOP response, in which she instead called for lowering tax rates by closing loopholes.""The president has already expressed some support for these kinds of ideas,"" she said.

"GOP lawmakers made it clear that the proposals the White House revealed in the days leading up to the address are non-starters in the new, fully GOP controlled Congress. ""Another tax increase obviously is not what we had in mind,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters.","17","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/20/obama-congress-react-sotu/22061941/"
"Republicans characterized Obama's address as a speech more tailored for the campaign trail than to a Republican Congress, where his proposals for free community college, expanding paid sick leave and making childcare more affordable, among others, have few allies in the Republican Party where lawmakers contend they are costly new programs the country can't afford right now. ""He knows we're not likely to pass these kinds of measures,"" McConnell said.","18","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/20/obama-congress-react-sotu/22061941/"

"Republicans said trade and cyber security remain areas where the GOP and the president can find agreement. ""We'll still look for things that we can actually agree on to try to make some progress here,"" McConnell said. Obama likewise cited those items in his address, and his call to advance trade pacts with Europe and Asia enjoyed a rare moment of GOP applause.","20","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/20/obama-congress-react-sotu/22061941/"
"Democrats, however, cheered Obama's economic message that included renewed calls for equal pay legislation and raising the federal minimum wage. Top Democrats attribute the party's losses in the 2014 midterm elections to a lackluster message on the economy despite growing signs of economic strength. Obama's speech coincides with the strongest economic period of his presidency, including a 5.6% unemployment rate.","21","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/20/obama-congress-react-sotu/22061941/"

"Obama's proposal to expand tax breaks for middle-class earners by paying for it with new fees on the top financial firms was lauded by Democrats hoping to energize the party with a more populist economic agenda to appeal to Americans who do not feel part of the economic recovery.","23","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/20/obama-congress-react-sotu/22061941/"
"It is the second year in a row that the Republican Party has tapped a female lawmaker to give the official response. Republicans also tapped Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., to deliver the Spanish-language version of the party's official response.

"Ernst's response also focused on an economic message that underscored the stresses facing American families, which Republicans contend are because of Obama's policies. ""Americans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare,"" she said.","25","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/20/obama-congress-react-sotu/22061941/"

"One of the most appealing targets would be the tech industry's wage-suppressing hiring habits. Not only have tech giants like Apple and Google engaged in what a federal court called an ""overarching conspiracy"" to prevent wage competition, but Silicon Valley firms also abuse H-1B visas to bring in immigrant competition at lower wages, a practice that's now spreading to other industries.

"First, a much stricter prevailing wage law for H-1B visas, with big damages against violators designed to make plaintiffs' attorneys zero in on this area. You can import foreign help if you want, but you have to pay those Indian or Chinese software engineers the prevailing wage for American software engineers in Silicon Valley, rather than paying the pittance most companies pay now. (In one case, a Silicon Valley firm was paying $1.21 an hour.) There has been a lot of cheating on H-1B visas, and this should help. The tech companies' excuse for hiring immigrants is that they can't find enough qualified Americans, not that they just want to pay sweatshop wages, though that excuse is bogus. Companies also draw out the H-1B application process to keep workers under their thumbs and away from competitors, something called ""handcuffing."" Maybe shortening the fuse on the application process there would be a good idea, too, or — again — creating damages that trial lawyers can exploit. (Most GOP types reflexively hate trial lawyers, but, like Kurt Schlichter, I think it's better to have them working for you than against you).

"Tech companies will hate this, but I don't see any downside for Republicans in siding with employees against the super-wealthy of Silicon Valley. It might even split off some tech-industry support, dividing the Silicon Valley worker bees from the oligarchs. I have Democratic friends who work there and this is a really big issue among them. And who could be against paying a ""living wage?"" For added fun, have some hearings where fat-cat Silicon Valley oligarchs are grilled about worker exploitation.","140","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/22/republicans-silicon-valley-wall-street-column/25183105/"

"America could use much more in the way of legislation and oversight to remedy these abuses — which, frankly, have been permitted mostly because the entertainment industry and Silicon Valley have been big donors to the Democratic Party for years. The GOP could change all that, and if it's smart, the Republican-dominated Congress will be passing bills to protect American workers and consumers from the depredations of these industries between now and 2016.","142","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/22/republicans-silicon-valley-wall-street-column/25183105/"

"Some see this unwillingness as a support for free markets, but there's a big difference between support for Big Business and support for free markets.

Bush administration: ""It is unacceptable that the Iraqi government will present the agreement to the Iraqi parliament for approval — yet the Bush administration will not do the same with the U.S. Congress.

"If you're a progressive and you like a little schadenfreude with your politics, you're probably enjoying the obvious squirming that many high-profile Republicans are doing when the climate issue comes up.

"But a funny thing happened on the way to 2015. Francis became pope. And Catholics came to greater prominence in the Republican Party.

But he has yet to signal any change of heart or strategy on climate.","543","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/22/pope-climate-change-gop-column/25192839/"
"In January, several weeks after the news that Francis would issue his environment encyclical, Boehner pulled out the standard ""job killer"" line in response to the latest White House action against carbon emissions. As to the reality of human-caused climate change, Boehner said he would leave that to the scientists to debate and resolve, as if they hadn't already.","544","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/22/pope-climate-change-gop-column/25192839/"

"That's where the pontiff's exhortation can make the biggest difference. If the upcoming encyclical is transformative the way many hope, public opinion will swing, perhaps dramatically.

"The latest RCP Poll has the top three potential candidates for the 2016 Republican nomination as Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, and Paul Ryan (Ryan is my personal favorite, but more on that in another post). Of course polls are just polls, but this list gives us a hint as to where the Republican Party is headed- and it's hopefully headed back to the White House. With the 114th Congress officially open as of yesterday, the GOP now holds its largest majority in the House since the 1940's, and as I wrote back in November, this has everything to do with a move away from the culture war crusaders and a move towards a ""bigger tent"" and a positive message.","551","http://www.usatoday.com/story/editorial/2015/01/07/2015-the-year-of-rational-republicans/21397765/"
"I realize that there are corners of the Republican Party that flinch at the thought of placing reason over politics, because they equate that idea with sacrificing one's convictions. This is an unfortunate misunderstanding and is indicative of a major problem within the Party: that too many allow the ""perfect to be the enemy of the good"". In any body of leadership, the leaders who are perpetually loud, angry, and antagonistic do not maintain their position for long. They are not seen as leaders but as agitators, and that is counterproductive to getting anything done. We need leaders who have the ability to hold strong to their convictions while governing alongside others who do not agree with them on every issue. Only then can their convictions actually be used to effect real change. And with Republicans now holding the majority in both the House and the Senate, there is significant potential to finally see some productivity in the U.S. Government.","552","http://www.usatoday.com/story/editorial/2015/01/07/2015-the-year-of-rational-republicans/21397765/"

"It took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I was a Republican...and even longer to admit it publicly. That was primarily due to the fact that the loudest Republican voices (and the ones pointed out to me by media and others in my social circles) were the ones that turned me off to the Party the most. But I could not shake the fact that my values and ideology were in line with those at the core of the Republican Party. So I am encouraged to see more and more Republican leaders allow their responsibility to govern trump what some would argue to be their obligation to ideological purity. We saw this approach succeed nationally in the midterm elections, and locally in the campaigns of folks like Rich Funke; and even Mark Assini, who did not win, but did send a powerful message through a well-run race that NY-25 is no longer an unwinnable race for the right Republican candidate.","554","http://www.usatoday.com/story/editorial/2015/01/07/2015-the-year-of-rational-republicans/21397765/"

"That's the message the Republican National Committee is sending to the Spanish-language TV network, Univision. The RNC recently announced its schedule of primary presidential debates, which will begin in August. ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, CNBC, Fox, and Fox Business were all selected to air debates.

"The RNC decision to exclude Univision is misguided. In their desire to avoid facing questions on the issue of immigration, Republicans are choosing to avoid a potentially huge Latino audience. Univision is the country's fifth-largest TV network, reaching 94 million households. Last year Univision tied with CBS and NBC as the most-watched network among the key 18-49 demographic. Its local news broadcasts regularly beat their English-language competition in cities like New York, Houston and Los Angeles. In 2012, the Hollywood Reporterestimated Univision network's share of Spanish-language broadcast viewers at 73% compared with Telemundo's 21% percent audience share.","837","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/28/univision-gop-debates-raul-reyes/22403041/"
"The GOP's own ""autopsy report"" — which was produced following their defeat in the 2012 presidential election — called for more engagement with Hispanics and other minorities. The RNC is unwise to leave Univision out of the debates, especially considering that CNN and Fox each received two debates – with the possibility of a third.","838","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/28/univision-gop-debates-raul-reyes/22403041/"

"Priebus is being disingenuous. The GOP's problem is not that Univision covers them unfairly; their problem is that the Univision covers them accurately. Univision is, in fact, helping get the GOP message out, like the recent vote by House Republicans to deport Dreamers. Rather than resorting to the blame game, Priebus ought to push his party to support immigration reform – a top concern of Latino voters.","840","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/28/univision-gop-debates-raul-reyes/22403041/"

"After the president unveiled his executive action on immigration, Ramos wanted to know why it took so long.

"Besides, Univision will be covering immigration and the Republican debates anyway. Why wouldn't the RNC choose to be part of the conversation?

Hispanics deserve to hear those positions directly from the candidates.""","844","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/28/univision-gop-debates-raul-reyes/22403041/"
"She's right. The GOP is missing an opportunity, and it's their loss. In fact holding a Republican primary debate on Univision would be a chance for the candidates to explain why most of them are so opposed to the Affordable Care Act, which has led to a dramatic drop in the number of uninsured Latinos. Or why they are mostly opposed to raising the minimum wage, which could increase Latinos wages by $8.5 billion. It wouldn't be just about immigration.","845","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/28/univision-gop-debates-raul-reyes/22403041/"

"Certain congressional Republicans, angry over President Obama's executive actions to create the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) programs, have attempted to strip away these programs through language in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding bill. The problem of course is that DHS performs critical functions to protect Americans. Republicans suddenly find themselves in the crosshairs of critics and concerned Americans because of ISIL and other growing threats around the world.","3:25 p.m. EST February 24, 2015","849","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/republicans-immigration-executive-judge-ruling-column/23931537/"

"While some Republicans continue to remain steadfast and insist that the president's programs be defunded, we believe that pursuing this course of action is unnecessary and a mistake. Because of Judge Hanen's injunction, a fully funded bill would not immediately support either of these programs. Of course, the government has stated that it will appeal the judge's decision to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. If the 5th Circuit declines to overturn Judge Hanen's ruling, the injunction will remain in place and the programs cannot move forward while the case is litigated. If the 5th Circuit lifts the injunction, Republicans can correctly claim that they turned the issue over to the judicial process and that process — the rule of law — found in favor of the government for now.","851","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/republicans-immigration-executive-judge-ruling-column/23931537/"

"Some voices in the debate are doing an effective job painting the Republican Party as the anti-immigrant party of ""No."" Spanish-language news anchor Jorge Ramos stated that Judge Hanen's decision defineswho is against immigrants in the United States and Latino voters will remember this in 2016. Moreover, following Judge Hanen's ruling, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., predicted an unprecedented ""militancy"" among Latino voters who will take out their anger on Republicans in 2016. Immigration advocates across the country are already getting out the message that a Republican-appointed judge has single-handedly shut down executive action for immigrants, and the underlying implication, if not outright accusation, is that the ruling is a result of anti-immigrant racism and nativism.","853","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/republicans-immigration-executive-judge-ruling-column/23931537/"
"Rule-of-law advocates, in the meantime, are failing to effectively get out the message that this is a case about institutional prerogatives, rather than anti-immigrant sentiment. Another message that has failed to take root in the American consciousness is that many of the previous pro-immigrant government reforms have been led by Republicans. The 1986 amnesty and revision of the Registry Provision were passed during the Ronald Reagan administration. The 1990 Immigration Act, which expanded the number of permanent residency visas available to immigrants, was passed during the George H.W. Bush Administration and the 2002 Child Status Protection Act was passed during the George W. Bush Administration.","854","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/republicans-immigration-executive-judge-ruling-column/23931537/"
"Conversely, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRAIRA) was passed during the Bill Clinton Administration. IIRAIRA has been very tough on immigrants, introducing new grounds of inadmissibility, making minor criminal offenses removable offenses under U.S. immigration laws, allowing prolonged detention of immigrants and introducing the controversial 287(g) program. The Obama administration expanded the reach of IIRAIRA and interpreted the 212(a)(9)(C) permanent ground of inadmissibility to attach to minor children who were brought into the United States unlawfully by their parents. Certainly, both parties have a lot to answer for when it comes to the plight of immigrants, but it is the Republican party that has too often, and unfairly, been labeled as the anti-immigrant party. The record demonstrates otherwise.","855","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/republicans-immigration-executive-judge-ruling-column/23931537/"
"We have previously stated our belief that the president's actions, even if found to be lawful, were short sighted and unwise. While immigration reform is primarily a job for Congress, we believe that trying to turn the tide of public opinion by defunding DACA is a losing proposition for Republicans. They have been handed a gift by Judge Hanen. Since DAPA and the expanded DACA have been temporarily enjoined, Republican members of Congress now have the opportunity to take the initiative on meaningful immigration reform that enhances our national security and our economy.","856","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/republicans-immigration-executive-judge-ruling-column/23931537/"

Based on recent polls, they found that 57% of Republican voters have an unfavorable view of the developer and reality TV star. It would not cost much, politically, for mainstream Republicans to rebuke Trump, or at least challenge his outrageous statements. Trump said that immigration leads to more crime, for instance, while research from the American Immigration Council suggests otherwise.","1416","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/24/donald-trump-speech-mexico-derogatory-comments-column/29113581/"

""There are a lot of folks who look at the Mexican border the way he pronounced it yesterday,"" Steele said. That is no excuse for hate speech. A candidate can be against immigration or immigration reform and not devolve into racism. Imagine the furor that would have likely erupted if Trump had similarly disparaged African Americans or Jews.

"“I don’t say controversial things, and I don’t fly around in a 747, so I guess it wasn’t paid as much attention when I said it, but we put out a very strong plan on how we’re going to deal with immigration in America,” he told the crowd.","1576","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/08/22/rick-santorum-encourages-republicans-reach-out/32209913/"
"Santorum reiterated his stance of lowering the annual quota for legal immigration to 750,000 — the number that he stated was used during the “great wave” of immigration at the turn of the last century — as a means of downscaling the pool of low-skill wage earners in America.

"A major topic of the Q&A was bipartisanship — specifically, the efforts that could be taken to make Washington productive again. Santorum accused President Barack Obama of having less interest in compromising with opposing viewpoints than predecessors such as Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan.

"And receiving or transmitting information that was not known to be classified at the time also was not a crime. This is true even if the information was mislabeled or misclassified.

"Secretary Clinton obviously went to great lengths to identify and preserve official emails as the law requires, turning over so many records that the government actually returned more than 1000 emails on the grounds that she had produced information that was clearly personal. And while U.S. government servers were hacked, there is no indication that Secretary Clinton’s server ever was.","1606","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/21/clinton-email-state-server-column/32042775/"
"Some say that following the letter of the law wasn’t good enough and question whether using the server was in keeping with the spirit of the law. That’s a fair question. Our view is that the efforts to preserve emails and produce those even arguably dealing with official matters show fealty to the spirit of the law. As does that fact that one other secretary of State also used private email for official business and virtually every Administration in the Internet era has been bedeviled by the mixing of personal and official emails at one time or another. Others may see it differently, but fundamentally, debating whether someone followed the “spirit of the law” concedes there was no crime.","1607","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/21/clinton-email-state-server-column/32042775/"
"As to the alleged mishandling of classified information, once again, the relevant law is crystal clear. The pertinent federal statute requires “knowingly” transferring classified information to an unauthorized location. Transmitting information that wasn’t known to be classified — even if the failure to classify was an obvious mistake — is not a crime under this statute. The latest reporting makes clear that even the emails the CIA now contends contained Top Secret information had no classification markings and did not reference any sensitive intelligence methods or contain any other hallmarks of classified sourcing.","1608","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/21/clinton-email-state-server-column/32042775/"
"Some partisans and pundits trying to find a way around this obstacle are hoping to find a way to convict without the requisite knowledge and intent, perhaps by arguing that negligence should be good enough. But the deeper they dig into antiquated and inapt statutes involving the theft of battle plans and the like, the more obvious it becomes that no crime was committed here. And all the wishful thinking in the world from opportunist political opponents can’t change that.","1609","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/21/clinton-email-state-server-column/32042775/"

"Republicans are supposed to oppose abortion.

"One such conflict is likely to appear this week, when the House is expected to vote on a 20-week limit on abortions. Such a limit polls well— Americans are much more supportive of early abortionsthan late-term abortions — and would still leave the United States with more-liberal abortion laws than nearly all of Europe. Even so, the Republicans need to be asking themselves — and the Democrats need to be asking them, too — where, exactly, Congress gets the power to limit abortions to 20 weeks?","1705","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/10/abortion-republicans-congress-limits-column/27083275/"
"The problem is that Congress is supposed to exercise only the powers enumerated in the Constitution, and those powers don't include regulating state medical procedures. (The federal government lacks even the power to criminalize murder as such: All federal ""murder"" statutes punish murdering someone in the course of violating some other federal law because unlike states, the federal government has no general ""police power."")","1706","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/10/abortion-republicans-congress-limits-column/27083275/"
"If you scroll through the powers enumerated to Congress in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, you'll find such things as establishing uniform rules of bankruptcy, raising and supporting armies and navies, and establishing post offices and post roads.

"The standard end run around this is to invoke the Commerce Clause, that is, Congress' power to regulate commerce ""among the several states."" But the performance of an abortion in a local clinic is commerce among the states only if you adopt an unjustifiably expansive reading of the Commerce Clause that supports near-unlimited government power, so the party of small government ought to be reluctant to do so. Some might labor under the misapprehension that the Supreme Court has already upheld Congress' power to regulate abortion under the Commerce Clause. In fact, in Gonzales v. Carhart, as Justice Clarence Thomas noted, that question was not addressed by either the Supreme Court or any lower court.","1708","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/10/abortion-republicans-congress-limits-column/27083275/"
"It's possible, of course, that the Supreme Court would uphold regulation of abortion under the clause. In the past, it has, absurdly, upheld federal commerce power to punish a farmer for growing too much wheat on his own land, to feed to his own family and livestock, on the ground that if he didn't grow his own he would be forced to buy the wheat on the open market, which would drive up prices and thus affect interstate commerce. With the bar set that low — and with liberal abortion-rights justices being fans of broad government power, while conservative limited-government justices oppose abortion — there's a good chance that the law would pass Supreme Court scrutiny, whether it really ought to or not.","1709","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/10/abortion-republicans-congress-limits-column/27083275/"
"But members of Congress take their own oath to preserve the Constitution, which imposes an independent obligation on them to take the Constitution seriously, not just to do whatever the Supreme Court will let them get away with.

"Cal Thomas is a conservative columnist. Bob Beckel is a liberal Democratic strategist. But as longtime friends, they can often find common ground on issues that lawmakers in Washington cannot.","5:52 p.m. EDT August 5, 2015","1743","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Today: GOP Field","1744","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Donald Trump","1745","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: He has tapped into growing voter anger about the failure of government to do anything well. Trump must offer specifics on domestic and foreign policy. I’d also like to know how and why he converted from pro-choice to pro-life in 2011. He has changed positions on other issues. Expediency or “conversion”? Question: You talk tough about world leaders you say you would confront, but why should any of them, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Chinese, respect you?","1746","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: Trump is doing well, not for who he is or what he stands for, but rather for who he isn’t and what he’s against. Trump has captured the mood of many Republican voters who are fed up with politicians in Washington, including GOP members of Congress, and want Congress to know it. Trump does that for them. Conservative voters are frustrated that Obamacare is still alive and that more undocumented workers continue to cross the border. Trump is against Obamacare and for sealing the border. What’s not to like?","1747","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Jeb Bush","1748","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: He should reiterate he is not his father or brother and say how a Bush (III) presidency will be different from the other Presidents Bush. Make a convincing case for immigration reform that includes a plan to first stem the tide of illegal aliens flooding our borders. “Compassion” won’t cut it. Most conservatives want it stopped. He also must convince voters why he thinks the federal government through Common Core can do a better job educating kids than locals. Question: What does “conservative” mean to you in terms of policy, and what are some issues on which you would never compromise?","1749","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: He can run, but he can’t hide from it. Jeb needs to achieve two goals. The first is to get by Iowa and New Hampshire. To do that he needs to stand firm on pro-life issues and small government. He has already broken with George W. on Iraq, which is good, but he cannot be soft on immigration. Once he gets by the first two states, the field will shrink, and he can get to South Carolina and Florida, where he needs to put away Sen. Marco Rubio.","1750","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Scott Walker","1751","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: The base loves him because he stood up to massive union money and outside groups coming into Wisconsin attempting to stop his efforts to break public unions. According to the latest publicpolicypolling.com survey, Walker is favored by 17% of GOP voters, just behind Trump’s 19% and ahead of Bush’s 12%. Question: The last time there was a Republican president and a Republican Congress, relatively little got done. What would your top priorities be with a GOP Congress, and how would you get them through?","1752","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: Many love him in Iowa because he is a neighbor, but he should beware. He will need to win Iowa big to get momentum going into New Hampshire, where his anti-union positions will largely be welcomed. I managed Fritz Mondale’s presidential campaign and they loved him in Iowa, where he won almost 50% against a large Democratic field and went on to lose New Hampshire. On every question, try to work in an Iowa angle. Iowans will be watching!","1753","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Marco Rubio","1754","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: Push any button from foreign to domestic policy and Rubio instantly “plays back” a stream of sound bites loaded with statistics and history. He represents a new generation and could say with credibility that older people have had their chance, let’s try something new — him. Question: You have spoken of the need for Social Security and Medicare reform. George W. Bush tried Social Security reform and was demagogued by the left into submission. How would you reform those programs and respond to heat from Democrats and the news media about “killing granny”?","1755","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: That’s an excellent question, because Social Security and Medicare reform has backfired almost every time it has been suggested. The problem Rubio has by emphasizing the “new generation” is that GOP primary voters skew older than the national median age, And they vote. Work into the debate the contributions of older Americans and your determination to protect them. Rubio has lots of senior support. Put them on buses and send them to Iowa and New Hampshire. No charge for the advice, Senator.","1756","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Ted Cruz","1757","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: Gets credit from the base for his 21-hour speech on the Senate floor against Obamacare. Openly Christian. Disliked by members of both parties in the Senate (not necessarily a negative because much of the country dislikes all of Congress). Question: According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, “One-fifth of the U.S. public — and a third of adults under 30 — are religiously unaffiliated.” How do you reach these people who might be turned off by you religious zeal?","1758","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: Sure, Cruz gets some credit for his filibuster — Obamacare has survived and is gaining popularity. Candidates for president who wear their faith on their sleeves are treading in dangerous waters. The conservative religious community may not doubt Cruz’s faith, but it cannot believe he will win. A good question for the senator: You have been firm on issues you oppose, what issues do you like that have been ignored by Washington?","1759","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Rand Paul","1760","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: Strong libertarian/conservative. Gets some support because of his father, Ron Paul. Must explain why he is reluctant to confront enemies like the Islamic State and Iran. Question: If you knew that Iran was about to finish a nuclear weapon and a ballistic missile to deliver it, what would you do to stop them? A follow-up question: If you wait until we are attacked before confronting our enemies, won’t it be too late?","1761","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB:Many people, including Republican voters, believe that the U.S. has spilled enough blood and treasure in overseas conflicts. Voters don’t get up each day and think about Iran. They think about the needs here at home and want their leaders to address them. If asked about the U.S. role overseas, Paul should be firm on his insistence that we not play world cop and focus on America’s needs.","1762","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Chris Christie","1763","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: If Christie’s first years as New Jersey governor were a political honeymoon, these days it’s more like a separation agreement. Positives: Great speaker with strong stage presence; disciplined enough to take advice and lose weight; high name recognition. Negatives: See first sentence. Question: What happened?","1764","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: Chris Christie’s problem is Chris Christie. I agree he’s an exciting speaker, and his “in your face” approach to campaigning reflects the mood of Republican-base voters. The problem is Christie is really a moderate from New Jersey, and in GOP primary politics, moderates need not apply. He also has a trust problem. The George Washington Bridge scandal has tainted Christie’s reputation for truth-telling —although he has never faced charges. And in 2012, according to Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s book Double Down, Christie did not fill out all his background forms when Mitt Romney was considering Christie for vice president. Wonder why?","1765","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"John Kasich","1766","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: He has a good record as Ohio governor. The economy has had a major turnaround. Unemployment is down. The conservative base doesn’t like his support of Medicaid expansion, and he has backed Common Core. He also has the irritating habit of lecturing fellow Republicans.","1767","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: I spoke to Kasich on Sunday night. He called to wish me a fast recovery from my back operation. He was in New Hampshire and he was feeling good about making the debate cut. Kasich has had a solid record as Ohio’s governor and he’s a good campaigner. My question is he conservative enough for the GOP base?","1768","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Mike Huckabee & Ben Carson,","1769","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: I put them together because they basically have the same message. They are speaking “righteousness” to an “unrighteous” nation. See above poll on the “nones.” Question for both: At what point would you consider dropping out if it appeared your presence was damaging the eventual nominee?","1770","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: You pose a good question and with some history in religion and politics to back it up. In 2008 and 2012 respectively, Huckabee stayed in the race well past his sell-by date. He convinced himself he were on a lonely mission to save the soul of America. Only God can do that. Carson will be out early.","1771","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"

"Donald Trump's performance at the debate was the talk of the conference on Friday. During the debate, Trump refused to pledge support for whomever may be the eventual GOP candidate in the 2016 presidential race. Trump himself had been slated to appeared at the “RedState Tailgate with Donald Trump” at the College Football Hall of Fame on Saturday evening, but Erickson disinvited the billionaire over comments he made about FOX News' Megyn Kelly during a CNN interview Friday.","1806","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/06/conservatives-assemble-red-state-gathering/31224899/"

"On Tuesday, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said she would shield from deportation a group of undocumented immigrants that even President Obama's lawyers have deemed beyond their legal limit to protect. That follows a month when Republicans not only voiced their collective opposition to any ""amnesty"" for undocumented immigrants, but started talking about restricting legal immigration as well.","1814","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/05/06/voices-gomez-clinton-republicans-immigration/26641519/"

"In 2012, Obama protected from deportation DREAMers, children illegally brought to the country as minors by their parents. And while Obama moved to protect even more undocumented immigrants last year, parents of DREAMers were not included because the White House says it lacks the legal authority to do so.","1817","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/05/06/voices-gomez-clinton-republicans-immigration/26641519/"

"The announcement stunned even the most ardent immigration advocates. Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, said Clinton had just ""bear-hugged"" the immigrant community. Following an election in which Obama received 71% of the Hispanic vote, Clinton is clearly trying to match or exceed that share in 2016.","1819","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/05/06/voices-gomez-clinton-republicans-immigration/26641519/"

"The first confirmed candidate in the race was Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whose father immigrated from Cuba. Then came Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who speaks glowingly about his parents' immigrant tale from Cuba. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush jokingly is called the first Hispanic governor of the state due to his popularity among Hispanics, fluency in Spanish and a Mexican wife.","1821","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/05/06/voices-gomez-clinton-republicans-immigration/26641519/"

"During a speech last month before the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, Bush boasted about his ""bicultural and bilingual"" children. But he stopped short of advocating a full pathway to citizenship. Instead, he said undocumented immigrants should be able to receive an ""earned legal status,"" which Hispanics view as little more than second-class citizenship.","1823","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/05/06/voices-gomez-clinton-republicans-immigration/26641519/"
"Rubio was briefly a champion of the Hispanic community when he co-sponsored a Senate bill in 2013 that granted a pathway to citizenship.

"Then there's Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. During interviews on conservative outlets last month, Walker said he wants to reduce the number of legal immigrants who enter the country each year because they take jobs away from American workers and depress their wages.","1826","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/05/06/voices-gomez-clinton-republicans-immigration/26641519/"
"That claim is in dispute.

"What's more important is the political fallout of Republicans moving in this direction. The Hispanic electorate has as much varied opinion as any other voting bloc, but I can't picture too many of them embracing this idea.","1828","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/05/06/voices-gomez-clinton-republicans-immigration/26641519/"
"Why would they? Walker is basically telling immigrants that fewer of their friends and colleagues back home should be able to enter the U.S. on a work visa, and that fewer of their relatives should be able to enter on a family visa.","1829","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/05/06/voices-gomez-clinton-republicans-immigration/26641519/"
"That strategy plays well when you're a Republican running for office in a conservative state or congressional district, or trying to win the GOP presidential nomination.

"But for a party that acknowledges it needs to improve on the 27% of the Hispanic vote Mitt Romney garnered in 2012 — and now faces Clinton's immigrant-friendly stance — I don't see how that strategy works in a general election.","1831","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/05/06/voices-gomez-clinton-republicans-immigration/26641519/"

"The very groups predicted to swell the numbers of Democrats are also those least likely to show up at the polls, especially in non-presidential elections. For example, in 2014, a non-presidential year, voters ages 18-29 constituted only 13% of the electorate, compared with those 65 and older, who were 22% of those casting ballots.

"Turnout for Democrats is equally underwhelming in non-presidential years with minorities, most notably African Americans, the most loyal Democrats. The party has been heartened by the rise of Hispanics in the population, but a portion of that rise includes the estimated 11 million undocumented residents of the U.S., most of whom are Hispanic and cannot legally vote. Even among those who can, turnout has been dismal. Last year, more than 43% of likely non-voters were identified as non-white.

"Five years ago today, after the worst recession since the Great Depression, Congress passed groundbreaking Wall Street reforms to prevent another financial crisis. They took important steps to stop abuse, limit reckless risk-taking, avoid future taxpayer bailouts, and strengthen oversight of the financial system. Yet as we mark reform’s fifth birthday, many Republicans continue their push to dismantle these new rules put in place to prevent another financial crisis. As a Democrat who represents thousands of financial services workers here in Delaware, I believe it’s critical we work together to improve Wall Street reforms where we can, rather than reverse the progress we’ve made.","8:56 p.m. EDT July 20, 2015","2110","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/07/20/republicans-still-get/30433661/"
"Simply put, rolling back reforms would be a dangerous step backward for the safety and soundness of our markets, and for our nation’s economic security.","2111","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/07/20/republicans-still-get/30433661/"
"At the heart of the housing market meltdown were millions of mortgages that, when the housing market finally collapsed, sent millions of homes into foreclosure. Behind those mortgages was a complicated house of cards with plenty of responsibility to go around – from families who couldn’t afford those mortgages in the first place, to lenders who should have known better than to extend them, to large financial firms that packaged those risky mortgages into complex financial instruments to make them look like a better investment than they were, to the ratings agencies which mislabeled those toxic assets. When housing prices finally fell, sending those risky mortgages underwater and homes into foreclosure, the values of neighboring homes plummeted as well – causing a devastating downward spiral.","2112","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/07/20/republicans-still-get/30433661/"
"Wall Street reform responded to each of these dynamics to help ensure we don’t face another crisis.","2113","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/07/20/republicans-still-get/30433661/"
"First, Congress created an agency with a simple, specific mission: to protect consumers from misleading financial products. Because Americans have long been protected from unsafe foods and dangerous consumer products, it only makes sense to ensure they’re protected from abusive financial products as well. The new agency is called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and it works to ensure that when consumers do buy financial products, they’re given clear information on their risks and benefits.","2114","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/07/20/republicans-still-get/30433661/"
"Second, Wall Street reform limited unsafe investing practices at the highest levels of finance. For instance, it set strong capital standards so banks have a sturdy backstop in times of need and ensured that regulators have the tools to scrutinize banking practices that are far more complicated than ever before. Congress recognized that in a complex, global financial system, regulators needed to have the resources to keep up as banking continues to change.","2115","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/07/20/republicans-still-get/30433661/"
"Lastly, the financial crisis made it clear that although there is much we can do to limit risk and protect consumers, banks can still fail – and when they do, it’s critical they’re closed down in a way that’s responsible, doesn’t harm the larger economy and doesn’t require a taxpayer bailout. That’s why Wall Street reform gave the government new abilities to responsibly wind down large banks so they don’t cause financial earthquakes, much in the way the government has done with smaller banks for more than 80 years.","2116","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/07/20/republicans-still-get/30433661/"
"Now, I have no doubt that we can improve and build on these reforms, especially as someone who wasn’t in Congress when they became law. There are further changes that Democrats and Republicans can agree on, for instance, to relieve regulatory burdens on community banks so that smaller banks can provide the lending their neighborhoods need to grow and thrive. We should continue to seek the regulatory sweet spot where rules are simple and prevent bad behavior, and where regulators act to protect consumers with an understanding of the important role responsible creditors play in our economy. Further, while reforms went a long way to prevent taxpayer bailouts, there are legitimate critiques that should force us to examine additional ways to make the system safer.","2117","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/07/20/republicans-still-get/30433661/"
"Many Delawareans work in the financial system – and that’s a great thing. I’m a firm believer in a strong, responsible and well-functioning financial services sector – it’s critical to capitalism and to our economy. I also believe that smart, fair financial regulations are essential to sustaining those very financial services jobs that we need, because without those regulations, our entire economy would be at risk. That wouldn’t be good for anyone, and if we want to prevent another financial crisis, we need to cement and build on the progress we’ve made since the last one. We shouldn’t roll it back.","2118","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/07/20/republicans-still-get/30433661/"

"Businessman Donald Trump continues to lead the Republican field in Iowa, a new Suffolk University Poll finds, but his performance in last week's opening debate has dented his standing among GOP partisans and cost him some ground in the state that will hold the first presidential contest next year.","4:33 p.m. EDT August 11, 2015","2120","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/11/iowa-poll-trump-leads-field-but-standing-dented-debate/31449175/"

"The Suffolk survey has warning signs for Trump. By 2-1, 55%-23%, those surveyed say watching Trump in the debate made them feel less comfortable rather than more comfortable with him as a candidate for president. A 54% majority also reject Trump’s complaints that he was treated unfairly by the Fox News anchors who served as moderators; 41% agree with him.","2125","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/11/iowa-poll-trump-leads-field-but-standing-dented-debate/31449175/"
"And a third of Iowa Republicans say Trump — enmeshed in a post-debate contretemps over his comments about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly — “doesn’t show appropriate respect for women.” A larger number, 46%, side with the real-estate mogul and reality-TV star, saying criticism of his comments about women ""are just examples of political correctness.""","2126","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/11/iowa-poll-trump-leads-field-but-standing-dented-debate/31449175/"

"While some of the major candidates this year hope to raise money far and wide, the lesser ones merely need to strike the fancy of a billionaire or two.

"As they plot strategy and evaluate candidates for 2016, too many Republicans embrace the notion that the key to victory lies with hordes of disillusioned Christian evangelicals for whom today's GOP isn't nearly conservative enough. Long before Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made this assumption the explicit basis for his campaign, this comforting idea percolated through talk radio and activist cadres, with frequent reference to the three million (or four million, or six million) ""missing conservatives"" who failed to show up to support Mitt Romney and thereby doomed his hapless, ""mushy moderate"" campaign.","6:53 p.m. EDT May 18, 2015","2322","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/18/christian-evangelicals-elections-demographics-medved-column/26474707/"
"This analysis gives rise to a stirring but dangerous fantasy: that a huge segment of the electorate is merely waiting for a ""courageous conservative"" pure and uncompromising enough to mobilize the legions of newly inspired true believers who will then surge to the polls to ensure the next GOP landslide. In his announcement of candidacy at Jerry Falwell's Liberty University, Sen. Cruz boldly proclaimed: ""Today, roughly half of born-again Christians aren't voting. They're staying home. Imagine instead millions of people of faith all across America coming out to the polls and voting our values.""","2323","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/18/christian-evangelicals-elections-demographics-medved-column/26474707/"
"Actually, one of the nation's most influential organizations promoting those values, Ralph Reed's Faith and Freedom Coalition, conducted a survey after Obama's 2012 victory in the key swing states of Florida and Ohio and reported evangelical turnout between 75% and 80% — one of the strongest turnouts for any segment of the electorate. Moreover, in spite of the fears that Christian conservatives wouldn't support a Mormon from Massachusetts, national exit polls showed self-identified ""white, evangelical or born-again Christians"" comprising 26% of the overall electorate, as large a proportion as ever before.","2324","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/18/christian-evangelicals-elections-demographics-medved-column/26474707/"
"In 2004, when George W. Bush placed special emphasis on drawing active church-goers to the polls, white evangelicals amounted to 23% of all voters but enabled Bush to achieve his margin of victory over John Kerry. Bush campaigned as the most outspokenly Christian candidate of recent years and drew an impressive 79% of the born-again vote — precisely the proportion Romney won in 2012, whatever his weaknesses as a candidate.","2325","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/18/christian-evangelicals-elections-demographics-medved-column/26474707/"
"The record-levels of GOP support by evangelical voters undermines the notion that Republicans can rely on mobilizing heretofore apathetic Christians to sweep the country. So why would prominent and sophisticated politicos endorse this strategy for 2016?","2326","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/18/christian-evangelicals-elections-demographics-medved-column/26474707/"
"The most obvious answer involves the prominent position of Iowa in the primary calendar, where polls show evangelical voters representing a clear majority of the Republican electorate. The last two Republican winners of the Iowa Caucuses — Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum — specifically targeted Christian conservatives and managed to win upset victories against better-known, better-funded rivals.","2327","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/18/christian-evangelicals-elections-demographics-medved-column/26474707/"
"But even here, conventional wisdom proves misleading and contradicts hard numbers from the Hawkeye State. Yes, Huckabee won big in 2008 with 34.4% of caucus-goers supporting him. But the combined vote of his five principal rivals — 65.2% — gives the lie to belief in automatic evangelical domination since none of those competitors (Romney, part-time Hollywood actor Fred Thompson, John McCain, Ron Paul and Rudy Giuliani) enjoyed robust support in the Christian conservative community.","2328","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/18/christian-evangelicals-elections-demographics-medved-column/26474707/"
"Four years later, the Iowa results provided even less evidence of the centrality of religious voters or religious issues. Santorum managed to claim first place (by 34 votes over Romney) with his tireless, heartfelt appeals to evangelicals, but his leading competitors (Romney, Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich, who could hardly count as religious rabble-rousers) nonetheless combined to out-poll him (59.2% to 24.6%) without particular emphasis on social issues. Even in states like Iowa with their devout and church-going population, evangelical sentiments don't necessarily dictate voting.","2329","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/18/christian-evangelicals-elections-demographics-medved-column/26474707/"
"None of the slate of candidates in 2016 can afford to ignore or dismiss Christian conservatives, who remain an essential element in the Republican Party base. As more than a quarter of the total electorate in 2012, exit polls show that these believers made up a larger voting bloc than African-Americans (13%) and Latinos (10%)combined. Nevertheless, the widely held belief that conservatives can carry the day by discovering — or manufacturing — invisible armies of Christian true believers represents the sort of groundless wishful thinking that only wrecks campaigns and undermines the cause.","2330","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/18/christian-evangelicals-elections-demographics-medved-column/26474707/"

"The newspaper-led three-state coalition is collaborating with C-SPAN in a battle with the Republican National Committee and Fox News, who are partnering on the first “official” GOP debate with rules limiting the debate to the 10 candidates registering highest in the polls. By the RNC-Fox rules, pollsters will eliminate seven of the 17 announced candidates, or about 41% of the field, six months before the first caucus-goers and primary voters cast ballots in the Forum coalition states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.","2336","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/03/c-span-forum-outfoxes-official-gop-debate-column/30748583/"
"The pollsters won’t decide literally. They will use data reflecting the opinions of a random national sample of voters whom candidates can reach only via expensive paid advertising. So, to the biggest campaign treasury (and Super PAC nest egg) will go the victory — perhaps on the strength of just a one-week ad blitz. Anyone concerned about the dominant role of money in politics should favor the three-state plan over the RNC-Fox plan.","2337","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/03/c-span-forum-outfoxes-official-gop-debate-column/30748583/"
"Rick Santorum won Iowa in 2012 by visiting all 99 counties over many months. Candidates win in New Hampshire by meeting the voters one-on-one. The old quip has the typical Granite State voter saying “I only met him once, so I can’t vote for him.” This is confirmed by a Dartmouth College survey during the 1996 primary which found that 20% of New Hampshire voters met one of the leading presidential candidates one-on-one or in one of the innumerable small rallies which take place.","2338","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/03/c-span-forum-outfoxes-official-gop-debate-column/30748583/"

"We should trust fellow citizens in these three small early primary/caucus states, whose small size makes spending big money impossible. These small-state voters vet the field in man-to-man discussions where sound bites don't count, via personal contact which reveals whether the candidate is comfortable with people and comfortable in his or her own skin — with the nation watching via the ever-present media.","2340","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/03/c-span-forum-outfoxes-official-gop-debate-column/30748583/"
"Once these early-primary voters have spoken, then the RNC and its TV partners can limit the debate lineup based upon the voting results.

"So, the C-SPAN forum has the potential to be unwieldy and messy. That can be addressed in the rules for the debate. Or RNC-Fox could have accepted the alternative suggested by GOP leaders in the three states: two separate back-to-back debates, with the candidates randomly assigned to one or the other.","2343","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/03/c-span-forum-outfoxes-official-gop-debate-column/30748583/"
"The RNC seems deathly afraid of a free-for-all from which the ultimate GOP nominee might emerge bloodied. Ironically, the huge size of the C-SPAN forum will probably prevent this. In a case of delicious irony, the C-SPAN Forum may be a model of decorum compared to the RNC-Fox affair, where the unpredictable and volatile Donald Trump, who will not be at the forum, may turn the debate into a circus.","2344","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/03/c-span-forum-outfoxes-official-gop-debate-column/30748583/"

At the heart of the issue is a study called the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 2, 2013.

"Former Texas governor Rick Perry once again puffed up his state's record on job creation, claiming that Texas had created 1.5 million jobs ""during the worst economic time this country's had since the great depression, while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs."" Actually, according to the job-growth measure used by most economists, and the appropriate time frame for Perry's tenure, the rest of the country gained 1.2 million jobs, while Texas also gained 1.2 million.","2455","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/06/fact-check-happy-hour-gop-debate/31265627/"
"Perry has used this statistic before, citing December 2007, the beginning of the Great Recession, as his starting point. But instead of using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' nonfarm payroll data — the data BLS itself uses to calculate the monthly job growth figures it releases — Perry relies on BLS' household survey data, a monthly survey of 60,000 households that's used to calculate the unemployment rate. The nonfarm payroll data, meanwhile, is a monthly survey of about 550,000 business establishments that include millions of employees.","2456","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/06/fact-check-happy-hour-gop-debate/31265627/"

"Perry can only get a loss of jobs for the rest of the country by using the household survey data for December 2007 and December 2014. But Perry left office on Jan. 20, 2015, and both of BLS' surveys are taken during the week or payroll period that includes the 12th of the month. So January 2015 is the correct end point for Perry's time in office. Using that month, the rest of the country gained 325,000 jobs, not lost them, even using the household survey.","2459","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/06/fact-check-happy-hour-gop-debate/31265627/"

"Obama, Aug. 5: As a result, those who say we can just walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy. Instead of strengthening our position as some have suggested, Congress's rejection would almost certainly result in multilateral sanctions unraveling.

Liberals and labor groups launched the recall in outrage over his efforts to curb the clout of public-employee unions. His landmark victory then and re-election two years later has made him a hero to conservative activists and given him a national fundraising base.","2492","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"

"That said, Walker's risk is that a misstep could make his first impression among voters a negative one.

"Barring unforeseen events, Kennedy will become the third sitting octogenarian on the court — Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 82, and Justice Antonin Scalia turns 80 in March. That will mark the first time since George H.W. Bush entered the White House more than a quarter century ago that a president has inherited three justices that old. At 78 by then, Justice Stephen Breyer will be close behind.","2836","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"Of all the reasons why the high court will loom large in the presidential election — from a docket brimming with hot-button issues to intensive lobbying campaigns on the right and left — none looms as large as simple arithmetic and actuarial tables. The average age for Supreme Court retirements is just shy of 79. Since 1900, the average age of those who died while still serving was 69.","2837","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"With the court narrowly divided, whoever wins the White House next November might enjoy the best chance to recast the high court in his or her image since Franklin Roosevelt did from 1937-43, when he named eight new justices. A Democrat such as Hillary Clinton might get to replace Kennedy or Scalia, both named to the court by President Ronald Reagan. A Republican such as Jeb Bush might get to replace Ginsburg or Breyer, President Bill Clinton's nominees.","2838","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"In recent years and during the current presidential primary campaigns, Republicans and conservatives act as if they have the most at stake, while Democrats and liberals appear more sanguine — even though the court remains largely conservative. There are several reasons:","2839","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"• Republican presidents have made 12 of the last 16 high court nominations but have yet to win a reliable majority, a record that motivates conservatives. For more than 50 years, Democratic nominees have behaved on the bench as they were expected to behave, causing less consternation on the left.","2840","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"• After seven years of the Obama administration — and 15 of 23 years with a Democrat in the White House — Republicans have a laundry list of grievances. They want to block or reverse President Obama's health care, environmental and immigration initiatives. They want the high court to overturn rulings by federal appeals courts now dominated by Democrats' nominees.","2841","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"• Because she already is 82, there is a perception that Ginsburg will be the next to leave the court. Her refusal to do so while Obama is president gives conservatives hope that they can increase their majority on the court under a Republican president.","2842","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"• No seat is as important as Kennedy's, who sits to Chief Justice John Roberts' left, both literally and figuratively. Conservatives rue the day Reagan nominated him in 1988 after two preferred candidates ran into roadblocks, and they want to ensure a Republican president replaces him. Control of the court will hang in the balance.","2843","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"""Kennedy was a compromise vote that has haunted the Republican Party for 30 years,"" says Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law.","2844","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"Not since 1991 has a Supreme Court seat changed hands ideologically, when Justice Clarence Thomas replaced Thurgood Marshall. Since then, only conservative Justice Samuel Alito's replacement of the more moderate Sandra Day O'Connor in 2006 affected the balance on the court. The last time a Democratic president was handed such an opportunity was in 1962.","2845","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"These days, it wouldn't be easy for a president to replace a liberal with a conservative, or vice versa. While Senate Democrats in 2013 changed the chamber's rules so that judicial nominees could not be blocked by minority-party filibusters, they didn't include the Supreme Court. That means 41 senators can block a nomination — though even Thomas, confirmed by a bare 52-48 margin, wasn't blocked.","2846","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"Many experts foresee three scenarios for the next Supreme Court nomination battle: Either a Senate controlled by the president's party confirms the nominee by doing away with rules allowing the minority to filibuster, or a Senate ruled by the opposition forces the president to name a moderate or blocks any appointment until the next election. That last scenario could leave the court with only eight members for a protracted period.","2847","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"“It’s very likely that that seat just stays vacant until there’s unified control"" of the White House and Senate, says Ian Millhiser, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund. Blackman, a conservative, agrees. ""We should be prepared to consider leaving a seat vacant,"" he says.","2848","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"The stakes with four aging justices are huge: If a Democrat wins the White House and outlasts Kennedy or Scalia, the result could be a liberal court for decades to come, with an impact on issues such as abortion, campaign financing, political redistricting and voting rights.","2849","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"Those stakes ""are higher than most people appreciate,"" says Eric Segall, a professor of law at Georgia State University and liberal blogger. When the ideological balance on the high court shifts, as it did when Thomas replaced Marshall, he says, ""everything is different.""","2850","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"Similarly, conservative watchdog groups have been seeking to prod GOP candidates on the issue, going so far as to run television ads in Iowa and New Hampshire denouncing even Chief Justice John Roberts as a turncoat for his votes upholding Obama's health care law.","2851","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"“Republicans realize from hard experience that you need to know more than just how to mouth the right incantations over your judges,” says Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the Judicial Crisis Network, which sponsored the ads.","2852","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"Many Republican candidates have answered the call. Sen. Ted Cruz has suggested justices face retention elections to keep their jobs, as some lower court judges do. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee wants term limits. Jeb Bush has gone so far as to question his brother George W. Bush's choice of Roberts, a fairly reliable conservative. Sen. Marco Rubio has called for ""more Scalias and less Sotomayors.""","2853","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"Democrats have reason to be satisfied with their recent nominees, so their wrath has been aimed more at the rulings of the Roberts Court. Hillary Clinton recently called its Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision in 2010 upholding unlimited political spending by corporations ""a grave error,"" adding, ""I will do everything I can to appoint Supreme Court justices who will protect the right to vote and not the right of billionaires to buy elections.""","2854","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/25/supreme-court-president-age-80-election/74003698/"
"If she wins the White House, she'll likely have that chance. Even if no one retires, actuarial tables alone are catching up with the justices.

"In particular, Bevin's nasty primary challenge of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in 2014 has left a sour taste in the mouths of some Republicans. They believe the lack of support for Bevin in his own party could allow Conway to win, despite Conway having to deal with President Barack Obama's unpopularity in the state.","2860","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/10/08/some-republicans-turn-bevin/73526308/"

"Bevin and Conway remain close in the polls, with the last Bluegrass Poll at the end of September by the Louisville Courier-Journal showing Conway leading Bevin 42 percent to 37 percent. The poll showed tepid support among their bases for both candidates, with 16 percent of registered Democrats saying they'd vote for Bevin and 15 percent of registered Republicans saying they'd vote for Conway.

"Conway doesn't need as high of a percentage among his base but could run into similar problems with his party as Bevin, Cross said. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 52 percent to 39 percent in Kentucky. But many Democrats vote Republican in the conservative state and remain registered Democrat for local races, he said. Bevin could make up the difference by appealing to the 20 to 25 percent of Democrats that vote Republican, Cross said.

"Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy shocked his colleagues Thursday by abruptly dropping out of the race for speaker at the beginning of a meeting that by all accounts was prepared to nominate him for the job. That left the party with no obvious front-runner, except Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who has said several times he is not going to run.","2951","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/08/majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-quits-speaker-race/73583652/"
"McCarthy met with colleagues at an early morning forum and made his case to become the next speaker, but then announced at the noon nominating gathering that he was dropping out. ""I just think it's best to have a new face,"" he told reporters afterward. Many conservatives who have chafed under Boehner's leadership had expressed support for other candidates, and it was clear McCarthy would not get the 218 votes he needed Thursday to guarantee he would win a vote for speaker on the House floor, which had been set for Oct. 29.","2952","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/08/majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-quits-speaker-race/73583652/"
"""Over the last week it has become clear to me that our Conference is deeply divided and needs to unite behind one leader,"" McCarthy, R-Calif., said in a statement released by his office. ""I have always put this Conference ahead of myself. Therefore I am withdrawing my candidacy for Speaker of the House. I look forward to working alongside my colleagues to help move our Conference’s agenda and our country forward.""","2953","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/08/majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-quits-speaker-race/73583652/"
"With McCarthy out, it was unclear where Republicans would turn for a new leader after Boehner departs. Republicans of all stripes have said in recent weeks that Ryan, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, would be able to unify the fractured party. But Ryan was backing McCarthy and on Thursday again said he would not run for the post.","2954","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/08/majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-quits-speaker-race/73583652/"
"In a statement, Ryan called McCarthy the ""best person to lead the House"" and expressed his disappointment in the day's news.

"But late in the day, colleagues were pressing him to reconsider. ""Most of the members know that that's really our only path forward at this point,"" said Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., considered a close ally of Boehner's. The job requires a lot of institutional knowledge and credibility, Nunes said, and ""really from the start of this, Kevin and Paul were the only two we had of that caliber.""","2956","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/08/majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-quits-speaker-race/73583652/"
"Boehner said in a statement that he will stay on until he is replaced, and appeared to call off the Oct. 29 vote. ""I will serve as Speaker until the House votes to elect a new Speaker,"" he said. ""We will announce the date for this election at a later date, and I’m confident we will elect a new Speaker in the coming weeks.""","2957","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/08/majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-quits-speaker-race/73583652/"
"McCarthy is not stepping down as majority leader, which means that the scramble that had begun for his job and other top leadership positions is now on hold as well. Boehner had said previously that the party would not select other top leaders until after the speaker vote was over.","2958","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/08/majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-quits-speaker-race/73583652/"
"Conservatives, led by members of the House Freedom Caucus, are demanding rules changes that will reduce the speaker's authority and allow more conservative amendments to come to the floor for a vote. But Nunes suggested other rules changes that would give the speaker more authority to punish Republicans who vote against leadership positions.","2959","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/08/majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-quits-speaker-race/73583652/"
"Freedom Caucus members agreed Wednesday to back Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., for the nomination, in part to preserve their ability to negotiate with McCarthy for rules changes. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who jumped into the race on Sunday, said Thursday he was ""shocked"" by McCarthy's withdrawal but that he remains a candidate for the job.","2960","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/08/majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-quits-speaker-race/73583652/"
"""It's all wide open,"" said Freedom Caucus member Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan. ""There's probably ten people that picked up ten votes"" in the wake of McCarthy's departure.","2961","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/08/majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-quits-speaker-race/73583652/"
"Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., who leads the House Republican campaign operation, said he would consider serving as interim speaker, but he wasn't sure that was a good idea — and Huelskamp said he would be unacceptable to conservatives. Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas, chair of the Republican Study Committee, a kind of conservative think tank in the House, said ""I don't know that we can get a new speaker before Nov. 5."" That is the date the Treasury Department says the nation will begin to default on debts unless Congress raises the debt limit. Flores said he expected Boehner to stay at least through that deadline.","2962","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/08/majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-quits-speaker-race/73583652/"
"McCarthy's rise to the top post was hampered by his comments on Fox News last week suggesting that the House Select Committee on Benghazi was set up largely to damage Hillary Clinton's political fortunes. McCarthy has since apologized and said that was neither what he meant nor the intent of the committee, which was created to investigate the Sept 11, 2012, attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi. Conservatives reacted with outrage that McCarthy's comment was undermining the committee's work. McCarthy said those comments were part of the reason he was stepping down, because ""I should not be a distraction"" from the committee's work.","2963","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/08/majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-quits-speaker-race/73583652/"

"Ryan could not provide details of what programs might be covered by a ""pause."" Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is heading up a GOP task force that will develop the details and propose legislation later this week, Ryan said.

"Vocational education is important and central economic planning is a bad idea, but these criticisms of philosophy are off the mark. I'm a Conservative so this is not written out of political malice: Republicans need to stop dissing philosophy. Philosophy, like literature, history and other humanities, is valuable not just because of what it helps us produce, but because of how it helps us live.

"For example, we need to rethink what we count as ""valuable."" Just because someone does not produce things in a way that economists can mathematically quantify, it does not mean that what they do lacks value. Stay-at-home moms are not counted in the GDP, but their work is the most important work of all. Reading great literature does not directly produce anything of economic value, yet it is impossible to read Romeo & Juliet or The Great Gatsby and not feel that one has learned something truly important.","3047","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/14/philosophy-welder-republican-debate-column/75699210/"
"In Romeo & Juliet we have our eyes opened to the wonder of love and the tragedy of war. In The Great Gatsby we see how the endless pursuit of wealth can leave one hollow inside. Philosophy, likewise, forces readers to grapple with fundamental questions about what is valuable. It does this not by presenting an artistic story, but by pressing readers with arguments and demanding self-evaluation.","3048","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/14/philosophy-welder-republican-debate-column/75699210/"
"The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates strongly criticized his fellow citizens for failing to value what is truly valuable and instead valuing things of lesser importance. When he was put on trial for corrupting the youth of Athens, he defended philosophy by saying ""I go around doing nothing but persuading both young and old among you not to care for your body, your wealth, and your reputation more than, or even as strongly as, the best possible condition of your soul … for it is not money that brings about virtue, but virtue makes wealth and everything else good for humanity.""","3049","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/14/philosophy-welder-republican-debate-column/75699210/"
"The Athenians were running around trying to make money, trying to get elected to important positions, trying to get invited to the right dinners, the right parties, and the right clubs.

"Republican presidential candidates will converge in Iowa for the Republican Party of Iowa’s Growth and Opportunity Event on Saturday. While the candidates have made many trips across the state, this event provides Iowans the opportunity to see them in one place and ask about their policies. Immigration reform is a policy area most Republican candidates have yet to address in a concrete and pragmatic way. If we can muster the political will, immigration reform is an opportunity for Republicans to improve the economy and people’s lives at the same time. As a Republican, I do not believe a majority of our party supports the extreme views on mass deportation that some candidates advocate. Mass deportation would require increased taxes and a massive growth in government that would hurt our economy. According to some studies, deportation could cost taxpayers $400-600 billion. Growing government and spending up to $600 billion is not a conservative solution. As candidates campaign across Iowa in the coming weeks, we need to encourage them to propose meaningful and realistic plans to fix our broken immigration system.

Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.

"Election Day 2016 will produce a shattering crash larger than anything the pundits anticipate because the revolutionary economic and social changes occurring in the United States have now pushed both the burgeoning new majority and the conservative Republicans' counterrevolution beyond their tipping points.","12:08 a.m. EST November 19, 2015","3373","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/19/election-shattering-republicans/76012410/"
"The United States is being transformed by revolutions remaking the country at an accelerating and surprising pace. Witness the revolutions in technology, the Internet, big data and energy, though just as important are the tremendous changes taking place in immigration, racial and ethnic diversity, the family, religious observance and gender roles. These are reaching their apexes in the booming metropolitan centers and among millennials.","3374","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/19/election-shattering-republicans/76012410/"
"As the revolutions interact, they are accelerating the emergence of a new America. Consider that nearly 40 percent of New York City's residents are foreign-born, with Chinese the second-largest group behind Dominicans. The foreign-born make up nearly 40 percent of Los Angeles' residents and 58 percent of Miami's. A majority of U.S. households are headed by unmarried people, and, in cities, 40 percent of households include only a single person. Church attendance is in decline, and non- religious seculars now outnumber mainline Protestants. Three-quarters of working-age women are in the labor force, and two-thirds of women are the breadwinners or co- breadwinners of their households. The proportion of racial minorities is approaching 40 percent, but blowing up all projections are the 15 percent of new marriages that are interracial. People are moving from the suburbs to the cities. And in the past five years, two-thirds of millennial college graduates have settled in the 50 largest cities, transforming them.","3375","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/19/election-shattering-republicans/76012410/"
"Shifting attitudes were underscored in this year's Gallup Poll when 60 to 70 percent of the country said gay and lesbian relations, having a baby outside of marriage, sex between an unmarried man and woman, and divorce are all ""morally acceptable.""","3376","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/19/election-shattering-republicans/76012410/"

"Further, these revolutionary transformations have accelerated the growth of a new majority coalition of racial minorities, single women, millennials and seculars. Together, these groups formed 51 percent of the electorate in 2012, but our analysis of census survey data and exit poll projections indicates that they will comprise fully 63 percent in 2016. With these growing groups each supporting Hillary Clinton by more than 2 to 1 in today's polls, it is fair to say that the United States has reached an electoral tipping point.","3378","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/19/election-shattering-republicans/76012410/"

"Republicans have joined a ferocious and intensifying decade-long counterrevolution in an attempt to stop this new majority from governing successfully. In 2004, George W. Bush campaign strategist Karl Rove launched the battle for American values when he gave up on the so-called swing voter and worked to engage millions more evangelicals. That has required pouring ever more fuel on the fire – including warning of Armageddon if the liberal Democrats were to govern.","3380","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/19/election-shattering-republicans/76012410/"
"This battle has left the Republicans with mostly married voters, as well as the oldest, most rural and most religiously observant voters in the country. That creates formidable odds against its winning an electoral college majority.","3381","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/19/election-shattering-republicans/76012410/"
"It has also left a Republican Party where three-quarters of its base voters are tea party supporters, evangelicals or religiously observant. That in turn has catapulted to the top of the Republican presidential race candidates who promise to challenge this new America before it's too late.","3382","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/19/election-shattering-republicans/76012410/"
"That this counterrevolution has reached its own tipping point is evident in the shrinking proportion of people who think of themselves as conservative. When Republicans challenged President Obama in the off-year elections of 2010, 46 percent of the country was conservative at the high point. That figure is now 37 percent.","3383","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/19/election-shattering-republicans/76012410/"
"For Republicans, 2016 will prove to be no normal election, because it will confirm that the new America is here and that the counterrevolution has lost. That is why I expect the result to be shattering for the Republican Party as we know it.","3384","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/19/election-shattering-republicans/76012410/"

"For the GOP, 2016 may look like 1984 did for the Democratic Party. It emerged divided out of a bitter primary, and the Democrats' mainstream candidate, Walter Mondale, lost in a landslide. Afterward, the modernizers got the upper hand. They might well have elected Gary Hart in 1988 and did elect Bill Clinton in 1992.","3386","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/19/election-shattering-republicans/76012410/"
"It is easy to imagine, then, that after the coming shattering election, some Republican leaders will repudiate this campaign's anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim appeals and actively embrace the United States as an immigrant nation. Other leaders might accept the sexual revolution and the new gender roles and work to help the modern working family. Others might embrace again the need for national investment in education and modern infrastructure.","3387","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/19/election-shattering-republicans/76012410/"

"The coast is the reason we are here. It is the beauty and productivity of the ocean, bays, and creeks that has drawn us. This environment now suffers the shadow of a new threat, that of fossil fuel extraction off our coast. President Obama has opened up the mid and south Atlantic coast to exploration for drilling for oil and gas. Permits are now being applied for geophysical exploration that could begin as early as 2017.","3462","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/10/29/letters-editor-republicans-wasting-taxes-politics/74771108/"
"According to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 34 species of marine mammals may be impacted by these exploration activities. Six of these are endangered species. From 32,367 to 3,378 individual dolphins and whales per year are estimated to become injured by the activities. The activities are also estimated to disrupt the behavior of over 3 million individual whales and dolphins per year.","3463","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/10/29/letters-editor-republicans-wasting-taxes-politics/74771108/"
"Worst of the associated impacts, are those from seismic testing. This method of sensing utilizes extremely loud blasts to search for fossil fuel deposits under the seabed. Seismic blasting can have damaging effects on cetaceans. Whales and dolphins have underwater auditory and sensory systems which are so specialized and highly-developed that they still exceed the current comprehension of scientists. For example, through echolocation, dolphins can detect the shape, position, and size of larger objects from up to six miles away. The impacts to these creatures from continuous, 190-decibel blasts are dangerous and not fully understood.","3464","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/10/29/letters-editor-republicans-wasting-taxes-politics/74771108/"

"The Atlantic Ocean should not be permitted to undergo a new barrage of impacts from seismic testing the ultimate consequence of which is risky resource extraction. We cannot gamble on a disaster like the Deep Water Horizon off our coast. That oil spill contaminated over 1,000 miles of coastline, caused billions of dollars in damage to fisheries, and caused over $20 billion in damage to the gulf tourist economy.","3466","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/10/29/letters-editor-republicans-wasting-taxes-politics/74771108/"

John Carney, at least a dozen other U.S. Senators, and elected officials from over eighty towns, cities, and counties.

Not only have Republicans wasted millions in taxpayer funds, but they have politicized the deaths of 4 Americans.

"The current Republican presidential race is less a political contest than a reality TV series: a stage-managed melodrama with a cast of characters selected to titillate and provoke. By that standard, the CNBC debate succeeded far beyond expectations -- all but guaranteeing a larger audience for the next exciting installment. Viewers who tuned in to see Donald Trump boasting and hurling insults at the Sleepwalking Surgeon, the Sweaty Senator and the Amazing Spineless Governor found themselves invited to boo an entirely different set of villains -- CNBC's frustrated and argumentative moderators. In professional wrestling, of course, the referees are always part of the show. Senator Ted Cruz got the party started with a cleverly contrived bit of bombast camouflaging evasiveness as high principle. Asked if his opposition to the recently negotiated congressional budget compromise showed he wasn't ""the kind of problem-solver American voters want,"" Cruz attacked moderator John Harwood instead. ""The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media,"" Cruz said. ""You look at the questions: 'Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?' 'Ben Carson, can you do math?' 'John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?' 'Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?' 'Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?' How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?"" In fact, none of those characterizations was accurate. Nobody called Trump a villain, although Harwood did ask about his ""comic book campaign"" promises to deport 11 million immigrants, build a giant wall, make Mexico pay for it, and slash taxes by $10 trillion while balancing the budget. Nobody had to urge Ohio's Gov. Kasich to insult Trump and Carson. He'd opened the debate by lamenting that his party's two leading candidates were people ""who cannot do the job."" He'd specifically cited their fantastical budget promises along with Trump's immigration vows. Elsewhere, Kasich suggested that many Republicans had lost touch with reality. CNBC's Becky Quick never challenged Dr. Carson's mathematical ability. But she did get visibly frustrated at his serene unwillingness to acknowledge basic arithmetic, and fell into bickering.","8:06 a.m. EST November 9, 2015","3926","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/09/republicans-reality-show-rat-race/75443252/"
"No matter. Sen. Cruz, who has carefully avoided antagonizing Trump, had identified the villains. The studio audience of GOP loyalists went ape -- hooting, beating their chests and all but flinging dung at the hapless CNBC moderators. Nothing so animates the GOP base as the perception that they're being sneered at by effete intellectuals. Pollster Frank Luntz reported thunderous approval among his all-Republican focus group. Poor babies. I'd argue that something historic is going on. As Kasich suggests, beleaguered Republicans are currently engaged in a retreat from reality as profound as communist apparatchiks during the last days of the USSR. Hence the predominance of hucksters, sharpers and mountebanks among the candidates onstage. In deference to the astonishing avarice of billionaire donors, instead of Five Year Plans, they're embracing magic hairball economics and quack cures. It's no accident that renowned brain surgeon Carson lent his prestige to Mannatech, an outfit peddling ""nutritional supplements"" that supposedly cure autism and cancer. The company recently paid $7 million to settle a deceptive practices lawsuit brought by the Texas Attorney General. Texas! Asked by CNBC's Carl Quintanilla about this unseemly connection, Carson dismissed it as ""propaganda."" But anybody can watch Carson's video endorsements online. Alas, much of the GOP electorate has reached that sublime point of self-deception where they refuse to acknowledge any reality they don't wish to believe. In consequence, the saner sorts of conservatives are bailing out. CNBC's Harwood brought up former Bush-appointed Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's statement that ""the know-nothingism of the far right"" had driven him out of the Republican Party. That merely showed his ""arrogance,"" said Sen. Rand Paul of the man who arguably saved the nation's financial system post-2008. Bruce Bartlett, the onetime Reagan Treasury official who thinks the GOP has gone badly astray, mocked Cruz's crybaby rhetoric. ""We've just seen Hillary Clinton go through 11 hours of questioning, and these guys can't go a couple minutes of questioning,"" he said. Pressed about his own save-the-billionaires tax scheme, Sen. Marco Rubio went off on Harwood. ""Democrats have the ultimate super PAC,"" he whined. ""It's called the mainstream media."" So would you like to hear Anderson Cooper's first softball question to perennial press ""favorite"" Hillary Clinton during the recent CNN Democratic debate? It was this: ""Will you say anything to get elected?""

"Arguably, one of the hardest places in the world to talk seriously about climate change solutions is in the United States House of Representatives, but a group of House Republicans is asking their colleagues to do just that.","11:33 a.m. EST November 14, 2015","3958","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/14/republicans-talking-climate-solutions/75774480/"
"Two Florida representatives, Carlos Curbelo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, have joined nine other Republicans in introducing the Gibson Resolution, which acknowledges that climate change “has had noticeable, negative impacts that are expected to worsen in every region of the United States and its territories.” The resolution states that the House should commit “to working constructively, using our tradition of American ingenuity, innovation, and exceptionalism, to create and support economically viable, and broadly supported private and public solutions.”","3959","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/14/republicans-talking-climate-solutions/75774480/"
"Despite what you might have heard, a majority of Republicans are with them. A recent poll from the University of Texas at Austin found that views on climate change are shifting fast. Fifty-six percent of Republicans believe there is solid evidence for global warming. Half of Republicans say they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to reduce the use of coal or require utilities to obtain a certain proportion of electricity from wind and solar.","3960","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/14/republicans-talking-climate-solutions/75774480/"
"Rep. Curbelo hinted at the conservative approach he would take in a recent editorial in the Miami Herald. “To efficiently and effectively address this issue, we need an approach that is market-based as opposed to one driven by an increase in top-down government regulation. Enacting policies that encourage the private sector to invest, not only in general infrastructure projects, but long-term visionary technologies, will lead to economic prosperity and environmental sustainability.”","3961","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/14/republicans-talking-climate-solutions/75774480/"
"An approach that meets Rep. Curbelo’s criteria is the plan supported by George Shultz, former Sec. of State under Ronald Reagan. It is a market-based plan that would collect a steadily-rising fee from fossil fuel companies, with all revenue returned to households as a monthly dividend. Because of the dividend, it fully protects American households from increased energy costs. George Shultz has said that it is a fee, not a tax, because the government doesn’t keep the money. The Shultz plan is by far the simplest and most effective way to rapidly achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.","3962","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/14/republicans-talking-climate-solutions/75774480/"
"The dividend even provides an economic stimulus that increases jobs, according to an independent study by Regional Economic Models, Inc. By starting with low fees but increasing them every year for 20 years, it provides predictable incentives for private sector investment in clean energy infrastructure and innovative technologies. By including a border tariff on imports from countries without a similar price on carbon, it protects American business and ensures worldwide cooperation.","3963","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/14/republicans-talking-climate-solutions/75774480/"

"Rubio said CNBC’s John Harwood was “wrong” that the Tax Foundation analysis of his tax plan found “you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top 1% as to people in the middle of the income scale.” But that is what the Tax Foundation found.","4010","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/29/fact-check-third-republican-debate/74779852/"
"Rubio responded that the largest percentage gains would be for those with the lowest incomes, which is also true, according to the Tax Foundation’s analysis.

"The Tax Foundation concluded that Rubio’s plan, when scored “dynamically” to account for expected economic growth, would result in an after-tax income increase of nearly 28% for those in the top 1%, while those in the middle income deciles — 40% to 50% and 50% to 60% — would see their after-tax income rise by 15.7% and 15.3%, respectively.

"Rubio’s tax plan, which he coauthored with Sen. Mike Lee, includes a number of dramatic changes to the current tax code, including a reduction in the number of tax brackets to two (15% and 35%), the elimination of most itemized deductions (excluding charitable and mortgage interest deductions), and a new child tax credit of $2,500.","4015","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/29/fact-check-third-republican-debate/74779852/"

"Looking at the plan on a “static basis,” which does not assume that tax cuts in the plan would spur economic growth, the Tax Foundation said the average gain in after-tax income would be 3.9%. But the biggest winners — on a percentage basis — would be those at the bottom and top of the income scale. For example, the analysis stated, the gain would be 11.4% for the 10% to 20% decile, 11.5% for the highest 1%, but only 1.7% for the 50-60% decile.","4017","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/29/fact-check-third-republican-debate/74779852/"
"Those disparities are not as dramatic when looking at the tax plan on a “dynamic” basis, which assumes the cuts would lead to significant economic growth.

"So Harwood and Rubio were talking past each other a bit. Harwood was pointing out that those at the top income levels were seeing greater benefit — on a percentage basis — than those in the middle income levels. And that’s true. Rubio, meanwhile, insisted that those at the very lowest income levels would see the greatest percentage increase in income. That’s also true. Rubio further confused the issue with his explanation that “5% of a million is a lot more than 5% of a thousand.” As we noted earlier, it’s not just that those in the top 1% of tax filers would be seeing greater dollar savings in Rubio’s plan than those in the middle income brackets, it’s that those at the top would see a greater percentage gain as well.","4019","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/29/fact-check-third-republican-debate/74779852/"

"Dear Ben:","4133","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/04/ll-give-republicans-debate-they-want/75145620/"
"I write to you in your capacity as debate negotiator for Republican presidential candidates. I understand you may have an opening for a moderator for your Feb. 26 debate. Please consider this letter my application for the job.","4134","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/04/ll-give-republicans-debate-they-want/75145620/"
"I applaud Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus’ decision to suspend NBC as a debate host because of the “mean” and “gotcha” questions CNBC asked at last week’s debate. I feel passionately that a debate is neither the time nor the place for hard questions, and as debate moderator I will rigorously adhere to gentle and affectionate questioning.","4135","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/04/ll-give-republicans-debate-they-want/75145620/"
"I also share Donald Trump’s outrage that Telemundo, a Spanish-language outlet, would be allowed to co-host the February debate even though a Telemundo journalist had the gall to challenge Trump about the rapists and criminals he says Mexico sends to America. Let me assure you that, as debate moderator, I would not challenge Trump or any other candidate on this or any factual matter.","4136","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/04/ll-give-republicans-debate-they-want/75145620/"
"Furthermore, I have read your draft letter proposing requirements for future debate moderators, and I wholeheartedly and unreservedly commit to abide by every one of them. Specifically, I pledge to meet the following demands you listed:","4137","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/04/ll-give-republicans-debate-they-want/75145620/"
"Additionally, per your list of requirements, I promise:","4138","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/04/ll-give-republicans-debate-they-want/75145620/"
"As a further inducement to hire me as your moderator, I will go beyond the above-mentioned requirements cited in your letter. You also posed questions about standards for inclusion in the debate, debate length, use of “gong/buzzer/bell,” debate format, stage design, and the type and size of the audience and clothing worn by audience members.","4139","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/04/ll-give-republicans-debate-they-want/75145620/"
"In order to guarantee that this debate will be the thoroughly enjoyable experience for the candidates that we all want it to be, I plan to allow all 15 candidates to debate on the stage at the same time and not to cut off candidates if they exceed their time limits. I pledge to hold the overall debate length to 30 minutes, including opening and closing statements, in order to minimize time for gaffes and unscripted remarks. To avoid unhelpful reactions from the audience, I promise to have no audience. I will pipe in artificial applause of precisely the same pre-agreed length and decibel level for all candidates after all answers.","4140","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/04/ll-give-republicans-debate-they-want/75145620/"
"I will submit my questions in advance for pre-approval by the campaigns. No questions will be asked about women, racial minorities or any other issue that might cast the Republican Party in an unfavorable light. There will be no questions about any candidate’s past statements or actions, including but not limited to: bankruptcies, financial difficulties, missed votes and inconsistencies. Candidates will be seated in Barcaloungers. If candidates feel overheated, the moderator will fan them while they answer and provide them with their choice of lemon or cucumber ice water. I will begin each question with the phrase “Mother, may I,” and I will address candidates as “Your Excellency,” “Your Eminence” or another honorific approved by the campaigns.","4141","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/04/ll-give-republicans-debate-they-want/75145620/"
"I hope this application meets with your approval. I believe the format outlined above will, after the CNBC debate debacle, truly Make Republicans Look Great Again and return journalists to their proper role as palace courtiers. I am hopeful that I can convince my colleagues at washingtonpost.com to live-stream the debate. Though I cannot promise you that any network will broadcast the debate, I believe this should not be a major impediment. Under the requirements you proposed, very few people will be watching anyway.","4142","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/04/ll-give-republicans-debate-they-want/75145620/"
