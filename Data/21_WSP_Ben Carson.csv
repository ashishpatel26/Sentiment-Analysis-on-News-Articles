"During a CNN interview Wednesday, Dr. Ben Carson proved once again why he should never be taken seriously outside the world of neurosurgery, where he rightfully occupies exalted status. Anchor Chris Cuomo asked the aspirant for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination about same-sex marriage. Carson gave his usual answer about how we should follow the Constitution and how homosexuality is nothing like race and how being gay or lesbian is a choice. But it was the example he used to illustrate his “choice” point that revealed how “Gifted Hands” has a deranged mind.","March 4","1","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/04/ben-carsons-mental-prison-on-gays/"

"Have you lifted yourself of the floor yet? I guess Carson figured the fruit analogy he used with Andrea Mitchell in 2013 wasn’t dumb enough. Invoking the violence of prison rape to blithely buttress his warped thinking about gay people is beneath contempt. Carson neither knows nor cares to know the real lives of LGBT people.","3","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/04/ben-carsons-mental-prison-on-gays/"
"One other point. Of course, race and sexual orientation aren’t the same thing. But only the willfully blind and ignorant refuse to see that the quest for equality, dignity and equal protection as guaranteed by the Constitution is a shared struggle for civil rights by African Americans and their fellow LGBT Americans. That Carson can’t see this is further proof that he doesn’t deserve to be the chief defender of our sacred founding document as president of the United States.","4","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/04/ben-carsons-mental-prison-on-gays/"

"Y’all know I am no fan of Ben Carson, an all-but-declared aspirant for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. The far-right heartthrob likens Obamacare to slavery and homosexuality to beastiality. Just last month at the Iowa Freedom Summit, Carson warned gays that cake makers “might put poison” in their creations if they are forced not to discriminate against legally married same-sex couples (who a majority of the nation believes should have the right to marry, by the way). With stances like that alone, I don’t think “Gifted Hands” should get the keys to the White House.","February 4","15","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/02/04/ben-carson-is-no-sarah-palin-yet/"
"In a lot of ways, Carson, a famed neurosurgeon, is no better than Sarah Palin, the half-term governor of Alaska. They both spend a lot of time complaining about the media. And they both have irritating speaking styles. Hers is a wannabe folksy stand-up comedy routine. His is that of a somnambulant stage-wanderer. But in an interview published in the Hill newspaper Tuesday, Carson said something Palin has never said and will never say.","16","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/02/04/ben-carson-is-no-sarah-palin-yet/"
"Carson is intelligent — some say brilliant given his gifted hands. The intellectual curiosity needed to reach such heights was drilled into him by an illiterate mother who made him and his brother read books. “We had to submit to her written book reports, two apiece each week, which she couldn’t read but we didn’t know that,” Carson told his Iowa audience last month. Contrast that with Palin’s stunning response in 2008 to a simple question from Katie Couric about what she reads to stay abreast of current events.","17","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/02/04/ben-carson-is-no-sarah-palin-yet/"

"Palin hasn’t gotten any better over the six and a half years. Instead, the frighteningly unprepared 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee became a best-selling author and reality television star. The Post’s Karen Tumulty reported last week that Palin’s star as a darling of the far right flamed out as a result of her meandering 34-minute snarkfest in Iowa.","19","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/02/04/ben-carson-is-no-sarah-palin-yet/"
"It is a safe bet that I will not agree with Carson on anything.

The national conversation on Herman Cain’s inane “9-9-9” tax plan in 2011 was enough.","20","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/02/04/ben-carson-is-no-sarah-palin-yet/"

"Carson is a celebrated neurosurgeon, conservative commentator and likely presidential candidate. A number of Baptist pastors, especially those affiliated with Baptist21, spoke out against Carson’s appearance.

"Carson has also made statements about Muslims, Jews and Christians all being “God’s children,” perhaps implying that there are multiple paths to God. Hosting Carson and other Republican candidates, the critics said, continues to convey the impression that the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) is “in bed with the Republican Party,” as Baptist21 put it.

"This was a welcome outcome to what had the potential to be a serious snafu for the SBC. Whatever the organizers’ intentions, Baptist21 has this exactly right – hosting any political candidate carries a tacit implication of endorsement.

"The Carson controversy highlights a major question of identity that has been with Baptists a long time, as my new book (with Barry Hankins) “Baptists in America” suggests. Are Baptists insiders or outsiders in American politics and culture? The early experiences of Baptists in colonial America left no doubt — Baptists were persecuted outsiders. Horsewhipped for illegal preaching in Virginia, fined for failing to pay taxes to the Congregationalist Church in New England, they were widely reviled as troublemakers and outlaws.","42","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/04/27/southern-baptists-canceled-an-event-with-ben-carson-heres-why-it-matters/"

"If politics creeps toward the center of the evangelical mission, then the gospel of salvation through the grace of Christ alone can become corrupted by politicization (usually Republicanization, at least for the SBC). Baptists can seem more concerned with preserving nominal Christian culture and aligning with politicians who affirm that culture, rather than proclaiming with laser focus that each person is lost without Christ, and that, as Jesus taught in the Gospel of John, they must be born again.","46","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/04/27/southern-baptists-canceled-an-event-with-ben-carson-heres-why-it-matters/"

His books sell out in Christian bookstores, and before his Fox News contract was canceled, he was a regular on that network. At last week's CPAC, he effectively tied for third place with Sen.

"But in the fundraising race, Carson isn't likely to come close to the top-tier candidates. His viability as a long-shot candidate will be based on his ability to catch fire, earn free media and have memorable showings on a debate stage. Mike Huckabee and Herman Cain, both ministers, were able to do that in the last cycles, because they spoke forcefully and in quotable soundbites.

"It’s clear that CNN “New Day” co-anchor Chris Cuomo had prepared for his interview with Ben Carson, the noted former neurosurgeon and likely 2016 presidential candidate. He asked about the Islamic State, he researched a long-ago opinion of Carson’s regarding health care and he pushed him on negotiations with Iran. Yet he couldn’t possibly have foreseen the out-of-nowhere remark that Carson made regarding sexual orientation.","77","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/03/04/cnn-scores-latest-shocking-opinion-of-presidential-hopeful-ben-carson/"
"In a back-and-forth about same-sex marriage, Cuomo noted that federal courts were applying equal-protection rationales to extend marriage to gay couples around the country. Carson made clear his opposition to the trend, saying that the matter should be settled state by state “because the judicial system at the state level has to answer to the people.” But what if the people of the states approve a measure that enforces the tyranny of the majority over an oppressed minority, as happened with slavery, asked Cuomo.

"Certainly a lot of things happened while they were in there. Yet the dynamic is scarcely what Carson purports here.

It certainly makes it hard for people to defend him. Who wants to defend a comment that can be construed as saying that Americans should be more like the Islamic State? Anyone?

"In a one-on-one interview with the Washington Post and NH1 News, Carson said he would replace Obamacare with “health savings accounts for everyone, giving the people flexibility within their families so that they can transfer money from one account to another within their family, utilizing the same money that we use from Medicaid to take of the indigent to establish their health savings accounts.

It looks like people are putting their money where their mouth is and obviously I would imagine if I announce that would go up tremendously. So what I really want to make sure of is that I’m doing what my fellow Americans want me to do. Do they really want to have someone in the mix who’s really more one of them and not just a traditional political figure, who has had a lot of experience solving problems, and is that something applicable to our nation.

"Because such things tend to attract interest on the Internet, the tweet attracted interest on the internet. The liberal blog Talking Points Memo wrote a quick story about it, for example. By the time TPM went to the site, though, the image associated with Carson's name was the correct one.","168","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/25/cpac-accused-a-post-reporter-of-photoshopping-an-image-that-didnt-happen/"

"When contacted by TPM, CPAC spokesman Ross Hemminger told the site that the image was ""a Photoshop,"" and that he'd ""spoken with the web people who verified that it was definitely photoshopped."" Terris rebutted the claim to TPM (""I don't know anything about Photoshop, anything about web design"") and on his Twitter account.","171","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/25/cpac-accused-a-post-reporter-of-photoshopping-an-image-that-didnt-happen/"
"When we reached him by phone, Terris explained exactly what he was doing this morning. (Probably unneeded disclosure: Terris and I know each other through The Post.) He was thorough. ""I woke up,"" he began, and explained that he was trying to find someone to shadow at the conference, and knew Carson's people. To find Carson's schedule: ""I Googled CPAC on my phone. I clicked on the link. I saw the list of speakers -- I think I was on the list of speakers page? [Ed. - Here. It's not actually in the mobile app.] I scrolled down to Ben Carson.

"And then he took a screenshot. Except he didn't know how, so he figured out the proper combination (on an iPhone 6, like his, it's the power button and the home button at the same time). He took a few screenshots, including the one at right.","173","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/25/cpac-accused-a-post-reporter-of-photoshopping-an-image-that-didnt-happen/"

"Like the text. Below is Terris's original image and an image of the existing page that I took from my phone. Notice that Carson's photo is longer than Scott's. It's still the full image of Scott, as you can see here. It's just shorter. But that shorter image means that the text flows under the photo one line higher.","176","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/25/cpac-accused-a-post-reporter-of-photoshopping-an-image-that-didnt-happen/"

"See the text under the red line? If Terris (or someone) is Photoshopping this, they need to move all of the text so that the line breaks work evenly with the shorter photo as well. And it would need to reflow all of the text with new line breaks all the way down. That is far trickier than simply swapping out the photo. Not impossible.

"So what happened? CPAC, responding to Terris's initial tweet, pointed to the Google cache of the speaker page, showing that the search engine had captured a version of Carson's speaker page with the proper image at some point earlier. But that was using a desktop browser. It's possible that this was a short-term bug that only affected those trying to access the site with a phone. Web sites usually create separate formatting for mobile devices and desktops, and at least one other user, unaffiliated with The Post or CPAC, saw similar problems from a phone.","179","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/25/cpac-accused-a-post-reporter-of-photoshopping-an-image-that-didnt-happen/"

""When we put in Ben Carson, we put in Ben Carson's photo with Ben Carson's bio."" He pointed out that there's enough fakery out there on Twitter that it's worth being skeptical.

"The 2014 outbreak was traced to the Philippines, specifically from members of the Amish community in Ohio who had traveled there as missionaries; the community had halted routine vaccinations many years ago after a baby was suspected of getting ill from a shot.

"As you can see, in most years, the other countries had better vaccination rates than the United States, though there was a sudden decline in 2013 in every country but El Salvador. Still, these are fairly high vaccination rates, making it much less likely that illegal immigrants from these countries are a source of the outbreak.","328","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/06/is-there-a-link-between-the-measles-outbreak-and-illegal-immigration/"
"Brooks, in an interview, emphasized that he “never made a statement” that there was a link, just that it was possible. “You can have a lively debate about the most probable source of the outbreak,” he said, but he said he has made no judgment about whether illegal immigrants are a source. “I certainly think it is a concern,” he added.","329","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/06/is-there-a-link-between-the-measles-outbreak-and-illegal-immigration/"
"Brooks acknowledged that the immunization rates in the countries that are the biggest source of illegal immigrants are good, “but anything less than 100 percent immunization” means that there is still a possible link. He pointed to the declines suffered by Mexico, Honduras and Nicaragua in 2013—and also noted that Haiti, another source of illegal immigrants, has only a 65 percent rate.","330","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/06/is-there-a-link-between-the-measles-outbreak-and-illegal-immigration/"
"Brooks cited a 2012 CDC report on 212 measles cases in 2011, which showed that 90 percent were associated with importations from other countries. Only 72 cases (36 percent) could be specifically linked to travel to or from overseas; 52 were linked to U.S. residents who had traveled abroad, and 20 were linked to foreign visitors. (France had a major outbreak that year, and 13 cases were traced just to it.) The report does not state whether any of the importations were linked to illegal immigrants; the only cases involving the Americas were from Canada (one) and the Dominican Republic (one).","331","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/06/is-there-a-link-between-the-measles-outbreak-and-illegal-immigration/"
"We should note that CDC’s Schuchat said that in 2014, “79 percent of the unvaccinated cases of measles in the U.S. were unvaccinated due to personal belief exceptions.” So even if one could trace the source to an illegal immigrant, the main source of the problem is a failure to get vaccinated in the first place.","332","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/06/is-there-a-link-between-the-measles-outbreak-and-illegal-immigration/"
"Terry Giles, campaign chairman for the nascent Ben Carson presidential campaign, emphasized that Carson used the word “perhaps’ in his comments. “Non-compliance is anyone who has not been vaccinated,” he said in an e-mail. “While the unaccompanied children entering the U.S. from Central and Latin America (we have all heard about) are being screened and you have some good information regarding Latin America, we cannot possibly know how many Mexican and other children are crossing the border that are not vaccinated.”","333","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/06/is-there-a-link-between-the-measles-outbreak-and-illegal-immigration/"
"“Does all of that create a risk — yes,” Giles said. “But does that mean the measles outbreak is an ‘immigration’ issue — no. It may be a another reason we should be sealing our borders — but the non-vaccination of American children because of misunderstood or misleading information would still create a potential public health issue even if we reduced the flow of illegal immigrants to zero.”","334","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/06/is-there-a-link-between-the-measles-outbreak-and-illegal-immigration/"
"The CDC has stated that “children arriving at U.S. borders pose little risk of spreading infectious diseases to the general public.” The agency says that unaccompanied children may have missed some vaccinations so “as a precaution, ORR [Office of Refugee Resettlement] is providing vaccinations to all children who do not have documentation of previous valid doses of vaccine.”","335","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/06/is-there-a-link-between-the-measles-outbreak-and-illegal-immigration/"
"Lauren Vandiver, spokeswoman for Brooks, provided an Inspector General report from the Department of Homeland Security that reported that some of the unaccompanied children had spread diseases:","336","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/06/is-there-a-link-between-the-measles-outbreak-and-illegal-immigration/"

"Unlike Limbaugh, Brooks and Carson did not draw a direct link between illegal immigration and the measles outbreak; they merely suggested it is a possibility. But it’s a tricky balance, given that thus far the CDC has not traced this most recent outbreak — or previous ones — to illegal immigration. One cannot have 100 percent certainty in life, and so that always leaves open the possibility of a link.","338","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/06/is-there-a-link-between-the-measles-outbreak-and-illegal-immigration/"
"Brooks’ comments were stronger, even suggesting the possibility of deaths, while Carson’s remarks were relatively nuanced. To some extent, this falls in the realm of opinion. And certainly if the link had been as clearly stated as Limbaugh, this would have resulted in more Pinocchios.","339","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/06/is-there-a-link-between-the-measles-outbreak-and-illegal-immigration/"
"Nevertheless, when raising the possibility that illegal immigration could spread disease, politicians also have an obligation to note that the evidence of any such link, thus far, is rather slim or even nonexistent.","340","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/06/is-there-a-link-between-the-measles-outbreak-and-illegal-immigration/"

"With a guest list of 650 — a fraction the size of the much-hyped White House Correspondents’ Association dinner — Gridiron is arguably a far more coveted ticket within Beltway circles. Gridiron is also the most insular of the city’s press dinners.

"— Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley (D) recently said that he will announce whether or not he is running for president -- which he recently called a ""colossal undertaking"" -- in late May.

"— On the Democratic side, former Virginia senator Jim Webb and former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee have both formed exploratory committees as they consider challenging Clinton in the primary.

"When conservatives gather Thursday for their annual confab there will be homages to Ronald Reagan everywhere.

"For the Loop, Crowdpac, a group that mines campaign and political data and assigns ideological scores, compared Reagan’s conservatism during his time in office to the many GOP presidential hopefuls speaking at CPAC over the four-day conference, to see who might be most like the Gipper if Reagan were a politician today.","435","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2015/02/25/if-ronald-reagan-ran-today-where-would-he-fall-on-the-conservative-spectrum/"

"One caveat to this data: When Reagan ran for president in 1980 and 1984, political giving was much different from it is today. There weren’t super PACs or just the sheer volume of money in campaigns. So there’s simply more data to analyze for politicians today.","438","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2015/02/25/if-ronald-reagan-ran-today-where-would-he-fall-on-the-conservative-spectrum/"

"Underscoring how divided the GOP is, several potential top-tier candidates are on the far edges of the conservative continuum. Gov. Chris Christie (N.J.) and former Gov.

Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Rand Paul (Ky.) are more.","441","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2015/02/25/if-ronald-reagan-ran-today-where-would-he-fall-on-the-conservative-spectrum/"

"Psychiatrist Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy has presented research that concludes the type of destructive behavior we’re seeing now is not only understandable, but should be anticipated by reasonable and just people.

"By coincidence, the Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network opened its annual conference in New York on Wednesday morning, and though you wouldn’t call it a celebratory mood — there’s nothing to celebrate about that video — there was at least satisfaction on the dais that, for the moment at least, the arc of the moral universe was visibly bending toward justice.","547","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/walter-scotts-murder-was-sickening-but-finally-there-are-signs-of-progress/2015/04/08/711ca4d8-de30-11e4-be40-566e2653afe5_story.html"

"Tuesday’s events — the charging of the South Carolina officer and the election results in Ferguson — show in an important way that victims of police violence are not alone and that a critical mass may have been reached in the movement to change policing practices.

"Okay. Let's start here: I do think that if you HAD to bet on a candidate right now, Bush is probably the best best -- narrowly. (I think that Marco Rubio would be your best investment because his odds are longer than I think his chances of winning the nomination would be.)","561","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/25/the-idea-that-jeb-bush-is-going-to-run-away-with-the-republican-nomination-makes-no-sense/"
"But -- and this is a big BUT -- the idea that the other potential contenders are falling away when faced with Bush's massive strengths doesn't jibe with the reporting I've done or my general sense of the race. There is absolutely no question that Bush will blow the doors off in terms of fundraising for both his leadership PAC and his super PAC. He will be the money leader in the race from wire to wire -- and no one else is likely to be all that close.","562","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/25/the-idea-that-jeb-bush-is-going-to-run-away-with-the-republican-nomination-makes-no-sense/"
"And, being the candidate with the most money is always a good thing. Always. That said, in a presidential race in which you would expect at least three candidates -- Bush, Scott Walker and Rand Paul -- to be able to raise $75 million (or more) and where the earliest voting states are smallish ones that put a premium on retail politicking, money is not as determinative as it might seem. Remember that in 2000, John McCain was badly outspent by George W. Bush and very nearly upended him for the nomination. (Counter argument: Bush WON that race ultimately because of the organizational advantages accorded to him by his superior fundraising.)","563","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/25/the-idea-that-jeb-bush-is-going-to-run-away-with-the-republican-nomination-makes-no-sense/"

"The first is, well, the first state that will vote in 2016: Iowa. In a Quinnipiac University poll of Iowa caucus-goers released Wednesday morning, Bush places fifth behind Walker, Paul, Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee. But, the topline numbers aren't even the thing that should scare Bush the most in that poll. It's that he is both well known (fewer than one in five voters didn't offer an opinion of him) and not all that well liked (41 percent favorable/40 percent unfavorable.)","565","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/25/the-idea-that-jeb-bush-is-going-to-run-away-with-the-republican-nomination-makes-no-sense/"
"As troubling, 26 percent of likely caucus-goers said they could not support Bush, tying him for the highest percentage of ""no can do"" voters with Chris Christie. And Bush doesn't have his father or brother to blame for his middling (at best) image in Iowa. Both the 41st and 43rd presidents are far better regarded by Iowa Republicans than the man who wants to be the 45th president.","566","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/25/the-idea-that-jeb-bush-is-going-to-run-away-with-the-republican-nomination-makes-no-sense/"

"Aside from Bush's standing in the early states, there is the matter of how he will perform both on the stump and as a candidate more generally. The early returns have been only so-so. Bush seemed to rush through much of his foreign policy speech last week and made a few errors seized on by foreign policy experts who are not favorably inclined to him. Those who have covered him for a long time have suggested this is par for the course -- and, therefore, there isn't much hope that he will get significantly better.","571","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/25/the-idea-that-jeb-bush-is-going-to-run-away-with-the-republican-nomination-makes-no-sense/"
"Now, Bush's awkwardness and lack of polish doesn't have to be a negative. In the wake of President Obama, many Republicans view someone who is not terribly charismatic but has the chops to do the job as very appealing. (The rise of Walker has something to do with that, too.) But, presidential campaigns -- particularly in a crowded primary -- tend to be, at some level, personality contests because the candidates don't have a huge number of major differences on policy. It's not clear -- at least not to me -- that Bush has found his sweet spot as a candidate.","572","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/25/the-idea-that-jeb-bush-is-going-to-run-away-with-the-republican-nomination-makes-no-sense/"
"To go back to where we started: NONE of what I've said above convinced me to rate Bush as anything other than the most likely presidential nominee earlier this month. But the gap between him and the likes of Walker, for one, seems to be narrowing, not widening -- and will continue to do so as Bush navigates his disagreements with the party base on things like Common Core and immigration reform.","573","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/25/the-idea-that-jeb-bush-is-going-to-run-away-with-the-republican-nomination-makes-no-sense/"

"Dogged by the infamous ""oops"" moment of his failed 2012 presidential campaign and by an indictment related to a 2013 veto, Perry has mostly been an afterthought in early national speculation on the 2016 presidential race.","593","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/09/with-new-iowa-approach-perry-looks-to-flip-the-script/"
"For the last month, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker commanded most of the political interest among the expected GOP field. Behind them is a second tier dominated by younger Republicans with fresh stump speeches: U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.","594","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/09/with-new-iowa-approach-perry-looks-to-flip-the-script/"

"""It would be foolish to sleep on Rick Perry's prospects in Iowa at this point,"" said former Iowa GOP Chairman Matt Strawn, an unaligned political consultant, reflecting many other operatives' opinions. ""While other candidates deliberate on how to compete in Iowa, he's been quietly traveling the state and building relationships that weren't there for him four years ago.""","598","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/09/with-new-iowa-approach-perry-looks-to-flip-the-script/"
"The argument goes that Perry's ability to connect to one-on-one with voters could quietly pull him to a surprise showing in the Iowa caucuses, which are known to reward retail politicking. It’s a counterintuitive strategy, given that Perry placed fifth there overall in 2012, winning only two of the state’s 99 counties.","599","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/09/with-new-iowa-approach-perry-looks-to-flip-the-script/"

"Huckabee and Santorum ran campaigns in previous cycles that were discounted early on. Huckabee carried the day in 2008, and Santorum stunned the political world with his 2012 Iowa win.

"Perry's strategy is to host small-venue events there this winter, engaging in much more retail politicking than in 2011. His stump speeches are crammed full of facts and statistics, an implicit acknowledgment of his 2011 debate failure. As he makes the rounds, he frequently talks about his efforts to be better prepared for this campaign.","606","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/09/with-new-iowa-approach-perry-looks-to-flip-the-script/"

"Cruz is now the sitting Texas officeholder in the expected field and has the bully pulpit that Perry once occupied as governor for 14 years.

"And though Perry no longer has the leverage of the office of governor of Texas – he has time. Lots of it.

"Austin Barbour announced on Thursday the formation of a super PAC to support Perry in the campaign, and praised Perry as ""not a guy who was born with a silver spoon in his hand"" in a recent interview with the Tribune.

"Last cycle, Perry’s problems were largely related to his health, the timing of entry into the race and his preparedness.

"Intentional non-vaccination is causing avoidable public health disasters in the United States. The problem is particularly acute for measles — though similar things might be said for flu and other diseases -- because measles is so efficiently transmitted from one susceptible person to another.","629","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/04/all-our-politicians-should-join-together-to-end-the-dangerous-anti-vaccination-madness/"
"Measles herd immunity requires more than 90 percent of Americans to be immunized. This daunting number may understate the challenge, since small communities that are ambivalent about immunization provide local pockets of vulnerability within which local outbreaks can take hold and spread.","630","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/04/all-our-politicians-should-join-together-to-end-the-dangerous-anti-vaccination-madness/"
"It’s all-too-easy to see how these issues could become enmeshed in the culture wars, partisan politics or even the 2016 presidential campaign. This would be a public health disaster. We will never sustain herd immunity if Americans’ beliefs and behaviors in the realm of vaccination harden along cultural or religious or ideological lines.","631","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/04/all-our-politicians-should-join-together-to-end-the-dangerous-anti-vaccination-madness/"
"Ambivalence about vaccines crosses conventional political boundaries. People of varying backgrounds and views find powerful reasons to doubt medical and public health authority, to distrust Big Pharma. These doubts and distrust don’t come from nowhere, and are deeply-held—which is why so many pro-vaccination messages often fall short. Many others simply wish to free-ride on the herd immunity provided by others.","632","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/04/all-our-politicians-should-join-together-to-end-the-dangerous-anti-vaccination-madness/"

"The headline grabber from Quinnipiac’s latest Iowa poll is that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is leading the filed with 25 percent, nearly double the next challenger. Walker has steadily taken hold of the base while attracting support from other segments of the party. With only 7 percent unfavorable an 50 percent favorable ratings he should be credited with one of the fastest, strongest presidential campaign starts in memory. The race has not really begun in earnest and Walker is not even an official candidate, but he becomes the prohibitive favorite in the caucuses if he can withstand the barrage that comes with frontrunner status.","February 25","700","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/02/25/what-are-iowans-telling-us/"
"Iowa requires serious organization to pull voters out on a cold winter’s night to vote in caucuses. But there too Walker seems to be putting it together. An Iowa insider notes that he brought on Eric Woolson, who headed up Mike Huckabee’s amazing upset win over Mitt Romney in 2008. If Walker can build an organization on the ground and keep momentum through the straw poll he will be hard to catch.","701","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/02/25/what-are-iowans-telling-us/"
"If Walker is going to be beaten, I continue to believe it will be by another governor or former governor. Likely caucus goers favor a governor over a senator by an astounding 64 to 21 percent margin. But by far the most popular man in Iowa among caucus goers is Bush, that would be former President George W. Bush with an 80 percent favorable rating. (Maybe Jeb’s opponents should stop reminding voters his last name is Bush.) Speaking of Jeb, his high unfavorable rating at 40 percent says he has his work cut out for him if he wants to compete against Walker and candidates with strong conservative followings (e.g. Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee). Jeb will be appearing this week at Club for Growth’s gathering and at CPAC, two chances to make inroads with the base and explain his actual positions and record.","702","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/02/25/what-are-iowans-telling-us/"
"The poll suggests Walker has room to gain ground among moderates, but that may simply be a function of their unfamiliarity with his record. As a reformer on healthcare and education and someone who acknowledges the ship has sailed on gay marriage, he seems well suited to expand his appeal there. In the weeks and months ahead he has the opportunity to spell out a full agenda on issues that can unify the party (economic growth, an Obamacare alternative, school choice and reform, taxes, trade, deregulation) and demonstrate he is within the strong conservative tradition regarding American leadership in the world.","703","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/02/25/what-are-iowans-telling-us/"
"There are some candidates who obviously have a tough uphill climb if they want to compete. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie “wins” the prize for the highest unfavorable rating (54 percent) while Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) despite his national image lags at 5 percent(barely ahead of Christie) with a favorable rating under 50 percent. If he cannot win in Iowa and if Walker continues to pull away Cruz’s natural base of support among conservatives one has to wonder what the point of a Cruz run would be.","704","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/02/25/what-are-iowans-telling-us/"
"Iowa, the saying goes, does not choose the nominee but does eliminate contenders. If the vote were tomorrow the single figure candidates (Christie, Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio, former Senator Rick Santorum and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry) might not make the cut and someone like the former Iowa winner Huckabee whose strength is with Christian conservatives and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) — whose strength would be in a small caucus state with avid follower — might be severely weakened going into the other early states. The good news for all the not Walker candidates is that months of retail politicking, debates, TV ads and free media await them. If however they are unable to knock Walker off his game we may find the top not-Bush contender much sooner than many expect. The more immediate question is whether anyone can contest Walker’s spot, that is become the top not-Bush-not-Walker candidate.","705","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/02/25/what-are-iowans-telling-us/"
"Arthur Laffer was waiting in the sun outside Terminal A of Reagan National Airport, smiling like the Gipper. It was 10:30 a.m., and he was just in from Nashville. In his briefcase were two papers he was eager to show off. One called minimum-wage laws a crime against black men. The other detailed all the ways liberal economists had been wrong about this economic recovery and Arthur Laffer had been right.","April 9","706","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"No one has influenced Republican candidates’ thinking on the economy for the past four decades as much as Laffer, who is now 75. Laffer says he believes that limiting government and cutting tax rates, especially the rate levied on top earners, will unleash faster economic growth. Since he sold then-candidate Ronald Reagan on that prescription, every Republican presidential nominee has run on a Laffer-inspired economic platform.","707","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"As the 2016 GOP primary season takes off, Laffer is more in demand than ever before, with Republican candidates embracing tax-cut-for-the-rich policies even as they bemoan economic inequality. Candidates have been meeting with him in recent weeks, and on Friday in Nashville, he says, his schedule includes Rick Perry at 10 a.m., Ben Carson at noon, Jeb Bush at 1:15 p.m. and Bobby Jindal at 5. Dinner is scheduled with Ted Cruz. He has already met at least once with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.","708","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"For the first time in a generation, however, Laffer’s “supply-side” strategies are not going without question on the right. Some conservatives believe that America’s struggling middle class needs more targeted policies today than simply broad tax cuts, and that Republicans won’t win back the White House without offering that relief. And mainstream economists, in surveys and interviews, have expressed deep doubt about whether his view of economics is correct.","709","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Laffer is as confident as ever — and so are many of the Republicans who follow his proposals. “What I tell candidates today — and there are not many who are very economically literate — is to push something simple, or do something that has worked in the past,” he said.","710","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"

"But some conservative economists disagree. Michael Strain, an influential economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said Laffer’s formula needs an update for Republicans to win. “I would argue that conditions are substantially different today than they were in 1978,” he said.","712","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"The upcoming election is, in many ways, a crucial barbecue for Laffer and his supply-side acolytes. In recent years Laffer has advised Republican governors and legislators on tax- ­cutting plans in North Carolina, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Florida and Kansas, where the revenue shortfalls that followed nearly cost Gov. Sam Brownback his job last November.","713","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Kansas did not see a surge in growth after making cuts, and it has suffered a series of large budget shortfalls. When Brownback, under threat, called Laffer, worried about whether the tax cuts were working as planned, Laffer said he told Brownback to remember why he cut those taxes in the first place. The growth will come. Be patient.","714","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"“Kansas,” Laffer declared over a five-hour lunch interview in Washington, “is doing fine.”","715","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"All of that was prelude for the presidential race, which Laffer says could be a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Republicans to seize control in Washington and enact sweeping, pro-growth tax cuts. Laffer has been tutoring candidates for months.","716","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"When Carson, the neuro­surgeon turned tea party favorite, came calling with a tax plan to run by him, Laffer headed him off. I have a great new plan I thought up for separating brain neurons, he told Carson. Carson, as Laffer tells it, got the joke. “His mouth fell open and he said, ‘I get it. I get it,’ ” Laffer said. “ ‘Throw away my agenda and listen to you.’ ”","717","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Some time ago, Laffer recounted, he sat down with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who was hoping the economist would bless his flat-tax plan. Laffer critiqued it instead as having too many complicated, economy- ­distorting features. He recalled Paul expressing disappointment he couldn’t endorse it.","718","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"After that sit-down, Paul’s advisers kept calling Laffer, he said. When Paul announced his presidential run this week, he touted a tax plan far more in line with Laffer’s vision.","719","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Now, bigger tests lie ahead — particularly with Bush, who has talked about reaching out to middle-class voters with new policies in this campaign, and with Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who has emerged as the early champion of a movement for more middle-class-focused policies that directly competes with ­supply-side economics for Republican attention.","720","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"In 1978, Laffer was already a rising force in conservative economics. He had graduated from Yale, earned a doctorate from Stanford, taught at the business school at the University of Chicago, the same campus that included the free-market champion Milton Friedman. He had been the first chief economist of the Office of Management and Budget in Washington, under President Richard Nixon, with the legendary George Shultz as his mentor.","721","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Most famously, he had sketched what would come to be called the Laffer Curve. It was a sloping line on a cocktail napkin that showed how, if tax rates were high enough at the top end, a tax cut could actually bring more money to the government than was coming in before — because the lower rates would spark faster economic growth, higher incomes and, voila, more tax receipts.","722","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"The curve drew Reagan’s attention. Laffer was an architect of his 1980 campaign plan to chop federal income tax rates, which at the time topped out at 70 percent. That was the plan George H.W. Bush dubbed “voodoo economics” in the primaries, and it was a plan Bush would embrace when he ran again for president eight years later, with Laffer advising him, and won the White House.","723","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Laffer tells a lot of Reagan stories, as many Reagan administration veterans do. His have a rare quality: Reagan often begins as the villain, only to be redeemed when he embraces ­supply-side economics.","724","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Do you know what Reagan did, he asked, as the head of the actors guild? He called a nationwide strike. As governor of California? He raised taxes. “Who would believe that the man could become the greatest president that we’ve had in generations?” Laffer asked, his eyes twinkling. “Now how could that happen? He was a politician. He was able to reflect the people’s will, and when he didn’t, he changed.”","725","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Laffer has stuck with the same basic argument about taxes that he brought to Reagan. And, recently, over a burger — no condiments — and black coffee, he repeated it.","726","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Taxes discourage work, he wrote, scribbling lines on a legal pad. Less work adds up to less economic growth, which suppresses everyone’s pay across the economy. “Whenever you redistribute income,” he said, “you reduce total income. Period. That’s math.”","727","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"The best way to encourage work is to scrap the entire federal tax code and replace it with two things: an effective national sales tax and a flat tax on income, both at 11.8 percent (compared to a top rate of 39.6 percent today). Laffer predicts the change would unleash huge additional economic growth.","728","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Influential conservatives say the message is powerfully seductive.","729","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"“He is a great communicator,” said Stephen Moore, the chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, who has known Laffer for nearly 25 years. “And most economists can’t communicate.”","730","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"There was even a time when Democrats called on Laffer, too. He helped with Gary Hart’s tax plan in 1988. In 1991, Jerry Brown, the once and future governor of California, called Laffer looking for a policy spark to a presidential campaign that was languishing. “I was looking for something that was clear and easy to articulate,” Brown recalled recently, “and I didn’t like the income tax.”","731","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Laffer reminisced about Brown and about working for Arnold Schwarzenegger when he governed California. (“You, Arthur, you remind me of Danny DeVito,” he recalled Schwarz­enegger telling him, complete with thick faux accent.) He lamented that it has been 20 years since a Democratic candidate sought his advice, and that, instead, the party had returned to a brand of economics that attempts to stimulate the economy through spending fueled by government borrowing.","732","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Laffer’s ideas have also grown out of fashion with much of the mainstream economic community. There is an entire branch of economic literature that uses detailed equations to show cutting top tax rates does not spark additional growth. Most recently, the University of Chicago’s Owen Zidar showed that the biggest gains from tax cuts come when rates are reduced for low-income workers.","733","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"In 2012, the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business asked a panel of respected economists from across the political spectrum whether they believed an income tax cut today would lead to higher tax revenue five years from now, compared with a world with no tax cut. Not a single respondent said it would.","734","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Laffer’s theories are so far detached from mainstream economics that “there is no point of contact,” said Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and a liberal columnist for the New York Times. “This is not a wing of professional economic thought, for what that’s worth. This is not at all the same kind of enterprise as what even conservative economics professors do.”","735","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Republicans love Laffer, Krugman said, not because his message is simple but because it conforms perfectly to a preexisting limit-the-government worldview: “The point is, he’s telling them what they want to hear.”","736","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Economists point out how different the world is today from 1978. The top income tax rate is 30 percentage points lower than it was when Reagan took office. Tax cuts appear to have lost some punch with voters — they didn’t get Mitt Romney elected, or John McCain. Jerry Brown stopped running on a flat tax a long time ago.","737","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"

"But Laffer is constantly reassuring the presidential candidates of his vision, steering them back toward simple supply-side principles, urging them to find the simplicity and embrace the power of low rates. He tells them that America will break its foreign enemies with economic strength, not more military spending. He calls earned- ­income tax credits for the working poor — a favorite idea of Paul Ryan and Rubio — “garbage.” He has written a 12,000-word paper on how minimum-wage laws have killed economic opportunity for young black men, in particular, by artificially reducing the demand for labor.","739","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/arthur-laffer-has-a-neverending-supply-of-supply-side-plans-for-gop/2015/04/09/04c61440-dec1-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"
"Candidates keep coming back to Laffer, said his friend Larry Kudlow, the popular conservative economics commentator, “for the same reason you pay attention to Milton Friedman, even though he’s dead.

"King, infamous for his anti-immigrant outbursts struck again, calling a guest of the first lady at the State of the Union address a “deportable” ( the 20-year old Ana Zamora was brought to the United States when she was less than a year old). King also introduced his “birthright” citizenship bill, which would deprive people born in the United States of citizenship unless one parent is a citizen, resident alien or in the armed services. (For example, a child born here to someone who was brought here illegally as a child would not be a citizen.) King also voted against John Boehner as speaker of the House and has been among the radical clique backing stunts like the 2013 shutdown.","783","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/01/22/keeping-away-from-iowa-may-be-the-smarter-move/"
"It will be interesting to see if any candidate has the spine to distance himself from King. The tendency in these things is to flatter the host, sometimes in embarrassingly enthusiastic terms. Not everyone has been as effusive about King as has Christie, who has headlined a fundraiser for him and declared, “I will be a supporter of Steve King for as long as he continues to be in public life. I consider him a friend.” But candidates who attend are enabling King to hold court, thereby setting themselves and the party up to be slammed as anti-immigrant at worst or at best merely insensitive.","784","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/01/22/keeping-away-from-iowa-may-be-the-smarter-move/"
"Events like these, like the Ames straw poll, risk turning Iowa into an irrelevant sideshow. If the caucuses are going to be controlled by fringe characters who egg candidates into positions and declarations that will come back to bite them, top candidates may choose to stay away. (Interestingly, Jeb Bush called the Iowa GOP state chairman to say he was going to play in Iowa, although he wouldn’t be going to the event.) Iowa then becomes a second-tier event.","785","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/01/22/keeping-away-from-iowa-may-be-the-smarter-move/"
"In light of the Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) flap over his purported appearance at a David Duke group more than a decade ago, it might be helpful for candidates to avoid lending their credibility to characters like King. There is a difference between attending an event hosted by someone with whom one disagrees and attending an event at the behest of someone whose statements have been repudiated by his own party, whose verbiage is offensive to millions of people and whose behavior in the House is representative of the sort of anti-government, anti-sanity image the GOP is trying to shed.","786","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/01/22/keeping-away-from-iowa-may-be-the-smarter-move/"
"Of particular interest is Rubio, whose views on immigration are antithetical to King’s. He is rumored to be meeting with aides and donors over the next couple of days. He’ll appear on a panel Sunday with Cruz and Paul at the winter meeting of Freedom Partners, a Koch brothers-related group, in Palm Springs, Calif. At a time when Romney, Bush and Christie have dominated the headlines, this gives Rubio some visibility for a potential presidential run if he wants to launch one. But does he?","787","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/01/22/keeping-away-from-iowa-may-be-the-smarter-move/"
"Rubio has said he is “down to the last decision — and I think the fundamental one — and that is, at this stage in my life, at this stage, where is the best place for me to serve the country.” That sounds perhaps like he’s edging away from a run, since he has said he’d have to give up his Senate seat if he did. Keeping his Senate seat and his kids from the spotlight may make the most sense for a young pol who has decades ahead of him. Hopefully 2016 contenders, if not Rubio, who are smart enough to steer clear of toxic figures (or make clear they don’t abide by their views) and are brave enough to take a reasoned position on immigration and other issues remain in the race.

"The $75 million refers to the threshold amount of money a top-tier candidate will need to win the nomination. That number is based on what Mitt Romney raised and spent to win the nomination in 2012 ($76.6 million) and numerous conversations I have had with Republican fundraisers and donors in recent months. And, in truth, it might be a little low.","796","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"“It depends on the final March 1st composition [of the field], but cash-on-hand at $30 million in December/January is a reasonable number to think someone has a viable campaign and can withstand some setbacks,” said Ed Rogers, a longtime Republican lobbyist.","797","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"So, the first question that needs to be asked of the more than 20 candidates weighing bids for 2016 is: How are you going to raise $75 million?","798","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"(Sidebar: Yes, I know money isn’t everything in politics.

"Three nearly certain candidates for the GOP nod can make a convincing case that they could reach that number: Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Rand Paul.","800","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"Bush is the no-brainer of the group. He is the son and brother of presidents and is expected to make a fundraising showing at the end of this month aimed at thinning the race’s herd considerably. His biggest edge over the rest of the field — from the second he announces until he either becomes the nominee or drops out — will be his cash-collecting prowess. Bush’s financial ceiling is much, much higher than $75 million; by way of comparison, remember that Hillary Rodham Clinton raised more than $223 million for her 2008 campaign.","801","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, has two things going for him when it comes to reaching that $75 million goal:(1) He has a national network from Democratic attempts to recall him earlier this decade and (2) He is the hot candidate at the moment.","802","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"On the first point, Walker has run three races in the past four years — his 2010 election, the 2011 recall and his 2014 reelection — and has raised $83 million combined for those contests. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. Of the 300,000 people who have given to Walker’s campaigns, three out of every four donated $75 or less, according to The Washington Post’s Matea Gold. That means Walker has a national small-dollar network that can be tapped again and again if he runs for president.","803","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"On point two: Donors — especially major donors — like to give to candidates who look like winners. Polling nationally and in key states such as Iowa suggests that Walker is the candidate with the momentum right now — a key time to be peaking, because so many of the major cash bundlers are making their candidate decisions now. (New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has the opposite problem, but more on that below.)","804","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"Then there is Paul, a senator from Kentucky whose father, Ron, made three runs for president — including two as a Republican in 2008 and 2012.","805","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"Ron Paul is a good place to start; he raised $76 million for the last two campaigns — $41 million in 2012. That was for a candidate and a campaign that almost no one — including many of the people who donated — thought could win. And it was done, in large part, on the Internet, a low-overhead form of fundraising.","806","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"Fast-forward to Rand Paul, who has the backing of his father’s small-dollar Internet donating army without raising a finger. Add to that $40 million (or so), Rand Paul’s aggressive courtship of major mainstream donors who would have never even considered his father and you begin to see his credible path to $75 million.","807","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"

"Christie’s great advantage — aside from his charisma and quick-wittedness — in the 2016 race was supposed to be his deep relationships with the New York and New Jersey money men and women who would finance his campaign. Two things have complicated that plan: Bush’s expected candidacy has stolen away many of those people, and Christie’s polling and political struggles have made donors wary of throwing in their lot with him.","809","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"Rubio, who raised almost $22 million in his 2010 Senate victory, must prove that he can collect tens of millions even with Bush in the race, soaking up major cash from the duo’s home state of Florida.","810","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"Once you get beyond those five candidates, the prospects for a path to $75 million drop significantly. Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) raised $15 million for his 2012 Senate bid and may not need as much as some of the other candidates expected to run in 2016 because of the fervor of his followers. That’s true, to a lesser extent, for former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who seems to have learned few lessons from his inability to capi­tal­ize on his 2008 Iowa caucus win because of a lack of money.","811","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"People such as former executive Carly Fiorina, neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.) may struggle to raise anywhere close to the tens of millions they are likely to need to compete in such a crowded and cash-heavy field.","812","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"
"Money isn’t determinative in picking Republican presidential nominees. If it was, then-Sen. Phil Gramm (Tex.) would have been the party’s 1996 nominee and Romney would have been the standard-bearer in 2008. But, as a general rule, fundraising prowess is seen as a proxy for viability. And in a field this large, proving viability will be harder than ever before.","813","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-republicans-a-75-million-question/2015/03/01/1cd3eca4-c050-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html"

"Hundreds of Paul fans had streamed in from across the country for the multi-day event in National Harbor, Md -- but his percentage of the vote actually dropped, to 25.7 percent, from 31 percent in 2014. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) had made a major effort, sponsoring buses that brought supporters in from Washington, D.C. to Maryland and paying entry fees for some supporters – a push that brought him a fifth-place showing. Gov. Scott Walker (R-Wis.), who drew a significant level of grassroots excitement at the conference with a strong performance in his Friday address, drew 21.4 percent of the vote, dramatically and improving on his fifth place showing last year.

"Walker, who tops many polls, made headlines for appearing to draw a parallel between his fight in 2011 against public sector unions and the challenge the United States faces in combating the Islamic State, the militant group that has taken responsibility for beheadings, burnings and other savagery.

"There has been quite a backlash against statements from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) regarding vaccinations.

"Several Republican members of Congress from the medical field have spoken out firmly for vaccination and have tried to debunk the fraudulent claims that it is linked to autism. So has the speaker of the House. Potential presidential rival Dr. Ben Carson, who criticized anti-vaccination hysteria yesterday, twisted the knife a bit more in a radio show today, declaring Paul must have been misunderstood (wink,wink) since ” I can’t imagine advocating that people who are living amongst others in our society would simply allow disease to spread because they have a philosophical disagreement.”","873","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/02/03/common-sense-on-vaccinations/"
"We are pleased but not surprised that respected conservative news outlets have weighed in as well. (NRO, for example, explains: “What Dr. Paul said [Monday], Michele Bachmann said in 2012, and Senators Obama and Clinton suggested in 2008 just isn’t true. There isn’t any reliable scientific evidence about mental downsides to vaccines. We hear a lot about ‘irresponsible political rhetoric’ — offering inaccurate information that can affect people’s personal choices and health is irresponsible, and not really political rhetoric at all.”)","874","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/02/03/common-sense-on-vaccinations/"
"What is interesting is that Richard Epstein, as he did on foreign policy, demolishes Paul’s hooey and rides to the rescue of sanity on behalf of libertarians who don’t buy the rubbish that this is all a matter of personal freedom. First, on the science he explains, “Before the measles vaccine in 1963, the death rate from measles was close to twice that from polio. Fortunately, the new vaccine turned the situation around. In 1963 and 1964, there were over 800,000 cases of measles in the United States. By 1982, vaccination had largely eliminated the disease. Measles made a modest comeback around 1990, and then fell quiescent—until the recent outbreak of measles cases at Disneyland in California, which, as it spreads, puts the issue of vaccines back on the table.” One factor in reducing immunization, he says, “is the spread, sometimes deliberate, of misinformation that overstates vaccination risks. This sentiment is often fueled by powerful suspicions that drug companies are greedy and governments corrupt. This entire episode was fueled by fraudulent studies published by Dr. Andrew Wakefield in 1998 in Lancet magazine, which twelve years later the journal eventually retracted, but only after much of the damage was done. Those studies, which had been funded in part by plaintiffs’ lawyers suing vaccine manufacturers, purported to find a (nonexistent) link between vaccines that were manufactured using a mercury-based compound, Thimerosal, and autism. Unfortunately, Lancet’s forthright retraction of the article did not quell the uneasiness about vaccines in either Britain or the United States. Indeed, it may well have fueled populist concerns of an ever-wider conspiracy among establishment figures.” So there — libertarianism does not necessitate quackery.","875","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/02/03/common-sense-on-vaccinations/"
"On a constitutional level, Paul and others claiming the “right” not to immunize are also on shaky ground. Epstein reviews the applicable case law and confirms, “The blunt truth is that even libertarians and other defenders of small government should support the basic constitutional framework that gives public officials extensive powers to control against infection and disease by devices such as quarantine and vaccination. Apart from the forced vaccination of compromised individuals, it is difficult to carve out some enduring constitutional island of individual rights from the general principle of state control. The weak constitutional system does not mean that nothing else should be done.” And he praises efforts to blunt “bloated parental fears of adverse reactions to standard vaccines.”","876","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/02/03/common-sense-on-vaccinations/"
"Epstein underscores several points. First, libertarians do not all reflexively resort to crackpot theories. Unfortunately, Paul does (whether it is the origins of World War II, Vice President Dick Cheney’s motives for supporting the Iraq War, or vaccinations). Second, limited government, to paraphrase Justice Robert Jackson and others, is not a suicide pact. Public health, protection from foreign enemies and keeping civil order all fall into that category. Third, maybe libertarians should draft Epstein to run instead of Paul; their ideology would be immeasurably aided by a spokesman who does not discard facts and common sense.","877","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/02/03/common-sense-on-vaccinations/"

Walker.","914","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-ben-carson-bashes-obama-many-blacks-see-a-heros-legacy-fade/2015/05/02/b9ce53c8-e850-11e4-9767-6276fc9b0ada_story.html"

"Carson has also raised money to refurbish libraries in nearly 150 of the country’s poorest schools. A Detroit public school was named for him, as was a medical school in Nigeria.

"That all changed after his appearance at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast. It was the second time Carson was invited to speak at the event. The first time, in 1997, he made quips about the unfairness of HMOs. But this time, he went further. With repeated references to his tendency to be politically incorrect and offend the “PC police,” he offered an alternative view of health-care reform in which people would simply have private accounts to pay for their own care with pre-tax income.

"The highly skilled neurosurgeon is, by most traditional measures, a less-than-skilled presidential candidate. On stage he speaks softly and can seem long-winded, sometimes sleepy. He is the same way when he moves through crowds. And when he talks to the press.

"His message rests on an appeal to small-government solutions to structural inequities, which he says will spur a culture of individual responsibility. His made-for-TV life story of rising from an impoverished childhood in Detroit to the top of the surgical field made him a hero in the black community long before his National Prayer Breakfast challenge to President Obama made him a conservative political icon.

"Many political strategists walked away from last week’s Republican debate assuming Carson had not landed any breakout moments — not that he had much time to. In two hours on stage, he spoke for just six minutes and 30 seconds, slightly more than half of Donald Trump’s 11-minute total.

"Nonetheless, he captured viewers’ attention: Carson was the runaway social media star of the race’s first faceoff.

And despite a lack of fireworks or feuds on stage, he generated the most discussion on Facebook of any candidate but Trump, according to internal analytics provided to The Washington Post by Zignal Labs.

"The ""it"" here boils down to this: Carson, a black man and by all accounts a brilliant neurosurgeon, overcame all manner of disadvantage to become one of the nation's leading medical minds and now presidential candidates. He did not let poverty -- or, most of all, a burdensome set of distracting worries and excuses about white America's minimal-to-nonexistent racism -- stand in his way. By sheer will, determination and perseverance, he is the man and now the retired doctor and presidential candidate that he is today.

This view largely rejects the idea that social structures and institutions -- the tax code, schools, health care, jobs, policing, transportation options and even food choices -- have helped some Americans and stand in the way of others.

"We have delved before into the question of birth-control pioneer Margaret Sanger, eugenics and her attitude about African-Americans, during the 2012 election season when Herman Cain made similar remarks suggesting Planned Parenthood targets blacks.

"Carson’s remarks are less inflammatory than Cain’s, but the implication is similar: The claim is that Sanger (1879-1966), who founded what is now Planned Parenthood, was racist and Planned Parenthood thus has a deliberate policy of trying to “control” the black population by placing “most of their clinics in black neighborhoods.” Carson, a neurosurgeon, also added a Nazi connection: “Look and see what many people in Nazi Germany thought about her.”","1068","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"

"Starting in 1916, Sanger’s clinics at first were aimed mainly at poor immigrant women.

"Hajo found that in the 1916-1939 period, white activists were more likely to exclude African Americans from clinics, rather than include them. There were some half-hearted efforts to create African American clinics, but white activists actually gave little or no assistance. “Whatever the activists’ personal beliefs about race may have been, there was no grand program to exterminate nonwhites or the poor,” Hajo concluded.","1073","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"

"At one point, in 1934, she even crafted a proposed law that included this provision: “Feeble-minded persons, habitual congenital criminals, those afflicted with inheritable disease, and others found biologically unfit by authorities qualified judge should be sterilized or, in cases of doubt, should be so isolated as to prevent the perpetuation of their afflictions by breeding.” Sanger said she wanted “to give certain dysgenic groups in our population their choice of segregation or sterilization,” which some have interpreted as a reference to concentration camps.","1080","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"

"Yet one of the most thorough looks at the connection between American eugenicists and Germany Nazis, “The Nazi Connection,” by German professor Stefan Kuehl, makes no mention of Sanger (though Stoddard is featured).

"“She was very positive about eugenically motivated sterilization,” Kuehl said in an e-mail. But he said “the typical mistake is linking eugenics in general too closely to Nazi race policy.

These are gongenital feeble-mindedness; schizophrenia, circular insanity; heredity epilepsy; hereditary chorea (Huntington’s); hereditary blindness or deafness; grave hereditary bodily deformity and chronic alcoholism,” she said. “The rights of the individual could be equally well safeguarded here, but in no case should the rights of society, or which he or she is a member, be disregarded.”","1087","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"
"Yet in 1939, she wrote that before Hitler came to power, “I was one of the few Americans who joined the Anti-Nazi Committee and gave money, my name and any influence I had with writers and others, to combat Hitler’s rise to power in Germany.” She added that “my three books were destroyed [burned] and have not been allowed to circulate in Germany.”","1088","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"

"While the two previous issues relate to interpretation of history—about which people can disagree—at least here we can deal with hard facts. Are “most” of Planned Parenthood’s clinics in black neighborhoods?","1090","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"
"The available data, from both sources that oppose and favor abortion rights, says this is false.","1091","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"
"A 2011 report by Life Dynamics, which opposes abortion, used Census data to determine the African-American and Hispanic population of each zipcode where Planned Parenthood has an office. The report was intended to show that the abortion clinics are placed mostly in areas where black residents exceed the average black population of the state.","1092","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"
"But when you look closely at the data, it turns out that there are only about 110 locations (out of about 800) where the black population exceeds 25 percent of the overall population. That certainly does not support the claim that “most” clinics are in “black neighborhoods.”","1093","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"
"Separately, in 2011, the Guttmacher Institute surveyed all abortion providers (about 1,700), including Planned Parenthood, and found that 60 percent are in majority-white neighborhoods — and that fewer than one in ten abortion providers are located in neighborhoods where more than half of the residents are black. The statistics did not change when the numbers were adjusted for nearly 600 providers that conduct more than 400 abortions a year.","1094","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"
"Still, there is clear evidence that blacks are more likely to get an abortion than whites. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the abortion rate for black women is almost four times higher than for white. The reasons for this disparity are not well understood, though some researchers cite economic issues; the location of abortion clinics does not appear to be a factor.","1095","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"
"Taken together, Carson’s remarks suggest that Planned Parenthood, as a result of deliberate policies set in place by its founder, targets blacks for abortions. But the evidence shows that a relatively small percentage of clinics are in black-majority neighborhoods — or even in neighborhoods where blacks are more than one-quarter of the population.","1096","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"
"Sanger’s embrace of eugenics — and her statements in support of sterilization — may be abhorrent today. Her attitudes on race may appear antiquated. But there is little evidence that she targeted blacks for “elimination” or embraced the Nazis, who took eugenics to a horrific extreme.","1097","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"
"Some readers may believe the historical record is even more damning for Sanger. But the data on where clinics are located is pretty clear. Mixing all of these elements together, with little basis in fact, earns Carson Four Pinocchios.","1098","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/18/carsons-claim-that-planned-parenthood-targets-blacks-to-control-that-population/"

"Ben Carson has made some big claims about abortion, Planned Parenthood and one of its founders, Margaret Sanger, in the last few days. If you haven't heard them, watch this video.","August 18","1105","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"

"These ideas are not new. In fact, they have been a part of a set of ideas circulated in both antiabortion and black-nationalist circles for decades. And, it is a set of claims raised by Herman Cain -- a contender for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination who, like Carson, is also black -- while contemplating his White House run.","1107","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"
"Now, here's the part that might surprise you: They are ideas that contain at least a kernel of truth and in some cases the technical truth, along with links to an ugly-but-real history which Carson used to draw some provocative conclusions. Only one of them is baseless. Still, the Washington Post's own Fact Checker blog found that Carson's claims, when taken together, could boast an only tenuous connection to the facts and are, on balance, false.","1108","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"

"Carson's comments, made without some critical context about race and reproduction, have been widely condemned outside of the GOP's antiabortion circles. Planned Parenthood has condemned Carson's comments and described them as a misleading attempt at race-baiting. At the same time, Republicans have lauded Carson's comments. The rather uncomfortable fact that Carson -- a candidate on record arguing that race is of no import -- has ignited a conversation that is very much about race, sex and reproduction hasn't stopped that.","1110","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"
"A big reason for the apparent dancing around the details on the left and the right is that black women, childbearing and abortion have long served as rallying points for those who want to slash social services or mobilize Americans around the idea that their tax obligations are unnecessarily swollen. It's a sensitive set of subjects, to say the least.","1111","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"

"Now, race-related abortion data is available for only just more than half of states. Still, even without many states in the abortion data, abortions outpace the leading causes of death for both black and Latino Americans.","1116","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"

"However, the reasons for the pattern the CDC data reveal are complex. Researchers at the CDC and the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion-rights think tank, have identified poverty, health insurance coverage rates, and inconsistent and sometimes nonexistent contraception access and use as three primary causes of elevated abortion rates among black and Latina women. They all contribute to unintended pregnancies, the leading reason women cite for having an abortion. (The Affordable Care Act has mandated that most health-insurance plans provide contraceptive coverage without a co-pay since 2012. Carson adamantly objects to Obamacare because of the control he says it attempts to exert over Americans' lives.)","1118","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"

"Again, there's evidence to show that Carson's assessment of Sanger is correct but incomplete. Sanger certainly said and wrote things during her lifetime (1879-1966) that support or endorse the idea that certain people should not reproduce. And she founded the organization that eventually became Planned Parenthood.","1121","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"
"When Sanger took up the highly controversial and illegal cause of making contraceptives available in the early 1900s, she aligned herself with the one wing of the overwhelmingly male-dominated medical profession that embraced contraception and its goals, said Johanna Schoen, a Rutgers University historian who wrote the 2006 book, ""Choice and Coercion."" Most of these people were eugenicists, or people who believed in ""improving"" the human race through controlling who breeds and who doesn't.","1122","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"
"Schoen said Sanger used some of their language and ideas to give her work a valuable, reputation-boosting association with medicine and ""science.""","1123","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"
"Sanger's ""Negro project"" -- one part of her larger contraception campaign -- aimed to bring contraceptive options to black women. But she also did similar work with white women.","1124","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"
"At the time, a dozen or more pregnancies, deliveries, miscarriages and children were relatively common. All of that was very rough on women, deleterious to the health of mothers and children born in rapid succession and not so great for family finances.","1125","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"
"Critics of contraception and its widespread availability claimed then (as they do today) that this would encourage promiscuity. During the early years of Sanger's work, contraception opponents also claimed it would limit the size of the nation's ""desirable"" white, Protestant population since other groups were too dumb to use contraception correctly, Schoen told me.","1126","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"
"Again, eugenic ideas were, in some ways, mainstream and ultimately prompted forced sterilization laws in about half the states. These programs targeted poor and unmarried white mothers, blacks, Latinos and the disabled. Some of these programs remained active well into the 1970s.","1127","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"
"But there's also evidence that Sanger was probably more than an opportunist who aligned with eugenicists for practical purposes. She was, in fact, an enthusiastic supporter of the idea that blacks were inferior and that their reproduction should be limited, said Nicole Rousseau, a sociologist at Kent State University who wrote the 2009 book ""Black Woman's Burden: Commodifying Black Reproduction.""","1128","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"
"Once during a radio interview, Sanger said blacks, the disabled and other groups should be marooned and left to die on an island, Rousseau told me.","1129","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"

"History informs the way we all think and behave. At least 100,000 black and Latina women were sterilized as a result of state sterilization programs, Rousseau told me. Some of these women were told that they needed other procedures so that doctors could sterilize them or were sterilized against their will while under anesthesia for other reasons. That happened to Fannie Lou Hamer, a civil rights activist who advocated against the pill because of her understandable suspicions that it was a form of chemical sterilization.","1131","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"
"What happened to Hamer was so common she reportedly gave it a name: the ""Mississippi Appendectomy."" Other women were coerced by social workers who threatened to discontinue welfare assistance. In Puerto Rico in the 1950s and 60s, the U.S. government took similar steps sterilizing thousands of women without their consent. And as recently as the early 2000s, at least one state operated a program that paid teens who were wards of the state to use a form of implanted (and reversible) contraception, Rousseau found in her research.","1132","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"
"That history, along with other better-known medical experiments, has fueled generational suspicion about medicine, and about birth control in particular, in some families -- especially families of color -- said Jennifer L. Hochschild, a professor of government at Harvard University.","1133","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"
"In the 1960s and '70s, black-nationalist organizations including the Black Panther Party often pushed the idea that birth control and abortions were part of an effort to minimize the black population. In more recent decades, antiabortion organizations, including those led by white Americans and those led by black Americans, have advanced the idea that abortions represent a form of attempted genocide.","1134","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/18/ben-carsons-focus-on-black-abortions-margaret-sanger-and-eugenics-explained/"

"Presidential primaries, particularly ones with as many candidates as there are on the Republican side this time, go through many phases. Though the “Holy cow, Donald Trump!” phase is not nearly over, we may now be seeing a simultaneous increase in the attention and interest given to some candidates who haven’t gotten much until now, particularly outsiders like Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina. And in all likelihood, they’ll rise and then quickly fall just as their predecessors did.","August 14","1166","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/14/the-fleeting-allure-of-the-outsider-candidate/"
"The proximate cause is last week’s Fox News debates, where these two were judged by many to have done particularly well, Fiorina in the “kids’ table” debate and Carson in the primetime one. Three polls this week show Carson moving into second or third place in Iowa, and a couple of polls have put Fiorina approaching double digits. That may not sound so great, but it’s a big improvement over the 1 or 2 percent she has been pulling, and in a field of 17 it puts her near the top tier. So here’s what’s likely to happen now: They’ll start getting a whole new level of examination, which will make them look less appealing than they were when nobody knew much of anything about them.","1167","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/14/the-fleeting-allure-of-the-outsider-candidate/"
"This should surprise no one, because something similar happens whenever there’s a big field.

"Carson and Fiorina are getting that scrutiny now, with articles in major publications like this one suddenly appearing (see here and here). But what’s likely to become clear is that neither one of them is even remotely qualified to be president. One is a businesswoman whose singular accomplishment was negotiating a lovely golden parachute for herself after a disastrous run as head of a technology company, and who then ran a dreadful, losing campaign for a Senate seat. The other was a well-known surgeon but has zero political experience and a whole series of lunatic ideas about both politics and the world in general (among other things, Carson is a young-Earth creationist who thinks evolution is a myth).","1170","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/14/the-fleeting-allure-of-the-outsider-candidate/"
"What usually happens to these kind of outsider candidates is that they have a couple of compelling moments, then wilt under the increased pressure of the daily campaign. Don’t forget that in 2012, the polling lead in the Republican primary was at various points held by Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain and Rick Santorum (Michele Bachmann, though the subject of brief fascination, never actually pulled into the lead), in addition to the guy who actually won. All of them, even those like Gingrich who had plenty of experience, eventually fell. Running for president is not a game for amateurs.","1171","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/14/the-fleeting-allure-of-the-outsider-candidate/"
"The reason these kind of outsider candidates emerge in the first place is the shared myth that not only is running for president something an amateur could do well, but so is being president. When you ask someone like Ben Carson why he ought to have that job despite never having worked in government or politics, he has a ready answer:","1172","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/14/the-fleeting-allure-of-the-outsider-candidate/"
"Although I’m sure it gets applause, this line is, as Antonin Scalia would say, pure applesauce. Imagine if Ben Carson were about to operate on your child’s brain and he came to you in the waiting room and said, “By the way, this is my friend Joe. He’s not a physician — actually, he’s a VP of sales at Procter & Gamble — but he’s really able to think. He can look at the facts and utilize those facts to make appropriate decisions. He’s going to be leading your child’s surgery today.” You’d think that both Joe and Carson had lost their minds, and you’d find another doctor.","1173","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/14/the-fleeting-allure-of-the-outsider-candidate/"
"I’m sure Fiorina says something similar, that her time in business means she understands the economy and knows about leadership. But that’s equally bogus — even just on the economy (which is only a portion of what the president does), setting federal government policy in all its complexity is nothing like figuring out how to make people pay 40 bucks for a printer cartridge.","1174","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/14/the-fleeting-allure-of-the-outsider-candidate/"
"The outsider candidates lose because at some point that all becomes clear, through a combination of their own missteps and the gradual realization among voters that electing them would be a terrible idea. Does all that apply to Donald Trump, too? He’s obviously a unique case, with his combination of preexisting celebrity, experience as an entertainer and positively epic shamelessness. But the answer is yes — it’ll just take longer for him to fall. For candidates like Carson and Fiorina, it won’t take long at all.","1175","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/14/the-fleeting-allure-of-the-outsider-candidate/"

"A large number of New York's psychics, including the three with whom I spoke, work out of what seem to be their homes. Astrologer Angel Eyedealism's (pronounced like ""idealism"") is a third-floor walk-up in the East Village, where we sat at a counter separating her kitchen and living room.","1222","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"

"The methodology As Eyedealism describes it, astrology is a ""pseudoscience based on two exact sciences"" -- those being astronomy and geometry. She uses software which can display where a variety of celestial bodies were in the sky over a location at a particular moment in time -- either in the past, particularly at birth, or in the future. She then interprets what their orientation means.","1224","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"

"It's very complex, plotting 12 houses (the inner circle numbered 1 through 12) in four quadrants, and identifying four significant cusps (transitions between houses). Each house has meaning (the ninth, for example, is the house of politics, as well as some other things), each quadrant has meaning, and the celestial bodies represented on the chart -- which travel around it, counter-clockwise -- all have meaning, too. What Eyedealism does is interpret the overlap and relationships of all of it.","1227","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"
"The most important cusp is the one at the top (between houses 9 and 10). It's the M.C., short for medium coeli, or ""middle of the sky."" That cusp represents fame and recognition. The three houses leading up to it -- the seventh, eighth and ninth -- are the third quadrant, what Eyedealism called the ""rise to success"" quadrant since they are the approach to the M.C.","1228","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"
"The two most important celestial bodies (as I perhaps incorrectly understood it) are Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter represents wealth and expansion powered by good luck. Saturn represents success, too -- but the hard way or the sneaky way. (Eyedealism calls it the ""Debbie Downer"" house.) The theory is that those planets and where they are located can tell you the future.","1229","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"

"Hillary Clinton We started with Hillary Clinton, for whom Eyedealism had good news. ""Hillary has Jupiter in the ninth house, the house of politics, now, and it is heading to conjunct her M.C.,"" Eyedealism said. ""I'm getting goosebumps.""","1232","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"
"Translation: Jupiter, the good luck planet, is in Clinton's rise-to-success quadrant -- and in the political house -- on its way to conjuncting (intersecting with) the future. And it gets better for Clinton. Her Jupiter already conjuncted Pluto (""so she has luck and power behind her"") and will conjunct Saturn (""so she's serious""). Or: ""She has luck and a mother[expletive] plan,"" as Eyedealism succinctly put it. That good news has been building for the three years it took to get there.","1233","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"
"But since the planets keep moving, and since we were looking at the skies right now, I asked how long Clinton could expect all these wonderful things to stay so wonderful. Jupiter, it turns out, will stay in her 10th house for a year after this fall. But all that luck won't evaporate a year from this fall (that is, right before Election Day), because she can keep building on the luck.","1234","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"
"A few minor details: Clinton does want to watch her personality, though, because she has Saturn (Debbie Downer) in her personality house, Eyedealism explained. She's private and a bit paranoid (lots of Scorpio placements). She was born to speak to the public (Mercury conjuncts her ascendant). Luck, power and organization are on her side, but she has to clean up her socializing persona.","1235","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"

"Bush has one favorable point. ""His natal Vulcanus, the asteroid of strength and power, closely conjucts the M.C."" -- meaning that strength and power are in his future, although Vulcanus is not nearly as big a deal as, say, Jupiter.

"Everyone else While astrology affords a lot of detail, there is a catch. Since lots of people were born in Chicago on the same day as Hillary Clinton but have not served as United States senators or twice sought their party's nomination for the presidency, you need as much refinement as possible in order to get the best picture for why their lives might be different. So Eyedealism includes birth time in her assessments. But the birth times of minor candidates -- the Vulcanuses of 2016, if you will -- are not readily available online. Clinton's is, Bush's is -- and Donald Trump's is, too, because he's a celebrity.","1241","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"
"So, hey, let's look at Donald Trump. ""I think I sold him a lollipop in a nightclub,"" Eyedealism said, somewhat off-topic. ""Mr. Fuji's Tropicana. It was 1992. He was very charming.

"Returning to his astrology, Eyedealism announced: ""He has Caput on his M.C.!"" Meaning, he has nothing, I asked? No, Caput is ""a demon star,"" one of the eyes of Taurus, which can be ""fed"" dark, edgy art, music and politics to earn wealth. Picasso had Caput on his M.C., she said; same with Johnny Depp.","1243","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"
"Trump also has Jupiter in his house of money, so he has a lot of cash coming in and out (from himself?). He has Regulus on his ascendant, which explains his big hair for a reason I didn't follow. And also, Trump has a trine.","1244","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"
"""Oh. Wow wow wow wow,"" Eyedealism said, staring through the pink darkness into her bright screen. ""He has an exact trine between Uranus and Jupiter in his chart!"" A trine is a good thing, and it means (as best I can tell) that objects appear at the same degree four houses apart. (So they neatly split the circle into a third.) Trump has Uranus in his 10th house -- career -- at 17 degrees, and Jupiter in the second house -- money -- also at 17 degrees.","1245","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"

I had to ask, then, what about all the other people who were born at the same time in the same place -- New York City. ""Remember, not everyone lives out the potential of their chart,"" Eyedealism replied. ""We have choices."" Some people who could have been Donald Trump made choices not to be.

Each card has its own meaning, as do the suits and the figures.","1284","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/what-three-psychics-told-us-will-happen-in-the-2016-election/"

"The surging candidacies of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are fueled by people’s anger with the status quo and desire for authenticity in political leaders.

"Let's dispatch with Trump quickly: In Quinnipiac's new national survey the Bouffant Bruiser continues to Godzilla his way through the Republican field. What's interesting here is the undercard, where Jeb Bush slips into the single digits. In Real Clear Politics' polling average, Bush is now in third -- a position he hasn't been in since last October, save for a brief Scott Walkerenaissance late last month. He can thank Ben Carson for that new position: Carson moves to 12 percent support in the new poll, matching what he had in Fox News's poll right after the first debate.","1353","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/27/donald-trumps-republican-lead-is-only-7-points-smaller-than-hillary-clintons-democratic-one/"

"The day belonged to the conservative Texas senator and 2016 presidential candidate, who commanded more media attention than any GOP contender who has never had his own reality TV show, according to our analytics partner Zignal Labs. Cruz’s call to defund Planned Parenthood stoked the conservative netroots. Cruz himself drove the social-media chatter with a series of widely-circulated tweets:","1372","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/07/29/ted-cruz-wins-twitter-with-call-to-defund-planned-parenthood/"

"The Planned Parenthood story is proving a boon for conservatives like Cruz. Iowa freshman Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) filed a bill in Congress last night to completely block any federal money from going to the group. It came at the end of a day that saw the release of a third undercover video by an anti-abortion rights group. Sen.

"“Populism” has had many iterations. In the 19th century, populists were against the gold standard and for the Grange. In the early 20th century, populists or “progressives” busted trusts and backed workers’ rights. George Wallace and the anti-segregationists in the 1960s thought of themselves as populists championing poor whites.","June 14","1382","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"
"In recent years populists on the right, embodied by the tea party, voiced suspicion of immigration, free trade and Wall Street. But in part because the tea party flourished in red states, it also took on a cultural meaning. “Populists” became anti-gay marriage, anti-urban and even anti-intellectual. They delighted in associated with rural, religious icons on cable TV who trashed liberal sentiments. They associated with talk radio show hosts, no matter how outlandish or uninformed, and most of all it adopted a cult of victimhood.","1383","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"
"But populism does not have to be any of those things. Populists can be economically sophisticated, urbane and witty, cognizant of barriers that minorities and women face. They can be optimistic, worldly and global in outlook. They can be kind and calm in tone.","1384","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"
"In essence, the battle between these two types of populism defines the GOP presidential race and the conservative movement. The first group, rural populists, have been in style of late. Ivy League graduates claim alienation from liberal elites. You get candidates and pundits who surely know better telling the country they can defy the Supreme Court’s rulings and return to the days of trade barriers. This group harkens to a bygone era and views modernity with dread and suspicion.","1385","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"
"Republicans have become confused, I think, associating populism with country music, opposition to gay marriage (aren’t gay couples also little guys and gals battling the state for recognition?) and, yes, a certain know-nothingism. It comes across as angry and its proponents as victims. It indulges in conspiracy theories and flat-out falsehoods. To one degree or another, Dr. Ben Carson, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum fall into this category. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) tries to mix this strain of populism with libertarianism, which accounts both for some logical inconsistencies and a heightened antagonism toward domestic and foreign security apparatuses. The Ivy League-educated Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is trying to fit into this club, which necessitates significant flip-flops on such issues as Common Core.","1386","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"
"This group, in tone and geography, is self-limiting and, in all likelihood, incapable of electing a president from its ranks. You can’t sneer at half the country, pose yourself at its victim, eschew modern American culture and values and hope to get an electoral majority that must incorporate states like Ohio, New Hampshire, Colorado and Florida.","1387","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"
"But for the first time you have a group of Republicans who take populism literally – a movement to boost the little guy. It does not require one to ignore the laws of economics or to become paranoid about all government. It sets an agenda aimed at upward mobility and neither ignores inequality nor adopts redistributionist policies. It goes after corporate welfare and crony capitalism. It understands the need to make American workers competitive with the global market, declining to pretend globalization can be halted. Before the 2016 prelims got underway, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich — hardly uniform in ideology — took up the cause of the underdog.","1388","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"
"Among the 2016 GOP contenders, we see this alternate form of populism. As former Texas governor Rick Perry put it, “Capitalism is not corporatism. It is not a guarantee of reward without risk. It is not about Wall Street at the expense of Main Street.” In his second presidential run he comes to the race, yes, as a Texan, but one who travels the globe, boasts about state reduction in greenhouse gases and does not allow his concern for border security to morph into antagonism toward foreigners.","1389","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"
"Populism need not be provincialism. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), from one of the most culturally diverse states, gets this. His musical taste is eclectic, his foreign policy is internationalist, his domestic agenda is about creating opportunity. And his family’s story is the triumph of the little guy – an immigrant. He doesn’t try talkin’ like someone who’s been livin’ in the South.","1390","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"
"Carly Fiorina is perhaps the most vivid example of a populist who is neither provincial nor economically illiterate nor rooted in rural America. But her message is pure populism – small businesses are being crushed by regulation, the government has too much power and takes too much money, and big bureaucracies are ruining capitalism and innovation. And to boot, she is obviously a person of deep faith, yet she does not adopt the pose of besieged Christian or a warrior against gay marriage.","1391","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"
"As for Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, their success depends on their ability to identify with the Perry-Rubio-Fiorina brand of populism. Each has his own challenges.","1392","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"
"Bush must find a way to refute the perception that he is a person of privilege and of wealth who does not see how hard the “little guy” has it. He must bring his considerable policy acumen down from 30,000 feet and relate it to the lives of people struggling to make ends meet. And he must show how faith and his life experience apart from the Bush extended family, not his last name, defines him. He can’t pretend as Hillary Clinton does that he is “broke.” He has to make his fight about shaping an America in which privilege, zip code, country of origin and family do not determine your fate. That is a very tricky message, but we’ve had wealthy presidents (JFK, TR and FDR and Ronald Reagan, too) successfully extol the dignity of the common man.","1393","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"
"Walker’s challenge is to define his Midwestern populism in a way that does not put him in the Huckabee-Carson-Cruz camp. He cannot adopt economic policies that ignore globalization or take a stance on social issues that casts him as intolerant. He cannot identify purely with red America and be merely an opponent of “special interests in Washington, D.C.” He’s a son of a preacher, with no college degree, comfortable on a motorcycle — but he needs to be a restrained populist, one who reveals himself to be as intellectually sophisticated and culturally current as any opponent.","1394","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"
"In sum, “populism” can be an appropriate antidote to the Republican image as the party of the rich and big business. But it must be a populism that expands the GOP’s appeal and does not narrow it.","1395","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/14/what-kind-of-populism/"

"Walker struggled for more than a week to say whether he believes birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, should be repealed.

From his opening statement, the Sunshine State senator gave crisp and compelling answers that made him the clear winner of the 9 p.m. gathering.

Former Florida governor Jeb Bush could learn from that example. As for Bush, he did okay. And on the “okay” scale, he was at the high end. Gov.

"Criminal justice reform is the one issue that just about everyone seems to agree on right now.

"Oddly though, criminal justice is all but absent on the websites most of the major contenders for the 2016 election. I just reviewed the sites for all of the announced candidates. (I know, I’m a glutton for punishment.) The first thing that struck me odd is just how little discussion there is of any issue on the candidates’ sites. Everyone has a bio, links to donate, links to volunteer, and a schedule. Some sites list the candidate’s major pieces of legislation and accomplishments in office, which does at least give some indication of what issues are important and where they stand on those issues. But there’s very little in the way of specific policy proposals, priorities, and positions. Most seem to be running on their personalities.","1453","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"But even within the relatively light coverage of actual issues, criminal justice lags far behind. Only a handful of candidates address it at all. On the GOP side, there’s much discussion of ISIS, Iran, Israel, and of course Obama. Among the Democrats, there’s language about getting money out of politics (good luck!), income inequality, and health care. But for all the talk lately of policing, prisons, marijuana legalization, and so on, these issues still haven’t penetrated presidential politics. Basically there’s Martin O’Malley and Rand Paul, and then there’s everyone else.","1454","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"This isn’t a review of the candidates’ records or a critique of their positions on these issues (although I’ll do some of that). It’s more of an evaluation of how (and if) they address criminal justice on their campaign sites. So here we go.","1455","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"Martin O’Malley","1456","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"By far and away, the most thorough, thoughtful, and detailed analysis of criminal justice issues is on the website of Martin O’Malley. “Criminal Justice Reform” is the first item listed under O’Malley’s “Issues” page. On the criminal justice page itself, O’Malley lays out several core principles, with key policies he’d push for each.","1457","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"Under “Build Trust in Law Enforcement,” O’Malley proposes expanding and mandating data reporting from police agencies for “police-involved shootings, custodial deaths, discourtesy complaints, and use of excessive force.” The site adds that, “This data should be centralized in a universal database and made publicly available, allowing communities to observe trends and develop policy responses when necessary.”","1458","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"O’Malley also proposes a national use of force standard, which he’ll then try to require each state to adapt. He proposes using the incentive of federal grants to encourage a variety of programs aimed at curbing common problems in policing, including, “undergoing racial bias training and crisis de-escalation training; establishing internal accountability measures to track and review civilian complaints and address officer misconduct; and creating and empowering civilian review boards to independently monitor and audit policing cases.” He also promises to work with law enforcement groups, civil liberties advocates, and technology experts to come up with national standards for the use of police body cameras.","1459","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"Additionally, O’Malley wants to reform asset forfeiture laws to put an emphasis on public safety (as opposed to providing revenue for police agencies). He promises to encourage states to pass laws requiring independent investigations of police shootings, and most interestingly, he proposes to strengthen the Justice Department’s civil rights division by reducing the standard required for them to investigate abuses.","1460","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"O’Malley’s next principle is called “Increase Fairness in Sentencing.” Here, he proposes eliminating the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity entirely, reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule II drug, eliminating mandatory minimums for low-level drug offenders, and giving judges and prosecutors more discretion on sentencing for more serious crimes. He also promises to push for abolishing the federal death penalty.","1461","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"O’Malley then offers a number of proposals to reduce recidivism and promote successful reentry for former prisoners, including job training programs, and suggests reauthorizing and expanding the 2008 Second Chance Act, which provides funding for “housing and benefits, substance abuse treatment, mentoring, education, and job training” for recently released prisoners. He wants to re-fund Pell Grants for inmates (as the Obama administration recently did), dramatically reduce solitary confinement, and ban solitary for juveniles.","1462","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"Up next, O’Malley looks at restoring the rights of former prisoners. He proposes a federal “fair chance” policy that would prohibit the federal government and its contractors from denying employment based solely on an applicant’s prior criminal record. He suggests permanent seals or expungement of juvenile records, restoring voting rights to felons who have served their sentences, and ending the federal ban on public assistance programs for people with drug records. He also promises to face out private prisons at the federal level.","1463","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"Under the heading “Reinvest to Ensure Justice,” O’Malley proposes programs to invest in drug treatment, mental health, and provide better training for law enforcement to deal with people in crisis. He offers policies to address the school-to-prison pipeline, the shortage of public defenders, immigration detention centers, and reforming the troubled Custom and Border Patrol.","1464","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"Lastly, O’Malley outlines what you might call a holistic approach to reform by including several policies that he believes will improve income inequality, like raising the minimum wage, strengthening the power of unions, student loan forgiveness, child care, and immigration reform.","1465","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"Whatever you think of these policies — I agree with many; I have some problems with others — it’s clear that O’Malley has both given a lot of thought to criminal justice reform and plans to make the issue a key part of his campaign. It almost reads like a wish list of policies reform groups have been advocating for years. The section on policing in particular shows that O’Malley has followed the national debate closely, and has a deep and nuanced understanding of the issues at stake.","1466","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"If anything, O’Malley’s policies may be a bit too ambitious. Most criminal justice policy is made at the state and local level. O’Malley could do a lot to change how federal laws are enforced, but with the states, he’ll be restricted mostly to encouraging best practices or trying to incentivize reform by offering or threatening to withhold federal money. There’s also the matter of how O’Malley would get these policies passed. If he plans to promote policies that would strengthen public service unions, for example, he’ll also be giving more power to the already-powerful police unions, nearly all of which will almost certainly oppose nearly every policing reform on O’Malley’s website. I’d also like to see O’Malley’s position on Byrne Grants, federally-funded multi-jurisdictional anti-drug and anti-gang task forces (which have a long history of problems) and police militarization.","1467","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"And finally, O’Malley took a lot of criticism earlier this year for some the policies he implemented as mayor of Baltimore, including a policy of mass arrests that critics say created a lot of the same problems O’Malley addresses on his campaign website. It would be helpful to include a section in which he explains those policies, whether or not he still thinks they were good ideas, if he’d encourage other mayors to adopt similar policies, and how those policies jibe with his larger themes of fairness, second chances, redemption, and the destructiveness of a criminal record.","1468","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"But given just how far out in front of the other candidates O’Malley is, these are minor quibbles. O’Malley demonstrates an understanding and appreciation of these issues on a level like no other candidate save perhaps for Rand Paul. Agree or disagree, he has certainly opened the discussion.","1469","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"Rand Paul","1470","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"Paul has disappointed some of his libertarian supporters of late with a rightward lurch on issues from Iran to immigration to putting a high priority on defunding Planned Parenthood. Still, no other candidate from the two major parties can match his legislative record on criminal justice reform. As I’ve pointed out here before, Paul’s interest in these issues seems genuine, not opportunistic. Yes, Paul has taken some criticism for his high-profile visits to black colleges, a few of which resulted in some awkward moments. But Paul also made the case for restoring the voting rights of nonviolent felons at an Iowa GOP convention. Telling a crowd of conservative, overwhelmingly white Republicans in the first caucus state that we need to restore voting rights to a population of disproportionately black people drug offenders who are likely to vote Democratic isn’t political opportunism, it’s leadership.","1471","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"
"On his website, Paul briefly explains why criminal justice reform has become a priority for him, noting the lessons he learned after trips to Ferguson, Detroit, Atlanta, and Chicago. He doesn’t get into specific policies he’d push as president, but he does list the bills he has already sponsored. Those include:","1472","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"

"Jim Webb has been talking about criminal justice reform since his days in the Senate. In that he actually proposed reform legislation while he was a senator, Webb has also done more “walking the walk” than any candidate but Paul. So it’s not surprising that the issue is one of the five highlighted on Webb’s campaign site. What is surprising is that it only gets a paragraph, and that paragraph contains no policy proposals and no positions on reform bills now pending in Congress. Webb basically just makes a broad, non-specific argument that things are bad and need to be changed. That’s unfortunate, because he has been much more thoughtful and interesting about these issues in the past.","1476","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"

And despite Perry’s ugly grandstanding on the death penalty in the 2012 primaries, he does have some accomplishments to tout. Perry helped implement drug courts in Texas for first time offenders, an imperfect approach that is nonetheless better than incarceration. He also notes that the policy was about treating addiction as a disease, not as a crime — at least for first-timers. (Of course, the vast majority of people who use illicit drugs aren’t addicted and never get that way.) Perry also boasts about closing prisons in Texas without opening new ones. The very fact that a GOP primary candidate would find this something worth bragging about is a good indication of how much the debate has shifted.","1479","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"

I finally did a Google search for “incarceration” on the URL for Sanders’s site and found a a blog post about a speech he gave in Des Moines and a video and the transcript of a speech he gave to the National Urban League. The latter includes some discussion of police militarization, racial bias, incarceration, and root causes of crime. It also includes some vague policy positions — support for body cameras, “moving away” from police militarization, opposition to private prisons, investing in community policing. But it’s still pretty vague, and you have to go through some effort to find it. Sanders also tends to talk about incarceration by lamenting how few bankers and Wall Street traders are in prison, which is more about economic populism than about reforming the courts, cops, and prisons.","1490","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/08/06/heres-what-presidential-candidates-websites-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/"

She is likely to get a boost from her performance, further embarrassing liberal critics who declared she was unfit to run for president.

Asked to disclose his information that the Mexican government was sending criminals across border repeated his assertion, but no facts. Responding to a question about sexist statements, he declared the country suffered from too much political correctness, drawing hisses when he said he wouldn’t be so nice to Megyn Kelly since he was not being so nice to him. His most egregious moments may have been his defense of a single-payer system and his insistence that he gave money to liberal Democrats who did what he told them to do.

"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) patted himself on the back for not getting along with others, speaking with excessive deliberation as if he was saying something of profound importance. Cruz mouthed platitudes about fighting the Islamic State but he gave no specifics about how he would do it.

Chris Christie touted his economic record and stuck by his tough stance on anti-terrorism, getting into a shouting match with Rand Paul and accusing him of blowing hot air while he was busy defending Americans from terrorists. He also lowered the boom on Huckabee for suggesting we can’t touch Social Security or that cutting lawmakers’ retirement benefits would solve the problem of runaway retirements. He was specific and tough on foreign policy, admonishing Rand Paul who insisted we should eliminate all foreign aid including that to Israel.

"Gov. Scott Walker cheered his own pro-life record and giving a serviceable answer on strengthening our Sunni alliances. Mike Huckabee gave a long and rambling answer on abortion, seeming to suggest a president had the authority to disregard the Supreme Court. Ben Carson seemed tentative and out of his depth, citing “tithing” as the basis for his tax code. Ohio Gov. John Kasich got in an effective tribute to inclusiveness and the need for policies to help the poor and those on the margins. In a sign have how far things have come even in the GOP, Kasich was cheered for saying he would support one of his daughters if she were gay.

"Early on the “debate” was not much of a debate, but rather a series of disconnected and discrete policy statements for much of the 90 minutes. As the evening went on and the candidates were implored to interact, the conversation sharpened. The questions were well chosen and sharply phrased, with the exception of awkward requests for the candidates to talk about whether God has given them a to do list if they become president. As a result the answers they received were — aside from Trump — generally high-minded and reasoned. That said, it did highlight Trump’s clownishness and allow serious contenders — especially Rubio, Bush, Kasich and Christie — to shine. In their closing comments the ex-governors and governors in particular were impressive in reciting their accomplishments and experience while Rubio delivered his telltale, inspirational tribute to the American dream. Along with Carly Fiorina’s superb showing in the afternoon debate their performances offered GOP voters reassurance that the party has many serious contestants.","1543","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/06/the-first-debate/"
"Donald Trump visits the Iowa Fair, gives kids helicopter rides and leads in the polls. That’s not nothing, but those events’ importance to the Iowa caucuses is greatly overrated. Trump is up against skilled opponents, a few of whom have outsider appeal and yet can opine without offending and have substantive ideas.","August 17","1544","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/17/whats-really-happening-in-iowa/"
"Trump has supporters on the ground. “The question is can they maintain the enthusiasm for that long? They are bringing in a lot of newcomers who haven’t caucused previously,” says a longtime Iowa Republican insider. “If someone is that politically inactive to begin with, their attention span for caucusing will be short. Conversely, Trump could be mounting the full Huckabee, who used organic grassroots enthusiasm to a masterful caucus upset win.”","1545","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/17/whats-really-happening-in-iowa/"
"At the other end of the spectrum is the pre-Trump favorite (now fallen to third), Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who will roll out a health-care plan tomorrow. Unfortunately, his low-key demeanor and one-note song (beating the unions) leaves him vulnerable to a devastating loss in a state he must win. “If Walker’s people are smart, they’re terrified right now,” says the Iowa insider. “No candidate – none – has lost their perch atop the Iowa polls and come back to win the Iowa caucuses. Giuliani, McCain, Thompson, Romney, Bachmann, Perry, Cain, Gingrich, Romney (again) all lost their perch and never recovered.” He and his organizers, including veterans of Huckabee and Bachmann, may be disappointed if they are hoping Walker can generate the same sort of grass-roots enthusiasm. Walker’s panic is beginning to show. He’s now defending Trump’s remarks that the real-estate tycoon learns foreign policy from Sunday talk shows. (Walker himself has both staff and outside experts to help him.) Worse, he is embracing repeal of birthright citizenship and praising Trump’s venal immigration plan. Even if he were to win Iowa, how would he win over mainstream Republicans let alone independents?","1546","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/17/whats-really-happening-in-iowa/"
"Then there are crowd favorites, such as Dr. Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina. Fiorina meanwhile continues to dazzle crowds as she expounds on foreign policy, government reform, education and job creation. If Fiorina is the thinking person’s CEO, Carson might be the Huckabee of 2016. Carson’s low-key charm and appeal to religious conservatives give him the chance, if not to win, then to do well in the caucuses, provided his organization is up to speed. “Ben Carson is the antithesis to Donald Trump,” writes Iowa Republican blogger Craig Robinson. “Both Carson and Trump draw huge crowds, both are outsiders, and both have been wildly successful in their careers, but when it comes to demeanor and the type of people they are reaching, it couldn’t be more different. That’s a good space for Carson to occupy.”","1547","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/17/whats-really-happening-in-iowa/"
"Then there is Jeb Bush. His poll numbers are stuck in single digits and it is not clear how much effort he is going to devote to Iowa. With Iowa guru David Kochel on his team, Bush is doing the legwork to organize a ground operation. It’s not clear which Bush, however, Iowans will consider on caucus night. There is the Jeb Bush of the debates and then there is the Jeb Bush who showed up at the state fair. “Bush turned things around on the soapbox. He spoke with real passion and purpose,” writes Robinson. “It was one of the rare times in which you could envision him being the nominee. After speaking for a while, Bush opened it up for questions. . . . Bush mixed it up with the crowd. Even before he took the stage, Bush walked through the area shaking hands and talking to fair goers.”","1548","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/17/whats-really-happening-in-iowa/"
"There are other candidates who could catch fire. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal offer Trump-lite to voters. Texas Gov. Rick Perry is spending gobs of time in Iowa and excels at retail politics. And Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who has yet to spend much time there and is drifting down in the polls, will have to decide what resources to devote there.

"The central question in Iowa remains: What happens when the air goes out of the Trump bubble — and does it go out before the Iowa caucuses?

"Republican operatives, insiders affiliated with no campaign and donors with whom Right Turn spoke last week are not pleased about the state of the GOP race. They will say something like: “Yeah, it’s early. Yeah, Rudy Giuliani never became president. But still.” They will tell you public polling is exaggerated, although internal polling shows him leading. They are angst-ridden over Donald Trump’s staying power, but more than that, the inability of the other candidates to respond effectively and present themselves as an effective alternative.","August 30","1551","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/30/the-anti-trump-angst-grows/"
"These Republicans, on one hand, despair that an egocentric bully with no discernible political principles should be leading in polls. They observe that his incoherent mix of authoritarianism, protectionism and cronyism is antithetical to the modern conservative movement, and in tone is 180 degrees from Ronald Reagan. But they also note that he is building an organization and displaying “P.T. Barnum showmanship,” as one veteran of GOP presidential campaigns put it. They shake their heads, unable to fully comprehend Trump’s appeal, but more than that they are disturbed by the rest of the field. They do not believe Trump will be the nominee, but high hopes for a deep, quality field have not been met. In particular, they are worried that Trump’s embrace of “nativism” will doom the party if mimicked by others.","1552","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/30/the-anti-trump-angst-grows/"
"Everyone would be advised to take a deep breath. Check the calendar (it’s still August). Remember who Trump supporters are. As Ramesh Ponnuru noted: “Take away the celebrity-besotted, the non-voters, and the single-issue opponents of immigration, and you’re left with a group of conservatives who deeply dislike what they see as a spineless Republican establishment. These voters never determine the nominee, because too many of them waste their passion on hopeless candidates, such as Ben Carson, Michele Bachmann . . . Donald Trump.” Already in the Des Moines Register poll, the most reliable Iowa poll available, Trump lead is down to a mere five points over Carson. Considering how Trump has dominated the airwaves, it’s not an impressive poll for him.","1553","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/30/the-anti-trump-angst-grows/"
"And then re-examine the rest of the field. Now, it is true that many campaigns and candidates have fizzled, or in some cases self-destructed. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has critically damaged himself by trying to ape Trump, some say fatally. In his must-win state of Iowa he is down to 8 percent. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and a handful of others have nearly disappeared entirely. Many Republicans think a number of candidates will fail to make subsequent debates as the polling percentage needed to qualify goes up. As these candidates drop off and the field consolidates, the survivors will get more time in the debates and have access to more donors and supporters.","1554","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/30/the-anti-trump-angst-grows/"
"But there are plenty of quality candidates whom one can envision competing for the nomination next year. While the media delight in taking whacks at Jeb Bush, he has only just begun to sharpen his rhetoric. He has the resources to use paid media to tell his own story and change the race’s dynamic, provided he avoids bobbles, steers clear of further staff bickering and focuses attacks on areas where others are weak. His super PAC has gobs of money to begin telling his story. (And truth be told, he’d rather Trump be taking up the oxygen than see a more viable alternatives gain traction.)","1555","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/30/the-anti-trump-angst-grows/"
"Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who few saw as a real competitor, looks more impressive than many expected. He’s run a smart race as the compassionate conservative and shown in debates he can be disciplined. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has both the political skill and broad appeal to make a run once the field narrows. So long as no one competitor wins all the early primaries, he will likely have the resources to compete once the race turns to winner-take-all races. And finally, Carly Fiorina gets high marks from most everyone with whom we spoke. Almost sheepishly, some will admit that many of the male, professional pols are floundering while the one woman, a political novice, excels in earned media and interviews and on the debate stage.","1556","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/30/the-anti-trump-angst-grows/"
"Moreover, the shoe has yet to drop: At some point, if he doesn’t blow up on his own, candidates and super PACs will drop negative ads portraying Trump, accurately, they say, as a liberal Democrat on a slew of issues. After all, he is erratic on the issues, a fact that issue-oriented activists will readily concede. Let’s remember, this is only August, when a fraction of primary voters are engaged. A full-blown counterattack against Trump is not likely to get underway for several months.","1557","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/30/the-anti-trump-angst-grows/"

"Club for Growth, the fiscal conservative group, put out a White Paper on Trump. They pulled no punches. “Donald Trump is not a pro-growth conservative. He has advocated for universal, government-run health care, for a massive new tax, and for the abuse of eminent domain so the government could forcibly buy up your property for a developer to build a shopping center,” the groups asserts. “While Trump may have claimed new positions since taking those stances, he has yet to renounce them, or explain different plans. . . . In light of Donald Trump’s statements and positions, the Club believes he would not govern as president in accord with the pro-growth principles of limited taxation, free trade, less regulation, and lower taxes.” Soon, one or more candidates will need to make this argument.","1559","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/30/the-anti-trump-angst-grows/"
"On social issues, Christian conservatives are distressed with Trump. In response to his praising his pro-choice sister as a judge and refusal to commit to defunding Planned Parenthood, Penny Nance of Concerned Women for America tells Right Turn that “it would and should be difficult for a candidate to earn our votes if he or she doesn’t understand that Planned Parenthood is an anathema to the pro-life community.” She adds, “The issue of abortion is ground zero for us. There is no room for equivocation. We also worry about his ability to choose Supreme Court nominees who are Constitutionalists.” She is also unsettled by Trump’s views on Iran and Israel (a key issue for her 500,000-person group). “I can’t really tell from day to day, which goes to the issue of trust,” she says. At some point, candidates must forcefully make the case against Trump’s erratic foreign policy and social views.","1560","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/30/the-anti-trump-angst-grows/"
"This should not be so hard, many presidential veterans say. You gather the data on Trump’s problematic views and rhetoric, you use earned media to blast away one issue at a time and you dump rounds of ads to remind voters he’s a Democrat at heart and would be a train wreck for the GOP. But most of all, you need to present an alternative, these voices say.

"Despite all the hand-wringing and many candidates’ belly flops, there are several candidates fully capable of doing so. In a few months, if no one has, anguish will be understandable.

"Four years ago this week, all the Republican candidates for president were asked in a debate what would happen if they were presented a deal to tackle the federal deficit, and the deal would yield $10 in budget cuts for every $1 of tax increases. “Who on this stage would walk away from that deal?” asked Fox News’s Bret Baier. Every single one of them raised their hands, so deeply offensive did they find the notion of any tax increase at all, even one that would allow enormous progress on another goal they claimed to hold dear.","August 13","1724","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/13/nearly-all-the-gop-candidates-bow-down-to-grover-norquist/"
"While the same question wasn’t asked in the first GOP debate of this season, perhaps it will be in one of the upcoming debates. And when it does, the answer may be the same, or nearly so. Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform has announced that Chris Christie has signed “The Pledge,” ATR’s blood oath in which Republican politicians promise to never, ever, ever raise taxes for any reason (h/t Steve Benen). Norquist has become a kind of high priest of tax purity, with the power to declare which Republicans have kept the faith and which are vile apostates who must be cast out of the temple. As the group’s news release about Christie says, “In 2012, all candidates for the Republican nomination for president signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, with the lone exception of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. Huntsman finished seventh in Iowa and third in New Hampshire before dropping out of the race.” So don’t get any ideas.","1725","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/13/nearly-all-the-gop-candidates-bow-down-to-grover-norquist/"
"And in this election, they’re having almost as much success. Other candidates who have signed the Pledge either this year or in the past include Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, Carly Fiorina, Rick Santorum, Ben Carson, Bobby Jindal, Scott Walker, Lindsey Graham, John Kasich, Jim Gilmore and Mike Huckabee. In other words, only three of the 17 candidates haven’t taken the pledge: George Pataki, Donald Trump and Jeb Bush.","1726","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/13/nearly-all-the-gop-candidates-bow-down-to-grover-norquist/"
"Are those stragglers going to come on board? Who knows what Trump would say if he was asked about it. Probably something entertaining yet not quite coherent, like “Pledges are for losers, and my tax policy is going to be so super-classy it’ll create a billion new jobs and make Mexico beg me to build a wall made of the finest cubic zirconium along our border.” And Bush, whom many people still think is going to wind up with the nomination, has actually ruled out taking the pledge. In fact, when testifying before Congress in 2012, he got asked the same question the candidates faced in their primary debate, and he responded, “If you could bring to me a majority of people to say that we are going to have ten dollars of spending cuts for one dollar of revenue enhancement — put me in, coach.”","1727","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/13/nearly-all-the-gop-candidates-bow-down-to-grover-norquist/"
"These days when you ask Bush about this topic, he’ll say bluntly that he has always rejected Norquist’s pledge but will quickly recite his record of cutting taxes as Florida governor. Perhaps the whole idea of absolute pledges makes him nervous, given the fact that his father said, “Read my lips: no new taxes,” then later did the right thing and accepted some tax increases as part of a budget deal, and for his trouble got forever branded as a traitor by the right.","1728","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/13/nearly-all-the-gop-candidates-bow-down-to-grover-norquist/"
"Though it goes back many years, the Pledge is in some ways the perfect embodiment of the current era in Republican politics. It takes a conservative principle — raising taxes is bad — and elevates it to the status of a holy commandment, one that can never be violated. It insists that context never matters, compromise is abhorrent by definition and the slightest deviation from orthodoxy should be punished without mercy. Deficits, wars, supervolcanoes, alien invasion — no matter what a future president might face, he cannot ever raise taxes for any reason. You have to hand it to Norquist: almost every Republican in Congress has taken the Pledge, and he’s gotten 14 out of the 17 presidential candidates to genuflect before him, which isn’t too shabby.","1729","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/13/nearly-all-the-gop-candidates-bow-down-to-grover-norquist/"
"I may not have a lot of good things to say about Jeb Bush, but let’s at least give him credit for not giving in to Norquist’s bullying. And we should hope that in one of the future debates, the GOP presidential candidates face a question like the one their predecessors did. Unlike many gimmicky-sounding debate questions, this one actually tells us something important. Because presidents keep the vast majority of the promises they make, it’s good to get them all on record in a high-profile setting. Then the voters will know what to expect in the budget battles that will inevitably be part of the next presidency.","1730","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/13/nearly-all-the-gop-candidates-bow-down-to-grover-norquist/"

"The first is the opener of the debate, in which the moderators asked candidates to raise their hands if they would not pledge to support the eventual nominee and forgo a third-party campaign.

"Was it an odd way to start a debate? Sure. But this is a question that has been bandied about in relation to Trump for a long time.

"The question was striking at the outset of a debate — largely because this hasn't yet been a storyline in Trump's political rise. But it was also completely fair and well-documented. Half the population are women, and Trump has said some things that suggest that his views of women aren't particularly evolved. And again: This would have come up eventually. There is no doubt about that.","1748","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/07/conservatives-are-mad-at-fox-news-and-megyn-kelly-they-shouldnt-be/"

"This was basically the only moment in the debate in which Trump was really pressed — to any extent — to explain himself or more specifically answer a charge against him.

"Most striking, we can get a taste of Donald Trump’s eventual demise. Trump enjoys nonstop media coverage and has not been targeted with any negative ads, yet he can manage only a five-point lead over Ben Carson in the DMR/Bloomberg poll. In the newest Monmouth University poll, Trump is tied with Carson. Trump, the angry and crass populist, may find his comeuppance among Iowa evangelicals for whom his refusal to pledge to defund Planned Parenthood and his feigned religiosity (doesn’t go to church, can’t name his favorite Bible verse) are problematic. Since 2000, GOP caucus winners (Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee and George W. Bush) have been overtly and sincerely faithful and strong on the social issues that these voters hold dear. Trump’s bully-boy routine may amuse talk radio hosts, but he is anything but “Iowa nice.”","1756","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/31/early-states-highlight-2016-gops-field-advantage/"
"Given Trump’s enormous ego and hype, Iowa is nearly a must-win for him. If he does not win there, he’s just another “loser.” Likewise, there is Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who claimed next-door Iowa as his own. He is now tied for third at 8 percent, 10 points behind Carson in the DMR/Bloomberg poll. He is down to fourth place in the Monmouth poll. Unless he makes a tremendous comeback, his fortunes may end there. Now he looks like a man in over his head, one who has yet to stop making gaffes.","1757","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/31/early-states-highlight-2016-gops-field-advantage/"
"Going down the list of “Iowa or bust” candidates, those whose strength is their evangelical appeal also need to win or come very close to the top (Santorum, Huckabee, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, etc.). Any who don’t win, place or show may be effectively eliminated from contention even if they don’t officially exit. Some of these contenders, in particular those who never make the top-tier debate, may leave the race before suffering an embarrassing loss. It’s not clear, for example, whether Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) stays in, only to be handed early-state losses far worse than his father experienced.","1758","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/31/early-states-highlight-2016-gops-field-advantage/"
"Moving on, New Hampshire is a must-win both for Ohio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Running in the “moderate” lane and looking to dislodge Jeb Bush, both need to duplicate Sen. John McCain’s victory in order to gain momentum, donors and earned media coverage. Christie’s irreverence and national security toughness more closely resemble McCain.","1759","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/31/early-states-highlight-2016-gops-field-advantage/"
"In sum, we could well go from a field of 17 or so to less than half that number coming out of Iowa and New Hampshire. Those who aren’t out of single figures and who needed to but did not win at least one of the races will find it hard to compete. The good news for Republicans is the handful of candidates who are left will then will have time to make their case in debates. Looking at the race that way, the name of the game is to be among the survivors after the first two races with an intact message and sufficient money. Republicans in all likelihood will have a choice from a mixed, smaller field likely to include, at least, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina and the winner(s) of the first two contests.","1760","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/31/early-states-highlight-2016-gops-field-advantage/"
"Then there is the Democratic side. Hillary Clinton (37 percent) leads in Iowa by a mere 7 points over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who clocks in at 30 percent. It is easy to imagine a repeat of Clinton’s Iowa loss in 2008. It’s worse than 2008, actually. One can foresee Sanders taking New Hampshire as well. If she loses both early contests, panic on the Democratic side will heighten. Relying on Democratic insiders (super delegates) and a pile of money to lift her to the nomination does nothing to improve her chances in the general election. And while Sanders might win the left in the primary, his views (he would not even say the first Gulf War was justified) are unlikely to win over the general electorate. So you can understand why VP Joe Biden (at 14 percent in Iowa) remains the Democrats’ life raft. That still leaves them with an old, D.C. insider running for President Obama’s third term. And that is probably the Democrats’ best-case scenario.","1761","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/31/early-states-highlight-2016-gops-field-advantage/"
"Either way, the Democrats likely will be stuck with the most vulnerable candidate since Michael Dukakis. Their hopes ride on an untrustworthy, unlikable candidate in the middle of an FBI investigation, or a socialist — or an old VP who has been in Washington for decades. Consider the contrast with the GOP, which is likely to have its pick of a half-dozen or so quality candidates, both insiders and outsiders, young and old, ethnically diverse.","1762","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/31/early-states-highlight-2016-gops-field-advantage/"
"For all the media predictions of the downfall of the GOP at the hands of Trump, in fact, the GOP has time and options to make its pick. The Democrats, however, have bad and worse options, no matter who wins the two earliest contests. Democrats’ empty bench is a much greater threat to their 2016 election prospects than Trump is to the GOP’s. The GOP almost certainly will choose someone else. The Democrats have no one else.","1763","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/31/early-states-highlight-2016-gops-field-advantage/"

"THE BIG IDEA by David Weigel: The Libertarian Moment is over, or is it? One year ago, in a flag-planting cover story for the New York Times magazine, Robert Draper asked whether a “libertarian moment” had come at last. The memorable art for the story was a fuzzed-out image of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), patterned after a hardcore show flyer, with a date of 11/8/16. Election Day.","August 17","1806","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/17/the-daily-202-is-the-libertarian-movement-over/"
"The image made sense at the time. Increasingly, it looks like a nostalgia piece. This August has tagged Paul’s presidential bid as officially “embattled.” Single-digit support in primary states; indictments for the two heads of his super PAC; a poorly-reviewed run at the first debate. “Whither Rand Paul” stories have been popping up for weeks, and Noah Rothman’s Commentary story – “Rand Paul lost the libertarian moment” – is the harshest.","1807","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/17/the-daily-202-is-the-libertarian-movement-over/"
"Draper politely declined to revisit his own article and argument, but I caught up with some of his sources. No one argues with this: The Paul campaign’s struggle has quieted down the “libertarian moment” talk. The dream of Paul as a “frontrunner”-in-waiting was based on a few polls that showed his support in the high teens. For a brief time, it made sense for libertarians to hitch their wagons to the story of a thriving national politician. That’s happening less now.","1808","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/17/the-daily-202-is-the-libertarian-movement-over/"
"“It’s a mistake to conflate Rand Paul’s electoral success with that of the libertarian moment,” said Nick Gillespie, the editor of Reason.com. (Disclosure: I worked for Reason from 2006 to 2008.) “Rand Paul’s high visibility is better understood as a consequence of the libertarian moment than its cause. There’s a reason why he’s been at his most electrifying and popular precisely when he is at his most libertarian: calling out the surveillance state, for instance, and leading the charge against reckless interventions in Syria and Libya.”","1809","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/17/the-daily-202-is-the-libertarian-movement-over/"
"That gets to a grievance that some libertarian activists have expressed about Paul. Perhaps it was too much to hope that he could start with his father’s 2012 coalition – one that cracked 20 percent in multiple states – and add new voters. Instead, Paul has failed to even unite self-identifying libertarian voters and donors. Charles and David Koch, who bankrolled much of the modern libertarian movement, have quite clearly been shopping around for a non-Paul candidate.","1810","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/17/the-daily-202-is-the-libertarian-movement-over/"
"“The question is not whether the libertarian moment is over but whether libertarians can agree on a single national candidate,” says Lawson Bader, the president of the free market Competitive Enterprise Institute. “The answer is probably “no,” and if Rand Paul can’t unite all the different strands of the movement, I am not convinced anybody else can right now. More importantly, the Republican primary has been ‘Trumped,’ upending everyone’s previous understanding of political alliances.”","1811","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/17/the-daily-202-is-the-libertarian-movement-over/"
"In this read, there is no libertarian “moment” to lose. De-coupled from Paul, the causes of the movement – social liberalism, then a distrust-fueled dismantling of government – is humming right along. No Republican candidate, with the chaotic exception of Donald Trump, is proposing a state as large and “compassionate” as the last Republican president. It’s really only on foreign policy that the libertarians have been quieted.","1812","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/17/the-daily-202-is-the-libertarian-movement-over/"
"Libertarians have been here before. The media come asking about whether now, finally, their movement has won; the media decide that the moment has passed. Paul’s campaign, for all its problems, is still going to be the lens through which everyone else tracks the movement’s success. “Hopefully his father’s endorsement will goad him to become THE libertarian alternative,” says Gillespie, “rather than the seventh or eighth or 10th most conservative candidate in the GOP race.” Read the full text of my Big Idea.","1813","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/17/the-daily-202-is-the-libertarian-movement-over/"

"— The Pentagon plans to increase by 50 percent the number of daily drone flights by the U.S. military, the Wall Street Journal reports. The flights would “broaden intelligence collection in such locales as Ukraine, Iraq, Syria, the South China Sea and North Africa,” a senior defense official told Gordon Lubold. “It would be the first significant increase in the U.S. drone program since 2011, reflecting pressure on military efforts to address a cascading series of global crises. While expanding surveillance, the Pentagon plan also grows the capacity for lethal airstrikes, the most controversial part of the U.S. drone program and its rapid growth under President Barack Obama Strikes by unmanned aircraft have killed 3,000 people or more, based on estimates by nonpartisan groups.” By 2019, the Air Force would continue to fly 60 drone flight; the Army 16; and the Special Forces Command up to four.","1820","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/17/the-daily-202-is-the-libertarian-movement-over/"

"Meanwhile, the real-estate mogul released a six-page immigration plan, seeking to answer critics who say he’s woefully short on policy prescriptions. In it, he slammed the 2013 Senate reform bill as “amnesty, cheap labor and open borders” and a “giveaway to corporate patrons who run both parties.” The proposal includes forcing Mexico to pay for a wall across the southern border; tripling Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers; imposing nationwide E-Verify for businesses to check citizenship claims; defunding sanctuary cities; and ending birthright citizenship. He wants to require businesses to hire Americans first; terminate the jobs program for foreign youth and replace it with a resume bank for inner-city youth; and use funds saved from cracking down on refugee and asylum seekers to place U.S. children without parents in safer homes and improve safety in high-crimes areas.","1825","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/17/the-daily-202-is-the-libertarian-movement-over/"

"—“Congress’s Awful Autumn,” by Kelsey Snell: “When Congress returns from its August recess, it faces a tangle of fiscal deadlines that could serve as a replay of some of the most contentious battles of the past five years. Those include keeping the government open amid fierce disagreement over spending caps put in place by the so-called 2011 sequester, finding a long-term way to fund highway and transit projects and lifting the debt ceiling before default. Dispatching with all of these issues before year’s end would be a big feat under even the most generous of circumstances, but they arrive as Congress will also be deciding whether to block the Iran nuclear deal, hosting a papal visit and dealing with a truncated September calendar due to religious holidays. For now, Republican leaders are preaching calm and assuring the agenda can be tackled without incident.”","1830","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/17/the-daily-202-is-the-libertarian-movement-over/"

And to think, it only took a lifetime of Hillary enduring horrible sexism about her hair, makeup, and pantsuits to get there! The same cannot be said for the men.

"Huckabee is generally underestimated. He has more experience on stage and on camera than anyone else in the field. He could surprise people. Huckabee is as likely to deliver a scripted line with good timing and effectiveness as anyone on the stage. And, importantly, he is better than most of the others at delivering an unscripted line that takes advantage of an opportunity others might miss. Huckabee has — at best — moved sideways since he entered the race. He needs a little lift to open new doors and to reassure his supporters.","1872","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/06/the-insiders-two-sleepers-to-watch-in-tonights-debate/"
"Also, watch for Dr. Ben Carson to say something different from the other candidates. He has a lot of goodwill in the party and people will be pulling for him. He could deliver some good lines, and he has a unique perspective that will likely be well-received. But, like Donald Trump, he could wow the crowd but still not be able to capitalize on the moment by building widespread support within the party. He doesn’t have an organizational foothold that will really help him build a campaign apparatus. So he could have his moment in the spotlight tonight, but it will be more light than heat. Anyway, this is only the first debate, and there will be a lot more to come.","1873","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/06/the-insiders-two-sleepers-to-watch-in-tonights-debate/"

"— The Fox News moderators went after Trump harder than any of his opponents during last night’s debate. He started the debate on the defensive over his refusal to rule out an independent bid. Megyn Kelly, one of three moderators, then memorably pushed him on his history of misogynistic comments: “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.’” Later, she wondered when he decided to become a Republican and asked about his flip-flops on abortion. The other moderators, Chris Wallace and Breit Baier, forced Trump to defend his past support for a single-payer health-care system, his contributions to Hillary Clinton and the bankruptcies of his companies. They also pressed him for evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals over the border.","1875","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/07/the-daily-202-megyn-kelly-out-foxed-donald-trump/"
"There is mixed evidence about how much of a toll these moments, which would be fatal for any normal candidate, will take on Trump’s image. But it seems very possible that last night was a tipping point in the Republican nominating contest. Frank Luntz’s post-debate focus group, which aired live on Fox, found many voters who supported Trump going into the two-hour event turning on him. Buzz on the cable network and across most conservative web sites broke decidedly negative, including from commentators who have been sympathetic. But everyone knows that Trump has only seen his lead in the polls grow despite a flurry of seemingly damaging comments over the past two months, whether about Mexican rapists or John McCain. Just over half of the 343,000 respondents to a nonscientific poll leading the Drudge Report this morning picked Trump as the winner. Ted Cruz is second, with just 12 percent.","1876","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/07/the-daily-202-megyn-kelly-out-foxed-donald-trump/"

"In politics, when you’re whining you’re usually losing. So it is telling that Trump went to the spin room after the debate to complain about a double standard. “The questions to me were far tougher,” he told reporters. “I didn’t think they were appropriate. And I thought Megyn behaved very badly, personally.” Overnight on Twitter, Trump (or whoever runs his account) intensified his attacks on Kelly and Fox. “Wow,” he wrote, “@megynkelly really bombed tonight.” He described her as “totally overrated” and “angry.” Trump also attacked Luntz as “a low-class slob,” suggesting that the GOP consultant was bitter because he had pitched him for some business “and I had zero interest.”","1878","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/07/the-daily-202-megyn-kelly-out-foxed-donald-trump/"
"Taking on an institution like Fox News is dangerous, especially for someone like Trump, whose rise has been propelled entirely by free media coverage. And taking on someone like Kelly, who is beloved by the very demographic that is key to Trump’s strength in the polls, is even more problematic. Though he’s a billionaire, Trump has made clear to staff that he does not want to spend money on commercials. So he has to find a way to stay in the spotlight. If the nation’s top-rated news channel, with its conservative bent, turned on him, that could cause real damage.","1879","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/07/the-daily-202-megyn-kelly-out-foxed-donald-trump/"

"— Chuck Schumer came out against the Iran deal: In a big blow to President Obama, the New York senator — in the middle of the debate, mind you — declared his opposition to the nuclear agreement. As one of the most prominent Jewish voices in Congress and the likely next leader of Senate Democrats, he was being closely watched as a bellwether for other fence-sitting lawmakers. His decision to oppose the pact may give cover for other Democrats to break with Obama. “I will vote to disapprove the agreement, not because I believe war is a viable or desirable option, nor to challenge the path of diplomacy. It is because I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear power,” Schumer wrote in a post on Medium. His main argument is that after 10 to 15 years, Iran would be “a nuclear threshold state with the blessing of the world community.”","1885","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/07/the-daily-202-megyn-kelly-out-foxed-donald-trump/"
"Lawmakers won’t vote on whether to reject the deal until September, after they return from a long recess. Schumer said he will “share” his view and try to “persuade” colleagues but believes the vote is a matter of conscience. Nonetheless, House Foreign Affairs ranking member, Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), quickly followed suit and said he’d oppose the deal, too. A dozen Senate Democrats (plus Angus King) are already on record supporting the deal; Obama needs 34 to sustain a veto if Congress votes to reject the pact.","1886","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/07/the-daily-202-megyn-kelly-out-foxed-donald-trump/"

At the time, Trump’s entire political staff consisted of his lawyer Michael Cohen, veteran operative Roger Stone, and all-purpose aide Sam Nunberg…According to a source close to the campaign, the old guard is frustrated that Lewandoski and another new hire, spokesperson Hope Hicks, seem to be favoring CNN over Fox News.”","1917","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/07/the-daily-202-megyn-kelly-out-foxed-donald-trump/"

Uber’s lawyers argued that they cannot, that there is no such thing as a ‘typical’ Uber driver and that it would make more sense for each driver to bring their own case — an expensive undertaking that most drivers likely wouldn’t pursue.

This decision short-circuits the political process that has been underway on the state level for years. While I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law. As we look ahead, it must be a priority of the next president to nominate judges and justices committed to applying the Constitution as written and originally understood. . . . I firmly believe the question of same sex marriage is a question of the definition of an institution, not the dignity of a human being. Every American has the right to pursue happiness as they see fit. Not every American has to agree on every issue, but all of us do have to share our country. A large number of Americans will continue to believe in traditional marriage, and a large number of Americans will be pleased with the Court’s decision today. In the years ahead, it is my hope that each side will respect the dignity of the other.”","1946","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/the-gop-contenders-react-to-the-same-sex-marriage-decision/"
"Jeb Bush‘s statement put it this way: “Guided by my faith, I believe in traditional marriage. I believe the Supreme Court should have allowed the states to make this decision. I also believe that we should love our neighbor and respect others, including those making lifetime commitments. In a country as diverse as ours, good people who have opposing views should be able to live side by side. It is now crucial that as a country we protect religious freedom and the right of conscience and also not discriminate.”","1947","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/the-gop-contenders-react-to-the-same-sex-marriage-decision/"
"The most surprising in this “category” was Dr. Ben Carson who had this dignified reaction: “While I strongly disagree with the Supreme Court’s decision, their ruling is now the law of the land. I call on Congress to make sure deeply held religious views are respected and protected. The government must never force Christians to violate their religious beliefs.”","1948","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/the-gop-contenders-react-to-the-same-sex-marriage-decision/"
"Carly Fiorina‘s statement was lengthy, but in essence argued, “I believe that responsibility should have remained with states and voters where this conversation has continued in churches, town halls and living rooms around the country. Moving forward, however, all of our effort should be focused on protecting the religious liberties and freedom of conscience for those Americans that profoundly disagree with today’s decision. The Court did not and could not end this debate today. Let us continue to show tolerance for those whose opinions and sincerely held beliefs differ from our own. We must lead by example, finding a way to respect one another and to celebrate a culture that protects religious freedom while promoting equality under the law.”","1949","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/the-gop-contenders-react-to-the-same-sex-marriage-decision/"

"Then there were the unhinged responses.","1951","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/the-gop-contenders-react-to-the-same-sex-marriage-decision/"
"As one would expect, Mike Huckabee bellowed, “The only outcome worse than this flawed, failed decision would be for the President and Congress, two co-equal branches of government, to surrender in the face of this out-of-control act of unconstitutional, judicial tyranny. . . .Under our Constitution, the court cannot write a law, even though some cowardly politicians will wave the white flag and accept it without realizing that they are failing their sworn duty to reject abuses from the court. If accepted by Congress and this President, this decision will be a serious blow to religious liberty, which is the heart of the First Amendment.” It was, in short, shameful and incendiary, further proof, if not already evident, he has no business holding public office.","1952","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/the-gop-contenders-react-to-the-same-sex-marriage-decision/"
"Rick Santorum preached defiance as well. “The Court is one of three co-equal branches of government and, just as they have in cases from Dred Scott to Plessy, the Court has an imperfect track record. The stakes are too high and the issue too important to simply cede the will of the people to five unaccountable justices.” Again, incitement to lawlessness should be a disqualifier for office.","1953","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/the-gop-contenders-react-to-the-same-sex-marriage-decision/"
"Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal did not go that far, settling for being vague on the remedy but taking victimhood to new heights (lows): “The Supreme Court decision today conveniently and not surprisingly follows public opinion polls, and tramples on states’ rights that were once protected by the 10th Amendment of the Constitution. Marriage between a man and a woman was established by God, and no earthly court can alter that. This decision will pave the way for an all out assault against the religious freedom rights of Christians who disagree with this decision. This ruling must not be used as pretext by Washington to erode our right to religious liberty.” Actually, it will do no such thing, and Justice Kennedy specifically included religious liberty is protected by the First Amendment.”","1954","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/the-gop-contenders-react-to-the-same-sex-marriage-decision/"
"The surprise.","1955","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/the-gop-contenders-react-to-the-same-sex-marriage-decision/"
"Most unexpected was the reaction of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker who in last year’s reelection campaign took as the law of the land the 7th Circuit ruling striking down the gay marriage ban. He has repeatedly stated that social issues should not distract Republicans and specifically threw cold water on the idea of a Constitutional amendment. But today, he genuflected to social conservatives, suggesting an (unattainable) Constitutional amendment is the way to go: “As a result of this decision, the only alternative left for the American people is to support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to reaffirm the ability of the states to continue to define marriage.” He then immediately suggests this in unlikely to happen, “Recognizing that our Founders made our Constitution difficult to amend, I am reminded that it was first amended to protect our ‘First Freedom’ — the free exercise of religion. The First Amendment does not simply protect a narrow ‘right to worship,’ but provides broad protection to individuals and institutions to worship and act in accordance with their religious beliefs. In fact, the Wisconsin constitution explicitly protects the rights of conscience of our citizens. I can assure all Wisconsinites concerned about the impact of today’s decision that your conscience rights will be protected, and the government will not coerce you to act against your religious beliefs.” But Kennedy, once again, said just that in the opinion.","1956","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/the-gop-contenders-react-to-the-same-sex-marriage-decision/"
"Walker obviously is concerned about challenges from his right. (His hesitation on the Confederate flag controversy demonstrated this as well.) But does he fear competition from Jindal or Huckabee in Iowa? He could have very well adopted Carson’s restrained tone. Instead, Walker went for the base-pleasing play and alarmist tone. This is not the first time he has been seen as shifting right. On immigration reform, he has acknowledged changing his mind. (He also got tangled up on the ethanol issue, certainly not the first pol to bow to Iowa farmers.) The danger is that he takes himself out of the mainstream of the party, offends donors and puts him in the lane with the less widely acceptable candidates. Alternatively, he risks being labeled as a Mitt Romney type. He, too, was a governor in a blue state, moderate on social issues, who in his first try for the president came out as a rabid social conservative. It did not work.","1957","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/the-gop-contenders-react-to-the-same-sex-marriage-decision/"

"Like any strategic exercise, presidential politics requires patience. While a frontal assault can knock an opponent off balance, it is often far more effective to wait for — or better yet encourage — an opponent’s self-destruction.

"On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is killing Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers and media coverage. Day after day, the news about Clinton is what previously made statement turns out to be false (e.g. “no” confidential material, she once claimed), what cringe-worthy moment occurred at the latest media encounter and what silly spin her team was trying out. She is far more effective at undermining her campaign than the best Republican opponent could ever be. Unsurprisingly, the Vice President Joe Biden buzz is heating up. The Draft Biden group is beginning to hire staff and he is now reportedly “gaming out” a potential run. He never attacked Clinton, never fanned the news about her scandal. He just waited. Quietly. Sometimes an opponent practically invites you to take her on.","2053","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/23/the-candidates-who-are-their-own-worst-enemies/"
"On the Republican side, directly attacking a shameless candidate turned out to be of limited value. While it cemented the view of 75 percent of Republicans he is noxious and buffoonish, he and his 25 percent are undaunted. The better play here is to watch Donald Trump fizzle. As Byron York reports:","2054","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/23/the-candidates-who-are-their-own-worst-enemies/"
"Certainly his act is wearing thin. “An an hour-long verbal meanderthon at half-filled Ladd-Peebles Stadium, Trump allowed an atmosphere of electric excitement to dissipate, and then he split town without his promised post-show press conference,” reported Quin Hillyer. ” As I left the stadium, a red-hatted lady of my acquaintance spotted me and pulled me aside, saying: ‘Somebody needs to tell that man when to shut the you-know-what up. People were leaving in droves.'”","2055","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/23/the-candidates-who-are-their-own-worst-enemies/"
"One senses the Trump phenomenon has peaked (his poll numbers nationally have declined since the first debate). As we get closer to the first balloting one can imagine his supporters losing interest, deciding the summer fling is over and, in any case, being outnumbered by well-organized caucus goers in Iowa. As soon as Trump fails to convert fame into votes — becomes just another “loser” in his jargon — the gig is up.","2056","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/23/the-candidates-who-are-their-own-worst-enemies/"
"A number of other candidates are zapping their own chances. No one is pushing Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker out of the race. He’s got himself tied up in knots over issues like immigration, doing his best imitation of the worst Mitt Romney flip-flops. It’s the ultimate brand-killing exercise for a candidate who wants to be seen as resolute. In spontaneous moments (e.g. analogizing union battles to the war on terror, “absolutely” agreeing to repeal birthright citizenship, saying only a “handful” of Muslims were nonviolent Muslims) he swings wildly and misses; his team’s spin only highlights the errors. When you go from “absolutely” supporting repeal of birthright citizenship to no position on the issue to opposition in just a few days it’s time to reconsider whether you are ready for primetime.","2057","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/23/the-candidates-who-are-their-own-worst-enemies/"

"In short, while Clinton is defeating herself, the GOP herd is in the process of thinning itself. Eventually we are likely to wind up with a manageable, diverse and interesting GOP field — say, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Dr. Ben Carson, Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Carly Fiorina. Put differently, Ted Cruz doesn’t have to take out Scott Walker; Scott Walker is taking out Scott Walker. A presidential race is never won in August of the preceding year, but it often is lost long before February voting.","2059","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/23/the-candidates-who-are-their-own-worst-enemies/"
"Depending on which polls you use, the top 10 for the first GOP presidential debate would feature some serious and not so serious contenders. If you go by the Fox News poll, the lineup would be former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Donald Trump, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Ben Carson, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Huckabee, Carly Fiorina, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Rick Santorum. If you go by the current RealClearPolitics average, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Texas governor Rick Perry would be in, while Fiorina and Santorum would not. In neither case would Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Ohio Gov. John Kasich or Sen.

What can we take away from all this?","2061","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/25/the-first-gop-debate-who-will-duke-it-out/"

"Second, Trump, Carson, Paul, Huckabee, Santorum and Cruz will probably try to outdo one another in fiery rhetoric and extreme stances. The longer they bicker about who the most strident standard-bearer is, the greater the danger they take themselves out of being an acceptable choice for a great number of voters. There is no incentive, however, to hold back because success for each lies in getting enough of their natural base as possible in Iowa.","2063","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/25/the-first-gop-debate-who-will-duke-it-out/"
"Meanwhile, Bush would be content to let these guys talk themselves off the ledge or even field vitriolic attacks. He is going for the more moderate, more establishment group that lives in fear that one of the people in the second group could break through. He would want to avoid errors but give a strong defense of his own record and mainstream conservative views. He does not need to knock anyone out.","2064","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/25/the-first-gop-debate-who-will-duke-it-out/"
"That leaves Rubio, Walker and possibly Fiorina, Perry or Christie in the middle. These candidates ultimately succeed by taking a good chunk of the base and then siphoning off Bush votes. They want to be the more conservative, but viable, alternative to Bush. That is a tricky place to be. Debates are not necessarily places for nuance, so threading the needle between the extremists and Bush is not easy. And keep in mind, with 10 people in the debate, no one gets much time to do much of anything. For them, the best advice would be: Don’t hit down. Ignore the people to their right fighting over red meat and focus on establishing themselves as viable alternatives to Bush. Walker and Perry can tout their records and their efforts battling President Obama’s agenda. Fiorina can cast them as all professional pols. Above all, they cannot get sucked into a competition with the nuttiest contenders. Any time spent engaging, say, Trump or Cruz is a waste, and at worst drags them into a lesser tier of candidates.","2065","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/25/the-first-gop-debate-who-will-duke-it-out/"
"Now all of this is likely to change as polls fluctuate, and it is not yet certain that all will run (although Christie reportedly will announce as early as next week).

"The debate over Obama’s electability is moot, but it dovetails with a broader, ongoing conversation within the Clinton campaign about the extent to which she should tie her fortunes to the president’s. She knows that she needs the so-called Obama coalition to turn out in force next November, which is one reason she’s tacked to the left in recent months. Many of these voters, registered by the Obama campaign in 2008 or 2012, will only turn out for Hillary if they see a vote for her as a vote for a third Obama term.","2073","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/07/29/the-daily-202-could-obama-win-a-third-term/"
"Hillary is not actively distancing herself from her ex-boss as much as many observers predicted throughout 2014. Almost exactly a year ago, during an interview with The Atlantic, Clinton criticized Obama for not taking more action in Syria and for an internal White House mantra buzzed about at the time (“Don’t do stupid sh**”). This prompted Obama allies like David Axelrod to point out that Clinton, not Obama, voted to authorize the Iraq war in the first place. Hillary phoned Obama to say she had not meant “to attack him,” and her spokesman announced that she looked forward to “hugging it out” when they were both on Martha’s Vineyard a few days later. We haven’t seen a blow-up quite like that since then.","2074","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/07/29/the-daily-202-could-obama-win-a-third-term/"
"From the preternaturally cautious and calculating Clinton, watch for a continued balancing act. When she distances herself, it will be more implicit and subtle than during that Atlantic interview. Her campaign leadership team is also stocked with Obama alumni who were still at the White House during this time last year. “I’m not running for my husband’s third term and I’m not running for Barack Obama’s third term,” she declared in New Hampshire this spring. In the very next breath, she added: “I’m running to continue the positive, results-oriented policies that both of them worked for.”","2075","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/07/29/the-daily-202-could-obama-win-a-third-term/"
"Some additional distancing is probably inevitable. Vice President George H.W. Bush’s talk during the 1988 campaign about “a kinder, gentler America” was a calculated effort to show he was different than Ronald Reagan. Few remember it now, but Reagan’s approval rating in the summer of 1987 was in the 40s because of the Iran-Contra scandal. A July 1987 Gallup poll asked how Reagan would go down in history: only 9 percent said he would be remembered as “outstanding”; 28 percent said “above average”; 34 percent said “average”; and 26 percent said either “below average” or “poor.” It’s a good reminder Obama could be viewed very differently next November.","2076","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/07/29/the-daily-202-could-obama-win-a-third-term/"

Some of his claims, made under oath, and under pressure, are shown to be hyperbolic overstatements, and others to be shadings of the truth or even outright misstatements. And in rare instances, he turns boorish and demeaning…It showcases Mr. Trump’s fixation with his image as a financial success, and lays bare his hypersensitivity to any suggestion of failure.” Also, the story sheds lights on some of Trump’s habits: he doesn’t drink alcohol, doesn’t really watch TV, doesn’t use text messages and “very rarely” used email as of 2013.","2107","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/07/29/the-daily-202-could-obama-win-a-third-term/"

All three of these contenders along with Mike Huckabee (who reminds one of the old joke, “Did he used to be Mike Huckabee?”) revealed that right-wing rhetoric is not sufficient to lift one into the top tier.","2174","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/07/seven-takeaways-from-the-first-republican-debate/"
"2. Jeb Bush is plenty conservative. His answers on immigration and Common Core demonstrated once again that for all the right-wing media frothing, neither is going to deprive him of the nomination. If he has a challenge, it is that there are at least four excellent contenders — Govs. John Kasich and Chris Christie, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Carly Fiorina.","2175","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/07/seven-takeaways-from-the-first-republican-debate/"
"3. The best candidates are center-right pragmatists. The four best performers in the evening round (Bush, Kasich, Christie and Rubio) can’t be written off as extreme. They are all in the mainstream of what we have come to call reform conservatism — a conservative approach to governance that is aimed at problem-solving and eschews anti-government vitriol.","2176","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/07/seven-takeaways-from-the-first-republican-debate/"
"4. The GOP is the party of hawks. In the most telling exchange between contenders, Christie pummeled Paul on anti-terrorism, lecturing the junior Kentucky senator that the idea of just focusing on the terrorists’ records is inane. (“That’s a completely ridiculous answer. ‘I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from other people.’ How are you supposed to know, Megyn?”)","2177","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/07/seven-takeaways-from-the-first-republican-debate/"
"5. You need more than a couple of soundbites on a 3×5 card to do well in these. As Fred Barnes put it, “[Walker’s] answers were short. He didn’t use all the time allotted to him. This was a mistake. It left the impression he didn’t have much to say. He appeared weak. He offered a quick answer, then nothing.” Compare his answers to those of Rubio, who showed depth of knowledge and ease in covering a range of issues.","2178","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/07/seven-takeaways-from-the-first-republican-debate/"
"6. The best debates give candidates some running room. The contenders did not get off the moment the bell rang, allowing them to complete their thoughts without abusing the rules. There were enough interchanges between the candidates but the moderators kept control of the proceedings. The questioners were not the main event; the candidates were. In that regard, the moderators were among the very best we have seen.","2179","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/07/seven-takeaways-from-the-first-republican-debate/"
"7. The GOP is no longer dominated by Southern social conservatives. The geographic diversity of the top performers — Florida, Ohio, New Jersey — provide reason for optimism that the GOP will have appeal outside deep red strongholds. These candidates know how to win in racially and politically diverse states. They are all pro-life and all opposed the Supreme Court’s decision on gay marriage, but they come across as inclusive and non-judgmental. Kasich stood out in this regard, telling the audience: “The court has ruled, and I said we’ll accept it. And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesn’t think the way I do, doesn’t mean that I can’t care about them or can’t love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? That’s what we’re taught when we have strong faith. . . . So, look, I’m going to love my daughters, I’m going to love them no matter what they do. Because, you know what, God gives me unconditional love. I’m going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me.”","2180","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/07/seven-takeaways-from-the-first-republican-debate/"
"The top 10 Republicans running for their party's presidential nomination debated for the first time Thursday night in Cleveland. It was amazing in every sense of the word and I loved every minute of it. I jotted down some notes during the two-hour event -- I could have watched for at least another hour! -- and picked some of the winners and losers from the night. Enjoy!","August 6","2181","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/06/winners-and-losers-from-the-first-republican-presidential-debate/"
"* Marco Rubio: Natural talent tends to shine through in big moments when the bright lights turn on. The senator from Florida, who had dipped in polls after a bump in the wake of his announcement, was terrific on Thursday night. He was poised, on message and seemingly entirely at ease -- even when pressed on immigration, which could have been a problem for him. Rubio's response on his inexperience -- ""This election cannot be a résumé competition"" -- was a good one. Most importantly for Rubio, he looked the part of a president. Hurdle cleared.","2182","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/06/winners-and-losers-from-the-first-republican-presidential-debate/"
"* Megyn Kelly/Bret Baier/Chris Wallace: Moderating a 10-person debate that includes Donald Trump is no easy task. The Fox trio managed the back and forth very well and, more importantly, asked good, challenging questions without venturing into ""gotcha"" territory. With the exception of the weirdness that happened between 8:50 p.m. and the start of the debate (more on that below), they were outstanding.","2183","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/06/winners-and-losers-from-the-first-republican-presidential-debate/"
"* John Kasich's first hour: The Ohio governor came across as reasonable, conservative and just different enough in the first 60 (or so) minutes of the debate. It helped him that the crowd in Cleveland was ready to jump out of their chairs at his every utterance, but Kasich still did well -- particularly in the agile way he avoided attacking or praising Trump. Kasich faded from sight a bit in the second half of the debate, although his same-sex marriage answer was personal and effective.","2184","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/06/winners-and-losers-from-the-first-republican-presidential-debate/"
"* Ben Carson's second hour: The acclaimed neurosurgeon was nowhere to be found through the first half of the debate. But in the second hour and, in particular, the final 15 minutes or so, Carson was outstanding. His closing statement was among the best -- if not the best -- of the group. Carson's math is simple: The more he talks about being a brain surgeon, the better.","2185","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/06/winners-and-losers-from-the-first-republican-presidential-debate/"
"* Donald Trump: As always, Trump is the hardest candidate to judge. His unwillingness to commit to supporting the Republican nominee if he isn't it should hurt him among Republicans. His general cluelessness about foreign policy specifics won't help either. But, what I've learned about Trump is that his brashness and boisterousness have an appeal with a not-small part of the GOP electorate. And, Trump did Trump tonight -- unapologetic and dismissive at every turn. ""I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct,"" Trump told Kelly at one point early in the debate. People clapped -- and the Trump message (such as it is) seemed vindicated. I've been wrong on Trump before. I think he may be beyond normal political predictions.","2186","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/06/winners-and-losers-from-the-first-republican-presidential-debate/"
"* Carly Fiorina: Yes, she was in the ""kids table"" debate at 5 p.m. But the former HP executive stood out -- big time. She was relaxed and well-versed on domestic and foreign policy. She looked the part, too. My guess is that by the time the next debate comes around, she will be more central to the conversation.","2187","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/06/winners-and-losers-from-the-first-republican-presidential-debate/"

"* Rand Paul: The senator from Kentucky didn't get a whole lot of time to talk -- the least of the 10 candidates -- but he didn't do much when he did. Paul's ""different kind of a Republican"" riff is a good one but he didn't hit it well until his closing statement. Too late. Paul did nothing to restore the momentum he has lost in the race to date.","2190","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/06/winners-and-losers-from-the-first-republican-presidential-debate/"
"* Scott Walker: The Wisconsin governor wasn't bad. He was just overly scripted. He hit all the notes he wanted to -- union fighter, elected three times in four years, proven conservative -- but it felt like he was rushing to get his talking points out rather than focusing on the actual policies behind the words. Not terrible. Just not great.","2191","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/06/winners-and-losers-from-the-first-republican-presidential-debate/"
"* 8:50 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Fox: What the heck was that? Did Bill O'Reilly throw to the debate too soon? It sure felt like something odd had happened. First Megyn Kelly asked the candidates to come out. Then they didn't. Then they did. Then they just sort of stood there as the moderators made awkward small talk with them. Super weird. It felt like I was watching myself at a junior high school dance all over again.","2192","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/06/winners-and-losers-from-the-first-republican-presidential-debate/"

We need competent.” (His opponents, of course, would quibble that he’s also competent to govern.) Using some impressive verbal jujitsu, Trump also sought to recast another of his perceived liabilities – his lack of message discipline – as a reason to vote for him. “We need some unpredictability,” he said. “We’re so predictable. We’re like bad checkers players!”","2197","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/28/the-daily-202-trump-says-maybe-america-should-try-making-a-jerk-president/"
"There’s a breathtakingly large opening for an outsider candidate like Trump in South Carolina, the first state to vote in the South. Newt Gingrich’s win here in 2012 was the first time the state hadn’t picked the eventual nominee in 28 years. What Newt tapped into, despite being a former House speaker, was frustration with the powers-that-be, from the party bosses to the elite media. Trump is tapping into the same feelings and winning over many of the same voters. The most striking thing about interviewing people at Trump’s events is how many supported Gingrich last time.","2198","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/28/the-daily-202-trump-says-maybe-america-should-try-making-a-jerk-president/"
"This week’s Palmetto State poll by Monmouth University asked primary voters whether it’s more important to have a president “from outside of government who can bring a new approach to Washington” or “someone with government experience who knows how to get things done.” They picked the former by two-to-one (61-28). Trump won the horse race with 30 percent, followed by Ben Carson with 15 percent. Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio tied for third at 6 percent. This means that three of the top four candidates in South Carolina, cumulatively pulling 51 percent, have never held elected office. “Political experience is not a particularly valuable commodity this primary season,” said Monmouth’s Patrick Murray.","2199","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/28/the-daily-202-trump-says-maybe-america-should-try-making-a-jerk-president/"

One person familiar with the matter said he hacked dozens of U.S. military personnel and published personal and financial details online, including those of a general, for others to exploit…Mr. Hussain was killed by a U.S. drone strike on Tuesday while he was in a car in Raqqa, Syria, U.S. officials said. That he was targeted directly shows the extent to which digital warfare has upset the balance of power on the modern battlefield…U.S. officials said they believe Mr. Hussain played an important role in recruiting two American Muslims to open fire in Garland, Texas, this spring on a contest for cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad.”","2252","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/28/the-daily-202-trump-says-maybe-america-should-try-making-a-jerk-president/"

"— National Review, “Calculating Ted Cruz (Ideological Purist, Shrewd Strategist),” by Eliana Johnson: “The man who boasts of his ideological purity is perhaps the most obviously tactical candidate. Whether praising Trump, changing his position on trade-promotion authority at the last moment, or getting as close as possible to Rand Paul on national security when the Paulite tendency was at its strongest, Cruz is always maneuvering to stay at the front of the parade. … But at other times, it’s Cruz who seems to be pandering. … When Paul was at his zenith, Cruz proved himself to be a deliberately slippery ally, making Paulite sounds but never fully embracing Paul’s libertarianism on national security. … Cruz’s path to the nomination clearly depends on uniting the right of the party, a rather Herculean task in such a crowded field. This is why, for all his stalwart rhetoric and talk of principle, Cruz sometimes seems unwilling to make a move that would alienate the populist Right.”","2254","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/28/the-daily-202-trump-says-maybe-america-should-try-making-a-jerk-president/"

"DNC site mistakes foreign vets for former U.S. troops. From Military Times: “Democrats’ election outreach efforts to veterans may need to start with a refresher course on what U.S. troops look like. For starters, they don’t wear Polish military uniforms. Until Thursday, the Democratic National Committee’s ‘Veterans and Military Families’ website had as its only picture a shot from White House photographers during President Obama’s visit to Warsaw in 2011. The president had been cropped out, but faces of four elderly veterans wearing European-style military uniforms were visible above several paragraphs asserting the party’s ‘commitment to America’s veterans.’ The Polish military’s White Eagle insignia was clear on the headgear of two of the veterans. … Within 90 minutes of being informed of the error by Military Times, Democratic officials swapped out the photo.

"We know those are the demographic groups Clinton targeted in 2007, apparently blind to the Obama campaign's recruitment of new caucus-goers.

"SELZER: Sanders appears to be bringing in first-time caucus-goers. So an influx of Sanders supporters could be part of what is suppressing the Clinton vote. And keep in mind, 17 percent say Clinton's e-mail situation is very or fairly important to them. A couple of points here, a couple of points there, and it adds up.

"August 28 marks the anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, best remembered as the setting for Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""I have a dream"" speech. Few Americans have recognized the date with the enthusiasm of Glenn Beck. In 2010, the conservative radio and TV host called for a sequel to the March on Washington, and the masses followed, filling the same space between the Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial that the 1963 crowd had.","August 31","2411","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/31/glenn-beck-got-20000-people-to-turn-out-for-an-all-lives-matter-rally/"
"Five years later, Beck's cultural influence has shrunken considerably. He left Fox News for a mini-empire at GlennBeck.com and The Blaze -- a more lucrative enterprise, but one that reduced his Q-rating like a prime time show relegated to Crackle.com. This past Aug. 28, when Beck gathered conservatives for an ""All Lives Matter"" rally in Birmingham, Ala., the media that had once covered his every cough was largely absent.","2412","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/31/glenn-beck-got-20000-people-to-turn-out-for-an-all-lives-matter-rally/"
"What did they miss? The latest stage of an ongoing, scattershot campaign to turn ""All Lives Matter"" from a sort of taunt into a pro-life, pro-Christian clarion call. Leading Republican candidates, from former Florida governor Jeb Bush to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), have criticized the Black Lives Matter movement as exclusionary. Its very slogan, in this reading, hints at a lack of consideration for the lives of white people or police officers.","2413","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/31/glenn-beck-got-20000-people-to-turn-out-for-an-all-lives-matter-rally/"
"""When I hear people scream ‘Black Lives Matter,’ I’m thinking, of course they do,"" former Arkansas governor Huckabee said this year. ""All lives matter.

"Last month, Huckabee spoke at a pro-life conference in Illinois on the ""All Lives Matter"" theme, and Ben Carson was scheduled to join him. (Carson's appearance was stymied by a delayed flight.) Beck's Birmingham event featured a prayer from Rafael Cruz, the pastor father of Sen.

"But the lengthy ""Restoring Unity"" rally (the 2010 Beck event was ""Restoring Honor"") was not really focused on abortion. Its general theme was that a new ""Gideon's Army"" was needed to save a fallen world; its most frequent prayers were for people in countries threatened by radical Islam and the rise of the Islamic State. Beck drew a straight line from the persecutions of the Holocaust to the anti-Christian and anti-gay murders of the Islamic State.","2416","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/31/glenn-beck-got-20000-people-to-turn-out-for-an-all-lives-matter-rally/"

"The Beck speech, filmed by several attendees, was broken up by musical numbers and remarks from Chuck Norris and John Voight. Like his 2010 address in Washington, it combined profundity with free association, story-telling with ambitious aphorisms, like ""You move from righteous anger to peaceful action."" The ""movement to end discrimination"" was described in the past tense, and Birmingham's Guiding Light Church lent its choir to perform a new song called, naturally, ""All Lives Matter.""","2418","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/31/glenn-beck-got-20000-people-to-turn-out-for-an-all-lives-matter-rally/"
"Beck's 2010 rally drew a reported 87,000 people to the Mall in Washington. The Birmingham rally drew a reported 20,000 -- and almost no national media coverage. Yet the location allowed Beck to call it the biggest rally in the city since 1963.

"Sen. Ted Cruz, who has assiduously courted evangelicals throughout his presidential run, will take a lead role in the launch this week of an ambitious 50-state campaign to end taxpayer support for Planned Parenthood — a move that is likely to give the GOP candidate a major primary-season boost in the fierce battle for social-conservative and evangelical voters.","August 23","2420","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cruzs-evangelical-outreach-moves-into-high-gear-with-new-church-based-push/2015/08/23/f8cdaaca-4858-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"

"Roughly 1 in 4 voters have identified themselves as evangelical in exit polls from the 2004 campaign on.

"“I think my natural second bracket is the evangelical bracket,’’ he told the News & Observer of Raleigh, N.C.

"Heading into the primary season, it wasn’t clear how significant a role social issues would play in the selection of the Republican nominee. But social conservatives and evangelical voters say they have been galvanized by a one-two punch this summer: first, the Supreme Court’s decision that same-sex marriage should be legal in all 50 states — and then, the release of hidden-camera videos showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing the donation of fetal tissue in a seemingly cavalier fashion.","2428","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cruzs-evangelical-outreach-moves-into-high-gear-with-new-church-based-push/2015/08/23/f8cdaaca-4858-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"
"All of the Republican candidates have found themselves spending more trail time on both issues over the past few months. Those fighting most fiercely for religious voters have made them central to their campaigns. But few candidates have made the burgeoning “religious liberty” movement in opposition to same-sex marriage and the fight to deny funding to Planned Parenthood as much of their campaign centerpiece as Cruz has — and perhaps no one is as well positioned to benefit politically from a renewed focus on those issues.","2429","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cruzs-evangelical-outreach-moves-into-high-gear-with-new-church-based-push/2015/08/23/f8cdaaca-4858-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"
"On the campaign trail, Cruz has urged people to watch the controversial Planned Parenthood videos and has repeatedly attacked the Supreme Court, where he once served as a law clerk.

"Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) have each proposed defunding Planned Parenthood and suggested that they would let the government shut down before yielding. Any shutdown would be the fault of Democrats, who would have to be “willing to try to shut down the government in order to force continued taxpayer funding from an organization that has now been caught on film apparently admitting to multiple felonies,” Cruz, who shot to conservative stardom when he led an effort to shut down the government over funding for the Affordable Care Act, told reporters earlier this month.","2431","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cruzs-evangelical-outreach-moves-into-high-gear-with-new-church-based-push/2015/08/23/f8cdaaca-4858-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"

"At his religious liberty-themed rally in Des Moines on Friday night, Cruz cast himself as the only choice for evangelical voters.

"In the Iowa ballroom that night, Cruz interviewed Dick and Betty Odgaard, an Iowa Mennonite couple who became icons in the religious liberty movement after they refused to hold a same-sex wedding at their events space, which has since closed; he held Betty Odgaard’s hand as she cried and recounted how the couple felt they could not hold a same-sex marriage because it violated their religious beliefs. The couple was sued and later closed their business. In a setting that was part church service, part talk show, he called to the stage other “heroes” who said their religious liberty had been violated, including an Oregon couple who refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple and a former Atlanta fire chief who said he was fired after releasing a self-published book in which he wrote that homosexuality was a “perversion” and morally equivalent to “pederasty” and “bestiality.”","2434","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cruzs-evangelical-outreach-moves-into-high-gear-with-new-church-based-push/2015/08/23/f8cdaaca-4858-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"

"The message resonated with undecided voters on hand, such as Jerry Miller, 65, of West Des Moines, who said the country needs a president who will put faith at the fore — a president like Cruz. “We need to put this country back to what it was founded on, Judeo-Christian values,” he said.","2439","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cruzs-evangelical-outreach-moves-into-high-gear-with-new-church-based-push/2015/08/23/f8cdaaca-4858-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html"

"— Thursday brings another decision day at the Supreme Court. We’re awaiting a handful of potentially landmark rulings, but none would shake the political landscape as much as King v. Burwell. The Court could invalidate health insurance subsidies for 6.4 million people using HealthCare.gov. If the justices rule against the Obama administration, based on a drafting error in the Affordable Care Act, it would be a major setback for the president’s biggest achievement. But, as millions of folks have come to experience positive benefits from the law, Democrats see a chance to finally play offense on Obamacare.","2467","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/18/the-daily-202-democrats-could-win-by-losing-at-the-supreme-court/"
"“I can think of no case that would more galvanize progressives across the spectrum,” Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress think tank, tells The Daily 202. “It would be a ridiculous decision and a travesty of justice, but like many travesties of justice it would serve to galvanize people.”","2468","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/18/the-daily-202-democrats-could-win-by-losing-at-the-supreme-court/"
"–A flurry of polls show that a significant majority of Americans want Congress to act if the Court strikes down the subsidies. “I definitely think this is an issue where, depending on how things go, Dems have an opportunity to give their base a reason to vote and to win over that small swath of swing voters that actually exist,” said Democratic pollster Tom Jensen, whose firm Public Policy Polling has been surveying extensively on the issue.","2469","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/18/the-daily-202-democrats-could-win-by-losing-at-the-supreme-court/"
"–Republican congressional leaders are scrambling to come up with something that gets this issue off the table ASAP. Both chambers are looking for something that punts the issue until 2017, a recognition that this is a loser for them. The House plan would give block grants for the next two years to the states that are affected, with the idea being that a new Republican president could enact an Obamacare alternative. The main Senate plan would extend the subsidies for up to two years.","2470","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/18/the-daily-202-democrats-could-win-by-losing-at-the-supreme-court/"
"–But it’s not so simple. The GOP track record of coalescing behind an Obamacare alternative is not good (See: the past five years). There will be heavy pressure from the right to roll back provisions like the individual mandate in any “fix” legislation, but there will be equally loud clamoring from GOP governors to get the problem solved. And this is all happening in the context of a presidential primary: Ted Cruz has made clear he won’t tolerate a long-term extension of the subsidies, for example. Heritage Action CEO Mike Needham published an op-ed overnight warning Republicans against extending subsidies.","2471","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/18/the-daily-202-democrats-could-win-by-losing-at-the-supreme-court/"
"“It would highlight Republican dysfunction in a way that I can’t imagine any other specific event doing,” said Democratic strategist Matt Canter. “While Republican presidential candidates’ first instinct will be to stay at a superficial, 30,000-foot level … the ones who have day jobs [as senators or governors] will be dealing with this in real time.”","2472","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/18/the-daily-202-democrats-could-win-by-losing-at-the-supreme-court/"
"–If the subsidies get struck down, control of the Supreme Court will become a major 2016 issue. There are already other rulings that could motivate liberal activists who are not otherwise thrilled with Hillary Clinton, but this would break through. Negative views of the court have increased dramatically since Obama took office. A national Gallup poll last September found that 48 percent of Americans disapprove of the way that SCOTUS is handling its job, up from 28 percent in 2009.","2473","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/18/the-daily-202-democrats-could-win-by-losing-at-the-supreme-court/"
"–This helps explain the conventional wisdom that the government is more likely than not to prevail in this case. Some court watchers think that Chief Justice John Roberts won’t want to hurt Republican chances of winning back the White House in 2016, and that perennial swing vote Anthony Kennedy is worried about maintaining the court’s legitimacy. “A negative decision on King v. Burwell we believe would galvanize progressives to focus like a laser beam on the Supreme Court’s role in this election,” said CAP’s Tanden, who was policy director on Clinton’s 2008 campaign. “Conservatives, for decades, have been more successful than progressives at making the court an issue.”","2474","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/18/the-daily-202-democrats-could-win-by-losing-at-the-supreme-court/"

"Twenty minutes. That was all it took for Islamic State terrorists to unleash a series of coordinated strikes that devastated a nation and shocked the conscience of the entire world. Glued to our television sets in the United States, we looked on in horror at scenes of chaos and bloodshed that shattered the lives of so many in Paris.","November 18","2536","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ben-carson-my-plan-to-defeat-the-islamic-state/2015/11/17/46b9e254-8d45-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483_story.html"
"Make no mistake about it: We are at war. It is not a war against an opposing nation. The Islamic State is not a sovereign in the territorial sense but is a sick and twisted ideology that seeks to engulf the region and turn back the clock to the Dark Ages. We must ask ourselves, how do we defeat an evil state of consciousness? What are the best approaches?","2537","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ben-carson-my-plan-to-defeat-the-islamic-state/2015/11/17/46b9e254-8d45-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483_story.html"
"The Obama administration has proposed a largely political, containment-based solution that is fraught with risks, including coordinating with the Russians and Iranians to win back Islamic State-controlled territory in Syria and Iraq. The problem with this strategy is that neither of these nations is a trustworthy ally; legitimizing them would lead only to further destabilization. Empowering Russia would only embolden Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Doing business with the Iranians encourages their ambitions to control the territory from Iran’s eastern border to the Mediterranean, threatening our allies in Israel and Saudi Arabia.","2538","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ben-carson-my-plan-to-defeat-the-islamic-state/2015/11/17/46b9e254-8d45-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483_story.html"
"To lead this fight, the United States must dramatically increase its efforts to appeal directly to the moderate Kurds, Syrians and Iraqis. We must convince them that the Islamic State poses a fundamental threat to their existence. And we must equip them with the means to convey that message to their people. This will require a multi-pronged communications strategy that leverages our strengths in media production and messaging, combined with cutting off traditional access routes to social media for radical Islamist groups.","2539","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ben-carson-my-plan-to-defeat-the-islamic-state/2015/11/17/46b9e254-8d45-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483_story.html"
"We have in place both the technical and legal capabilities to prohibit the widespread dissemination of hate-based propaganda disguised as religious teaching. We can monitor social media by expanding the search algorithms already in place to safeguard against inappropriate behavior, including religious hate speech. Once flagged, we can notify platform providers and encourage them to censor communications (and block users) that violate the terms of constructive discourse. The hacker group Anonymous has already provided a model for accomplishing this. We should use every tool at our disposal to root out and destroy the global online recruitment efforts of these extremist organizations. We must not allow their macabre murder videos and threats to be promoted anywhere.","2540","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ben-carson-my-plan-to-defeat-the-islamic-state/2015/11/17/46b9e254-8d45-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483_story.html"
"The Islamic State is on the offensive, and we must do more to counter their fighters and eviscerate their infrastructure. But this also means identifying and cutting off their sources of supply and funding — namely the oil fields along Syria’s eastern border. We need to either destroy the fields with airstrikes or take them and hold them with a coalition of local (Iraqi, Turkish and Kurdish) ground troops and Western military advisers and Special Operations forces. The United States can lead the way in developing a political framework and military strategy that enables this to happen. Ongoing military and economic development assistance to these nations would have to be tied to their cooperation in securing the Syrian oil fields.","2541","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ben-carson-my-plan-to-defeat-the-islamic-state/2015/11/17/46b9e254-8d45-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483_story.html"
"We also need enhanced security on our borders. We need to take additional steps to ensure that terrorists from the Middle East do not infiltrate and use refugee status to slip into the United States, which is among the countries that the Islamic State wants desperately to strike directly. But it can’t simply end with defending our borders. As a leader in the fight against Islamist extremism, the United States has certain responsibilities toward the millions of Syrians and Iraqis who have been terrorized by the Islamic State.","2542","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ben-carson-my-plan-to-defeat-the-islamic-state/2015/11/17/46b9e254-8d45-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483_story.html"
"While we should not open U.S. borders to refugees at this time, we should encourage the establishment of sanctuary zones in the contested areas of Iraq and Syria. These zones would be administered and controlled by local moderate forces, with financial support and military coordination provided by Western countries. This would not involve a significant on-the-ground presence of Western armies. But we would provide humanitarian aid in the form of shelter, food, water and medical care to fleeing refugees.","2543","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ben-carson-my-plan-to-defeat-the-islamic-state/2015/11/17/46b9e254-8d45-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483_story.html"
"The containment strategy currently employed by the Obama administration has simply not addressed the huge power vacuum created by the abdication of U.S. leadership in the region since U.S. forces left Iraq in 2011. Instead, the situation has gotten far worse than we could have imagined.","2544","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ben-carson-my-plan-to-defeat-the-islamic-state/2015/11/17/46b9e254-8d45-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483_story.html"
"Now, more than ever, the United States must be willing to lead the free world. We need to restore America’s standing by winning over the hearts and minds of populations affected by radical Islamist violence.

"Carson likes to say that he is only interested in running a positive campaign, and in many respects has been true to that idea. He is calm and quiet, he doesn’t often attack his Republican opponents, and puts intense focus on his compelling life story -- his journey from poverty in Detroit, to a successful career as a neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins.","2559","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/10/ben-carson-i-dont-want-to-get-into-a-gladiator-fight-with-trump/"

"Ben Carson became convinced of two things during his teenage years. First, that he was uniquely talented, “one of the most spectacular and smartest people in the world.” Second, that God would answer his prayers, however specific they might be. Carson absorbed his mother’s mantra: “If you ask the Lord for something and believe He will do it, then it’ll happen.”","November 5","2564","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"Little has occurred in Carson’s life and career since then to counter those impressions, and much has happened to confirm them. That may help explain why, during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, the retired neurosurgeon has appeared at times indifferent to or uninformed about matters relevant to the office he seeks, such as the federal debt ceiling or natural disasters, and has expressed little regret over his controversial comments on the Holocaust, mass shootings, slavery and Islam. After reading five of his autobiographical, self-help and political books — “Gifted Hands” (1990), “Think Big” (1992), “The Big Picture” (1999), “America the Beautiful” (2012) and “A More Perfect Union” (2015) — I find this attitude more understandable. Why stress over policy details or gaffes when you’re the brightest person in the room, and when the Big Guy will show up if you ever need a hand?","2565","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"Carson’s story is a nearly uninterrupted string of being proved right and smart. “I can learn to do anything that anybody else can do,” he tells his wife repeatedly. This certainty has guided him from Detroit, to Yale University, to medical school at the University of Michigan, to an illustrious career at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and now to the top of latest national polls in the GOP race. With that mind-set, the presidency isn’t a stretch; it’s an intellectual and divine entitlement.","2566","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"In Carson’s telling, an early instance of heavenly intervention comes during his freshman year at Yale. It is the night before a final exam in chemistry, and Carson, who had developed weak study habits in high school, is hopelessly behind in the class. If he fails, he will have to drop out of pre-med. “Either help me understand what kind of work I ought to do,” Carson prays to God, “or else perform some kind of miracle and help me pass this exam.” While he sleeps, Carson dreams that a nebulous figure enters the chemistry hall and begins working out problems, while Carson, sitting alone in class, takes rapid notes. The next morning, the actual test contains all the questions from the dream. Carson scores a 97. “For whatever reason,” he concludes, “the God of the universe, the God who holds galaxies in His hands, had seen a reason to reach down to a campus room on planet Earth and send a dream to a discouraged ghetto kid.”","2567","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"Set aside for a moment that when a college student has not prepared for an exam, yet somehow learns the questions ahead of time, supernatural assistance is but one possible explanation. God didn’t just help him pass a test, Carson decides, but also expressed divine support for the young man’s vocation. Carson tells readers that he had “the sense that God not only wanted me to be a physician, but that He had special things for me to do.”","2568","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"[11 times God intervened directly in Ben Carson’s life, according to Ben Carson]","2569","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"Throughout his books, Carson, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, describes himself as an instrument of God, and the riveting stories of his most complicated surgeries — separating twins conjoined at the head, removing large portions of brains that were causing seizures and other ailments — are suffused with the divine. “We believe that God has led us to Baltimore and directly to you for this operation,” one parent of a sick child tells him in a typical conversation.","2570","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"Carson courageously takes on impossible cases, brushes aside doubting colleagues and performs heroic surgeries. In the middle of one procedure, a 4-year-old patient goes into cardiac arrest, and Carson isn’t sure what to do. “Lord, I don’t know what’s going on or what caused this,” he prays. “Fix it, God please.” Suddenly her heart resumes pumping. “Thank you, Lord,” Carson responds. “I don’t know what happened, but clearly you fixed it.”","2571","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"[I just binge-read eight books by Donald Trump. Here’s what I learned.]","2572","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"This man of science is often skeptical of non-spiritual explanations. When a dying patient makes a surprising recovery following a high-risk surgery, Carson cuts off a Hopkins colleague offering more Earth-bound hypotheses. “This is a miracle. Why not accept it for what it is?” Carson demands. “They don’t come any more blatantly than this.”","2573","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"Such faith is self-fulfilling; the more fervently Carson believes in God’s involvement, the more he assumes it will happen again. Though still supremely confident in his medical skills — “I had been extremely well trained, was quite smart, and knew that I was especially capable” — he now has backup, too. “It has become abundantly clear to me that the Lord was letting me know . . . that He is there for me, available to be used if I call on Him,” Carson explains.","2574","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"Once you have God on speed dial, well, it’s hard not to press that button. At one point, Carson requests God’s help to find his stolen passport; it is retrieved. On the eve of a safari in South Africa, Carson asks God to “bless us with the opportunity to observe a wide variety of wildlife.” No surprise: His party witnesses such an astonishing range of animals that the guide can remember nothing like it. (“I never dreamed just how literally my prayers would be answered,” he writes.) And in a particularly unnerving intercession, Carson asks God for help in dismissing his incompetent, alcoholic secretary without hurting her feelings. (“I’m softhearted,” the doctor assures, “and it is especially hard for me to fire somebody.”) Two weeks later, the secretary doesn’t show up for work. “We never did find out what happened to her,” Carson writes. “She simply disappeared.” He regrets not being able to help her, but nevertheless, he is “thankful that this problem was resolved without any unpleasantness on my part.” Prayers answered and unpleasantness avoided, at least for the softhearted surgeon.","2575","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"Carson frequently cites a poem, “Yourself to Blame,” that his mother taught him as a kid. “If things go bad for you/ And make you a bit ashamed/ Often you will find out that/ You have yourself to blame” are the opening lines. The sentiment fits his philosophy of self-help and self-reliance, which in turn informs his views on poverty and race. Yet he rarely casts blame in his own direction. He repeatedly plagiarizes in college, but when he is finally caught, he minimizes the transgression as ignorance rather than malice. “Frankly, I had never even heard of the term plagiarism,” he writes. “Fortunately for me, the professor was very compassionate, realized that I was naive, and gave me a chance to rewrite the paper.” And when things go wrong for him in the operating room, when a patient dies, Carson concludes that the surgery was impossible from the start and, prophet-like, chastises God for wasting his talents. “Why did you let me spend so much valuable time and energy in something that could not possibly work out?” Carson asks God. “Why would you provide an opportunity like this only to allow us to fail? Why?”","2576","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"It’s easier to lecture God when you’re convinced of your own virtue. Carson seems particularly pleased with his humility, as the prideful tend to be. “I am uncomfortable with praise,” he says. “It is embarrassing to be the subject of a string of complimentary remarks.” But he is eager to detail accolades. He mentions multiple times that the medical internship he won at Johns Hopkins accepts only two students from an average of 125 applicants each year and that he became chief of pediatric neurosurgery at the tender age of 33. “God has given me not only the natural gifts of a surgeon but also the sensitivity to feel the hurt of my patients,” he writes. “This, however, does not give me the right to boast — I am only using the gifts that were given to me.”","2577","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"

"He reassures readers that achievement has not gone to his head. “After earning my M.D. degree, I tried to be aware that I was the same person I had always been,” Carson writes. “Now that I am a board-certified neurosurgeon, I am still the same individual that I was in high school. . . .

"The self-confidence of a surgeon, the dead certainty of faith and the inherent hubris of those who run for president — all these forces coalesce in Ben Carson. No wonder he is annoyed at any suggestion that he is unqualified for the Oval Office. “There are many today who think that doctors should stick to medicine and cannot possibly know anything about other areas of life,” he complains in his most recent book. “The opposite is true: Most doctors are deeply invested in areas of knowledge besides medicine.” He notes five doctors who signed the Declaration of Independence, and he disparages the political dominance of the legal profession. “While many of the founders were lawyers, many of the signers [of the Constitution] were businessmen or doctors,” he writes. “If they understood freedom enough to write the Constitution, you shouldn’t have to be a lawyer to understand it today.”","2580","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"
"His virtues and vices already call to mind recent presidents and candidates. In his books, Carson resembles President Obama in the incessant reliance on personal biography to illustrate the larger American story. The prominence of faith is reminiscent of President George W. Bush, though while Bush appeared to rely on it for individual discipline and resolve, Carson’s faith guides him through everyday tasks. And he comes off as even more confident than his chief rival for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. While Donald Trump’s books offer flashes of insecurity, Carson’s provide few that I can see.","2581","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carson-the-humblebragging-instrument-of-god/"

"When I first met Ben Carson in 1996, at his luxurious home outside Baltimore, I stood before one of my heroes. I was a college senior at the nearby University of Maryland at Baltimore County, and Carson was a leading neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital. I had been accepted to Johns Hopkins for medical school and was invited to campus as part of a “second look” weekend, where admitted African American students got the chance to interact with black medical students, young doctors and faculty members, all offering assurances that if we chose Hopkins, we would not be isolated.","October 8","2602","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/ben-carson-inspired-a-generation-of-black-doctors-now-were-disappointed-in-him/"
"Our experience culminated with brunch at Carson’s home. As a future doctor, I felt genuinely thrilled to meet him. Here was a black man who had excelled in academics, rather than the familiar avenues of sports and entertainment. His important work not only saved lives but gave him entrée to the highest echelons of society. Carson’s impact on other African American students who aspired to become physicians was equally profound. In every group of black pre-meds or medical students I met, someone invariably wanted to become a neurosurgeon, and Carson’s name was always mentioned. This wasn’t just my experience: Black medical students are about five times as likely as their non-black classmates to choose neurological surgery as their specialty.","2603","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/ben-carson-inspired-a-generation-of-black-doctors-now-were-disappointed-in-him/"
"Today, Carson’s greatest fans are no longer those within the black community. Instead, in a bizarre twist, he has become a major star among the far-right – the faction of the Republican Party often perceived as being indifferent, or worse, to African Americans. Many black doctors – given our longstanding adulation of Carson – are puzzled and discouraged by this evolution. The man who built his brand as a black icon has found a new home. And it’s a place where many of us feel unwelcome.","2604","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/ben-carson-inspired-a-generation-of-black-doctors-now-were-disappointed-in-him/"

Raised by an uneducated single mother in inner-city Detroit, he overcame this inauspicious beginning to become a pioneering neurosurgeon at one of the world’s greatest medical institutions.","2606","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/ben-carson-inspired-a-generation-of-black-doctors-now-were-disappointed-in-him/"
"Even then, he espoused what are commonly described as conservative values: faith, family and self-reliance. We had long heard rumors that Carson had conservative political leanings, but that did nothing to diminish his standing within the black community. Nor should it have. He was rightly viewed as a hero, someone who used his platform to encourage us to make the best of ourselves. Jesse Jackson, then in his heyday as a political figure, wrote a blurb for Carson’s first book in 1990, describing him as “a model to all the youth of today.” Ta-Nehisi Coates, who grew up in Baltimore during the ’80s and ’90s, frequently saw Carson at his school and admired him for “regularly giving his time to talk to young people, who needed to know that there was so much more beyond the streets.”","2607","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/ben-carson-inspired-a-generation-of-black-doctors-now-were-disappointed-in-him/"
"But as his surgical career approached its end, Carson reinvented himself. In February 2013, he delivered a scathing critique of President Obama’s policies at the National Prayer Breakfast while Obama sat nearby. Overnight, Carson became a celebrity of an entirely different magnitude to a completely different audience. The Wall Street Journal urged him to run for president, and he soon became a fixture on Fox News Channel. His quiet conservatism became reactionary. Suddenly, people who had never heard of Carson were treating him like an overnight sensation.","2608","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/ben-carson-inspired-a-generation-of-black-doctors-now-were-disappointed-in-him/"

"For many of us still trying to reconcile the current version of Carson with our formative impressions, it doesn’t matter that he is a Republican. There are prominent examples of black Republicans – Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Louis W. Sullivan (who was secretary of Health and Human Services under George H.W. Bush) – who still enjoy favorable reception within the black community. Whatever their disagreements with Democrats, they present themselves as thoughtful, open-minded and optimistic.","2611","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/ben-carson-inspired-a-generation-of-black-doctors-now-were-disappointed-in-him/"
"What distinguishes Carson is his intense appeal to the most strident wing of the GOP and his open disdain for Obama. It is perfectly fine to disagree with Obama; quite a few African Americans from both the left and the right do. It’s fine, of course, to support a different candidate. But it is altogether different to give Obama no credit for ascending to the highest office in the United States, a feat that so many Americans – black, white and other – never thought would be possible for a black man. Sullivan, a lifelong Republican, acknowledges being deeply affected by Obama’s inauguration even if “I might wish he were doing some things differently.” In contrast, Carson said that Obama has succeeded because he operates “like a psychopath.”","2612","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/ben-carson-inspired-a-generation-of-black-doctors-now-were-disappointed-in-him/"
"Carson has leveled some of his most vicious attacks on the Obama administration’s signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act, calling it “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.” However appealing those words may be to Obama’s biggest detractors, they are absurd. Yes, the health-care law is imperfect, but it is a very real effort to stem the tide of uninsured Americans over the past three decades. Slavery, segregation and Jim Crow it is not. No black person, regardless of political affiliation, should ever make such a suggestion.","2613","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/ben-carson-inspired-a-generation-of-black-doctors-now-were-disappointed-in-him/"
"Nor should any doctor. Lacking health insurance is a big deal. Diagnoses are delayed, chronic conditions are poorly managed and medical complications are more likely to ensue. And African Americans are about 60 percent more likely than whites to be uninsured, an important reason why black people continue to experience far worse health outcomes across a variety of measures. Expanding health insurance won’t fix this problem by itself, but it is a crucial first step. Carson has acknowledged the need to expand health insurance coverage (albeit in a different manner). But his anti-Obama rhetoric drowns out this significant message.","2614","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/ben-carson-inspired-a-generation-of-black-doctors-now-were-disappointed-in-him/"

"Many black physicians will always be indebted to the role Carson played in inspiring us to enter the medical profession. This is especially true for me, a black man who grew up in the sort of environment where becoming a professional athlete – or a felon – seemed a more likely possibility.","2616","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/ben-carson-inspired-a-generation-of-black-doctors-now-were-disappointed-in-him/"
"But Carson’s new identity as political provocateur baffles and disappoints us all at once. It highlights the way that we in the black community focus all of our energy on celebrating just a few superstars. For example, while the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is deservedly the most revered African American in our history, focusing on him to the exclusion of others does a disservice to the likes of Thurgood Marshall, A. Philip Randolph, Dorothy Height and other leaders in the civil rights movement. Similarly, medicine offers many other black role models, such as physicians Levi Watkins, Keith Black and David Satcher – each of whom overcame major obstacles to reach professional success, just as Carson has. Although these men are largely unknown, their stories are no less worthy of our praise than Carson’s.","2617","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/ben-carson-inspired-a-generation-of-black-doctors-now-were-disappointed-in-him/"
"I respect Carson’s desire to be more than a “black role model.” I agree that greater racial harmony is achievable by focusing more on our similarities than on our differences. And no, Obama has not been perfect when it comes to race. But Carson’s callous denigration of Obama appears designed primarily to expand his platform. It comes across as opportunistic and polarizing, unbecoming of a widely respected figure who has positioned himself for so long as a humble voice of reason. As a black man who has looked up to Carson for so many years, I hope that he can figure out how to take his conservative beliefs and aim them at helping to heal the nation’s racial wounds.","2618","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/ben-carson-inspired-a-generation-of-black-doctors-now-were-disappointed-in-him/"

"The first and arguably the most viciously attacked was Al Smith, four-time New York governor and the Democratic nominee in 1928. Smith’s Catholicism became the target of a vitriolic campaign against him. Fliers warned voters that Smith, if elected, would annul Protestants’ marriages and confiscate their Bibles, Smith biographer Robert Slayton wrote in the New York Times in 2012, and opponents claimed that a photo of the newly built Holland Tunnel, which links Manhattan and New Jersey, was actually a secret passageway between Washington and Rome. An anti-Smith political cartoon showed the pope and several bishops seated at a table while Smith, wearing a bellboy’s uniform, waited on them. The cartoon was captioned: “Cabinet Meeting — If Al Were President.”","2786","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/09/21/despite-backlash-ben-carson-is-not-backing-down-from-his-opposition-to-a-muslim-president/"
"Even respected intellectuals questioned whether a Catholic could be trusted to be loyal to the county. In a letter published in the Atlantic Monthly, lawyer and religion scholar Charles Marshall detailed the “inevitable and irreconcilable” conflict between Catholic teachings and the Constitution, and demanded that Smith promise not to put his allegiance to the pope above his allegiance to the country.","2787","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/09/21/despite-backlash-ben-carson-is-not-backing-down-from-his-opposition-to-a-muslim-president/"

"Those same concerns came up about John F. Kennedy during the 1960 election. Radio evangelist G.E. Lowman warned that a Catholic president would be “in the position of cooperating fully with the Pope, taking advice from the Pope, accepting the counseling of the pope and giving the Roman Catholic Church and its teachings preeminence over the Constitution of the United States!” But three decades after Smith’s loss, those arguments seemed to have less sticking power. Kennedy became the country’s first — and, so far, only — vocally non-Protestant president.","2789","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/09/21/despite-backlash-ben-carson-is-not-backing-down-from-his-opposition-to-a-muslim-president/"
"But suspicion of candidates’ religions didn’t go away. Lest we forget the not-so-distant past, remember that Mitt Romney’s Mormonism was regarded with suspicion during his 2008 and 2012 campaigns. A Pew poll in 2007 had found that a quarter of Americans were less likely to support a candidate who was Mormon. Four years later, a South Carolina voter told NPR she could not elect Romney because Mormonism “is not a biblical-based, Judeo-Christian religion.

"Ben Carson ought to get ready, because things are about to get very difficult for him. In fact, we can probably start the clock on the demise of his presidential candidacy.","October 27","2796","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/why-ben-carsons-candidacy-is-doomed/"
"Okay, so that’s a little dramatic. But today we saw the first national poll, from the New York Times and CBS, that puts Carson in the lead in the Republican race. Yes, it’s only one poll, and yes, that lead is within the margin of error, meaning he may not actually be ahead (the poll averages still have him trailing Donald Trump by a few points). But he’s clearly leading in Iowa, and this poll will be taken as a cue for the press to give him more scrutiny than he’s gotten so far. Carson has been getting more media attention, but that focus will intensify now. And it won’t be good for him.","2797","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/why-ben-carsons-candidacy-is-doomed/"
"In a year in which outsiders are all the rage, Carson is the most outsidery of all. Ted Cruz is a U.S. senator who built his identity by hating the institution he’s a part of and everyone who’s in it — but he’s still a senator. Carly Fiorina is a former CEO — but she ran for office before and has been involved in politics for some time. Even Donald Trump is less of an outsider than Carson. He may be just as ignorant about policy, but there’s a surface plausibility to him being president. He runs a company, you can see him on TV ordering people around, and he’s got a plane with his name on it.","2798","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/why-ben-carsons-candidacy-is-doomed/"
"With each passing week, however, Carson has been gaining. All of his shocking statements on things like Muslims not being allowed to run for president unless they publicly disavow their religion, or Obamacare being the worst thing since slavery, or that the Jews might have stopped the Holocaust if they had more guns, only seem to have helped him win support for his campaign. But there’s a limit to everything.","2799","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/why-ben-carsons-candidacy-is-doomed/"
"As of now, Ben Carson’s actual plans for being president will get much more attention. And even Republicans may not be happy with all of what they hear.","2800","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/why-ben-carsons-candidacy-is-doomed/"
"Take, for example, Carson’s plan to shut down Medicare and Medicaid and replace them with health savings accounts. From a policy standpoint, it’s utterly daft. But it’s also about as politically unwise as you could imagine. Medicare is one of the two most beloved government programs there is. Even though Republicans would love to get rid of it (in part because its success stands as a constant rebuke to their belief that government can’t do anything right), they always insist that their plans to cut or transform it are really about “strengthening Medicare to make sure it’s there for future generations.” They know that saying anything other than that they love the program and want it to exist forever is somewhere between treacherous and suicidal.","2801","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/why-ben-carsons-candidacy-is-doomed/"
"That doesn’t stop Democrats from charging that Republicans want to destroy the program, an attack that usually works. And with Carson, there wouldn’t be any doubt — he does want to end Medicare.","2802","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/why-ben-carsons-candidacy-is-doomed/"
"What else does he want to do if he becomes president? His ideas are almost absurdly vague, a fact that will become more and more evident as he gets more attention. Go to the “Issues” section of his web site, and you’ll search in vain for anything resembling an actual proposal. When he is asked about particular policy issues, he tends to offer something so simplistic and divorced from reality that it often seems like it’s the first time he’s ever thought about it. How might he change the tax system? Well, how about a tithe, like in the Bible? (Or actually not like in the Bible, but never mind that.) How would that actually work? He doesn’t know, and barely seems to care.","2803","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/why-ben-carsons-candidacy-is-doomed/"
"Carson certainly checks off many of the standard Republican boxes: overturn Roe v. Wade, balanced budget amendment to the Constitution (as idiotic an idea as either party has ever produced, but that’s a topic for another day), show Russia who’s boss, more guns, and so on. But as he’s forced to talk more about a Carson presidency, he’s likely to get lots of negative coverage growing out of his own lack of understanding of government.","2804","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/why-ben-carsons-candidacy-is-doomed/"
"You see, the journalists covering Carson come from that same Washington world he finds so alien, and they’ll be drawn to talking about his unfamiliarity with it. This has nothing to do with liberalism or conservatism — someone like Ted Cruz, who’s every bit as conservative as Carson, can have a conversation about the presidency with reporters in which they’re all inhabiting the same planet. They can ask him a question about something like defense spending or Social Security or foreign policy, and while his answers might be oversimplified, they won’t make the reporters say, “Oh my god, did he just say what I think he said?”","2805","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/why-ben-carsons-candidacy-is-doomed/"
"You might reply that Donald Trump knows just as little as Carson, and also gives ridiculous answers to policy questions. But Trump’s ability to blow through those questions (“When I’m president, it’ll be terrific!”) is possible because his supporters don’t really care about the answers. They’re not party loyalists who are concerned with ideological fealty or electability.","2806","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/why-ben-carsons-candidacy-is-doomed/"
"But Carson’s support right now is centered on evangelicals and older Republicans, and they’re more pragmatic than you might think. Yes, they’ll support someone like Carson for a while — just as they gave Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee victories in Iowa — but that support isn’t permanent. Once other Republican candidates start going after Carson for wanting to eliminate Medicare (Donald Trump has already started), many of Carson’s voters are going to say, “Well that’s not going to go over too well,” and even, “I’m not sure I like that.” The more attention he gets, the less electable he’s going to look.","2807","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/why-ben-carsons-candidacy-is-doomed/"
"Am I being premature? Perhaps. Carson is so popular with evangelicals in part because they’ve known him for years (his autobiography is a common assignment in Christian home-school curricula everywhere). His combination of a calm, soothing manner and absolutely radical ideas has proven compelling to a healthy chunk of the Republican electorate. It’s entirely possible that he could sustain this support enough to win Iowa and then receive all the glowing coverage such a victory would produce. And the very fact that he’s doing as well as he is makes for a fascinating story. But it isn’t going to last.","2808","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/27/why-ben-carsons-candidacy-is-doomed/"

"Things unraveled more when Carson waded into foreign policy. Stephanopoulos noted Carson is the only major candidate to oppose President George W. Bush's invasion of Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In explaining his position, Carson sounded like a student who was called on in class to talk about something he hadn't quite read up on.

"No, it isn't, for a variety of reasons. First of all, Clinton could win 100 percent of the white vote and 100 percent of the Hispanic vote, in which case Carson's 13 percent of the black vote isn't going to do him much good. Again: That's not likely. But it's not impossible.","2883","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/ben-carsons-plan-to-win-enough-black-voters-to-be-elected-president-has-some-flaws/"

"In 2012, Mitt Romney got six percent of the black vote. Four years earlier, John McCain got four percent and four years before that, George W. Bush got 11 percent. Bush's 11 percent was enough to get him across the finish line, which is maybe why Carson's team thinks 13 percent will put it away. But Bush also got 44 percent of the Hispanic vote to McCain's 31 and Romney's 27. Bush got 44 percent of the Asian vote, too -- versus 35 percent and 26 percent for the next two Republicans, respectively. In other words, unless Carson makes significant in-roads among other groups as well, that 13 percent among black voters won't necessarily do him much good.","2885","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/ben-carsons-plan-to-win-enough-black-voters-to-be-elected-president-has-some-flaws/"
"If we contrast 2012 results to available exit polling, we can see that 13 percent of the African American vote in 2012 wouldn't have done Romney any good, either. The states with the highest population of black voters are primarily ones that vote heavily Republican: Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina. Shifting the black electorate slightly more to the right in those states would only make the Republican victories there larger. In other states, like Colorado or New Hampshire, a Republican victory isn't far out of reach -- but there simply aren't a lot of black voters.","2886","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/ben-carsons-plan-to-win-enough-black-voters-to-be-elected-president-has-some-flaws/"
"What Romney would have needed is a stronger black vote in places with closer results and larger black populations. Places like Florida, Ohio and Virginia. The next problem, though, is that shifting a small part of the population a small amount has an even smaller effect on the end result.","2887","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/ben-carsons-plan-to-win-enough-black-voters-to-be-elected-president-has-some-flaws/"
"In 2012, Ohio's electorate was 15 percent black, according to exit polling, and President Obama won the state by three points. Black voters supported Obama by a 93-point margin, 96.5 percent for the incumbent and 3.5 percent for Romney. If you jack that Romney percentage up to 13 percent, as Williams would like to do, it shifts the overall vote to the Republicans -- by 2.7 percent. Not enough for Romney to have won.","2888","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/ben-carsons-plan-to-win-enough-black-voters-to-be-elected-president-has-some-flaws/"

"Only in Florida would it have made a difference. There, a 0.9-point Obama victory becomes a 1.3-point Romney one. Which would have shifted the electoral vote calculus from 332 votes for Obama to 303 votes -- still a 68 electoral college vote win for the president. No other state for which we have exit poll data becomes a Romney win under the ""13-points"" strategy, including Pennsylvania, Massachusetts or New York. Some close states like North Carolina and Indiana were won by Romney anyway.","2890","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/ben-carsons-plan-to-win-enough-black-voters-to-be-elected-president-has-some-flaws/"
"What's left over are states that Obama or Romney won handily, states that have small black populations and/or states that don't have many electoral votes. If Romney had gotten the support from black voters that Armstrong says Carson can get, he'd still be sitting in his home right now instead of sitting in the White House.","2891","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/ben-carsons-plan-to-win-enough-black-voters-to-be-elected-president-has-some-flaws/"

Donald Trump, in contrast, does. When challenged, he becomes more forceful. He exhales a gale of fibs and just shoulders his way through until his interrogator, some hapless journalist, surrenders.

"Of course, the Declaration of Independence was crafted by a committee charged by the Continental Congress, which was made up of delegates who had been elected by the Colonial assemblies. But we’ll assume that Carson knew that, and instead meant that prior to being elected to Congress, the delegates had had no elected office experience. Is that correct?","2907","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carsons-absurd-notion-that-the-founding-fathers-had-no-elected-office-experience/"
"Let’s start with Thomas Jefferson, the primary writer of the Declaration of Independence. Years earlier, he had been a student at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg. As luck would have it, the House of Burgesses met there, and so Jefferson as a student was able to witness legislative debates.","2908","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carsons-absurd-notion-that-the-founding-fathers-had-no-elected-office-experience/"
"The House of Burgesses evolved from the first European-style legislative assembly in the Americas, the General Assembly that was formed in 1619. And in 1769, seven years before penning the Declaration, Jefferson was elected to the House of Burgesses. As an online biography of the signers said: “It was there that his involvement in revolutionary politics began. He was never a very vocal member, but his writing, his quiet work in committee, and his ability to distill large volumes of information to essence, made him an invaluable member in any deliberative body.”","2909","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carsons-absurd-notion-that-the-founding-fathers-had-no-elected-office-experience/"
"Now let’s look at the other members of the drafting committee: John Adams (Mass.) was elected to the Massachusetts Assembly in 1770, Benjamin Franklin (Pa.) had been elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1751 and served as speaker in 1764, and Roger Sherman (Conn.) had been elected to the Connecticut General Assembly in 1755. Only Robert R. Livingston (N.Y.) had minimal political experience.","2910","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carsons-absurd-notion-that-the-founding-fathers-had-no-elected-office-experience/"

"John Hancock, president of the Continental Congress, had been elected to the Boston Assembly and had participated in the Stamp Act Congress, a gathering of elected representatives (from Colonial assemblies) to craft a response to new British tax laws. Some states sent delegations with little political experience, but every member of the seven-person delegation from Virginia had been elected to the Houses of Burgesses.","2912","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carsons-absurd-notion-that-the-founding-fathers-had-no-elected-office-experience/"

"Indeed, one reason why the American Revolution was successful is because it was led by men with many years in politics, political action and protest, often honed in the debates held in Colonial legislatures. In many ways, the background of the Founding Fathers undercuts the very argument Carson was trying to make.","2915","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carsons-absurd-notion-that-the-founding-fathers-had-no-elected-office-experience/"

"And so it may seem during these fine days in the charmed life of Ben Carson. The man has suffered a series of trials that would doom a mortal politician. In Tuesday night’s debate, he bungled a question about foreign policy (he seems to think China is fighting in Syria, and he talked about making the Islamic State “look like losers”).

Thank you, Father, for this person that you’ve called out for such a time as this to be a voice of reason — to be, God, a testimony for you,” Nasser prayed. “Lord, if this is the leader that you’ve called for us, we pray, Father, that it would be very clear to people, and . . . that there will be just crystal clarity, Father, for us as your people on how to serve, Father, your kingdom first and then be great citizens of this nation, whoever that leader is.”","2930","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ben-carson-is-the-anointed-one/2015/11/11/b000370e-88bd-11e5-9a07-453018f9a0ec_story.html"

"At Liberty, Carson spoke about doing poorly on medical-school exams and being told by the counselor that he wasn’t “cut out to be a doctor.” Carson said he prayed (“Lord, I always thought you wanted me to be a doctor”) and got an answer: He would stop attending “boring lectures” and would read instead.","2933","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ben-carson-is-the-anointed-one/2015/11/11/b000370e-88bd-11e5-9a07-453018f9a0ec_story.html"

"Over seven in 10 Republicans have a positive view of Carson (71 percent), similar to his 68 percent favorable rating in a Post-ABC poll six weeks ago. Businessman Donald Trump is close behind, with 69 percent favorability among Republicans, followed by Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) at 58 percent, former Florida governor Jeb Bush at 56 percent and Sen.

"What distinguishes Carson from his opponents is how intensely Republicans like him -- 39 percent report a ""strongly"" favorable view of Carson, 13 points higher than for Trump (26 percent) and more than twice as many with strongly positive views of Rubio (19), Cruz (18) or Bush (12).","2944","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/10/ben-carson-still-the-most-popular-man-in-presidential-politics/"

"Carson also boasts largely positive ratings beyond the Republican party. By 50 percent to 32 percent, considerably more Americans have a favorable than unfavorable view of Carson. And in fact, that 50 percent favorable rating is the best for any presidential candidate in Post-ABC polling going back several months. The last candidate who had half the country like them was Hillary Rodham Clinton in July (52 percent) -- and even then, she had significantly more detractors than Carson does today.","2946","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/10/ben-carson-still-the-most-popular-man-in-presidential-politics/"
"The poll was conducted Wednesday through Sunday, so it doesn't cover the entire period during which Carson faced the most scrutiny.

But it does include many interviews conducted during the controversy.","2947","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/10/ben-carson-still-the-most-popular-man-in-presidential-politics/"

"The survey finds one bit of negative news for Carson: His unfavorable ratings among political independents have risen to 35 percent, up from 23 percent six weeks ago.

"Rubio’s 58 percent favorable rating among Republicans is right in the middle of the pack, but his position is better considering 1 in 5 Republicans have no opinion of him. As noted, he has the next-to-lowest unfavorable rating of 22 percent -- a sign he has not alienated significant portions of the party and has room to grow his already-solid appeal.","2951","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/10/ben-carson-still-the-most-popular-man-in-presidential-politics/"
"Perhaps most importantly for an establishment-type candidate, Rubio is also overwhelmingly popular among strong conservatives. Fully 75 percent of Republicans and independents who call themselves “very conservative” have a favorable view of Rubio. That matches Carson and Trump and is similar to Cruz at 72 percent.","2952","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/10/ben-carson-still-the-most-popular-man-in-presidential-politics/"

"More than one-third of Republicans (37 percent) have an unfavorable opinion of Bush. That's higher than any other candidate tested in the poll and a significant obstacle to winning the party’s nomination. Where Rubio is strong among very conservative Americans, Bush is less popular. Just about half of very conservative Republicans and independents have a positive view of Bush (51 percent), while 43 percent are unfavorable. This dynamic has tracked in Post-ABC polls throughout the year, with Bush faring worse among the most conservative swaths of the GOP electorate.","2954","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/10/ben-carson-still-the-most-popular-man-in-presidential-politics/"
"It’s worth noting Mitt Romney won the 2012 nomination despite weak support from strong conservatives, but he maintained consistent vote support from more moderate Republicans, which Bush hasn’t so far. Bush also cannot claim Romney's veneer of general-election appeal; 36 percent of all Americans rate him favorably, while 55 percent see him unfavorably.","2955","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/10/ben-carson-still-the-most-popular-man-in-presidential-politics/"
"Trump’s image troubles are of a much different nature, but they suggest even bigger challenges when it comes to winning a general election.

"ST. LOUIS -- Joined by Ferguson, Missouri's mayor, Ben Carson spent Friday morning in the place where America's new conversation on race and policing began. The neurosurgeon and presidential candidate got a guided tour of the small suburb, including the intersection where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer in August 2014, then headed to an St. Louis airport hotel for a roundtable with activists, pastors, and politicians.","September 11","3015","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"""I heard more than one time how the thing that really inflamed the community was the fact that Michael Brown's body laid out on the street for four hours,"" said Carson. ""I think a lot of people understood that he had done bad things, but his body didn't have to be disrespected. I heard also that people need to learn how to respect authority.""","3016","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"Carson was the first declared candidate of either party to visit the city, though Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) held a ""listening session"" before announcing his bid, and Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig made a visit before launching his. Unlike Paul, Carson kept the roundtable -- and the tour -- closed to press. According to Mayor James Knowles, who has invited any and all contenders to Ferguson, Carson's tour included a stop at the city's only coffee shop, lunch at an Italian restaurant, and conversations with the people who happened by. The mayor also tried to connect Carson with Brown's father, though the scheduling didn't pan out. Among the roundtable invitees were Ella Jones and Wesley Bell, two black Ferguson residents elected to city council in the wake of the Brown shooting; Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder (R-Mo.), the leading Republican candidate for governor, joined both the roundtable and the tour.","3017","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"""At lunch, we were discussing some of the young people who protested in this community,"" said Kinder, who has endorsed Gov. Scott Walker (R-Wis.) for president. ""Dr. Carson generously and graciously said that he could have been among them. From his humble beginnings on the mean streets and tough neighborhoods of Detroit, growing up in a single parent household, he could have ended up where Michael Brown ended up.""","3018","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"Carson, the only black presidential candidate in either party, has alternated between praise and criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement. In a 2014 interview, he linked the decline of families and communities to ""the women's lib movement,"" and just this month he wrote in USA Today that ""the notion that some lives might matter less than others is meant to enrage,"" which might be ""distracting."" Yet in the same column -- distributed at his post-Ferguson press conference -- Carson wrote that ""the protesters are right that racial policing issues exist.""","3019","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"The most prominent Black Lives Matter activists did not make it to the Hilton Garden Inn. Carson said he was open to meeting them, though his ""beef"" with the movement was that it did not seem adequately concerned with lives ""that are eradicated by abortions."" Some Black Lives Matter activists wanted the Department of Justice to bring a federal monitor to Ferguson, and Carson said locals had told him ""was probably more hurtful than helpful to have DOJ involvement.""","3020","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"Apart from that, Carson said that the activists's concerns were well-founded. ""It is very important that police are taught to be respectful of everyone,"" said Carson. ""One lady was talking about the fact that she woke up, her son woke up, and said: 'There are police out there all over the place! There are armored vehicles out there!' She went outside, a policeman was walking on the sidewalk, and she asked him: 'What's going on?' He said, 'nothing.' That's not respectful. We need to make sure that respect is offered in both directions.""","3021","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"Asked what programs or reforms he might favor for Ferguson, Carson shifted the conversation to local actors and to individual acts of education, charity, and outreach. He did not take a firm position on whether the many municipal courts of the St. Louis area should be consolidated, or whether the many courts were unfairly filling city coffers with tickets on black people -- something suggested after the Department of Justice and media outlets started looking into the system.","3022","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"""Does that need to be studied? Of course it does,"" said Carson. ""When we talk about liberty and justice for all, that's exactly what it means. We don't treat anybody specially, we don't persecute anybody specially. When we find evidence of that happening, we use our intellect and our goodwill to remedy the situation. Let's do it on the basis of evidence. That's one of the wonderful things about medicine -- we make decisions based on evidence, not on emotion, not on ideology.""","3023","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"Carson took a similar approach to the debate over mandatory body cameras for police officers, an idea that gained steam after the Michael Brown killing, but has been thwarted in some states by aggressive lobbying from law enforcement unions.","3024","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"""I'm not really favor of a lot more federal programs, to be honest with you,"" Carson said. ""I certainly would not have a problem with block-granting to states funding for body cameras and things of that nature... for anything that I block-granted to the states, I would tell them that if they are able to accomplish whatever they want to do with 80 percent of that, they can do whatever they want with the rest.""","3025","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"Carson's observations on the Ferguson visit lasted for 29 minutes. The only off-topic question -- about becoming the latest Republican recipient of Donald Trump's insults -- got a quick dismissal, with a complaint about ""the media"" making a controversy out of nothing. At one point, as his wife Candy watched from the front row, Carson's eyes grew damp as he talked about the conversations he'd had.","3026","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"""One of the things that touched me a lot was listening to someone who had lost her business during the riots,"" said Carson. ""She’s a mother of three sons. She was talking about how every day, when her sons went out, she worried about would happen to them, and I started thinking about what my mother must have gone through. She had to work two or three jobs at a time. She would leave the house at 5 in the morning -- wouldn't get back until midnight. And we were on our own. She must have been so worried about what would happen to us.""","3027","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"Mayor Knowles, who had spent an uncomfortable year in the spotlight, said that visits by Carson and his rivals could do more then continue the conversation about black lives. They could help change the city's image.","3028","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/11/ben-carson-visits-ferguson-missouri/"
"""To go into a coffee shop and see residents of all different races interacting with each other really is a stark contrast from what the national media has presented,"" said Knowles, who recently thwarted a recall campaign.

"Challenged on his tendency toward Nazi metaphors, Carson’s instinct is to double down. “Interestingly enough, in the last several weeks I’ve heard from many people in the Jewish community, including rabbis, who said, ‘You’re spot on,’ ” Carson told NBC’s Chuck Todd on Sunday. “It is generally agreed that it is much more difficult to dominate people who are armed than people who are not armed.

"The foolishness is entirely on Carson’s part, and, unfortunately, on the part of Republican voters who seem inexplicably mesmerized by his soft-spoken outrageousness.

"You don’t have to be German, or a student of German history, to grasp the repugnance of Nazi analogies, but being at the scene of Hitler’s crimes helps reinforce the caution against comparing the Holocaust to anything except another genocide. Nothing about which Carson complains — alleged but unproven IRS targeting of Obama administration critics, what he sees as the chilling effect of political correctness — comes close to the brutality of Hitler’s Germany.","3044","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/thinking-of-making-a-nazi-analogy-just-dont/2015/10/27/22778508-7cca-11e5-afce-2afd1d3eb896_story.html"
"On guns, Carson’s ahistorical notion that an armed populace, or armed Jews, could have stopped Hitler is nonsensical.

"“With regard to possession and carrying of firearms, the Nazi regime relaxed the gun laws that were in place in Germany at the time the Nazis seized power,” Harcourt wrote.

"Even as the Nazis relaxed gun ownership rules for others, Hitler in 1938 barred Jews from having guns and other weapons. But Jews accounted for less than 1 percent of the German population.

"“It’s evident on a daily basis that he hasn’t given all these things a lot of thought,” an adviser to a rival Republican presidential campaign said Tuesday. “The more he speaks, the more you realize that he does not have depth on any of these issues.” However, the adviser noted that Carson’s favorables are “astronomical,” which makes it difficult for any of the other contenders to really attack him on the topic.","3103","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/10/28/why-the-evangelicals-fueling-ben-carsons-rise-dont-much-care-that-hes-a-seventh-day-adventist/"

"The entry into the presidential race of a candidate from a small, not-well-known faith is reminiscent of when Romney brought Americans’ attention to Mormonism. Yet Americans know even less today about the Adventist faith. Adventist Today, a major independent Adventist news site, reported Tuesday that “in major surveys of the general public conducted for the Adventist denomination, about half of Americans say they have never heard of the Adventist faith and nine out of ten say they know nothing about it even if they recognize the name. The Adventist message has not connected with most Americans, leaving them uncertain about what it is.”","3105","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/10/28/why-the-evangelicals-fueling-ben-carsons-rise-dont-much-care-that-hes-a-seventh-day-adventist/"
"Among the most significant aspects of Adventism that many Americans may have heard about is its intense belief in the importance of observing the Sabbath — and doing so on Saturdays, as early Christians did, and Orthodox Jews do today. While more progressive Adventists are less firm on the divine importance of Saturday — a few churches even switched services to Sunday — the vast majority of Adventists consider Saturday observance a core truth, something that potentially could separate out God’s favored when Judgement Day comes.","3106","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/10/28/why-the-evangelicals-fueling-ben-carsons-rise-dont-much-care-that-hes-a-seventh-day-adventist/"
"Another basic part of Adventist culture is physical health, which is why there are many large Adventist health-food stores and hospital chains. Adventists believe the body and soul are one and discourage members from drinking alcohol and using drugs and tobacco. A large percentage of Adventists are vegetarians.","3107","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/10/28/why-the-evangelicals-fueling-ben-carsons-rise-dont-much-care-that-hes-a-seventh-day-adventist/"

"This is in good part because of lack of familiarity, but there are also differences in theology.

"Hoping to join the evangelical mainstream, Seventh-day Adventist leaders in the 1950s initiated a series of meetings with evangelical leaders that ended with a kind of quiet evangelical acceptance.","3115","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/10/28/why-the-evangelicals-fueling-ben-carsons-rise-dont-much-care-that-hes-a-seventh-day-adventist/"
"Adventists initially had rejected the concept of the Trinity. Their faith continues to teach that when you die you cease to exist — in other words that there is no soul — because it requires the resurrection for God to remember who you are and make those worthy whole again. And then there was the difference of the Sabbath, which, put most sharply, means that some Adventists think Sunday-Sabbath people are doomed. One of the founders of Adventism, Ellen White, was believed to have prophetic visions, something mainstream evangelicalism rejected because it was outside of the Bible.","3116","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/10/28/why-the-evangelicals-fueling-ben-carsons-rise-dont-much-care-that-hes-a-seventh-day-adventist/"
"In the mid-20th century, a more evangelical, pragmatic group of Adventists came to power and reached out to evangelicals in a series of dialogues. It ended with an authoritative book revered by many evangelicals — sort of a who’s-in-who’s out, litmus test of a book — called Kingdom of Cults, declaring Adventism “an evangelical, albeit unique Christian denomination.”","3117","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/10/28/why-the-evangelicals-fueling-ben-carsons-rise-dont-much-care-that-hes-a-seventh-day-adventist/"
"The reality is that Adventists, like other faith communities, vary widely on how literally they take their teachings. Adventists have swung over the decades in leadership from more or less literal. This year, Adventists broke into controversy when their governing body affirmed that women can’t be considered ordained clergy — despite the fact that many Adventist churches in the West actually have women they consider their pastors — and voted to confirm that their denomination believes in the literal six-day creation story.","3118","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/10/28/why-the-evangelicals-fueling-ben-carsons-rise-dont-much-care-that-hes-a-seventh-day-adventist/"
"But theology isn’t the issue for evangelicals — it’s culture, according to Dean Inserra, pastor of the influential Southern Baptist City Church.

They like Carson in that context.","3119","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/10/28/why-the-evangelicals-fueling-ben-carsons-rise-dont-much-care-that-hes-a-seventh-day-adventist/"
"“We jump on candidates who use a few Christian buzzwords and now the flavor of the month is Ben Carson.

"For all the attention paid to Donald Trump in the Republican presidential race, the candidate with the most momentum at the moment is Ben Carson. Carson, a world-renowned pediatric neurosurgeon, is making major gains in Iowa -- with two new polls showing him tied with or running a close second to Trump. I reached out to Barry Bennett, Carson's campaign manager, for more insight into the candidate's appeal in Iowa, and more broadly. Our conversation, conducted via e-mail, is below -- edited only for grammar and clarity.","3127","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/02/ben-carson-is-the-smartest-man-i-have-ever-met/"

"Bennett: We think his appeal is multi-layered. You start with a doctor with a pediatric specialty. That makes him caring. Add that he is a renowned brain scientist with 67 doctorates. That makes him caring and smart. Now add his life story which makes him caring, smart and inspirational. Package that in likability and you have his appeal. He doesn’t look, sound or speak like a politician. His common-sense, level-headed approach is what many are thirsty for in an era of screaming and disappointment.","3129","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/02/ben-carson-is-the-smartest-man-i-have-ever-met/"

"Bennett: The truth is they are quite similar in defining the problems, but worlds apart in style. DBC [Dr. Ben Carson] is never going to say something mean about Trump. He told me the day I met him that he wasn’t running against anyone; he was running to change our country. I think DBC won the last debate simply because he showed some of his personality. He is smart, funny and immensely likable. That was a very strong contrast to all of the bickering about who loves the Fourth Amendment the most. The style contrast between the two couldn’t be more vivid. In a field of candidates, success depends on being different.","3131","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/02/ben-carson-is-the-smartest-man-i-have-ever-met/"

"Bennett: I should point out that the current Congress has a combined 8,700 years of political experience. It seems to me that great leaders must have something more than experience. DBC is the smartest man I have ever met. But more importantly he has an internal compass that is solid. DBC has lectured and practiced medicine in 57 countries. He lived abroad for a year and a half. We have spent the summer sitting him down with experts and hiring our own. Every morning he is briefed by experts in what is going on in the world. He is an avid reader. Our policy team may not be household names, but they are experts from the Department of Defense, State, the National Security Council and the CIA. Doctors have this great system of calling in specialists to help them solve problems. He will be more than able handle his own. Take a great man like Lincoln. What made him great? It wasn’t his one term in Congress. It was his core.","3133","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/02/ben-carson-is-the-smartest-man-i-have-ever-met/"

"Bennett: His cabinet looks like his life. He spent 18 years on some of America’s biggest corporate boards. He accumulated many friends along the way. His medical career brought him in contact with some of the great minds in health care. His foundation’s focus on reading and education has had him working with thought leaders on education. His economic team his headed by Professor Tom Rustici and his national security team is headed by General Bob Dees. Their work is supplemented by dozens of others.","3135","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/02/ben-carson-is-the-smartest-man-i-have-ever-met/"

"Bennett: ""Getting some time at the microphone."" The DBC life story is the most compelling political story in a long, long time. To know it is to become an admirer. Every other candidate in the field has to drive over the back of other candidates to get the nomination.

"To which I would say: He's got it half right. Carson is being scrutinized because he is the frontrunner for a major party's presidential nomination.

"When you are in the handful of people running for the most powerful job in the country, the job of the press is to educate the public about who you are -- based on the things you have done in your life.

"So, how then can reporters try to understand and explain Carson to the public? By telling -- and examining -- his remarkable personal story, which sits at the center of his I-am-not-a-politician appeal.

"Politico may have gone too far in insisting Carson ""fabricated"" his memory that he had been admitted with a full scholarship to West Point. He says that in a meeting with General William Westmoreland it was intimated to him that he could have a scholarship if he wanted one. But, Westmoreland's records suggest he wasn't in Detroit when Carson said they met. And, even if the two met, saying ""Hey you are a smart dude and would be a great candidate for admission at West Point"" isn't the same thing as being formally offered admittance. It's just not.","3145","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/08/ben-carson-isnt-being-treated-unfairly-hes-being-treated-like-a-frontrunner/"
"And, even if you support Carson, you should find it slightly strange that nine people who grew up with him in Detroit told CNN said that his recounting of his troubled youth and angry temperament don't jibe with their remembrances. Or that, when pressed, Carson has refused to name even a single person involved in several of the incidents of violence he wrote about in ""Gifted Hands,"" his memoir. ""I'm not giving any information about who the person was that I tried to knife,"" Carson told Jansing Saturday in one of the most amazing quotes ever from a presidential candidate.","3146","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/08/ben-carson-isnt-being-treated-unfairly-hes-being-treated-like-a-frontrunner/"
"None of the above means that Carson is a fabulist or that he shouldn't be president. But, the idea that the questions raised about inconsistencies in his personal story are somehow out of bounds or the result of some sort of ""witch hunt"" is equally ridiculous.

"The knife story — along with tales of how Carson punched someone, threw rocks and tried to hit his mother with a hammer — are essential stops on Carson’s road to redemption that makes him such an appealing candidate to some. The knife even made its way into a TV movie about Carson. But now CNN, which mounted an investigation of the story, claims it cannot find Carson’s purported victim — and the candidate himself has said the names he used in this tale and another from his reportedly violent past were “fictitious.”","3157","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/06/ben-carsons-stories-of-violence-in-his-past-questioned/"
"“I don’t like to generally bring them in,” Carson said to reporters Thursday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. “The names I used for instance are fictitious names because I don’t want to bring people into something like this because I know what you guys do to their lives‎.” He added: “I’m not going to expose them.”","3158","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/06/ben-carsons-stories-of-violence-in-his-past-questioned/"

"The idea that only some people -- namely white, Protestant men -- are suitable for public office is such an ingrained part of American political culture that, when Gallup first began asking American voters about the idea of voting for ""alternates"" such as women, Catholics and Jews in the late 1930s, the public opinion research organization did not even bother to inquire how voters felt about the idea of a black president, Bositis explained.

"Don’t tell me, “It matters because it speaks to his honesty.” Honesty does matter, but the way you figure out whether a president will be honest about the things he does as president is to see what he’s saying about the things he’d do as president.

That as president, he’d have an affair and cover it up — not that he’d lie about other things. George W. Bush presented himself as brimming with personal integrity, all while telling one lie after another about his record in Texas and the the policies he was proposing (while the press was poring over his opponent’s every word with Talmudic care to see if they could catch him in a misstatement). Lo and behold, as president he was faithful to his wife, but deceived the country about all kinds of important policy matters.","3229","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/06/ben-carson-has-weird-ideas-and-makes-stuff-up-what-kind-of-president-would-he-be/"
"So yes, it now appears that Carson embellished his life story a bit to make his autobiography a more compelling read.

"Now stay with me while I argue that Ben Carson’s views on the provenance of the pyramids actually do matter. Carson maintains that unlike “all the archeologists” who say that the pyramids were built by the pharaohs to be their tombs, he believes that the biblical figure Joseph built the pyramids to store grain. There is precisely zero evidence for this belief.","3231","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/06/ben-carson-has-weird-ideas-and-makes-stuff-up-what-kind-of-president-would-he-be/"
"This is hardly the only matter about which Carson says all the scientists are wrong. He thinks that the theory of evolution was born when Satan encouraged Charles Darwin to devise it; all the copious evidence for evolution is meaningless. Carson also says that he once stumped a “well-known physicist” by asking him how the organization of the solar system could be compatible with the second law of thermodynamics, which states that systems tend to move toward entropy. Carson is either lying about this or wildly misinterpreted the conversation he had, because there’s no contradiction between the two, and there isn’t a physicist on earth who would tell you that the solar system proves that God’s hand was at work. But people who learn only a tiny bit about certain scientific ideas often become convinced that they’ve happened upon a striking new revelation that all the so-called experts have never considered before.","3232","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/06/ben-carson-has-weird-ideas-and-makes-stuff-up-what-kind-of-president-would-he-be/"
"So what does this have to do with what Carson might be like as president? When George W. Bush said he was “the decider,” he was describing accurately a large part of the job. Every day, the president’s aides bring him decisions he has to make, decisions that are often complex and uncertain. He has to weigh different kinds of evidence and make predictions about the future. People who know more than him about a particular topic — the economics of the labor market, the internal politics of Iran, the health effects of power-plant emissions — will offer him their advice based on their expertise, and he’ll have to integrate their perspective with other considerations that might come into play in a particular policy decision.","3233","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/06/ben-carson-has-weird-ideas-and-makes-stuff-up-what-kind-of-president-would-he-be/"
"Ben Carson’s ideas about things like the pyramids, combined with what he has said about other more immediate topics, suggest not only that his beliefs are impervious to evidence but also an alarming lack of what we might call epistemological modesty. It isn’t what he doesn’t know that’s the problem, it’s what he doesn’t realize that he doesn’t know. He thinks that all the archeologists who have examined the pyramids just don’t know what they’re talking about, because Joseph had to put all that grain somewhere. He thinks that after reading something about the second law of thermodynamics, he knows more about the solar system than the world’s physicists do. He thinks that after hearing a Glenn Beck rant about the evils of Islam, he knows as much about a 1,400-year-old religion as any theologian and can confidently say why no Muslim who doesn’t renounce his faith could be president.","3234","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/06/ben-carson-has-weird-ideas-and-makes-stuff-up-what-kind-of-president-would-he-be/"

"This is a more acute question with Carson than with any other candidate, because he has no political record we can examine to see how he might perform. The policy ideas he has put forward range between the impossibly vague and the utterly outlandish. Even more so than Donald Trump, who has at least managed a large organization, Carson offers only himself — his heart, his spirit, his soul — as the reason why America should elect him president. In assessing him we have no choice but to look at the man, because there’s nothing else. Some parts of his personal story are irrelevant to that assessment, but some parts aren’t. And it’s those that should really give us pause.","3236","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/06/ben-carson-has-weird-ideas-and-makes-stuff-up-what-kind-of-president-would-he-be/"

"Carson has stellar ratings among self-identified Republicans; 68 percent have a favorable impression of him, while a mere 14 percent are unfavorable. Trump nearly matches Carson on positive ratings (62 percent), but his unfavorable ratings are about twice as high (34).

"Fiorina has made the argument that she is best positioned to challenge Hillary Rodham Clinton and combat allegations of the supposed Republican ""war on women."" But she is not immediately popular among women, splitting evenly with 31 percent favorable to 29 percent unfavorable.

What Carson and others leave out is that while these were indeed six of about a 50-question test, most kids that took the test, failed. In fact, according to a Salina Journal report that reviewed the test results, only 25 percent passed the test. And considering that in this area of Kansas, only about half of the kids stayed in school all the way until eighth grade completion, it makes these six-example test questions even more meaningless.","3297","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/10/16/ben-carson-says-americans-were-better-educated-in-the-1830s-no-they-werent/"

"According to recent polls, Ben Carson has surged in popularity among likely Republican voters and now finds himself at the top of the GOP presidential primary pack. A recent poll of Iowa Republicans, for example, found Carson tied with Donald Trump for first place. That an African American that has never held political office is now a front-runner in the Republican primaries has surprised many observers.","September 10","3384","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"
"But his candidacy is perhaps less surprising if you consider two things: the long traditional of black conservatism in America, and how black Republicans like Carson have often appealed to largely white voters.","3385","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"
"The idea of a black conservative or a black Republican often feels like an oxymoron. Black people are overwhelmingly loyal to the Democratic Party. In 2012, more than 90 percent of black voters cast ballots for Barack Obama. Their partisanship reflects the advances in racial and social justice championed primarily by the Democratic Party. Given that and the Republican Party’s opposition to some parts of the civil rights agenda, black voters would appear to have little in common with the Republican Party and also modern conservatism.","3386","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"
"But clearly there are exceptions to this rule. According to the Pew Research Center, between 5 and 11 percent of blacks either identify as Republican or lean Republican.","3387","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"
"Moreover, Carson is not the first black Republican to run for president, and he won’t be the last. He’s also not the first black Republican to be discussed as part of a potential Republican presidential ticket. In 1968 Richard Nixon toyed with tapping liberal Republican Edward Brooke as his vice-presidential running mate, while Gerald Ford placed Brooke high on a private list of potential vice-presidential appointees in 1974. Speculation has also long surrounded Colin Powell, who has declined to run.","3388","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"
"Carson, Powell and Brooke, of course, all exhibit different forms of black Republicanism, ranging from liberal to conservative. But to some degree, their belief in Republicanism is undergirded by a kind of general black conservatism.","3389","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"
"African Americans are no strangers to conservatism. It crops up in the 19th and early 20th centuries, especially among black churches, despite their political radicalism. Conservative thinking was evident even in some of the most progressive civil rights leaders of the 1960s and 1970s. Even today, studies have shown that about a third of black people self-identify as conservative, although their conservatism rarely translates into support for the Republican Party.","3390","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"
"And this is how we make sense of Ben Carson. He comes from a long conservative tradition, one that is rooted in a belief in religious morality, personal responsibility, self-help, individualism and free-market enterprise, and one that sometimes exists outside the boundaries of partisanship. Some have attributed Carson’s switch from ardent Democrat to conservative Republican as a matter of opportunism. That may very well be true, but Carson’s book, Gifted Hands, indicates that he has long exhibited the kind of “everyday black conservatism” that defines a portion of black communities.","3391","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"
"Carson also comes from a partisan tradition that has given us figures like Clarence Thomas, Mia Love, Tim Scott and many others. Organizations like the Black Silent Majority Committee in the 1970s, and the Lincoln Institute for Research and Education in the 1980s and 1990s, built on black conservatism and cultivated both Republican activism and the type of partisan rhetoric that Ben Carson currently articulates.","3392","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"
"It’s a rhetoric that conservative audiences, almost exclusively white, embrace. Still, Carson is unusual in attracting so much support. And although there are many possible reasons for Carson’s appeal — his religious roots, his “niceness” especially when contrasted with Donald Trump, his career as a surgeon, his position as a political outsider — his message on race may also be a factor.","3393","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"
"For white conservative audiences, Carson is “safe.” His words on racism, for instance, while profoundly critical of racist acts, differ sharply from the words of black liberals. For Carson, racism is something to be changed through individual acts rather than something to be eradicated through structural change. Conservative voters can thus look at Carson and have their personal beliefs on race validated, especially because a black man is articulating these same beliefs.","3394","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"
"This has happened before. In 1975, for example, Republicans cited the Black Silent Majority Committee’s conservative platform to validate their views on racial issues – even as African American voters routinely rejected the organization’s positions. This fraught relationship even led Clarence Thomas to quip that blacks wanting to be accepted in the GOP needed to become a “caricature of sorts, providing sideshows of anti-black quips and attacks.”","3395","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"
"Carson may be a long shot for the presidential nomination, and even the vice-presidential nomination. But even if he doesn’t end up in political office, he could easily become an important consultant to various public and private Republican factions. Thus, there’s a very real chance that Carson may ultimately end up influencing public policies, either directly or indirectly. That is why we should take his candidacy seriously.","3396","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"
"After all, over the course of the last 80 years, the GOP has implemented black Republicans’ policies and programs, often favoring those ideas that were firmly couched in conservative thought. And many previous Republican contenders have been able to use their popularity to influence public opinion and party politics. Carson may eventually do the same.","3397","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/what-explains-ben-carson-the-long-tradition-of-black-conservatism/"

He told one version of it at a speech in Conroe, Tex., an exurb north of Houston, and more than 1,000 people roared with laughter.

"“I would call it unwise, perhaps, but not stupid,” Carson said in Anaheim. “To some degree, I fault Congress for not insisting that something that involves us and other nations is a treaty.

"That approach lets Carson evade the normal traps that ensnare candidates — and lets him echo the fears of evangelicals without anyone hearing a pander.

Every time, he took questions. No one accused him of backing “amnesty” — though it helped when he suggested canceling 10 visas from the country of any one immigrant who was found overstaying a visa. Every time, he described how a president could “destroy America” if he was so inclined — and he proceeded to describe the policies of President Obama.

The company did not admit to wrongdoing.","3486","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"Carson has blamed moderators for asking a “gotcha” question about his involvement with Mannatech. In a news conference the day after the debate, he acknowledged he appeared in promotional videos, but said that he was not paid for them.","3487","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"The issue turns out to be more nuanced than Carson said during the debate, and how his critics have made it out to be in reaction to his debate comments. Let’s dig into the facts.","3488","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"The veracity of Carson’s statement depends on how one defines “involvement,” “relationship” or “formal relations.” Does it mean direct payments from the company to Carson? Does it mean being publicly supportive of the company’s initiatives or products?","3489","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"Carson has never been a paid endorser or spokesman for the company or its products, according to Mannatech. However, Carson has given glowing reviews of the company and his experience with the main ingredient in its products, glyconutrients, in paid speeches and unpaid testimonials.","3490","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"In a January 2015 Newsmax interview, Carson said he gave a speech “10-plus years ago” and that he was not aware of the company’s legal problems in 2004. In the debate, Carson said he gave a “couple speeches.”","3491","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"Carson delivered speeches at four Mannatech events — in 2004, 2011 and 2013. Mannatech donated to Carson’s nonprofit scholarship foundation, the Carson Scholars Fund, in lieu of a speakers fee for three of the events. In 2013, the company paid a speaker’s fee of $42,000, as per his agreement through the Washington Speakers Bureau, according to Mike Crouch, Mannatech’s director of communications.","3492","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"“Dr. Carson has no direct association with Mannatech. He was never a paid endorser or spokesman for Mannatech. However, he is a current customer and has purchased Mannatech products on a regular basis for a number of years,” Crouch’s statement said.","3493","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"Carson was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2002, and had it surgically removed that year. In 2002 and 2003, he said in interviews that he had changed his diet significantly to include mostly organic fruits and vegetables. He found there was a “dietary connection to cancer rates,” especially of prostate and breast cancers. He became interested in how diet and stress affect people’s health, and the importance of preventive care rather than relying on surgeries to cure disease.","3494","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"In his 2004 speech at a Mannatech event, Carson said he was introduced to glyconutrients through a patient after his diagnosis, and began taking the product. Glyconutrients are plant extracts that the company says are nutritious, natural and healthy sugars that boost the immune system. “Within about three weeks, my symptoms went away, and I was really quite amazed. And I actually toyed with the idea of not having surgery done,” Carson said.","3495","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"But given his high profile, Carson said he feared his forgoing surgery would create “needless deaths” among cancer patients who followed his example to forgo surgery, but “may not be quite as diligent as I was about taking the product.”","3496","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"“I do not advocate abandoning traditional medical cures that have been shown to work. What I would, however, advocate is using natural products to supplement what’s done by traditional medicine. The two things do not have to be adversarial. In fact, they can be extremely complementary,” Carson said in his 2004 speech.","3497","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"“I’m not a Mannatech associate,” Carson continued. “I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to be one. I’m not a Mannatech spokesman. I don’t think that would be appropriate, either. I do refer people to appropriate people. I do not make any claims of being an expert in the area of glyconutrients. … I still take the products today, every single day. My wife takes them, too. We’re on a regular plan where we get our stuff every month.”","3498","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"In his 2007 book, “Take the Risk,” Carson explains he believed after taking glyconutrients that he could manage or even cure the disease with nutritional supplements and a healthy diet. After surgery, Carson found out that his cancer was one millimeter away from his prostate gland and metastisizing throughout his body. Had he waited on surgery just a few months, he could have died.","3499","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"Carson later filmed promotional videos without pay while he attended Mannatech corporate events, the company said. Carson campaign spokesman Doug Watts said the videos were to be used for internal and archive purposes, per the contract with the Washington Speakers Bureau. Mannatech removed videos ahead of Carson’s campaign announcement to comply with federal campaign finance regulations, the company said.","3500","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"“Obviously, someone egregiously breached the contract,” Watts said. “The videos were part of his speech presentation. When we learned they were being used by distributors, we contacted Mannatech and demanded they be taken down. I believe they made best efforts to substantially comply, but there was not universal compliance.”","3501","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"Some of these videos still exist on YouTube. In one, Carson gives a testimonial about the importance of nutrition and a healthy diet, and compliments Mannatech for its use of natural ingredients: “Basically, what the company is doing is trying to find a way to restore natural diet as a medicine, or as a mechanism, for maintaining health.”","3502","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"In another, Carson talks about integrative health, nutrition and healthy diet with Mannatech’s co-chief executive and chief science officer. Carson talks about the benefits of glyconutrients and his decision to take nutritional supplements. He does not endorse a particular product in either clip.","3503","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"Carson also appeared in a promotional video for the Mission 5 Million movement, a Mannatech initiative to donate nutritional powder to orphanages and relief organizations around the world through an affiliated non-profit. Carson praised the company’s social entrepreneurship, calling the initiative a “really crafty model” that encourages sales associates to create social change. Carson spoke at the launch event of this initiative in 2013.","3504","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"Reg McDaniel, former Mannatech medical director who recruited Carson as speaker at Mannatech’s events, told The Fact Checker that distributors tried to convince Carson to give public endorsements for Mannatech’s products, but Carson refused.","3505","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"When the National Review first wrote about Carson’s connections to the company in January 2015, Mannatech’s Web site had featured Carson in connection with its products, and carried a video of Carson promoting a PBS special on brain health and glyconutrients. The company told the National Review that some of the company’s independent distributors had sponsored Carson to be a speaker in the PBS special.","3506","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"In an interview on CNN, Carson’s business manager Armstrong Williams claimed he had negotiated a contract on behalf of Carson for his video testimonials and the PBS special. But then he withdrew those comments in an interview with Breitbart News. Williams confirmed to The Fact Checker there was no contract for promotional videos or the PBS special, and that he had misspoken during the CNN interview.","3507","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"In 2011, Carson claimed in a speech at a Mannatech event that the company paid a portion of the $2.5 million endowed chair in his name at Johns Hopkins University, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. When the Journal asked Johns Hopkins for the donor information, the school said it needed permission from Mannatech to do so. (The video of the 2011 speech was taken down after the Journal’s Oct. 5, 2015 article.)","3508","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"The Fact Checker asked Mannatech to release its donation information to the school, and the company replied that there is “simply no record of Mannatech Inc., providing a donation to Johns Hopkins or Dr. Carson’s endowed chair at Johns Hopkins. If Dr. Carson said that Mannatech had provided a donation to his endowed chair at Johns Hopkins, he was mistaken.” Watts said Carson misspoke, as he was doing fundraising at the time for Johns Hopkins and had confused his information.","3509","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"We have not found evidence that the company had a direct financial or contractual relationship with Carson, or that he was paid for the promotional videos. One speech earned a fee, and three resulted in contributions to a Carson charity.","3510","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"Carson has minimized his role with Mannatech since the National Review began raising questions in January. That has contributed to the confusion over the details of his history with Mannatech. Initially, he said he gave a speech 10-plus years ago. During the debate, he said that he “did a couple of speeches” for the company. Eventually, after the debate, he acknowledged he also shot unpaid videos.","3511","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"For 10 years, Carson has been a Mannatech customer and has spoken positively about the company, its initiatives, its philosophy and the main ingredient in its products, glyconutrients. He did not do formal endorsements. He can blame independent distributors for publishing the videos beyond their intended purpose, but he can’t claim it’s a “total propaganda” that he had ties to the company before and after the lawsuit.","3512","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios. His initial answer at the debate was in the realm of Three, but his follow-up explanation acknowledging unpaid videos showed there was more than “a couple speeches,” as he said the night before.","3513","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"
"Carson is using technical and legalistic language to distance himself from Mannatech. But the public isn’t necessarily looking for evidence of signed contracts between Carson and Mannatech or a “paid endorser” label. That puts him squarely in the Two Pinocchio criteria. Using the reasonable person standard, as we do at The Fact Checker, Carson clearly has had some “involvement” with the company — albeit an informal, unpaid one.","3514","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/04/ben-carsons-claim-he-did-not-have-an-involvement-or-formal-relations-with-mannatech/"

"Ben Carson has been trailing Donald Trump in the polls for about a month now, steadily increasing his share of support from Republican voters even as Trump keeps tromping around in first place, shouting. Carson, tortoise; Trump, hair.","September 15","3520","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/ben-carsons-poll-surge-is-starting-to-look-like-donald-trumps/"
"A new poll from CBS News and the New York Times reveals just how much Carson is gaining on Trump. Trump gets 27 percent -- and Carson gets 23. (The Post-ABC poll that was conducted a few days prior to the CBS-Times poll had Trump at 33 and Carson at 20.)","3521","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/ben-carsons-poll-surge-is-starting-to-look-like-donald-trumps/"
"To show movement in the field over time, CBS coupled its report on the new poll with results from a poll conducted at the end of July. It's only been a bit over a month, but in this ridiculous year, a month's passage yields an entirely different field. Back then, Trump had as much support as the next two candidates, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, combined. Now, Trump's got as much as Bush plus Walker times three.","3522","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/ben-carsons-poll-surge-is-starting-to-look-like-donald-trumps/"
"You can see Carson's improvement clearly on the graph below.

"In fact, Carson's recent improvement looks an awful lot like Trump's. Comparing the Real Clear Politics polling averages for the two from the point at which each began to surge, Carson's rise tracks how Trump did when he first started to run wild -- albeit slightly less huge.","3526","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/ben-carsons-poll-surge-is-starting-to-look-like-donald-trumps/"

"The modern presidential campaign is essentially an endless series of arguments that begin with “He said what???” as one candidate after another gets his chance to be pilloried for something he said, with feigned outrage and cries of “Gaffe!” reverberating throughout the land. In this week’s installment, Ben Carson is in the hot seat for comments he made about the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. But the real question is, why is everyone so upset with Carson? What he said is nothing more than the logical outgrowth of what nearly every Republican candidate and officeholder believes about guns. You can say he’s wrong, but you can’t say that his views should be any kind of surprise.","October 7","3532","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carson-perfectly-explains-the-republican-position-on-guns/"
"There were two things that Carson said that drew condemnation, one on television and one on his Facebook page:","3533","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carson-perfectly-explains-the-republican-position-on-guns/"
"Let’s take these one at a time. Was it unspeakably insulting to the victims of the Oregon shooting and their families to suggest that they were killed or injured because they didn’t have the physical courage and quick thinking that a hero like Carson would have displayed had he been in their shoes? Of course. And is it an absurd fantasy that in the instant he was confronted by a gunman, Carson would in the space of seconds organize a bunch of terrified strangers to mount an assault on someone ready to kill them? You bet it is.","3534","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carson-perfectly-explains-the-republican-position-on-guns/"
"But this fantasy is nothing unusual at all. In fact, it lies at the heart of much of the efforts Republicans have made at the behest of the National Rifle Association in recent years to change state laws on guns. “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” says the NRA, and Republicans believe it, too. So they push for laws to allow guns to be brought into as many places as possible — schools, government buildings, churches, anywhere and everywhere. They advocate “stand your ground” laws that encourage people to use guns to settle arguments. They seek both open-carry and concealed-carry laws on a “shall issue” basis (meaning the government presumes that you should get the license unless it can prove you fall into certain categories of offenders) to put guns in as many hands as possible.","3535","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carson-perfectly-explains-the-republican-position-on-guns/"
"All of this is driven by the fantasy of the gun owner as action hero. Sure, the world may see you as just a middle-age middle manager with an expanding gut and a retreating hairline, but at any moment you could be transformed into Jack Bauer! Woe be to the al-Qaeda commando team or deranged shooter who comes to your town, because you’ll be ready for ’em! The world is divided into the sheep who cower while waiting to be killed, and those possessed of the courage and firepower to stand up at those life-and-death moments. This is what the gun industry, the NRA and the Republican Party encourage people to believe. So, of course, Ben Carson believes it, too.","3536","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carson-perfectly-explains-the-republican-position-on-guns/"
"As for Carson’s assertion that “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away,” that, too, is the natural outgrowth of the contemporary Republican position on guns.","3537","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carson-perfectly-explains-the-republican-position-on-guns/"
"Think for a moment about how we reorganized our government, our airline industry and entire swaths of our society, spending hundreds of billions of dollars, creating a new apparatus of surveillance, all because nearly 3,000 people were killed on Sept. 11, 2001. We didn’t like spending all that money, creating all that fear, compromising our privacy and constitutional principles and making everybody take off their shoes at the airport, but it was a price we had to pay because of those 3,000 deaths, right?","3538","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carson-perfectly-explains-the-republican-position-on-guns/"
"It takes about a month — every month, month after month — for that many Americans to be killed with guns. Just imagine how we would have reacted to an attack 10 or 11 times the scale of 9/11, which is but a single year of the death toll guns place on our country. In 2013, the latest year for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released data, 11,208 Americans were murdered with guns, and 505 Americans died due to accidental firearm discharge. Another 21,175 Americans killed themselves with guns (having a gun in the home dramatically increases one’s risk of suicide), for a total of 32,888 gun deaths.","3539","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carson-perfectly-explains-the-republican-position-on-guns/"
"But unlike their position on terrorism, the position that the entire Republican Party now adopts — not necessarily all its voters, but virtually all its elected representatives — is that a toll that size is simply not meaningful enough to justify any action to not even restrict, but merely to inconvenience Americans’ ability to own as many guns as they want and to get them as easily as they want. Presumably there would be some level of carnage that would make even Republicans sign on to gun restrictions — say if a million Americans every year were being shot down, or 5 million or 10 million. But 33,000 a year? Not a big enough deal.","3540","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carson-perfectly-explains-the-republican-position-on-guns/"
"I don’t know if the thought he describes actually ran through Ben Carson’s head when he was on his E.R. rotation — I doubt that the young doctor said to himself, “Wow, that’s a tragedy that we saw three people shot to death this week, but it sure would be a bigger tragedy if people had to get background checks at gun shows” — but it is indeed the position of his party. The fact that it sounds crazy when he speaks it out loud doesn’t mean it’s not what they believe.","3541","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carson-perfectly-explains-the-republican-position-on-guns/"

"The rise in the polls by Carson, who like Trump has never held office, has been described as a manifestation of voter frustration and anger with the way that politics have come to work. Others have looked at how well Carson seems to be doing in heavily white and heavily evangelical states like Iowa and presumed those demographic patterns hold in the rest of Carson's newly assembled base.","3544","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/20/ben-carsons-pigeonholed-political-appeal/"
"The truth though, isn't so simple.","3545","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/20/ben-carsons-pigeonholed-political-appeal/"
"Carson has only recently started to post big enough polling numbers to allow us to delve deep into his base. And most of what people think they know -- Carson's support relies heavily on evangelicals, Carson might be drawing non-white conservatives -- isn't borne out by data that we actually have.","3546","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/20/ben-carsons-pigeonholed-political-appeal/"
"It is true that Carson, who has made opposing abortion rights a central feature of his campaign, does do well with white evangelical Protestants, pulling 24 percent of their support in the Post-ABC poll.

"But then consider this: Trump, a man whom Carson said seems to practice a kind of faith that requires no humility, is actually ahead with Republican evangelicals, at 32 percent. And even in a Monmouth University poll of likely Iowa GOP caucus-goers a few weeks back -- a poll that showed a tight Trump-Carson race -- Carson posted 29 percent support among Iowa evangelicals to Trump's 23. That gap falls well within the poll's margin of error (plus or minus 4.9 percent).","3548","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/20/ben-carsons-pigeonholed-political-appeal/"
"So any assertions that Carson's ascendancy is driven in some large measure by evangelicals isn't well-founded. His share of that vote among them is pretty much on-par with his overall share of the vote.","3549","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/20/ben-carsons-pigeonholed-political-appeal/"

"And the share of non-white Republicans backing Carson really isn't clear at all. Carson is the only black candidate vying for the White House in either major party. GOP voters are, as is well-known, overwhelmingly white. The small share of black, Latino and Asian voters who rank among the party's faithful or self-identify as Republicans or Republican-leaning voters makes it rare to have a sample size big enough to draw many real conclusions here.","3551","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/20/ben-carsons-pigeonholed-political-appeal/"
"That's not to say that those who have described Carson's voter base as largely white are wrong. That's almost certainly true since most of his supporters are GOP voters. But we just don't have reliable data to go into any further detail or say in a certain way that Carson's candidacy appeals to non-white Republicans and Republican leaners in a way that other Republicans do not. We only know from a large number of studies that both race and party do shape the behavior of all voters, and one recent study found that with black voters party matters much more than race.","3552","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/20/ben-carsons-pigeonholed-political-appeal/"
"In other words, it would be surprising to see a huge amount of black voters crossover to vote for Carson in the GOP primaries. We can't say it won't happen, but there's little reason to believe it will in any significant way.","3553","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/20/ben-carsons-pigeonholed-political-appeal/"

"Carson is strongest with GOP party faithful who describe themselves as conservatives (26 percent), college-educated Republicans (25 percent) and Republicans with incomes over $50,000 (23 percent). It's also interesting that Carson's support among GOP women (24 percent) outpaces his backing among GOP men (17 percent). But outside of college graduates, Carson's support is numerically lower than Trump’s in each of these groups.","3556","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/20/ben-carsons-pigeonholed-political-appeal/"
"Even where Carson is weakest -- among Republican-leaning voters who aren't actual Republicans (20 percent), moderate to liberal Republicans (13 percent), those who do not have a college degree (18 percent) and GOP voters who earn less than $50,000 a year (15 percent), Carson’s support is still slightly higher than the one-time presumptive party front-runner, former Florida governor Jeb Bush.","3557","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/20/ben-carsons-pigeonholed-political-appeal/"
"One thing certainly worth noting, though, is the speed at which Carson has climbed into the No. 2 slot. In a July New York Times-CBS New poll, Carson posted 6 percent support, tying him with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and putting him behind Trump (24 percent), Bush (13 percent), Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (10 percent) and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (8 percent).

The former appeals to hopes and aspirations while the latter appeals to populist anger. But I posited another theory that I want to explore further. The one that believes part of Carson’s poll vault might be due to eagerness among many Republicans to show that they have have their own brilliant black man to support. It’s a not-so-subtle rejoinder to those of us who have recoiled at the racism and other forms of disrespect endured by the nation’s first black president and his family.","3561","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"

"Leah Wright Rigueur is assistant professor of public policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School. She is also the author of “The Loneliness of the Black Republican.” That makes her the the perfect person to talk to about Carson’s appeal to an overwhelmingly white party.","3563","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"“I think you’re right about Carson and Republicans saying, ‘See, we can’t possibly be racist!’ But there’s also a level of nuance, that’s hard to pin down with white Republican voters,” Rigueur told me via e-mail. “Many of them believe this truly isn’t about race (i.e. using the language of, ‘I don’t see Carson’s race, I just think he’s the best man for the job!’); but at the same time, if you look at the language surrounding support of Carson, a lot of it is racial/racialized (i.e. ‘I don’t see his race, but he’s right on the money about what needs to be done in black communities.’). It’s the awkward nature of colorblindness; when you claim that you don’t see race, when in actuality you do.”","3564","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"But there is something else to the appeal of Carson among white Republicans. According to Rigueur, the lone African American Republican in the presidential nomination quest rhetorically goes where they dare not go.","3565","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"“I’d argue that a good portion of [Carson’s] popularity stems from his ability, as a black man, to say things that conservative [white] audiences get attacked for.” A prime example is Carson’s criticism of President Obama and the Affordable Care Act at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast. “This is actually not a new strategy — there’s a long history of African Americans rising in popularity and in esteem among white right-wing Republicans, so long as they are willing to say the controversial and uncomfortable things that white conservatives can’t say, especially along racial lines.”","3566","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"“I think it is also important to recognize that Carson is surging in the polls at the same time that ‘Black Lives Matter’ is gaining nationwide prominence,” Rigueur pointed out. “For the conservative public, not only is Carson a stark contrast to the Black Lives Matters crowd — he’s also willing to disparage that movement, which again, comforts conservative voters.” Carson unleashed a harsh, but rather thoughtful, assessment of the Black Lives Matter movement in a USA Today op-ed last week.","3567","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"Rigueur told me that Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, who died on Jan. 3, used the same approach in 1966. That’s the year he made history by becoming the first African American popularly elected to the U.S. Senate. “He publicly denounced Black Power advocates and advocated for ‘respectable’ protest (i.e. The Civil Rights Movement). His popularity among white Massachusetts voters immediately surged,” Rigueur said. “And despite his relatively liberal stance on open housing, he even gained the support of white anti-housing advocates; they overlooked his entire political agenda and simply honed in on what they liked.”","3568","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"In fact, Rigueur sees a lot of overlap between Carson and Brooke. “The strongest overlap that I see is that Carson has adopted the same moderate and middle-class approach to racial uplift, one that suggests that equality rests on behaving properly (or as I say in my book, “equal citizenship rested on an established moral code of acceptable black behaviors that fit within societal norms”),” she said in her e-mail. Of course, Democratic politicians practice respectability politics. But Rigueur told me the way Carson articulates his positions is “unique.”","3569","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"“Unlike other black politicians,” she said, “[Carson] has little interest in the broad societal reasons for inequality. For him, a lot of this boils down to personal accountability (with a little bit of racism). Which partly explains why he continues to reject ‘Black Lives Matters’ as a valid political movement.” Rigueur said another area of overlap between Carson and Brooke is how they tend to their base. But she noted one critical way they differ.","3570","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"
"There is another aspect to Carson’s rise that Rigueur said we must not overlook, his religious appeal. “This is a man who opened his campaign in May with a full-fledged black choir! Carson’s religious nature really comes out when he speaks and I think the idea of a religiously devout, “trustworthy” and brilliant doctor is appealing to a lot of potential voters,” she said. “He’s also incredibly safe. And by that I mean, Carson is far more mild-mannered and civil when compared to Donald Trump.” That’s for sure.","3571","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/08/how-ben-carson-cures-white-fright-in-the-republican-party/"

"But Rigueur told me the appeal Carson generates in the GOP “fall[s] by the wayside” once you look at the national electorate. “He doesn’t have the same appeal as say, Barack Obama in 2008. His politics and policy proposals render him unappealing to white liberals, nonwhite millennials, and women of all races,” she said.

"The surgery did prove that it was technically possible for twins conjoined at the head to be separated and for both to survive. It created a blueprint for other doctors to follow in the future.

If Carson dropped out of the race and they did, the real-estate magnate could win the nomination.","3658","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/15/a-simple-guide-to-what-ben-carson-actually-believes/"

"One important issue on which Carson is arguably the most conservative candidate is the federal budget. Carson supports a version of the flat tax advocated by some of his rivals. Under his system, all Americans would pay 10 percent of their income in taxes (""although it could be any percentage,"" he has written). There would be no exemptions for the poor. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee advocates a similar system, but he has promised that the poor would be spared paying taxes. Even libertarian Sen.

"Carson's tax plan, which is based on the biblical tithe, would raise roughly $1.1 trillion in revenue, according to an analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice.

"— Ben Carson has clearly been caught off guard by the scrutiny that comes with leading the polls in a presidential campaign.

"His complaints underscore a common problem for first-time candidates. When someone like Carson or Donald Trump tries to gets into politics by starting at the top of the ladder, they invariably don’t appreciate what it takes: from building an organization to forging coalitions, raising money and, yes, being vetted. Nothing compares to the white hot spotlight of running for president, but those who have run for governor or Senate have at least gotten a taste of it – and they can dismiss some of the negative stories that came out during those earlier races as old news.","3680","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/11/09/the-daily-202-first-time-candidate-ben-carson-doesnt-understand-what-running-for-president-entails/"
"Carson argues that the burden should not be on him to substantiate the stories he has told over the years. For now, he’s getting a fundraising boost as conservative activists rally to his defense. In the long run, the drip-drip-drip of tall tales will damage his brand. The reason that embellishments and exaggerations are so bad for Carson, in particular, is that his campaign has largely been animated by his undeniably inspiring autobiography.","3681","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/11/09/the-daily-202-first-time-candidate-ben-carson-doesnt-understand-what-running-for-president-entails/"

The 94 other forms can be filed only with paper. This project, run by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, was originally supposed to cost a half-billion dollars and be finished in 2013.

But now the Virginia Supreme Court has issued a directive to trial judges, advising them to warn non-citizen defendants to consider the possible impact a conviction could have on their immigration status.

"— New York Times, “Democratic group called iVote pushes voter registration,” by Michael D. Shear: “As Republicans across the country mount an aggressive effort to tighten voting laws, a group of former aides to President Obama and President Bill Clinton is pledging to counter by spending up to $10 million on a push to make voter registration automatic whenever someone gets a driver’s license. The change would supercharge the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, known as the “motor voter” law, which requires states to offer people the option of registering to vote when they apply for driver’s licenses or other identification cards. The new laws would make registration automatic during those transactions unless a driver objected. The group, called iVote — which is led by Jeremy Bird, who ran Mr. Obama’s voter turnout effort in 2012 — is betting that such laws could bring out millions of new voters … Many of those new voters would be young, poor or minorities — groups that tend to support Democratic candidates, Mr. Bird said.”","3732","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/11/09/the-daily-202-first-time-candidate-ben-carson-doesnt-understand-what-running-for-president-entails/"
"— Wall Street Journal, “Colleges flex lobbying muscle,” by Brody Mullins, Douglas Belkin and Andrea Fuller: “Colleges and universities have become one of the most effective lobbying forces in Washington, employing more lobbyists last year than any other industries except drug manufacturing and technology. There are colleges in every congressional district, and 1 in 40 U.S. workers draw a paycheck from a college or university. Over the last two decades, the higher-education industry has beaten back dozens of government proposals to measure its successes and failures. It has killed efforts to tighten rules for accrediting schools, defeated a proposed requirement to divulge more information about graduation rates and eliminated funding for state agencies that could have closed bad schools. The proposals had support from both sides of the political aisle. The political pressure on higher education is rooted in a simple but vexing question: Is the government getting a good return on the money it is pouring into the U.S. college system?”","3733","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/11/09/the-daily-202-first-time-candidate-ben-carson-doesnt-understand-what-running-for-president-entails/"

Hennigan: “Experienced pilots and crews complain of too much work, too much strain and too little chance for promotion operating the Predator and Reaper drones that provide surveillance and that fire missiles in Iraq, Syria and other war zones. Partly as a result, too few young officers want to join their ranks. The Air Force has struggled with a drone pilot shortage since at least 2007, records show. In fiscal year 2014, the most recent data available, the Air Force trained 180 new pilots while 240 veterans left the field. ‘It’s extremely stressful and extremely difficult,’ said Peter ‘Pepe’ LeHew, who retired in 2012 and joined private industry.

"— Bloomberg, “Cameron’s EU demand letter just deepens his domestic dilemma,” by Robert Hutton: “As David Cameron puts the finishing touches to a letter setting out the U.K.’s demands of the European Union, he may discover that EU negotiating partners find them more acceptable than his domestic critics. The prime minister will go public this week with a long-awaited list of measures aimed at redefining the terms of Britain’s EU membership before an in-or-out referendum he’s pledged to hold by the end of 2017. Whereas European governments are keen to learn at last just what Britain wants, to his U.K. audience the details matter much less than how he presents them. Cameron’s dilemma is that he risks upsetting people back home whatever the letter’s content. If the wishlist is one he’s certain of achieving, those who want to get Britain out of the EU will describe it as unambitious. If it contains things he doesn’t get, those shortfalls will be cited as evidence that he has failed.”","3736","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/11/09/the-daily-202-first-time-candidate-ben-carson-doesnt-understand-what-running-for-president-entails/"

"When Carson says he is being misquoted or taken out of context, what he really seems to mean is that the words he used didn't convey the fullness of what he meant.

"Like clockwork, Dr. Ben Carson’s rise in the polls, especially in Iowa, provokes an attack from Donald Trump. “I just think it’s a very difficult situation that he puts himself into, to have a doctor who wasn’t creating jobs and would have a nurse or maybe two nurses.

"Because he is so soft-spoken, it is hard to imagine Carson striking back, but paid media can certainly do the job, raising, for example, Trump’s past pro-life position and refusal to pledge to defund Planned Parenthood. Moreover, Trump is trying to feign religiosity. Because he doesn’t go to church regularly, can’t tell us his favorite verse, and because never talks in religious terms, there is a fair amount of suspicion that he is faking it. And here Carson, without being sanctimonious, can tell voters that if a candidate’s faith is important, he’s the man whose life and words reflect that faith. (Lowry writes: “Carson is a serious Christian who has a powerful testimonial about getting down on his knees as a young man unable to control his temper and saying, ‘Lord, unless you help me, I’m not going to make it.'”) One wonders if evangelicals will be annoyed by Trump’s fakery once highlighted by Carson or others.","3785","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/03/trump-attacks-ben-carson/"

Once he’s exposed as a fraud on religion, we even might get around to his self-image as a phenomenally successful businessman. (“Forbes reports Donald Trump is worth $4.1 billion; Trump says $10 billion. Either way, he’d be worth a lot more if he simply retired 30 years ago and put his money in an unmanaged stock fund.”).

But as people said at the time, ""when the day came but the Lord did not,"" many Millerites, including Truth, walked away and began referring to failed prophecy as the ""Great Disappointment."" Slowly, pieces of the Millerite community became convinced that Miller's ideas were accurate and only his read on the date was wrong and eventually formed the Seventh-day Adventist Church.","3801","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/30/ben-carson-opposed-to-a-muslim-president-practices-a-faith-that-has-faced-similar-suspicions/"

"MCGRAW: From the very beginning, the connection to Miller, the end-times prediction and what followed it, the Saturday worship (Sabbath begins sundown Friday and ends at sundown Saturday) and Adventism's origins in North America put Adventists in a kind of socially suspect category with a few other faiths — Mormons, Christian Scientists and Jehovah's Witnesses. They are all American originals, doctrines that began here in the United States. And at points, all four groups were called cults and their members subject to derision, exclusion and even legal persecution.","3803","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/30/ben-carson-opposed-to-a-muslim-president-practices-a-faith-that-has-faced-similar-suspicions/"

"MCGRAW: Most Americans are aware that Mormons were driven out of certain states. Adventists have similar stories in their history.

"SAMPLES: It would not be correct to describe it as a straight and contiguous process — or a short one. Ellen G. White, who Adventists regard as a prophet, certainly played a major role.

She also wrote a series of books on everything from management to diet, health and fitness that have been widely translated.

"In a lot of his work, he pushed hard for the elimination of the term ""cult"" from descriptions of Adventism. He thought this was essential to the efforts to change other people's views.

"MCGRAW AND SAMPLES: In the 1950s, a now-defunct Protestant evangelical magazine published an article that basically said 'Adventists are unusual, but they are Christians, too.' The article received a lot of attention in religious families around the country and eventually led to a series of meetings between some of the most prominent evangelical and Adventist leaders of the time.

"SAMPLES: There have been some more recent rough patches for Adventists, too. In the 1960s and '70s when people began to write dissertations about White, her work and the denomination, more than one person went public with a shocking and now-well-proven revelation. White plagiarized passages in her many, many books. That's right — plagiarized what she wrote. Some Adventists rejected these claims because it made no sense to them that a prophet would need to borrow the language of other human beings. Some left the church. Others still integrated these facts into their understanding of White. And some Adventists insist that the plagiarism charges are false to this very day.

"MCGRAW: Sure. There are Americans who have no knowledge at all or don't subscribe to the cult allegation, but also some people who are still suspicious and question Adventist loyalties. I'll put it this way: When I lived in Woodbridge, Va., like all Adventists, we were members of a church that held services on Saturdays. So that meant that our sanctuary was free on Sundays, and we often rented it out to other congregations from other denominations. For a time, we even held all kinds of joint programs, including vacation bible school with one congregation that rented from us.","3822","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/30/ben-carson-opposed-to-a-muslim-president-practices-a-faith-that-has-faced-similar-suspicions/"

"Many GOP voters, as Cillizza noted, just plain agree with Carson's ideas. These are the voters who have been longing for someone to draw the kind of direct comparisons between Hitler and gun-control advocates, and Obama and pro-choice women and abortion and slavery, and so on and so forth for a very long time.

"The week before the fourth Republican presidential primary debate on Tuesday, sometime Republican presidential front-runner Ben Carson has faced some tough questions about his past. In a twist perhaps unique in modern presidential politics, he’s had to defend the veracity of stories he’s often repeated about behaving badly — trying to knife a classmate at 14, hitting another classmate with a rock in his hand, trying to hit his mother with a hammer — that show how his faith helped save him from the rough streets of Detroit.","November 10","3848","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/10/another-odd-ben-carson-story-how-he-refused-a-dna-test-to-settle-paternity-suit/"

"But whether it’s the pediatric neurosurgeon’s strange theories about the Egyptian pyramids or his opinion that armed Jews could have “greatly diminished” the Holocaust, there always seems to be another Carson tale worth re-examining. And, as Republicans gather in Milwaukee for the Fox Business Network debate Tuesday night, one very strange Carson tale has yet to be delved into: the candidate’s contention, discussed in speeches and an op-ed as recently as last year, that he was sued for paternity by an unnamed woman in Florida and refused to give a DNA sample to resolve the case.","3851","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/10/another-odd-ben-carson-story-how-he-refused-a-dna-test-to-settle-paternity-suit/"
"Though he’s told the story as early as 2003, as Mediaite reported, Carson wrote about the paternity suit at length in a Washington Times op-ed in 2014.

"Carson went on to discuss a famous case of blackmail involving the nation’s first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton. As Carson told it in his Washington Times piece, Hamilton “was seduced by the wife of a political enemy with the intention of blackmailing him into complying with their wishes. Hamilton publicly confessed his transgression and the public forgave him, completely thwarting the plans of his adversaries.”","3856","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/10/another-odd-ben-carson-story-how-he-refused-a-dna-test-to-settle-paternity-suit/"
"In fact, it wasn’t quite that simple. Hamilton engaged in an affair in 1791 with a 23-year-old woman, Maria Reynolds, who, as Hamilton told it, lured him to her home. When her husband, James Reynolds, discovered the relationship, he threatened to tell Hamilton’s wife unless Hamilton paid him hush money, which he did. The affair continued.","3857","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/10/another-odd-ben-carson-story-how-he-refused-a-dna-test-to-settle-paternity-suit/"
"Ultimately, however, Reynolds informed some of Hamilton’s political rivals, including future president James Monroe, who sent them along to Hamilton’s arch-enemy, Thomas Jefferson. Eventually, for complicated reasons and after a quiet investigation by some members of Congress, Hamilton decided to go public about the affair and the blackmail in a pamphlet, primarily to avoid a potentially more damaging scandal related to his role as treasury secretary.","3858","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/10/another-odd-ben-carson-story-how-he-refused-a-dna-test-to-settle-paternity-suit/"
"As this article in Smithsonian Magazine recounted, the public was not so forgiving. Hamilton’s “reputation was in tatters,” wrote Angela Serratore, and “talk of further political office effectively ceased.” (Hamilton died in an 1804 duel with Aaron Burr, who, as it happened, represented Maria Reynolds in a divorce suit against her husband.)","3859","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/10/another-odd-ben-carson-story-how-he-refused-a-dna-test-to-settle-paternity-suit/"

"So, in sum: To exhibit his opposition to political corruption, government intrusion on his privacy, and his faithfulness to his wife, Carson had revived — no, pointed to — the case of a founding father who was guilty of infidelity and a paternity suit few knew about that would leave any voter or reporter with a lot of questions.","3861","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/10/another-odd-ben-carson-story-how-he-refused-a-dna-test-to-settle-paternity-suit/"
"“The purpose of the anecdote seems to be to slip in that humblebrag about never having slept with anyone other than his wife, but confessing to having been sued for paternity seems like an awful long walk to get there,” Tommy Christopher of Mediaite wrote. “It’s not as though this story was ever out there; the only published reports I could find about it were of Carson telling the story himself.”","3862","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/10/another-odd-ben-carson-story-how-he-refused-a-dna-test-to-settle-paternity-suit/"

"The confusion starts the moment Carson starts his reply. The man who was against the military personnel decisions made by President Obama supports those positions. Special Operations forces in Syria are “better than not having them there.” Keeping 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan is a counterbalance to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “We have to oppose him there in an effective way,” Carson said.","3874","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-middle-east-muddle/"

"Tharoor then ably explains how Carson stepped deep in it by even acknowledging the caliphate sought by Islamist extremists. Carson would thwart their goal and “destroy” them by “mak[ing] them look like losers.” And he would accomplish this by taking an oil field. “Take that from them. Take all of that land from them,” he said. “We could do that, I believe, fairly easily, I’ve learned from talking to several generals, and then you move on from there.”","3877","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-middle-east-muddle/"

"Left unsaid, but plainly apparent, is whether American boots on the ground would be necessary. Of course, they would be. The Carson worldview, as espoused in his rambling response, demands it.

"Last night's Republican presidential debate was marked by a rather scattered conversation on foreign policy.

"This was Bartiromo's question: ""Dr. Carson, you were against putting troops on the ground in Iraq and against a large military force in Afghanistan.

"1. Let's begin with a bit of sympathy. Carson's point here is not wrong — given U.S. strategic goals in Syria, it's probably better to have special forces on the ground than not at all. But the bumbling explanation that follows sets the tone for the rest of Carson's adventure through Middle East policy.","3885","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-remarkable-gibberish-on-syria-and-iraq-explained/"
"2. As WorldViews has examined at length, the Russian mission in Syria is an opportunistic gamble to help bolster the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. It has involved, to varying degrees, cooperation from the governments in Iraq and Iran, and it may widen to include dealings with a leading faction of Syrian Kurds.","3886","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-remarkable-gibberish-on-syria-and-iraq-explained/"
"Is Putin's move into Syria really the first step of a wider Russian takeover in the Middle East? Probably not. Russian military resources in the region are dwarfed by that of the United States, let alone NATO, an alliance whose second-biggest military — Turkey — sits on the Syrian border. And recent events, including the suspected bombing of a Russian passenger jet over Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, suggests that Moscow has already put itself in line for a great deal of blowback.","3887","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-remarkable-gibberish-on-syria-and-iraq-explained/"
"3. The short answer is no, the Chinese are not there, certainly not in any meaningful way. It's nice that Carson recognizes that the region is a ""complex place"" but pretty amusing that he brushes aside its actual complexity for a phantom menace.","3888","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-remarkable-gibberish-on-syria-and-iraq-explained/"
"4. The United States has no ""ground"" to ""give up"" there. Some Syrian rebel factions loosely backed by the United States do, but it's not at all clear here what it is that Carson thinks ""we've been doing so far"" that is ""very ineffective.""","3889","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-remarkable-gibberish-on-syria-and-iraq-explained/"
"Presumably, if we are to be charitable, he's talking about the half-hearted American effort to train and equip ""moderate"" Syrian rebels. But there's no trace of an alternative solution in his response, especially when you consider that Carson's prompt was a question about his earlier reticence to deploy ground forces in the region.","3890","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-remarkable-gibberish-on-syria-and-iraq-explained/"

"5. So here's the solution: ""Make them look like losers."" Interestingly, Carson doesn't say make them lose, but make them look like losers. Because we don't show it to be the loser that it is, he suggests, the Islamic State is able to ""gather a lot of influence.""","3892","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-remarkable-gibberish-on-syria-and-iraq-explained/"
"To be clear, the United States, particularly the State Department, is actually trying pretty hard to make the Islamic State ""look"" like a loser. It has engaged in a concerted, sometimes controversial counter-propaganda campaign online against the group, aimed at dissuading potential recruits from joining the Islamic State, as well as discrediting its noxious ideology. Carson offers no advice on how to further improve these efforts.","3893","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-remarkable-gibberish-on-syria-and-iraq-explained/"
"6. But — aha! — he does present a solution. We ""make them look like losers"" by destroying their caliphate. Okay. This makes a bit of sense: The Islamic State defines itself as a caliphate, so if you destroy it, then presumably you have destroyed the group.","3894","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-remarkable-gibberish-on-syria-and-iraq-explained/"
"But by making this declaration, Carson has bought into the extremists' own worldview and gone against the deliberate rhetoric of basically every single major Western and Arab government seeking to combat the Islamic State. Many officials even refuse to use that name when referring to the extremist organization, choosing instead to go with the more pejorative ""Daesh.""","3895","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-remarkable-gibberish-on-syria-and-iraq-explained/"

"7. The key to destroying this caliphate, this fount of global jihadism, is ... to take land in Iraq. Some generals in the know have told Carson that it's easy. It involves an oil field outside Anbar — a particularly unhelpful place to cite given that it is Iraq's largest province — and the presumption that ""we"" can ""take all of that land from them.""","3897","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-remarkable-gibberish-on-syria-and-iraq-explained/"
"Let us put to a side the initial question about where this is — WorldViews assumes that Carson is referring to the strategic oil refinery at Baiji, a city that has been long contested and recently wrested away from the Islamic State with the help of U.S. air support.","3898","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/11/ben-carsons-remarkable-gibberish-on-syria-and-iraq-explained/"
"Carson's grand strategy raises plenty of questions: Is he proposing to deploy U.S. ground troops to help the Iraqis battle the Islamic State?

And Trump is running an unorthodox campaign, too. But there's a difference between an unorthodox public-facing campaign and the private chaos of a bunch of amateurs making it up as they go. (Trump, to his credit, has serious political people in his operation — including in early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire.) The Times story suggests that Carson's candidacy is a lot more the latter than the former.","3972","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/18/what-is-ben-carson-doing-exactly/"

"My guess is that the Times story doesn't change how his supporters see him — and it might even make him stronger in their eyes. (Being ""attacked"" by the New York Times is something most Republicans wear as a badge of honor.) Which is fine.

"New York Times reporter Trip Gabriel saw an opening: What are Carson’s foreign policy advisers telling him? In an interview with the Erik Wemple Blog, Gabriel says he went first to Williams, the business manager, in search of contacts and context. That’s how the reporter got the name of Duane R. Clarridge, a former CIA official who’s described in the New York Times piece as a “top adviser to Mr. Carson on terrorism and national security.”","3979","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/11/18/ben-carson-fashions-mind-blowing-approach-to-public-accountability/"
"And this top adviser doesn’t play by the rules of most top advisers. “Nobody has been able to sit down with him and have him get one iota of intelligent information about the Middle East,” Clarridge told Gabriel, among other tweetable quotes about the candidate. “We need to have a conference call once a week where his guys roll out the subjects they think will be out there, and we can make him smart,” Clarridge told Williams, according to the New York Times.","3980","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/11/18/ben-carson-fashions-mind-blowing-approach-to-public-accountability/"
"Bolstering the accountability factor was Williams himself, who told Gabriel about the “Fox News Sunday” problem: “He’s been briefed on it so many times. I guess he just froze.”","3981","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/11/18/ben-carson-fashions-mind-blowing-approach-to-public-accountability/"

"Note that the statement didn’t allege that the campaign had been blindsided by the story. Because it hadn’t. As Gabriel tells the Erik Wemple Blog, he contacted the campaign about an hour before his deadline. Campaign manager Barry Bennett voiced an objection to the short time he was given to respond. Gabriel then asked what time would work for him, and didn’t hear back. He published.","3983","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/11/18/ben-carson-fashions-mind-blowing-approach-to-public-accountability/"
"Doug Watts, communications director for the Carson campaign, told us last night via e-mail that the connection with Clarridge wasn’t an officially sanctioned transaction: “My understanding is that yes AW did connect Mr Gabriel with Mr Claridge, unbeknownst to the campaign,” wrote Watts.","3984","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/11/18/ben-carson-fashions-mind-blowing-approach-to-public-accountability/"
"In just a few months, Williams has earned a spot in the Erik Wemple Blog Transparency Pantheon. We don’t have a family member who gets back to us as fast as does Williams. We send him an e-mail with our phone number, and the line is ringing in seconds. He addresses all questions quickly and completely, though sometimes he can be a bit prickly. Which is great. “I respect the press and I feel that they are a very important institution,” says Williams, a significant media entrepreneur. Speaking of his two-decade-long friendship with Carson, Williams says being “available” is the best approach to “doing your friend a service….Especially when you’re running for the highest office in the land, you’ve got to make a commitment that you’re not going to isolate yourself from the press.”","3985","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/11/18/ben-carson-fashions-mind-blowing-approach-to-public-accountability/"
"An exception from the Williams Doctrine occurred when CNN was poking around in the deep past of Carson as a kid growing up in Detroit. Correspondents Scott Glover and Maeve Reston were trying to firm up the tales of juvenile misconduct that Carson told in his memoir “Gifted Hands” and elsewhere. One of the stories involved Carson attempting to stab another youth, but hitting the kid’s belt buckle instead of soft flesh. “Why would anyone cooperate with your obvious witch hunt?” Williams wrote to CNN in an e-mail. “No comment and moving on…… Happy Halloween!!!!!”","3986","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/11/18/ben-carson-fashions-mind-blowing-approach-to-public-accountability/"
"Asked about that bit of stonewalling, Williams said, “I talked to that person and when I talked to them, the pushback was so strong, I realized that people have to come to this on their own.” That’s why he wasn’t giving up the name to reporters. (CNN, it should be noted, was seeking cooperation on a number of different anecdotes).","3987","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/11/18/ben-carson-fashions-mind-blowing-approach-to-public-accountability/"

"“I love him,” says Watts in a phone interview. “I have a very good relationship with him and I tell him directly many times that his energy and his response time, which is quicker than most Western gunslingers, is a little too fast for me and we debate it quite a bit…I guess we get sideways with him sometimes and he gets sideways with us but we are independent entities.

"As for the Clarridge-Gabriel thing, Watts says that he wouldn’t have facilitated interviews with advisers because the campaign is about to release white papers on the candidate’s position on foreign affairs, among other policy areas. “In my way of thinking, the candidate is the one and only and having anyone advance that or confuse the messages or content of any of the papers this close to the release of them is not a good idea,” says Watts.","3990","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/11/18/ben-carson-fashions-mind-blowing-approach-to-public-accountability/"
"Another reason cited by Watts: Clarridge, the guy referred to the New York Times by Williams, isn’t a senior adviser to the candidate. “Mr. Clarridge, in fact, was oversold by Armstrong to Trip Gabriel and I don’t mind saying that,” says Watts.","3991","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/11/18/ben-carson-fashions-mind-blowing-approach-to-public-accountability/"

"This was before the Affordable Care Act. I didn’t have terms like “preexisting conditions” on the tip of my tongue to communicate the vague, nagging concern I felt about whether she could get insurance in the future with this medical history. “No, what about later in life, when she’s older?” Carson just put his hand on my shoulder.

"Most health-care economists believe that the individual mandate, which requires Americans to carry insurance, is necessary to cover the cost of insuring people with preexisting conditions. Insurance companies can’t afford the risk of covering people who might need expensive care if they don’t also have a lot of healthy clients on their rolls to balance out the big payouts — such as for brain surgery and MRI check-ups. “The bottom line is that we can’t have fairly priced insurance for the healthy and the sick alike without the broad participation that is guaranteed by the mandate,” wrote Jonathan Gruber, a former Obama administration adviser on health care, in 2012.","4038","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/11/13/ben-carson-the-doctor-saved-my-daughters-life-ben-carson-the-president-might-put-others-in-jeopardy/"

"“Certainly once the heart starts beating. Certainly at that point,” life has begun, Carson said on Fox Business News in August. That was a deviation from the stance that life begins at conception, which Carson said is his personal belief.

"First, CNN published a story questioning the veracity of claims Carson has made about his life for decades. Carson has repeatedly described himself as a generally good but occasionally violently angry teen who came dangerously close to hurting people about whom he cared very much. What changed Carson? What made him the remarkably soft-spoken surgeon-turned-novice-politician — and, in some polls, the leading Republican contender for the White House — that we know today? To hear Carson tell it, it comes down to a few things:","4114","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/08/why-ben-carson-having-stabbed-someone-is-so-key-to-his-appeal-to-white-america/"
"CNN's story — one that started out with a fact-finding challenge because juvenile criminal records and certain student data, if they exist, are often shielded by law from public view — did not completely deliver. CNN turned to a number of people who said they knew Carson way back when and had no memory of such violent incidents. Carson's mother (who suffers from Alzheimer's disease) and his brother were unavailable for comment. So, the story concluded that Carson's tale of violence and deliverance cannot be confirmed.","4115","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/08/why-ben-carson-having-stabbed-someone-is-so-key-to-his-appeal-to-white-america/"
"But it was Carson himself who made the political importance of his once-angry-poor-and-violent-young-black-man story utterly clear. Late Thursday and early Friday, stories in which Carson clarified but stood by the claims started popping up. Carson told CNN that all this was part of a ""smear campaign."" By Friday, a Politico story raised questions about precisely what, if any, formal interest Carson had shown in West Point as a teen and the military academy in him. Carson seemed to concede that his descriptions have been imprecise, but he went no further.","4116","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/08/why-ben-carson-having-stabbed-someone-is-so-key-to-his-appeal-to-white-america/"

"Consider this: During the 2012 campaign, reports emerged about the time a teenage Mitt Romney led a prep-school posse outraged by what it viewed as the flagrantly gay appearance of a fellow student student. The group pinned down the student. Romney forcibly cut the student's hair. Decades later, Romney told Fox News Radio that he didn't remember the incident but was sorry about pranks that might have gone too far. But that didn't put an end to the question of whether Romney was a nice enough person or too steeped in a rich, white-guy brand of cruelty to become president. As his campaign ran its course, the Romney hair-cutting bully story joined the already-big Romney the cruel dog owner narrative. Then, there was that ""47 percent"" video.","4119","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/08/why-ben-carson-having-stabbed-someone-is-so-key-to-his-appeal-to-white-america/"

"Some will unquestionably argue that the mean, cruel Romney narrative was a function of media bias. Maybe. But it's also possible that voter biases gave those stories political meaning. Rich, mean, privileged white men have been villains in literature, film and some people's actual lives for a long, long time.

"Carson's up-from-nothing, saved-by-Jesus-and-personal-effort-only story works, primarily with white Republican voters. It works because for some it affirms the conscious or unconscious connections (stereotypes) they draw between blackness, poverty and violence. For others, it demonstrates that Jesus saves. And for others still, it is a narrative that says other, potentially costly social solutions to poverty and violence are not necessary. It says that small government can work.","4122","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/08/why-ben-carson-having-stabbed-someone-is-so-key-to-his-appeal-to-white-america/"

"For the record, black voters have not, since at least the early 2000s, been the group most in need of anything imploring them to simply vote. ""Freedom"" says nothing at all about Carson's claims that Obamacare is among the worst things that have happened to this country, including slavery. Nor does it mention that Obamacare has reduced the share of black Americans who are uninsured. It does not make mention of Carson's call for a tithing-inspired flat tax system.

A sample:","4148","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/08/ben-carson-rants-at-media-and-it-seems-to-be-serving-him-well/"
"The last two e-mails were representative, because, on the right, it is accepted as truth that the media failed to vet Obama and smoothed his path to the White House. It doesn't matter that ABC News broke the Jeremiah Wright story or that Politico broke the Bill Ayers story. Because those stories were not piled on Obama — or because he was able to break free of them — they are proof that the media went easy and allowed him to become president.","4149","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/08/ben-carson-rants-at-media-and-it-seems-to-be-serving-him-well/"
"This take on the press is basically immutable. In 2012, Breitbart News published a series on a young Obama titled “The Vetting,” predicated on the idea that ""the complicit mainstream media had refused to examine President Obama’s ideological past."" When the stories failed to blow up the president's reelection, a process called ""BenSmithing"" was blamed, named for the editor of Buzzfeed. BenSmithing, according to the New York Times, meant ""writing an article that supposedly tackles a Democratic Party scandal, but is actually intended to dismiss the issue."" Why was Smith a fitting namesake? Well, before Buzzfeed, he was the Politico reporter who first wrote about Obama's political debts to Ayers. The assumption that the media vets Democrats only as a way to clear them runs as deep as the assumption that it vets Republicans to destroy them.","4150","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/08/ben-carson-rants-at-media-and-it-seems-to-be-serving-him-well/"
"Carson, more than almost any Republican politician, is suited to make this argument. He is not really comparable to Herman Cain, a popular but minor tea party figure who become a primary phenom and blamed bias for the scrutiny that ended his campaign. Carson is an icon whose memoir has passed through the hands of home-schoolers and even public school students for decades.","4151","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/08/ben-carson-rants-at-media-and-it-seems-to-be-serving-him-well/"
"More people have read ""Gifted Hands"" than perhaps will ever read ""Dreams from My Father,""Obama's memoir. Obama was known to Democratic voters roughly 2½ years before he started running for president. Carson and his biography have been known since the late 1980s. Cover a Carson mega-rally, and you'll find people who know a young person who benefited from a Carson-endowed scholarship, or were even operated on by the man himself.","4152","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/08/ben-carson-rants-at-media-and-it-seems-to-be-serving-him-well/"
"The reporters now vetting Carson may know this, but it hasn't stopped them from falling into a trap. In Florida, after Carson asked why reporters had demanded his records but not those of Obama, one reporter could be heard quizzically asking why Obama's biography would ever be questioned. He had never tried to hide his mediocre early school tales.","4153","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/08/ben-carson-rants-at-media-and-it-seems-to-be-serving-him-well/"

"Totally fascinating. And very insightful. It's not just that people are sick of politicians. (We knew that.) It's that Republican voters feel like they were sold a bill of goods. They were told that if they voted Republicans into majorities in the House and the Senate, things would change. Then they didn't -- or , at least, not as much as they had hoped.

"Now, it's also true that the belief among rank-and-file Republicans that their elected officials didn't change things like they said they would reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how much you can get done when your party doesn't control the White House.

"But, that's sort of besides the point as it relates to the average GOP voter. When someone like Trump or Carson emerges promising to stand up for Republican principles in ways that the current leadership in the party hasn't done, it's immensely appealing.

"Even one of the nation’s most august founding fathers, James Madison, was not immune to such bias. His copious notes of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 used by scholars and the courts to interpret the origin and meaning of the nation’s founding document, are considered only semi-reliable, as he altered them through the years before they were published posthumously. They were revised “as he changed his understanding about the Convention,” wrote Mary Sarah Bilder, a Boston College Law Professor and author of “Madison’s Hand: Revising the Constitutional Convention.”","4216","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/09/why-we-cant-trust-ben-carsons-memories-or-anyone-elses/"

"“Research illustrates that the human mind is not like a tape recorder; we neither record events exactly as we see them, nor recall them like a tape that has been rewound,” the Innocence Project, which defends people it believes have been wrongly convicted, wrote on its Web site. “In eyewitness identifications, witness memory is impacted by a variety of factors that occur from the time of the crime onwards, and their memories can be easily contaminated.”","4218","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/09/why-we-cant-trust-ben-carsons-memories-or-anyone-elses/"
"To see this in action outside of a criminal court, one need look no further than Carson’s companion on many a debate stage: Donald Trump. In an review of Trump’s recently published book “Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again,” Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio wrote of the candidate’s shortcomings when it comes to self-evaluation.","4219","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/09/why-we-cant-trust-ben-carsons-memories-or-anyone-elses/"

"Still, Trump and Carson’s somewhat jumbled memories in their books are not wholesale fabrications of a fabulist like James Frey, the author of “A Million Little Pieces,” an autobiographical book promoted by Ophrah Winfrey until it was exposed as a million little lies. Instead, they may be embellishments or distortions of the Brian Williams variety: exaggerations, differences in interpretation or emphasis that arise as decades go by and, in the heat of a presidential campaign, are again refashioned to make their authors look good. Do the candidates deserve to be raked over the coals for puffery? That’s up to voters. But Trump’s job in his new book, after all, is not to write a fair-minded self-assessment. It is to win a presidential election.","4221","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/09/why-we-cant-trust-ben-carsons-memories-or-anyone-elses/"

"That sounds like a cliche, but I’ve seen the effect Carson has on a room full of low-income African American students when he tells the story of how he escaped a childhood of poverty in Detroit to graduate from Yale University, study medicine at the University of Michigan and become one of the most acclaimed surgeons of our time. Carson’s message — if I can do it, so can you — has a powerful impact on young people. I wish he were still delivering it.","4231","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gops-scariest-candidate/2015/10/12/370444f2-710d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

"His most recent burst of blather was over gun control in the wake of the Oregon massacre. As recently as Sunday, on “Face the Nation,” Carson was defending his assertion that the Holocaust would have been “greatly diminished” if Jews had been able to keep firearms in their homes. Gun control laws enacted by the Nazi regime, he contends, were a prelude to genocide.","4234","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gops-scariest-candidate/2015/10/12/370444f2-710d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"To say that experts disagree is an understatement. As Jonathan Greenblatt, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, wrote in the Huffington Post: “It is mind-bending to suggest that personal firearms in the hands of the small number of Germany’s Jews (about 214,000 remaining in Germany in 1938) could have stopped the totalitarian onslaught of Nazi Germany when the armies of Poland, France, Belgium and numerous other countries were overwhelmed by the Third Reich.”","4235","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gops-scariest-candidate/2015/10/12/370444f2-710d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

"It is equally beyond the pale, in my view, for Carson to have written on Facebook that while he saw the horror of gun violence as a youth in Detroit and as a doctor in emergency rooms, “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” Or to have implicitly criticized the victims in Oregon by saying that “I would not just stand there and let him shoot me,” stating that people who find themselves in such circumstances should rush the gunman.","4237","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gops-scariest-candidate/2015/10/12/370444f2-710d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"Carson’s story of a personal encounter with firearms is just weird. “I have had a gun held on me when I was in a Popeyes organization,” he told an interviewer, referring to the fried chicken chain. “Guy comes in, put the gun in my ribs.

"It is unclear what happened next. And it is unclear to me, frankly, that this really happened, though Carson swears it did.

"Disturbingly, Carson is a fan of dark conspiracies. Witness his claim that Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Russian President Vladimir Putin got to know each other in Moscow in 1968. All of them, he claims, were at Patrice Lumumba University at the time.","4240","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gops-scariest-candidate/2015/10/12/370444f2-710d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"PolitiFact looked into the matter and found one meager shred of evidence that Abbas might have attended the university, though no indication of when; zero evidence that Khamenei ever studied in Moscow; and the inconvenient fact that Putin was 16 at the time.

"The political press is chortling at BuzzFeed’s story that Ben Carson believes Egypt’s pyramids were built for grain storage, not as burial chambers. “My own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain,” he said in a 1998 commencement speech, referring to Genesis 41, which tells of Joseph storing Egypt’s grain during the “years of plenty” for the coming famine. Carson confirmed to CBS yesterday that he still believes this, but I’m not sure why this is such a big story. Before Wednesday, we knew that Ben Carson takes the Bible literally. After Wednesday, we knew the exact same thing. Frankly, I don’t care whether the president believes the pyramids were built by Joseph, aliens or the Egyptians themselves levitating the stones into place. What matters are the ideas — and that’s where the focus should be with Carson, since it’s clear he has no idea what he’s talking about.","November 5","4245","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carsons-striking-ignorance/"
"In the same week, Carson also said that Medicare and Medicaid fraud is “huge — half a trillion dollars.” If true, that would be almost 50 percent of our total spending on the two programs. The real number is somewhere between 3 and 10 percent — still a problem, but handing the program to a Carson White House would be like handing the drug war over to someone who believes half the United States is hooked on heroin. In the same Miami Herald interview, Carson was completely stumped by basic questions on U.S.-Cuba policy, before having no qualms about holding forth on the president’s Cuba policy.","4246","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carsons-striking-ignorance/"
"And on Wednesday night on Facebook, Carson defended his lack of experience by claiming, “Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience.” That is utterly false: Many of the signatories, including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, had been elected to colonial legislatures or other positions (and indeed were partly chosen for the Continental Congress precisely because of their prominence as elected officials). It’s one thing to be wrong about the pyramids, but Carson can’t cite the Founders both for the basic idea behind his outsider candidacy and for many of his policies when he can’t get their biographies right.","4247","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carsons-striking-ignorance/"
"That’s just the past week. Zoom out farther, and we find that Carson has changed his Medicare plan from “End Medicare” to a new version that doesn’t make any sense. He refuses to acknowledge that his tax plan would force trillions of dollars in spending cuts to reach the balanced budget he wants, partly because he or his advisers appear to have no idea what does and doesn’t get taxed. (For example, Carson’s calculation would include taxing all government spending, including defense.) And he has confused the budget and the debt ceiling. Those are just some of the specifics he has actually talked about — even the conservative Heritage Action says he needs to release more detailed plans. We haven’t even touched on his many offensive comments about women, the Holocaust, Muslims, gays and so on.","4248","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carsons-striking-ignorance/"
"As more and more debates have passed this fall, several commentators have suggested moderators should retire more confrontational questions (such as “Is this a comic book campaign?” or “another candidate said something bad about you last week; please respond”) and ask more basic things like, “Should the Federal Reserve raise interest rates?” Carson’s lack of knowledge backs up this strategy: If you ask him a more confrontational question, he can just brush it off as an attack by the lamestream media. But give him a wide berth, and he’ll expose his own ignorance. Carson’s words clearly show he will trip up all by himself.","4249","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carsons-striking-ignorance/"

"Essentially, the Koran suggests that a person who faces religious persecution can withhold the identity of their faith in order to avoid bodily harm or death. The concept was particularly embraced by Shiites, who took steps to hide their religious beliefs from the majority Sunnis.

"“Yes, it is permissible to hide the fact you are Muslim” if a person is under threat, “as long as it does not involve hurting another person,” Abou El Fadl said. “But there is no concept that would encourage a Muslim to lie to pursue a goal.

"“It is a dispensation within some aspects of Shia law, which was developed out of the experience of a persecuted religious minority,” said Omid Safi, director of the Duke University Islamic Studies Center. “In brief, it states to value human life over declaration of faith.

"Another expert on Islamic law, Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School, agreed that Carson’s comment was “very much oversimplified to the point of misrepresentation.” As Feldman put it, “taqiyya is dissimulation when one is being oppressed or tortured or having one’s views banned, a bit like Jesuit dispensation to lie under oath when your life is in danger.”","4264","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/22/ben-carsons-claim-that-taqiyya-encourages-muslims-to-lie-to-achieve-your-goals/"

"“If an American Muslim (or Muslim more generally) says that they want to kill Americans, we take them at face value,” said Safi as an example of the Catch-22. “If an American Muslim (or Muslims more generally) says that they are committed to American democratic principles and pluralism, we state that they are of course lying, and hoping to achieve nefarious goals.”","4266","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/22/ben-carsons-claim-that-taqiyya-encourages-muslims-to-lie-to-achieve-your-goals/"
"Hussein Ibish, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute, said that the claim made little sense because Islam is a proselytizing religion, like Christianity. “You’re supposed to preach it from the rooftops and the minarets” in order to gain adherents, not keep the religion a secret, he said. Advocates of the alternative version of taqiyya have “dragged a rather obscure and marginal concept out of the corner” to make broad-brush accusations against Muslims, he said.","4267","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/22/ben-carsons-claim-that-taqiyya-encourages-muslims-to-lie-to-achieve-your-goals/"

"Ben Carson is Having a Moment as a presidential candidate. After a first debate in which Carson distinguished himself primarily by speaking softly, his poll numbers have risen appreciably in Iowa, New Hampshire and across the nation. So as round two of the GOP debate season starts this evening, it’s worth asking an important question: Is Ben Carson qualified to be president?","September 16","4288","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/16/ben-carson-miracle-surgeon/"
"Donald Trump is clearly nervous about Carson, as he told Face the Nation’s John Dickerson, “Ben’s a doctor, and he’s not a dealmaker.” Since Trump’s background is even more suspect, that’s not the most persuasive criticism.","4289","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/16/ben-carson-miracle-surgeon/"
"On the other hand, Carson has stressed that his background as a neurosurgeon proves that he possesses important leadership qualities and decision-making skills, which sounds like a dubious claim. That claim was enough for Vox’s Dan Diamond to write a jeremiad about how surgeons should be kept as far as possible from the Oval Office. Diamond also quotes Malcolm Gladwell as an authority on the subject.","4290","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/16/ben-carson-miracle-surgeon/"
"More surprisingly, Diamond failed to mention the biggest personality flaw that most surgeons possess, a flaw that is worth discussing more fully.

"As the child of a surgeon, who often said “when I’m appointed czar” before spouting his political views, I know that the most stereotypical personality tic of surgeons is their world-class levels of arrogance. I love my father dearly, but if he ever were appointed czar, I would have no choice but to lead the partisan resistance. Most surgeons possess so much self-confidence that they should be kept away from the levers of power. And, indeed, Diamond does reference studies demonstrating that surgeons are often bad at administrating and other executive functioning skills.","4293","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/16/ben-carson-miracle-surgeon/"

"As John Dickerson noted in Slate after back-to-back interviews with Trump and Carson, what Carson has stressed during his campaign is a quality that is often said to be alien to the surgical mindset: humility.","4295","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/16/ben-carson-miracle-surgeon/"
"This is a theme that Carson has written about during the campaign, but it’s a theme he stressed long before he was a candidate for president as well.

"None of this should be interpreted as an endorsement of Carson’s platform. Everything I have read about Carson’s policy preferences sounds pretty bonkers.

"""I've been to Auschwitz repeatedly, and I've talked to many survivors of the Holocaust,"" said Huckabee. ""And one of the reasons that 10 or 11 Nazi guards could march thousands of Jews into a train, off a train, was because they had guns and the Jews didn't. If you read the history, one of the first things that the Nazis did was order registration of guns. Once they were registered, then all they had to do was pick them up and collect them -- which they did. All you have to do is read the Berlin newspaper from 1937 -- I've got that article somewhere -- but this was the day after Kristallnacht, and it expressly says that anyone found with a weapon would be shot.

"“The one that I’ve advocated is based on tithing, because I think God is a pretty fair guy,” Carson said at the first Republican debate. “And He said, you know, if you give me a tithe, it doesn’t matter how much you make. If you’ve had a bumper crop, you don’t owe me triple tithes.”","4354","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/carson-builds-his-platform-but-leaves-many-details-unexplained/2015/10/27/a6988e92-7cd7-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html"
"If Carson tried to pass such a plan as president, it would carry significant political risks. For one thing, it would serve to raise taxes on the poor — about 45 percent of Americans pay no federal income taxes at all now, and many would pay something under Carson’s plan. Also, a 10 percent rate would bring a major tax cut for the rich — and lead to a significant decline in the federal government’s revenue.","4355","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/carson-builds-his-platform-but-leaves-many-details-unexplained/2015/10/27/a6988e92-7cd7-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html"

"“Number one, it was not 10 percent,” said Andreas Köstenberger, a professor of theology at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C.

"He has said, for instance, that he does not want to follow Trump’s model and deport the approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.

"When Carson sketched out this idea last year in a newspaper column reprinted in his book “What I Believe,” he said that the immigrants would not be able to apply from within the United States. “People already here illegally could apply for guest-worker status from outside of the country, meaning they would have to leave first,” Carson wrote.","4361","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/carson-builds-his-platform-but-leaves-many-details-unexplained/2015/10/27/a6988e92-7cd7-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html"

"The neurosurgeon said much the same thing on his Facebook wall the previous night: “As a Doctor, I spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies,” he wrote. “There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking – but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.”","4368","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carsons-comment-on-oregon-shooter-generates-mega-media-attention/"
"He added: “The Left would prefer to use these tragedies to advance a political agenda. To me, that is also devastatingly sad,” he added. “The Left would have you believe that a man that asked Christians to stand up (and then executed them one by one) would obey ‘new gun laws.’ That kind of logic explains many of the problems we find ourselves in today.”","4369","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/07/ben-carsons-comment-on-oregon-shooter-generates-mega-media-attention/"

"“There’s no question I’m getting special scrutiny, because there are lot of people who are very threatened,” Carson said in a “Face the Nation” interview Sunday. “The whole point is to distract, distract the populace, distract me.”","4376","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-conservative-culture-of-victimization/2015/11/09/90156934-8717-11e5-be8b-1ae2e4f50f76_story.html"
"That’s rich, given how Carson’s own mouth has proved to be such a powerful weapon of mass distraction. His “personal theory” that the pyramids of Egypt were built by the biblical patriarch Joseph as grain silos — rather than by Egyptians as pharaonic tombs — is but one example.","4377","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-conservative-culture-of-victimization/2015/11/09/90156934-8717-11e5-be8b-1ae2e4f50f76_story.html"
"The retired neurosurgeon and novice politician, one of the leaders in the GOP presidential race, is aggrieved that journalists are looking into his background. Was he really “offered a full scholarship” to West Point, as he has claimed? Not exactly, it turns out. Was he really as much of a juvenile delinquent as he says? Maybe yes, maybe no.","4378","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-conservative-culture-of-victimization/2015/11/09/90156934-8717-11e5-be8b-1ae2e4f50f76_story.html"
"Because Carson has never before sought public office, it should be no surprise that the thorough vetting given to any major presidential candidate comes as a shock. Moreover, since Carson has no record to run on, his main appeal to voters is his inspirational life story: Through sheer determination and unshakable faith in God, a young man rises from inner-city Detroit to become one of the most acclaimed brain surgeons of his time. If the story crumbles, Carson’s candidacy goes with it.","4379","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-conservative-culture-of-victimization/2015/11/09/90156934-8717-11e5-be8b-1ae2e4f50f76_story.html"
"It is clear that the good doctor exaggerated some events and, shall we say, misremembered others. Instead of finding a way to acknowledge these lapses and move on, he responds with the notion that the scrutiny he’s getting is somehow “special.” This will come as a surprise to Marco Rubio, whose credit card bills and personal finances are being subjected to forensic accounting.

"Most absurd of all is Carson’s assertion — supported by an amen chorus of prominent conservatives — that Republicans are generally subjected to tougher vetting than Democrats.

"“I do not remember this level of scrutiny for one President Barack Obama when he was running,” Carson said Friday. “In fact, I remember just the opposite. I remember people saying, ‘Oh, we won’t really talk about that. We won’t talk about that relationship. Well, Frank Marshall Davis, well, we don’t want to talk about that. Bernardine Dohrn, Bill Ayers, well, we don’t really know him.

"Carson definitively refutes his own point. Obama’s friendships and associations were unearthed, reported and talked about incessantly. The stories he told in his books were truth-squadded. Critics suggested he was a secret Muslim while at the same time holding him responsible for sermons given by his Christian pastor.","4383","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-conservative-culture-of-victimization/2015/11/09/90156934-8717-11e5-be8b-1ae2e4f50f76_story.html"
"The idea that Democratic presidential candidates are somehow not thoroughly examined is patently absurd. Yet Ted Cruz got a big ovation at the CNBC debate when he pushed back at the aggressive questioning and claimed that in the recent Democratic debate, “every fawning question from the media was ‘Which of you is more handsome and wise?’ ”","4384","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-conservative-culture-of-victimization/2015/11/09/90156934-8717-11e5-be8b-1ae2e4f50f76_story.html"
"Cruz’s tirade and Carson’s complaining fit neatly into the conservative narrative of victimization by the liberal media.

"Oh, come on. What’s the threat, that Carson will lure African Americans in droves to the Republican Party? Let me go out on a limb and predict that a man who described the first black president as “like most psychopaths” and the Affordable Care Act as the worst thing since slavery will not prove to be much of a Pied Piper. The simple truth is that African Americans reject the GOP because it seems indifferent or hostile to their interests.","4387","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-conservative-culture-of-victimization/2015/11/09/90156934-8717-11e5-be8b-1ae2e4f50f76_story.html"
