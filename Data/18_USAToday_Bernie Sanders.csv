"WASHINGTON — He's a 73-year-old populist with a chaotic halo of thinning white hair who isn't, technically, a Democrat.

"But Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, slated to announce Thursday that he will seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, poses some significant political perils for Hillary Clinton — even though she's in such a strong position to win the nomination that ""front-runner"" doesn't quite do justice to the dominance of her standing.","2","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-2016/26564509/"
"Sanders, the longest-serving independent in congressional history, is positioned to tap the vocal resistance to Clinton among those in the Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party, since the Massachusetts senator herself insists she's not jumping into the race. He comes across as earnest, authentic and accustomed to the person-to-person campaigning favored in small states like his own and in Iowa and New Hampshire, states with the opening presidential contests.","3","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-2016/26564509/"

"Sanders is a leading opponent of the Obama administration's 12-nation Pacific trade pact; Clinton called it the ""gold standard"" when she was secretary of State and has dodged questions lately about whether she supports it now. He argues Wall Street banks have too much power; she has received millions of dollars in contributions and speaking fees from Wall Street interests for her campaigns, the Clinton Foundation and herself.","5","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-2016/26564509/"

"Then there's Clinton's vote in 2002 to authorize the Iraq war, which provided a critical opening for Barack Obama's challenge in 2008. Sanders, then a member of the House, voted against the authorization. Given the continued turmoil in Iraq, it's no favor to Clinton to be reminded of her early support of the war there.","7","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-2016/26564509/"

"""Possible?"" repeats Tad Devine, who was an adviser to the presidential campaigns of Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004. He has worked for Sanders since 1996, through a half-dozen House re-elections and two successful Senate runs. ""I'll say 'possible.' I'm not going to go much beyond 'possible.' I'm not going to deny for a second she is as strongly situated as any non-incumbent candidate who has sought the nomination of a major political party in my lifetime.","10","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-2016/26564509/"
"""But going back to Lyndon Johnson, you can change the calculus of an election, if you fit the times,"" he adds. The long-shot anti-war challenge by Minnesota Sen.

"Sanders aims to raise $50 million in small, online contributions to finance campaigns in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, and to get on the ballot in succeeding states, Devine says. If he does well in early contests, the theory goes, that will fuel a flood of contributions to continue. A PPP Poll of Iowa Democrats released Tuesday had Clinton at 62%, Sanders in second at 14%.","12","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-2016/26564509/"

"""Bernie Sanders is a great senator and a wonderful man, but he, and all of her other putative opponents, are in a vastly weaker position than Barack Obama was at this time eight years ago,"" Mellman says.

"For his generation, Burger said, ""the disconnect with electoral politics is that most politicians are afraid of taking bold stances, like on student debt, same-sex marriage, taking on Wall Street.

"The truth is that Social Security is a success story. Without it, nearly half of seniors, and 1 million children, would be living in poverty today.

"That's not true. The retirement trust fund has $2.8 trillion in surplus, enough to pay full benefits for 18 years (and three-quarters of benefits afterwards). Why not longer?

A Wall Street CEO who makes $18 million per year pays no more in payroll tax than someone earning $118,000.

"Among key findings:","607","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2015/02/20/nursing-home-performance-ratings-drop/23707745/"
"•The average overall rating among all Iowa nursing homes fell slightly, dropping from 3.48 stars to 3.29 stars.

"•Twenty-three nursing homes received higher overall ratings this year under the new way of measuring. That's 5 percent, about double the percentage that managed to score gains nationally.","609","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2015/02/20/nursing-home-performance-ratings-drop/23707745/"

"•About 17 percent — or 75 Iowa nursing homes — scored just one star in the category of anti-psychotic drug use, which the government had not previously measured. Facilities were docked for using those medications on residents unless they were indicated for specific conditions, such as schizophrenia, Huntington's disease or Tourette's syndrome. That compares with 20 percent of all U.S. nursing homes.","611","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2015/02/20/nursing-home-performance-ratings-drop/23707745/"

"""But the one thing that is not being asked is the obvious: How are people in those facilities being treated?"" said Hale, founder and owner of the Hale Group, an Ankeny-based consulting firm focused on long-term care public policy and service delivery issues. ""Ask the customer, ask the consumer or families how satisfied they are with the service. Is the staff helpful?

"Nursing home operators, meanwhile, are concerned that consumers will focus too much on the lower year-to-year ratings and won't realize the standards have changed.

"""Unfortunately, this redesign has downgraded some facilities' ratings, even though their quality efforts have improved during the same period,"" Ackerson said. ""These rating changes are not a true reflection of an individual facility's improvement or lack of improvement. It is simply a recalibration by CMS of the rating's scale and the addition of two new Quality Measures.""","618","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2015/02/20/nursing-home-performance-ratings-drop/23707745/"

"It was during this time that Hickson developed his own way of caring for the living and dead. Listening to and discerning the needs of grieving families, guiding them through the intricate process of laying one to rest, providing financial assistance, and talking candidly with young people about their plight are ways in which he connects.","837","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/04/13/hickson-funeral-dunbar-faust-violence/25728139/"

"Votes on the competing House and Senate GOP budgets will consume much of the week's legislative work, with both chambers expected to approve the measures before Congress adjourns Friday for a two-week recess. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., said they are working to enact a joint budget resolution by the statutory April 15 deadline.","855","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/23/budget-votes-congress/70337568/"
"If Republicans can agree to a joint budget resolution, which sets spending levels for the upcoming fiscal year, they could also trigger a protected legislative process known as reconciliation. Republicans intend to use that process to repeal Obamacare, because it requires only a majority vote and cannot be filibustered. Even if they are successful, however, Obama would veto the measure if it reaches his desk.","856","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/23/budget-votes-congress/70337568/"
"GOP leaders are hopeful that the appeal of targeting Obamacare will help ease ongoing intra-party divides over defense spending.

"However, some deficit hawks view the move as a budgetary gimmick that still contributes to the deficit. Other conservatives do not believe the budget balances quickly enough. A group of House conservatives in the Republican Study Committee released a budget Monday that achieves balance in six years and relies on deeper spending cuts.","858","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/23/budget-votes-congress/70337568/"
"The Senate budget is also more timid when it comes to Medicare. The House budget once again includes a call to overhaul the system from a guaranteed benefit to a premium support program where seniors are subsidized to buy private insurance. The Senate budget keeps Medicare intact, but calls for savings. Getting one chamber to embrace the other's approach will be a challenge in budget negotiations.","859","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/23/budget-votes-congress/70337568/"
"Failure to advance a joint resolution would be an embarrassing defeat for the nascent GOP majority.

"House Democrats also unveiled Monday their competing budgetary vision. It largely mirrors Obama's budget request that calls for $1.8 trillion in new taxes over the next decade from the wealthy and corporations. It would keep Medicare, Social Security and Obamacare intact, but it would add to the projected 10-year deficit. The Democratic budget will get a vote, but it has no chance of passage. Rather, the competing budget allows the parties to draw a stark contrast on their competing policy agendas.","861","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/23/budget-votes-congress/70337568/"

"So climate change can no longer be denied – or ignored. The world is looking to the United States – to us – to lead. And that's what we're doing. We're using more clean energy than ever before. America is number one in wind power, and every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. We're taking steps to waste less energy, with more fuel-efficient cars that save us money at the pump, and more energy-efficient buildings that save us money on our electricity bills.","944","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/18/president-obama-everglades-florida-earth-day-climate-pythons/25956089/"

We've committed to doubling the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China has committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the world's two largest economies came together, there's new hope that, with American leadership, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to prevent the worst impacts of climate change before it's too late.","945","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/18/president-obama-everglades-florida-earth-day-climate-pythons/25956089/"

"Many Republican candidates, both among those who lost as well as a few that won, are still questioning the decision by the state Republican Party and the House leadership in early 2014 to hire a consulting firm out of Indianapolis called Mark It Red. Although only in existence since 2012, Mark It Red partner Mike Gentry nevertheless claims his firm is responsible for ""flipping"" Indiana's House over the last 12 years from a 47 member minority (out of 100 seats) to a super-majority of 71. Gentry's group had a trial run doing the consulting work for (now) Rep. Suzanne Miles, the Republican who won the sex scandal-plagued John Arnold's House seat in a December 2013 special election. With that rather thin resumé, Mark It Red was signed to create and implement a coordinated game plan with final responsibility for every contested House race in Kentucky, an effort in size and scale it had never undertaken anywhere outside of Indiana. Candidates, whether an incumbent or a challenger, were all but compelled to give Mark It Red carte blanche control over their campaigns. (Prominent contrarian Phil Moffett, running in Jefferson County's 32nd district, unsurprisingly opted out. He won anyway.)","972","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/01/13/mark-lost-anatomy-defeat/21684513/"
"Despite a promise to run individual races tailored to the unique issues of each district, Mark It Red, for the crucial stretch drive, crafted a one-size-fits-all, cookie-cutter campaign that looked the same in Paducah as it did in Owensboro as it did in Bullitt County as it did in Jessamine County — all losses, by the way, despite Mitch McConnell and other GOP local candidates in those areas winning, some in landslides. Those four races alone, against two vulnerable Democratic incumbents and in two open seats, could have made the difference in winning the House.","973","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/01/13/mark-lost-anatomy-defeat/21684513/"
"The coup de grace may have been Mark It Red's ill-advised decision to inject the volatile Right to Work issue into nearly every district where it was running the show. Reluctant candidates who questioned this approach were assured that internal polling (done by the same firm (objectivity, s'il vous plait?) showed ""60 percent or better"" support for this white-hot button issue. Au contraire! Instead, it angered many voters in indisputably conservative areas but who nonetheless regard a union membership (or that of a family member) as an indispensable part of their economic security.","974","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/01/13/mark-lost-anatomy-defeat/21684513/"

"But all of those advantages (minus, of course, Mr. Stumbo) were also held by the Democrats in next-door West Virginia.

"Getting anywhere fast during the busiest time of year for Southwest Florida, when about 2.5 million visitors and seasonal residents are projected to bolster the population, can be a challenge.","1061","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"Just ask Brian Holly, managing director for the Holiday Inn Fort Myers Airport-Town Center. The hotel offers complimentary guest shuttle service to and from Southwest Florida International Airport, promising a vehicle every 20 minutes.","1062","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"During non-seasonal months, May through November, Holly said a single van can make the 7.2-mile round trip within that time frame. Currently, however, it's taking about 25 minutes – one way.","1063","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"""We've basically had to double the amount of runs we make,"" Holly said. ""We've had to get an extra van on the road so that creates additional labor and mileage costs.","1064","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"

"Some of Lee County roadways that experience the largest seasonal traffic increase, with some running as high as 163 percent above their 2013 average annual figures, are thoroughfares leading to and from the airport – Terminal Road, Treeline Avenue and Alico Road.","1069","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"While official 2014 annual traffic counts are not yet available for Lee and Collier counties, preliminary figures from the Lee Department of Transportation show increases in average annual traffic at an overwhelming majority of the county's permanent count stations.","1070","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"Most of those stations are already experiencing traffic volume above their annual averages. For example, Daniels Parkway west of Metro Parkway, which saw a 15 percent increase in average daily traffic in 2014 (from 40,100 cars to 46,000), experienced an additional 11 percent rise in daily volume during a seven-day stretch in mid-December (50,857), the official start of 2015 winter tourist season.","1071","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"Early reports are indicating this season's traffic could return to levels not seen since 2006, before the economic downturn led to double-digit declines in Southwest Florida's overall traffic count.","1072","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"

"Dealing with delays","1074","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"Between them, Lee and Collier's traffic operations centers are connected to nearly 600 signalized intersections. This allows DOT employees to monitor roadways and try to alleviate congestion problems when possible.","1075","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"""What we can do from here is manage our traffic signal controllers,"" said Anthony Khawaja, Collier's chief traffic operation engineer. ""We can adjust green time accordingly to try and keep traffic moving as smoothly as possible.""","1076","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"Khawaja said once a problem is confirmed, the center typically responds within five minutes. However, during peak season at peak hours of the day on heavily traveled stretches of the county's major roads, the impact of these alleviating measures is lessened.","1077","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"""When all the approaches are busy, it's very difficult to make adjustments,"" he said. ""When traffic is backed up in all four directions, what we try to do is balance the delay.""","1078","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"Randy Cercie, deputy director of Lee DOT, said the county uses traffic responsive control systems on a handful of intersections at its busiest roads, including Daniels Parkway, College Parkway and Del Prado Boulevard. These systems automatically check traffic counts at determined time intervals and if a certain vehicle threshold is reached, can independently alter signal light patterns without being ""told"" to do so by the traffic operations center, allowing for a quicker response to congestion problems.","1079","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"Next year, Cercie said, Lee will begin using adaptive signal systems on heavily traveled corridors. While their exact locations are not yet finalized, these systems would link together a series of traffic signals, allowing one that is experiencing congestion to independently control not just its own timing but timing of the signals both preceding and following it.","1080","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"Such proactive measures will be necessary as Southwest Florida enters a likely period of increased traffic, thanks to projected growth in tourism and permanent residents. The University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research projects Lee County's population will grow at an annual rate of 2.5 percent through 2040.","1081","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"
"""Really I think the next couple of years it will be higher than that when you get down to it,"" said Don Scott, executive director of the Lee County Metropolitan Planning Organization. ""For the foreseeable future, with the way the growth is going, there'll be more traffic.""","1082","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/19/tourist-season-brings-congestion-lee-collier-roads/21973487/"

"Income and Wealth Inequality: Today, we live in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world but that reality means very little for most of us because almost all of that wealth is owned and controlled by a tiny handful of individuals. In America we now have more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth, and the gap between the very rich and everyone is wider than at any time since the 1920s. The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral issue of our time, it is the great economic issue of our time and it is the great political issue of our time. And we will address it.","1343","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/26/remarks-by-sen-bernie-sanders/27979493/"
"Let me be very clear. There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and when 99 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. There is something profoundly wrong when, in recent years, we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires at the same time as millions of Americans work longer hours for lower wages and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on earth. There is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans. This grotesque level of inequality is immoral. It is bad economics. It is unsustainable. This type of rigged economy is not what America is supposed to be about. This has got to change and, as your president, together we will change it.","1344","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/26/remarks-by-sen-bernie-sanders/27979493/"
"Economics: But it is not just income and wealth inequality. It is the tragic reality that for the last 40 years the great middle class of our country – once the envy of the world – has been disappearing. Despite exploding technology and increased worker productivity, median family income is almost $5,000 less than it was in 1999. In Vermont and throughout this country it is not uncommon for people to be working two or three jobs just to cobble together enough income to survive on and some health care benefits.","1345","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/26/remarks-by-sen-bernie-sanders/27979493/"
"The truth is that real unemployment is not the 5.4 percent you read in newspapers. It is close to 11 percent if you include those workers who have given up looking for jobs or who are working part time when they want to work full time. Youth unemployment is over 17 percent and African-American youth unemployment is much higher than that. Today, shamefully, we have 45 million people living in poverty, many of whom are working at low-wage jobs. These are the people who struggle every day to find the money to feed their kids, to pay their electric bills and to put gas in the car to get to work. This campaign is about those people and our struggling middle class. It is about creating an economy that works for all, and not just the one percent.","1346","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/26/remarks-by-sen-bernie-sanders/27979493/"
"Citizens United: My fellow Americans: Let me be as blunt as I can and tell you what you already know. As a result of the disastrous Supreme Court decision on Citizens United, the American political system has been totally corrupted, and the foundations of American democracy are being undermined. What the Supreme Court essentially said was that it was not good enough for the billionaire class to own much of our economy. They could now own the U.S. government as well.

"American democracy is not about billionaires being able to buy candidates and elections.

According to media reports the Koch brothers alone, one family, will spend more money in this election cycle than either the Democratic or Republican parties. This is not democracy. This is oligarchy. In Vermont and at our town meetings we know what American democracy is supposed to be about. It is one person, one vote – with every citizen having an equal say – and no voter suppression.

"Jobs, Jobs, Jobs: It begins with jobs. If we are truly serious about reversing the decline of the middle class we need a major federal jobs program which puts millions of Americans back to work at decent paying jobs. At a time when our roads, bridges, water systems, rail and airports are decaying, the most effective way to rapidly create meaningful jobs is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. That's why I've introduced legislation which would invest $1 trillion over 5 years to modernize our country's physical infrastructure. This legislation would create and maintain at least 13 million good-paying jobs, while making our country more productive, efficient and safe. And I promise you as president I will lead that legislation into law.","1354","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/26/remarks-by-sen-bernie-sanders/27979493/"
"I will also continue to oppose our current trade policies.

"Raising Wages: Let us be honest and acknowledge that millions of Americans are now working for totally inadequate wages. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised. The minimum wage must become a living wage – which means raising it to $15 an hour over the next few years – which is exactly what Los Angeles recently did – and I applaud them for doing that. Our goal as a nation must be to ensure that no full-time worker lives in poverty. Further, we must establish pay equity for women workers. It's unconscionable that women earn 78 cents on the dollar compared to men who perform the same work. We must also end the scandal in which millions of American employees, often earning less than $30,000 a year, work 50 or 60 hours a week – and earn no overtime. And we need paid sick leave and guaranteed vacation time for all.","1356","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/26/remarks-by-sen-bernie-sanders/27979493/"

You can't hide your profits in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens, while there are massive unmet needs on every corner of this nation. Your greed has got to end.

Despite the modest gains of the Affordable Care Act, 35 million Americans continue to lack health insurance and many more are under-insured.

If you can believe it, the Republican budget throws 27 million Americans off health insurance, makes drastic cuts in Medicare, throws millions of low-income Americans, including pregnant women off of nutrition programs, and makes it harder for working-class families to afford college or put their kids in the Head Start program. And then, to add insult to injury, they provide huge tax breaks for the very wealthiest families in this country while they raise taxes on working families.","1363","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/26/remarks-by-sen-bernie-sanders/27979493/"
"Well, let me tell my Republican colleagues that I respectfully disagree with their approach. Instead of cutting Social Security, we're going to expand Social Security benefits. Instead of cutting Head Start and child care, we are going to move to a universal pre-K system for all the children of this country. As Franklin Delano Roosevelt reminded us, a nation's greatness is judged not by what it provides to the most well-off, but how it treats the people most in need.

"College for All: And when we talk about education, let me be very clear. In a highly competitive global economy, we need the best educated workforce we can create. It is insane and counter-productive to the best interests of our country, that hundreds of thousands of bright young people cannot afford to go to college, and that millions of others leave school with a mountain of debt that burdens them for decades. That must end. That is why, as president, I will fight to make tuition in public colleges and universities free, as well as substantially lower interest rates on student loans.","1365","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/26/remarks-by-sen-bernie-sanders/27979493/"
"War and Peace: As everybody knows, we live in a difficult and dangerous world, and there are people out there who want to do us harm. As president, I will defend this nation – but I will do it responsibly. As a member of Congress I voted against the war in Iraq, and that was the right vote. I am vigorously opposed to an endless war in the Middle East – a war which is unwise and unnecessary. We must be vigorous in combatting terrorism and defeating ISIS, but we should not have to bear that burden alone.

"Even more than Trump, Sanders has all the excitement within his party. As Chris Stirewalt of Fox News comments: “If Sanders can pack nearly 30,000 souls into a Portland, Ore., arena, it’s fair to say that he is doing even better than Trump in harnessing the outrage that animates voters, particularly older, white ones, who believe that America is truly at the abyss.

"One of those weak points is that the Sanders phenomenon is mostly among white people.

"“We are tired of seeing black women yanked out of a car, thrown to the ground, assaulted, put in handcuffs and then sent to jail and then die three days later,” Sanders said Wednesday during a live broadcast to volunteers. He was referring to the July 13 death of Sandra Bland, an African-American woman who died in jail after a traffic stop in Texas. Her death was ruled a suicide, but her family disputes the finding.","1632","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/30/sanders-focuses--racial-justice-reform/30891827/"

"Blacks are a crucial source of Democratic votes and accounted for President Barack Obama’s entire margin of victory in seven states in 2012, according to the Cook Political Report.

"“It’s fair to say that I don’t think Bernie Sanders has any relationships with civil rights or African-American leaders of any depth or longevity,” Morial said. “Bernie has to get to know people.

"I have been reading several opinion letters in recent weeks that deal with the subject of presidential candidates. Whether attacking or defending, the letters seem to agree on one point: Sen.

His ideas are lock step with the people’s desires.

"His stance on all issues is unchanged from what he has always stood for. He does not have millionaires backing him — just grassroots donations.

"He’s right. The rise — and, for that matter, the fall, if fall it is — of Trump is an indictment of the GOP establishment and, for that matter, of the American political establishment in general. And that failure bodes poorly for the future, regardless of what happens to Trump.","1665","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/09/trump-american-ruling-class-tyranny-column/31371813/"
"Trump’s rise is, like that of his Democratic counterpart Bernie Sanders, a sign that a large number of voters don’t feel represented by more mainstream politicians. On many issues, ranging from immigration reform, which many critics view as tantamount to open borders, to bailouts for bankers, the Republican and Democratic establishments agree, while a large number (quite possibly a majority) of Americans across the political spectrum feel otherwise. But when no “respectable” figure will push these views, then less-respectable figures such as Trump or Sanders (a lifelong socialist who once wrote that women dream of gang rape, and that cervical cancer results from too few orgasms) will arise to fill the need.","1666","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/09/trump-american-ruling-class-tyranny-column/31371813/"
"But Trump and Sanders are just symptoms. The real disease is in the ruling class that takes such important subjects out of political play, in its own interest. As Angelo Codevilla wrote in an influential essay in 2010, today’s ruling class is a monoculture that has little in common with the rest of the nation:","1667","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/09/trump-american-ruling-class-tyranny-column/31371813/"
"“Never has there been so little diversity within America's upper crust. Always, in America as elsewhere, some people have been wealthier and more powerful than others. But until our own time, America's upper crust was a mixture of people who had gained prominence in a variety of ways, who drew their money and status from different sources and were not predictably of one mind on any given matter. The Boston Brahmins, the New York financiers, the land barons of California, Texas and Florida, the industrialists of Pittsburgh, the Southern aristocracy and the hardscrabble politicians who made it big in Chicago or Memphis had little contact with one another.","1668","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/09/trump-american-ruling-class-tyranny-column/31371813/"
"“Today's ruling class, from Boston to San Diego, was formed by an educational system that exposed them to the same ideas and gave them remarkably uniform guidance, as well as tastes and habits. These amount to a social canon of judgments about good and evil, complete with secular sacred history, sins (against minorities and the environment), and saints.

"But party insiders are making sure their preferred candidate — Hillary Clinton — is protected from debate. “It's all about trying to preordain the outcome, circle the wagons and close off debate,” O'Malley told The Hill. “If (the Democratic Party leaders) could actually accelerate the date of the Iowa caucuses and hold them tomorrow — they'd like to do that.

"This scheme by Clinton’s DNC cronies is poised to backfire. While Democratic voters still favor Clinton in national polls, the margin is shrinking. Her arrogant and secretive email server shenanigans are reminding Americans just how entitled and unaccountable Clinton believes herself to be.

"At some point, perhaps party officials will realize she’s a terrible candidate who needs sharpening before battling the GOP nominee.

"In a court filing that was part of a lawsuit against the State Department, officials told a federal judge in Washington they would be able to meet an existing schedule to release copies of Clinton’s emails because only about 5% of the messages reviewed so far contain possible secret information that could hold them back for further analysis. The agency said those 305 emails with potential classified data were among more than 1,500 documents analyzed so far.","1967","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/17/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department/31882983/"
"The filing came after Clinton said in an Iowa radio interview that during her stint as secretary of State in the Obama administration she had never sent or received any emails on her private server that had information clearly marked classified.

"The email controversy has proven a major distraction for Clinton as she campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.

"Last month, the inspector general for the State Department warned that some of the information that passed through Clinton’s home-based private server was classified information produced by the U.S. intelligence community. It’s generally not possible to forward or cut-and-paste an email marked classified to a private account because classified email systems are closed to outsiders. But it can be illegal to paraphrase or retype classified information from a secure email into an unprotected message sent to a personal address.","1974","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/17/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department/31882983/"
"The State Department acknowledgement that 305 Clinton emails were being reviewed for possible national security concerns came as part of legal sparring in a lawsuit against the agency by journalist Jason Leopold, a reporter with Vice News. In January, Leopold sued the agency to quickly produce Clinton emails and other documents that were sought under a freedom of information request dating back to 2014.","1975","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/17/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department/31882983/"
"Leopold’s case is one of several pending against the State Department for Clinton records. The AP also sued the agency this year for failing to turn over copies of emails and other documents since mid-2013 and in one case, back to 2010. In both cases, U.S. district court judges have pressed the State Department to produce records on a firm schedule.","1976","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/17/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department/31882983/"
"But Leopold’s lawyers have raised concerns that the intelligence review of Clinton’s emails has bogged down the schedule of release ordered previously by U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras. Leopold’s lawyer said the department missed its July target by more than 1,000 pages of emails, in part because of screening by five intelligence agencies.","1977","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/17/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department/31882983/"
"State Department lawyers said that despite the growing number of Clinton emails that will have to be forwarded to intelligence agencies for review, the government was confident that the low number — 5.1% of the total — would not slow down public release of the emails.","1978","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/17/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department/31882983/"

"WASHINGTON — Sen. Bernie Sanders used Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate to pitch the populist economic message that has electrified his supporters.

"To have a chance at winning the party's nomination, political experts say, Sanders must make inroads with voters supporting former secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and that didn't seem to happen during the debate.","2195","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/14/experts-doubt-debate-expanded-support-bernie-sanders/73916986/"

"Sanders, polling at about 25%, skipped the chance for a personal introduction and launched straight into his core message: The middle class is disappearing and the nation's campaign finance system “is corrupt and is undermining American democracy.”","2197","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/14/experts-doubt-debate-expanded-support-bernie-sanders/73916986/"
"Sanders' strategy is to expand the Democratic electorate beyond the people who normally vote in primaries. The more than 4,000 debate-watch parties organized by his backers ""will turn out votes and help us win this election,"" Sanders wrote in a Wednesday email to supporters.","2198","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/14/experts-doubt-debate-expanded-support-bernie-sanders/73916986/"
"By some measures, Sanders generated more online and social media interest than his debate rivals, and some focus groups cast him as the winner. Experts said he did well, but Dennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University, said ""I don’t think he did anything to add supporters.""","2199","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/14/experts-doubt-debate-expanded-support-bernie-sanders/73916986/"

"But Sanders was forced off that message to defend his more moderate record on guns by noting that he represents a rural state, said Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, campaign manager of Howard Dean’s presidential campaign in 2004. Sanders favors a ban on assault weapons along with strong background checks for firearms buyers, including at gun shows, but he's voted to limit gun makers' and gun dealers' legal liability and he opposed the pro-gun control Brady Bill.","2201","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/14/experts-doubt-debate-expanded-support-bernie-sanders/73916986/"

"His most memorable moment, though, had nothing to do with his own record. In one of the most striking statements of the debate, Sanders angrily condemned the controversy surrounding Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state, saying “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails.""","2205","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/14/experts-doubt-debate-expanded-support-bernie-sanders/73916986/"

"“With Bernie, there’s no way we’re ever going to try to change the way he presents himself or what he says,” Tad Devine, Sanders’ senior media adviser, said before the debate began. “Because that’s the power of his campaign. We think he’s connecting to people because he’s very authentic in his presentation and his message is more powerful than anyone else’s.”","2208","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/14/experts-doubt-debate-expanded-support-bernie-sanders/73916986/"
"Goldford said the moment made Sanders seem magnanimous. But his unwillingness to exploit a chance to hurt his main opponent could be a weakness, he said.","2209","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/14/experts-doubt-debate-expanded-support-bernie-sanders/73916986/"
"If Sanders is correct about the existence of a “great liberal majority” that hasn’t been mobilized, he should emphasize Clinton’s establishment Wall Street connections and argue “she’s too quick to compromise with the powers that be,” Goldford said.","2210","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/14/experts-doubt-debate-expanded-support-bernie-sanders/73916986/"

"After proving he can draw crowds in the thousands, Sanders is moving toward the “persuasion” phase of his candidacy. He’ll hold smaller events in the two early voting states, in addition to his mega-rallies, so he can take questions from undecided voters, according to Tad Devine, Sanders’ senior media strategist.","2215","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/22/bernie-sanders-campaign-enters-persuasion-phase/74414176/"
"Vice President Biden’s decision to opt out of the 2016 campaign helps solidify Sanders’ position as the Democratic Party’s alternative to front-runner Hillary Clinton. But Devine said that doesn’t impact Sanders’ strategy.","2216","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/22/bernie-sanders-campaign-enters-persuasion-phase/74414176/"
"“From the beginning, this campaign really has not been about opponents, it’s been about Bernie and his message,” Devine said. “We’re not going to deviate from that strategic course.”","2217","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/22/bernie-sanders-campaign-enters-persuasion-phase/74414176/"
"It’s unclear how a Biden bid would have affected Sanders’ chances, but national polls suggest the vice president’s absence from the race could make Sanders’ already difficult path toward the nomination even more challenging. Four polls taken since the first Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 13 showed Clinton's lead over Sanders jumped from an average of 23.5 percentage points to an average of 30 when Biden was excluded as an option.","2218","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/22/bernie-sanders-campaign-enters-persuasion-phase/74414176/"
"“Now she is the formidable front-runner again,” Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute in New Jersey, said of Clinton. “It doesn’t look like (Sanders) can make this up. Even if he pulls off a win in New Hampshire, the problem is he doesn’t have the blue-collar vote, he doesn’t have the Latino or African-American vote. When we get to Super Tuesday, those groups are going to dominate.”","2219","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/22/bernie-sanders-campaign-enters-persuasion-phase/74414176/"
"James Campbell, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo, said Biden’s decision helps Clinton. He said the opposition Clinton faces from Sanders is a secondary concern compared to the significance of her performance Thursday testifying before the House committee on Benghazi, and the controversy over her use of a private email server while secretary of State.","2220","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/22/bernie-sanders-campaign-enters-persuasion-phase/74414176/"
"“Most likely the only way she is not getting that nomination would be a self-destruction,” he said in a statement.","2221","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/22/bernie-sanders-campaign-enters-persuasion-phase/74414176/"
"Devine disagreed, saying the path for Sanders is even clearer now because Biden cited priorities in his Wednesday announcement that are similar to Sanders’, such as the need for campaign finance reform and to end income inequality.","2222","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/22/bernie-sanders-campaign-enters-persuasion-phase/74414176/"

"Sanders has begun to show his lighter side, dancing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and joking about comedian Larry David’s portrayal of him on Saturday Night Live. That portrayal featured David bragging, in Sander’s characteristic shout, that he had only one clean pair of underwear, prompting Sanders to assure reporters in Iowa he has “an ample supply of underwear.”","2224","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/22/bernie-sanders-campaign-enters-persuasion-phase/74414176/"
"Part of Sanders’ strategy is to begin speaking more substantively on issues, including what it means to be a democratic socialist, the term he uses to describe his politics. He also plans to offer more specifics in speeches about his economic plan, including his ideas for taxes and generating revenue. Another topic: how he would handle his role as commander-in-chief.","2225","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/22/bernie-sanders-campaign-enters-persuasion-phase/74414176/"
"The campaign has continued to draw significant resources from small contributions, according to Devine. Between Sept. 28 and Oct. 15, it raised $6.7 million in contributions of less than $200. That has allowed the campaign to continue to hire staff, open field offices and conduct research to begin advertising. The campaign hired pollster Ben Tulchin, who previously worked for former Democratic National Committee chairman and former presidential candidate Howard Dean, Devine said.","2226","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/22/bernie-sanders-campaign-enters-persuasion-phase/74414176/"

"“Absolutely,” Sanders said. “In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.

"As we also have written before, despite some claims to the contrary, there is some evidence that climate change is linked to more severe hurricanes, droughts and other weather disasters.

"This is the first link in the chain of logic that provides the basis of Sanders’ claim.

"The authors analyzed the severity and frequency of droughts in the region and concluded that a severe drought in the Fertile Crescent region in 2007-2010 — just prior to the Syrian uprising — would not have been as severe or lasted as long absent a “century-long drying trend.” That trend, the authors contend, is the result of “human interference with the climate system.” In other words, the authors found that human-caused climate change “increased the probability” of the severe drought. The drought resulted in widespread crop failure and led to mass migration of farming families to urban centers, causing conflicts.","2527","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/17/fact-check-bernie-sanders-climate-link-terrorism/75950720/"

"“The continuous violence, political disintegration, and massive migration we’re seeing in Syria and neighboring countries right now is precisely what the Pentagon warned us about over a decade ago,” a Sanders campaign spokesman related via email. “And it is exactly the kind of environment in which extremist groups like ISIS, al-Qaeda, and Hezbollah flourish. … Climate change is making terrorist threats … much worse.”","2537","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/17/fact-check-bernie-sanders-climate-link-terrorism/75950720/"
"Indeed, a 2012 study by the National Research Council, commissioned by the CIA to evaluate the evidence on possible connections between climate change and U.S. national security concerns (summarized in the New York Times), concluded, “It is prudent to expect that over the course of a decade some climate events—including single events, conjunctions of events occurring simultaneously or in sequence in particular locations, and events affecting globally integrated systems that provide for human well-being—will produce consequences that exceed the capacity of the affected societies or global systems to manage and that have global security implications serious enough to compel international response.”","2538","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/17/fact-check-bernie-sanders-climate-link-terrorism/75950720/"

"In other words, Sanders has broad support for his claim that climate change is a factor in the terrorism equation, that it can contribute to and worsen tensions in some regions and lead to instability that poses security threats. But there is a complex web of causal factors behind the Syrian conflict and the Islamic State terrorism that has emerged from it. A study concluded that global warming “increased the probability” of a severe drought, a drought which contributed to displacement and mass migration, which contributed to instability, which may have contributed to violent conflict. But increasing the probability of a possible factor in a conflict isn’t the same as being a “directly related” cause for terrorism. The evidence so far does not support Sanders’ claim.","2540","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/17/fact-check-bernie-sanders-climate-link-terrorism/75950720/"

"There was no sassy undercard debate before the main event. No crowd of contenders jockeying on stage.

"Clinton lost her status as the party's inevitable nominee through a difficult summer, but she remains the front-runner by double digits and the party's most likely standard-bearer in 2016. That put her in the spotlight and in the cross hairs from a combative Sanders and a trio of long-shot candidates — former Virginia senator Jim Webb, former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee and O'Malley — struggling for traction at their first face-to-face encounter.","2549","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/analysis-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democratic-debate/73866212/"
"But after two dozen debates in the 2008 campaign, Clinton was by far the most experienced figure on stage, giving no quarter against four rivals who were each making their first appearance in a national debate. She cited the breakthrough that her election as the first female president would represent. And she repeatedly sought to contrast her positions not with her Democratic competitors but against the Republicans, as though she already had made it to the general election.","2550","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/analysis-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democratic-debate/73866212/"
"On the issue that has dogged her for months, her exclusive use of a private email server when she was secretary of State, she acknowledged with a determined smile that it ""wasn't the best choice."" Then she called the special House panel investigating it ""an arm of the Republican National Committee"" — citing bragging by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy that the inquiry had succeeded in bringing down her poll ratings — and said she preferred to talk about the kitchen-table issues that concern most Americans.","2551","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/analysis-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democratic-debate/73866212/"
"Even Sanders joined her on that. ""The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,"" the Vermont senator said to laughter. ""Let's talk about the real issues facing Americans."" Clinton reached out to shake his hand, and the largely partisan audience stood and applauded.","2552","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/analysis-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democratic-debate/73866212/"

"Sanders faced a barrage of questions as well. He was forced to explain how he would be able to serve as commander in chief despite having applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. He denied that his affiliation as a democratic socialist, and the fact that he says he's not a capitalist, would make him unelectable, noting he had demonstrated an ability to enlist the enthusiastic support of young people.","2554","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/analysis-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democratic-debate/73866212/"
"For all the fireworks at the debate, sponsored by CNN and moderated by Anderson Cooper, two other events that follow in short order are likely to be equally consequential for Clinton.

"And Vice President Biden is expected to announce whether he'll jump in the race, a decision he initially promised by the end of the summer but has delayed as he weighs the impact on his family and his prospects to prevail. Advisers acknowledge that the approach of filing deadlines for primary ballots in several states — including in first-in-the-nation New Hampshire — presumably will force him to make a call soon, one way or the other.","2556","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/analysis-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democratic-debate/73866212/"

"In a bit of political irony, that fact reflects the coalition Obama helped shape, which is younger, more racially diverse and more dominated by the East and West coasts than it was before his tenure. It also reflects the continuing impact of the Great Recession and the failure of the recovery that has followed to raise wages and hopes for many Americans. As a result, the political landscape is friendly to Sanders' populist message for expansive government social programs, higher taxes on the wealthy and tougher regulations on Wall Street.","2559","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/analysis-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democratic-debate/73866212/"
"That's been great for the Vermont senator, who has espoused leftist policies since he was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981. But at times it has been awkward for Clinton, who only in recent weeks announced she would oppose the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. When she was in Obama's Cabinet, she had praised the trade deal as the ""gold standard.""","2560","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/analysis-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democratic-debate/73866212/"
"The field is more liberal and more ideologically consistent than some Democratic contests in the past, including in 1992, when centrist Bill Clinton portrayed himself as a ""new kind of Democrat"" challenging some of the party's liberal traditions. This time, Hillary Clinton has found herself distancing herself from her husband on criminal justice and other issues.","2561","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/analysis-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democratic-debate/73866212/"
"That's another parallel with the Republican Party, illustrated by this year's debates. If the Las Vegas debate made it clear that the Democrats have moved left, the GOP debates have demonstrated how the GOP has moved to the right from the days of the presidents Bush. Like Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush has found himself distancing himself from some of the policies taken by his father and brother.","2562","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/13/analysis-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democratic-debate/73866212/"

"The Vermont independent drops Pope Francis’ teachings into conversation and speeches, posts his comments on social media and highlights news stories about him on his website.

"I watched Bernie Sanders's speech in Columbia, South Carolina on a recent night. I thought it was great. The economic populist in me was cheering. When Sanders talks about income inequality he is hitting a nerve.

"Sanders, the progressive Vermont senator, will be speaking at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia on September 14. Liberty, the school founded by the Reverend Jerry Falwell, has long been a defender of conservative values. In the past it has not only championed Christian morality, but it has promoted free markets and limited government. Sanders may be the most progressive person who has ever spoken — if not set foot — on the Lynchburg campus.","2618","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/03/bernie-sanders-liberty-university-speech-column/71462920/"

"I don't know what motivated Liberty University to invite Sanders. The cynical side of me says that the Liberty leadership wants him to speak so that they can point out the wrongness of his progressive views. I am sure Sanders's visit will be discussed at length in Liberty classrooms, giving professors plenty of opportunities to debunk his ideas.","2620","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/03/bernie-sanders-liberty-university-speech-column/71462920/"

"I hope the students, faculty and administrators at Liberty listen carefully to Sanders. Inequality, poverty and health care are moral issues.

"Sanders often talks about ""protecting the most vulnerable Americans."" It is one of the lynchpins of his campaign. For Sanders, this means protecting senior citizens and children in poverty by strengthening government programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other social safety nets.

"""It is not acceptable that billionaires grow richer while kids in this country go hungry.

Whatever one thinks about the recently released Planned Parenthood videos, one thing seems clear: aborted fetuses are alive, they are vulnerable and they need protection.","2629","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/03/bernie-sanders-liberty-university-speech-column/71462920/"

"The briefs, which come in men and women's versions, can be ordered over the Internet and cost a somewhat hefty $15 per pair (plus shipping and handling), perhaps getting away from the man-of-the-people ethos of the self-declared Democratic socialist.

"In recent weeks, Clinton has crept closer to Sanders on a number of more liberal policies.

"Before the Register staff began asking questions in his editorial board visit this month, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was given a few minutes to say why he wants to be president of the United States. He plunged right in and reeled off a litany of evidence that this nation is seriously out of whack.","10:02 a.m. EDT September 14, 2015","2688","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/11/bernie-sanders-revolution-democratic-socialist/72029734/"
"This country’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a tiny group of billionaires. Democracy has become oligarchy as the billionaire class and corporations are allowed by the U.S. Supreme Court to spend limitless amounts of money to affect the outcome of elections. We are the wealthiest nation in the world, yet two in 10 children live in poverty and a third of our youth are unemployed. We hand out criminal records for marijuana convictions but not for Wall Street criminals.","2689","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/11/bernie-sanders-revolution-democratic-socialist/72029734/"
"This was a quick recitation of Sanders’ standard stump speech, and the message resonates with many disaffected voters who see the United States becoming a nation where the 1 percent own most everything, including Washington, while the poverty increases and the middle class disappears. Sanders held forth like this for 90 minutes, covering a broad range of issues.","2690","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/11/bernie-sanders-revolution-democratic-socialist/72029734/"
"Sanders is intense and on message with rapid-fire facts, figures and occasionally rising anger. He looks a bit like a disheveled professor, with a shock of windblown white hair and a clipped Brooklyn accent. He gives the impression he’s gotten most of our questions before.","2691","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/11/bernie-sanders-revolution-democratic-socialist/72029734/"
"An exception was about his personal management style, prompted by a story in a Vermont alternative weekly that quoted anonymous sources who said he could be tough, bordering on abusive, with his staff.","2692","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/11/bernie-sanders-revolution-democratic-socialist/72029734/"
"“Where did you get that information?” Sanders snapped. “You got it from one article from one person who quoted four anonymous people.” While he said he was offended by the accusations, he does not deny being a demanding boss. “Yes, I do work hard. Yes, I do demand a lot of the people who work with me. Yes, some people have left who were not happy. But I would say that by and large in my Senate office, in my House office, in my campaign, the vast majority of the people who have worked with me consider that to be a very, very good experience and a learning experience and have gone on to some great things.”","2693","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/11/bernie-sanders-revolution-democratic-socialist/72029734/"
"Another topic Sanders has talked little about in this campaign is foreign policy. He has strong opinions, of course, such as a very high bar for going to war. In general, he says “war is the last resort of a great nation,” and though he supported the U.S. bombing missions in Kosovo and the war in Afghanistan, he opposed both wars in Iraq.","2694","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/11/bernie-sanders-revolution-democratic-socialist/72029734/"
"Sanders really wants to talk about economic inequality, however, which he sees as eating away at the very core of this nation. What would he do about those things, though, and how would he get his solutions through Congress?","2695","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/11/bernie-sanders-revolution-democratic-socialist/72029734/"
"Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, is not shy about prescribing solutions considered heresy by conservatives.","2696","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/11/bernie-sanders-revolution-democratic-socialist/72029734/"
"His Supreme Court justices would strip unlimited campaign spending by corporations and billionaires and replace that with taxpayer-funded campaigns. He would make tuition free at public universities. The Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) would be replaced with a single-payer government health insurance program similar to Canada’s or Medicare. Tax breaks would end for billionaires and a new tax would be imposed on Wall Street speculation.","2697","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/11/bernie-sanders-revolution-democratic-socialist/72029734/"
"In short, the Sanders agenda would require a political revolution at the grass roots, a total overhaul of Congress, new personnel on the U.S. Supreme Court and a Constitutional amendment or two for good measure. All that seems far-fetched, but who knows? At the rate Sanders is gaining momentum, he is at least off to a good start.","2698","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2015/09/11/bernie-sanders-revolution-democratic-socialist/72029734/"

"Here’s where it went fatally wrong for Trump. During the GOP debate on Fox, when Megyn Kelly famously queried him about his attitude toward women (whom he has called “fat pigs,” “dogs,” “slobs” and “animals”) he hit back by threatening the questioner: “I’ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me.

"Bad enough to alienate women in this way, but there’s even more insidious political crime here: attacking the First Amendment’s protection of a free press by menacing journalists. “I wouldn’t do that,” he said coyly. If you wouldn’t do it, why bring up that you could? For no other reason than to stifle other journalists who might want to ask tough but reasonable questions.

"Later, after Trump had blamed her attitude on her menstrual cycle, Kelly went on what Fox says was a planned vacation. Nevertheless, Trump suggested he may have been the cause. What kind of candidate takes credit for bullying the media? And last week, Trump allowed Univision reporter Jorge Ramos to be ejected from a press conference for asking questions about immigration without being called upon. Ramos was later readmitted and permitted to ask about immigration, during which he said Trump could still deport immigrants compassionately. “I have a bigger heart than you do,” Trump replied. Trump’s non-specific answer to the question ended with a personal insult directed at the reporter.","2804","https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/09/03/difference-donald-trump-bernie-sanders/71638134/"

"Trump’s rationale for avoiding Kelly’s debate question — that neither he nor America has time for “political correctness” — taps into a popular boogeyman. The term “political correctness” is so general that to most people it simply means a discomfort with changing times and attitudes, an attack on the traditions of how we were raised. (It’s an emotional challenge every generation has had to go through.) What it really means is nothing more than sensitizing people to the fact that some old-fashioned words, attitudes and actions may be harmful or insulting to others. Naturally, people are angry about that because it makes them feel stupid or mean when they really aren’t. But when times change, we need to change with them in areas that strengthen our society.","2808","https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/09/03/difference-donald-trump-bernie-sanders/71638134/"

Or to deny a woman a job because she’s not attractive enough to you. Or to assume a person’s opinion is worth less because she is elderly. Or that physically challenged individuals shouldn’t have easy access to buildings. If you don’t have time for political correctness, you don’t have time to be the caretaker of our rights under the Constitution.","2809","https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/09/03/difference-donald-trump-bernie-sanders/71638134/"
"It’s easy to buy into the Trump mirage because his rising poll numbers indicate he’s actually doing well. But polls are historically misleading, and his supporters will eventually desert him. Many, such as Tom McCarthy in the Guardian, have laid out the statistical reasons Trump can’t win, complete with graphs that show polls from past presidential candidates who were doing even better than Trump at this stage of an election, only to fade into political irrelevance, like Rudy Giuliani, Howard Dean and Ross Perot. In 2008, Hillary Clinton was also a front-runner who unexpectedly got beat for the nomination by Obama.","2810","https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/09/03/difference-donald-trump-bernie-sanders/71638134/"
"Americans may flirt with the preppy life of the frathouse partier because he’s poked sacred cows, said stuff we all wish we could say (except that reason keeps us from doing it), and acted buffoonishly entertaining. But when you wake up the next morning and he’s saying you’re now in a four-year relationship, reason comes rushing in, and it is time for the “it’s me, not you” speech. With over a year until the elections, there are too many Republican hopefuls that dilute the polls. Once the herd thins out (Rick Perry seems out of money; Bobby Jindal out of breath; Huckabee out of touch), other candidates with more substance will have their voices heard. And when it comes down to just three or four candidates, Trump’s blustering inarticulation and dodging of questions will seem untrustworthy.","2811","https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/09/03/difference-donald-trump-bernie-sanders/71638134/"
"Although each absurd, uninformed or just plain incorrect statement seems to give Trump a bump in the polls, there are only so many times supporters can defend his outrageous assault on decency, truth and civility. Yes, a few will remain no matter what. (One 63-year-old woman told CNN that the Republicans were out to discredit Trump: “They twisted what the words were, because they’re trying to destroy him.” No one has to twist his words because what he says is twisted enough. He speaks fluent pretzel.) But voters will eventually see the light.","2812","https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/09/03/difference-donald-trump-bernie-sanders/71638134/"

"Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders faced his own challenge at a Netroots Nation political event last month, when two African-American women pushed in front of him to use the microphone to demand four and a half minutes of silence to honor the death of Michael Brown. Sanders left the stage and mingled with the crowd. Later, Trump criticized Sanders as being “weak” for allowing them to speak, but truly he showed grace under pressure by acknowledging their frustration and anger. Instead of bullying their voices into silence or ridiculing them as losers, pigs or bimbos, Sanders left. After all, it was not his event; he was a guest. Besides, his voice was not silenced, but came back booming even louder: The next day, Sanders posted a sweeping policy of reform to fight racial inequality. (The timing coincided with Michael Brown’s death and had nothing to do with the two women.)","2814","https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/09/03/difference-donald-trump-bernie-sanders/71638134/"
"The two approaches reveal the difference between a mature, thoughtful and intelligent man, and a man whose money has made him arrogant to criticism and impervious to feeling the need to have any actual policies.

"There’s a lot of complaining about the lengthy process in the United States of winnowing candidates, but this year has shown its great strength.

"One month ago who would have suspected that the Democratic primary would become a referendum on whether the United States should be more like Denmark? At least, that's what I took away from the recent debate between Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and whoever those other guys were.","3:12 p.m. EDT October 21, 2015","2916","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/10/21/explaining-denmark-sanders-favorite-european-country/74322302/"
"In all the years Vermonters have been electing and re-electing Bernie Sanders, I don't remember Denmark, or Scandinavia, being a major speech or debate topic. Certainly we all knew Mr. Sanders was a socialist — he said so — and he admired the Scandinavian countries' social welfare systems. But no one in Vermont pushed that very hard — certainly not as hard as Anderson Cooper did in the debate.","2917","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/10/21/explaining-denmark-sanders-favorite-european-country/74322302/"
"There are a lot of democratic socialist policies that, on the face of it, most people would have little to disagree with. Take Denmark, apparently Bernie Sanders' favorite European country, as an example. The average Dane works 1,436 hours per year; the average American works 1,789 hours, 25 percent more. Parents can get up to 32 weeks of paid time off when they have children. With universal health care, there's no worry about getting sick and having catastrophic medical bills. Danish universities are tuition-free. The average Dane retires at age 63, the average American at 65. What's not to like?","2918","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/10/21/explaining-denmark-sanders-favorite-european-country/74322302/"
"All of those programs, and more, come at a price, and the price is a level of taxation. Those ""free"" programs have to be paid for by someone, and in Denmark, as well as the rest of the Scandinavian countries, that someone is not just the extremely wealthy.","2919","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/10/21/explaining-denmark-sanders-favorite-european-country/74322302/"
"Certainly, the very rich do pay very high income taxes. The top marginal income tax rate in Denmark is 50 percent. In the U.S. it's 39.6 percent. Vermont has one of the highest top marginal income tax rates of any state, and if we add that 9 percent to the federal income tax, wealthy Vermonters pay a marginal income tax rate of nearly 50 percent, almost as much as wealthy Danes pay.","2920","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/10/21/explaining-denmark-sanders-favorite-european-country/74322302/"
"But Denmark's high level of government services and high spending, apparently what Senator Sanders means by the phrase democratic socialism, means high taxes not just for the rich, but for everyone. Total taxes in Denmark amount to about 48 percent of GDP, well above the U.S. level of 27 percent. The only way government can get that much money is to tax everyone, which means the middle class. The average income Danish family gets a lot more government services and benefits than an average income American family. But the Danish family pays a much higher share of their income in taxes than the average American family.","2921","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/10/21/explaining-denmark-sanders-favorite-european-country/74322302/"
"And it's not just income taxes that are high. Vermonters are concerned about our 7 percent sales tax and 9 percent meals and rooms tax. That's a pittance compared to Danish consumption taxes. Danes pay a 25 percent value-added tax, which is similar to a sales tax, on everything. That $10 restaurant meal, which costs you $11 in Vermont with taxes, will cost you $12.50 in Denmark. The value-added tax is built into the price in Denmark and the sales tax is added onto the bill in Vermont, but that's just a semantic difference.","2922","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/10/21/explaining-denmark-sanders-favorite-european-country/74322302/"
"A $100 sweater in Vermont runs $125 in a Danish department store. A $1,000 refrigerator costs you $1,070 with taxes at Home Depot, but $1,250 in Copenhagen. It's no wonder that one of the most popular things for Scandinavians to do when they come to the U.S. is to shop. Well, not for refrigerators, but they do load up on Levis, Woolrich jackets, and anything else that will fit into a suitcase.","2923","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/10/21/explaining-denmark-sanders-favorite-european-country/74322302/"
"Getting to the store to buy those high-taxed Danish goods isn't cheap, either. A $25,000 Toyota Camry will cost you an extra $1,500 due to Vermont's 6 percent purchase and use tax. That same $25,000 Camry will cost you an extra $45,000 in taxes in Denmark. That's not a typo. The Danish car tax is 180 percent of the purchase price. You'll write out a check for $70,000 for your new Camry in Denmark.. And you'll pay the equivalent of about $6 per gallon of gas — more than double the current price per gallon in Vermont.","2924","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/10/21/explaining-denmark-sanders-favorite-european-country/74322302/"
"Denmark has figured out how to finance a generous welfare state without unduly impacting its economic growth and economic competitiveness, as have other Scandinavian countries. And it's not by taxing billionaires and corporations. There aren't enough billionaires to get the revenues they need to finance their expenditures, and the owners of corporations are very sensitive to tax differentials. It's not hard to move a business from Denmark to Sweden. Or the Netherlands, France, Spain, or Germany. The Danish corporate income tax rate, at 23.5 percent, is well below the United States' level of 35 percent (not including what states add on) and it's scheduled to go down to 22 percent next year.","2925","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/10/21/explaining-denmark-sanders-favorite-european-country/74322302/"
"The only way to finance a generous welfare state without killing the geese that are laying the eggs of prosperity is for the middle class, not just the wealthy, to pay very high taxes. I don't think we'll be hearing about that part of democratic socialism in any of the upcoming debates.","2926","http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/10/21/explaining-denmark-sanders-favorite-european-country/74322302/"

"Sanders said there are ""very few members of the Congress who have a stronger record"" on civil rights and cited his involvement in early equality battles, including having joined Martin Luther King for his 1963 march on Washington. Sanders said his agenda will ultimately resonate with African Americans, including raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and investing in education.","2934","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/06/democrats-south-carolina-clinton-sanders-omalley/75286714/"

"Six Republican presidential candidates -- Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum -- spent yesterday at the North Texas Presidential Forum. The goal: to present their campaign resumes to religious conservatives on issues ranging from abortion and gay marriage to support for Israel and the fight against ISIS. Can wooing the religious right help bring home an early state victory for one of the six GOP attendees? Appealing to social conservatives may help candidates in two states early in the voting calendar (Iowa and South Carolina), but won't hold much influence in either New Hampshire, a notoriously secular state; or Nevada, a state founded by stagecoach robbers.

"Donald Trump's candidacy is in the peak of health, but that's not stopping one potential heir (namely, Ted Cruz) from laying claim to all his voters after his presumed political demise. On NBC's Meet the Press, Cruz said he doesn't think Trump will wind up as the Republican nominee, and that he's going to inherit the orphaned anti-establishment voters instead of the race's two other political outsiders, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina.

"It's nothing new; Bernie Sanders has been in a continuous state of fury since 1963. Today's reason: the lack of a cost-of-living adjustment this year for Social Security recipients. ""What seniors are purchasing are not flat-screen TVs,"" Sanders said. ""They are purchasing medicine. They are purchasing health care. Those costs are going up."" Sanders' message continues to resonate, despite recent polling gains in New Hampshire by Hillary Clinton.

"But so far Sanders has not won over Latino voters, a critical part of any successful White House run. That’s a shame, because the Sanders campaign is centered on issues that should resonate with the Latino community. Just as Sanders has lately been reaching out to Hispanics, we would do well to return the favor and “Feel The Bern.”","3158","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/22/hispanics-sanders-clinton-democratic-primary-column/72613414/"
"There’s no denying that Hillary Clinton enjoys overwhelming support from Latinos. A July poll by Univision found that 73% of Latino voters would vote for Clinton in the Democratic primary. Yet 68% did not know of or had not formed an opinion of Sanders. This means that, despite Clinton’s impressive numbers, Sanders still has plenty of time and potential to cut into them.","3159","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/22/hispanics-sanders-clinton-democratic-primary-column/72613414/"
"If Latinos are willing to give Sanders a chance, they will see that he has much to offer. He has been fighting for the civil rights of all Americans for decades. Like most Latinos, he believes that the government has an important role to play in solving big problems. Unlike Clinton, Sanders does not have to apologize to voters for email irregularities or a vote for the war in Iraq — nor is he beholden to corporate bankers.","3160","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/22/hispanics-sanders-clinton-democratic-primary-column/72613414/"
"Research from Latino Decisions shows that Latinos are generally progressive voters. So it’s worth noting that on the issues that matter most to Latinos — education, jobs, and health care — Sanders is actually more progressive than Clinton. Sanders supports free public college education, an idea that should be attractive to Latinos, who complete college at lower rates than other Americans. He has proposed a $15 minimum wage, while Clinton believes that goes too far. He wants single-payer health care, which would greatly benefit Latinos, who are still the largest uninsured demographic.","3161","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/22/hispanics-sanders-clinton-democratic-primary-column/72613414/"
"Sanders is an ally on immigration as well. He has said, ”Economically and morally, it is unacceptable that we have millions of workers who are living in the shadows.” He favors comprehensive reform and a path to citizenship for the undocumented, and wants to end the “bed quota” that results in thousands of immigrants being placed in for-profit detention centers. Last week, on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert he denounced Donald Trump for “appealing to the baser instincts among us, xenophobia and, frankly, racism.” Echoing the views of Latinos nationwide, he termed Trump’s campaign “disgraceful.”","3162","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/22/hispanics-sanders-clinton-democratic-primary-column/72613414/"
"True, Sanders is not perfect. He worried some immigration reform advocates when he suggested at a U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce forum that immigrants take jobs from Americans. But Clinton has made missteps too, like last year when she stated that child migrants from Central America should be sent back, a position seemingly at odds with her longstanding commitment to human rights. To his credit, Sanders has been trying to connect with Latinos, at appearances in Nevada and before advocacy groups like National Council of La Raza. He has also hired Latino staffers for key roles in his campaign.","3163","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/22/hispanics-sanders-clinton-democratic-primary-column/72613414/"
"Hillary Clinton has been a friend to the Latino community for many years. Still, while loyalty to a candidate for the past is admirable, it is more important to consider which candidate would be the best fit for the future. If more Latinos back Sanders, it will make Clinton a better candidate by offering her real competition in the race for the nomination. It will remind politicians that we are not a monolithic voting group to be taken for granted.","3164","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/22/hispanics-sanders-clinton-democratic-primary-column/72613414/"

"• Former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley said that in President Reagan’s first term, the highest marginal income tax rate was 70%. But Reagan signed a bill in his first year dropping that to 50%, and it dropped again to 28% in his second term.","3283","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"• Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said that the U.S. “has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on earth.” But Israel, Brazil and Chile have both greater income and wealth inequality, and more countries beat the U.S. in one of the measures.","3284","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"

"O’Malley said that in President Ronald Reagan’s first term, “the highest marginal [income tax] rate was 70%.” That was true only briefly. In Reagan’s first year in office, he signed a bill reducing the top rate to 50%. And in his second term, he reduced it again, to 28%.","3290","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"O’Malley cited the top marginal tax rate during the debate to make the point that upper-income taxpayers should be paying more, and historically have.","3291","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"As a matter of history, the top marginal tax rate of 70% was established in 1964, when Congress passed a tax cutbacked by President John F. Kennedy. In the decades before that, the top rate was much higher — hovering around 90%.","3292","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"So 70% was the top rate when Reagan took office in January 1981.

"Regarding income inequality, we noted back in May that World Bank statistics list at least 41 countries with greater income inequality than the U.S. — including Israel, Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina.","3296","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"And as for wealth inequality, the share of wealth held by the top 1% in the U.S. puts it in 11th place among 37 nations listed in the 2015 edition of the Global Wealth Databook. The top 1% in Russia, Thailand, Indonesia, India, Brazil, Chile, South Africa, China, Czech Republic and Israel each hold a greater share of their nation’s wealth, according to that publication.","3297","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"Finally, the rate of child poverty is far worse in many other countries, including several with industrialized economies. The campaign told us the senator was referring to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, but that report ranks the U.S. seventh in “relative childhood poverty” among the 38 countries listed.","3298","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"Turkey, Israel, Mexico, Greece, Romania and Bulgaria all had higher rates of child poverty than the U.S., in the OECD’s ranking.","3299","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"

"Clinton erred when she said real wages haven’t risen in nearly 15 years.","3301","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"That’s not true, according to the most recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Real average weekly earnings of rank-and-file workers were 7.2% higher in September than they were in December 1999.","3302","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"

"Sanders repeated one of his campaign trail talking points: “But we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us … that billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers.” That’s the case for some in those professions — compared with billionaires who earn their money through investments — but it’s not accurate for all. In fact, a truck driver would have to earn more than the median salary to pay a higher effective rate.","3304","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"We previously ran the calculations for several different hypothetical nurses and truck drivers (and firefighters and police officers, who have also been part of this Sanders claim), comparing total effective tax rates, including payroll taxes, to what an investment fund manager would pay if only paying capital gains tax rates on earnings.","3305","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"The billionaire fund manager would pay 23.8% — the top capital gains rate for income above $413,200 for individuals — and a 3.8% Medicare surcharge tax on investment income for those earning more than $200,000. A truck driver earning the median income for the profession ($39,520) wouldn’t pay a higher rate then the fund manager’s 23.8%. But if that truck driver earned a higher salary — such as the average pay in Peabody, Massachusetts ($57,250) — and was single with no dependents, he or she would pay an effective tax rate of 26%, higher than the fund manager. If that truck driver had one dependent child, however, the rate would drop to 21%.","3306","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"As for nurses, the median salary is much higher — $66,640. A single nurse with no dependents would have a 28% effective tax rate with that salary. But once we add a dependent child, or a nonworking spouse, or both, the nurse’s rate sinks below that of the wealthy fund manager.","3307","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"If the billionaire fund managers’ earnings were taxed at regular income tax rates, he or she would pay a higher rate. Most marginal income tax rates are higher than capital gains rates, with individual income between about $37,000 and $90,000 at the 25% rate for 2015. The top income tax rate is 39.6%, which starts after income surpasses $413,200.","3308","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"O’Malley lumped Princeton economist Alan Krueger in with what he called “economists on Wall Street.” Krueger is not a Wall Street economist.","3309","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"O’Malley made his remarks when he had a disagreement with Clinton over how much to raise the minimum wage. O’Malley supports raising it to $15 per hour. Clinton has proposed $12 per hour, and she cited Princeton economist Alan Krueger’s support for her proposal and concern for increasing the minimum to $15 per hour.","3310","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"O’Malley is wrong about Krueger’s background. It is entirely in academia and education.","3311","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"Krueger graduated with a doctorate in economics from Harvard University in 1987. “Since 1987 he has held a joint appointment in the Economics Department and Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University,” according to his biography on the university website.","3312","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"Krueger also has held top positions in government, including chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama and chief economist at the Department of Labor under President Bill Clinton.

"O’Malley claimed that Maryland was the only state that went four consecutive years without an increase in college tuition. That’s no longer the case.","3314","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"Yes, as governor, O’Malley did sign bills implementing a tuition freeze at public universities in Maryland that lasted from 2007 until 2010. But Maine has now matched what Maryland once achieved.","3315","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
"In March of this year, the University of Maine System Board of Trustees again voted to freeze in-state tuition at its seven member schools. That means the school system has now gone four years without an increase in tuition at its public universities.","3316","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/15/fact-check-second-democratic-debate/75803260/"
