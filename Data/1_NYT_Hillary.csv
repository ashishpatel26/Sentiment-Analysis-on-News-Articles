"The prolonged prologue to Hillary Rodham Clinton’s second run for the White House will reach its suspenseless conclusion on Sunday: The former secretary of state, senator and first lady is to announce that she will indeed seek the Democratic nomination for president.","APRIL 10, 2015","1","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton is expected to begin her campaign with a video message on social media, followed by a visit to important early-primary states next week, said two people briefed on her plans.","2","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"But for all the attention paid to how Mrs. Clinton would reveal her 2016 candidacy, little has been said about her reasons for mounting another presidential bid. Her campaign rollout is expected to provide voters, particularly users of Twitter, Facebook and other social media, a succinct rationale that she is best positioned to address an American electorate that has seen virtually stagnant wages for middle-income earners over the last 15 years.","3","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"A fresh epilogue to Mrs. Clinton’s 2014 memoir, “Hard Choices,” posted on The Huffington Post Friday morning, signaled a number of elements of what is very likely to be a familiar feature of her campaign message: evoking her new status as a grandmother to talk about creating opportunities for all Americans.","4","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"“I’m more convinced than ever that our future in the 21st century depends on our ability to ensure that a child born in the hills of Appalachia or the Mississippi Delta or the Rio Grande Valley grows up with the same shot at success that Charlotte will,” Mrs. Clinton wrote, referring to her new granddaughter.","5","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton will begin testing that and other themes in earnest beginning on Sunday and stretching through next week when she travels to Iowa and later this month to New Hampshire for a series of small-scale events where she can field questions and address the concerns of the voters her campaign calls “everyday Americans,” people made aware of her plans said.","6","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"In the early months of the Democratic primary contest, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign hopes to capture some of the magic of her successful 2000 run for the Senate in New York, when she worked to show some of the common touch that had helped catapult her husband to the White House. Her governing principle in the 2000 campaign was demonstrating that she would work hard to earn every vote.","7","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton’s team is also planning a slow expansion of its staff over the course of the year, deliberately avoiding the appearance of a battleship heading into the fight, as her organization seemed on her entry into the 2008 Democratic campaign. Back then, Mrs. Clinton arrived at some events in Iowa on a chartered aircraft called the “Hill-A-Copter” that became a symbol for how her campaign spent heavily in the early voting states, leaving her short of cash as the primary contest dragged on.","8","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"But even as Mrs. Clinton attempts to set aside her celebrity and offer herself as a fighter for ordinary voters, her finance team and the outside groups supporting her candidacy have started collecting checks in what is expected to be a $2.5 billion effort, dwarfing the vast majority of her would-be rivals in both parties.","9","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"The Clinton campaign’s fund-raising staff and other aides have already started working out of a new headquarters in Brooklyn, with almost the entire team working there on Friday.","10","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton has fielded advice from more than 200 policy experts in formulating her economic agenda and still has not settled on the details. Rather than deliver a robust policy speech immediately, she intends to ease into presenting her ideas for alleviating the growing gap between rich and poor and for increasing wages, said several people involved in her plans. The slow pace will allow her to continue to generate news coverage as Republican presidential hopefuls engage in heated debates in their crowded primary field.","11","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"But the essence of Mrs. Clinton’s message has become clearer and was reiterated in the new epilogue of her memoir on Friday. “You shouldn’t have to be the granddaughter of a president or a secretary of state to receive excellent health care, education, enrichment, and all the support and advantages that will one day lead to a good job and a successful life,” she wrote.","12","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"Many factors played into the timing of Mrs. Clinton’s announcement. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, whom Mrs. Clinton’s advisers are watching closely as a potential opponent, staked a claim on Monday as his announcement date. Mrs. Clinton’s announcement on Sunday will certainly draw attention from Mr. Rubio’s entry into the race and could well eclipse it.","13","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"Some in her campaign are betting that Democrats will applaud the show of force against a Republican. (Others involved insisted the date was selected before Mr. Rubio scheduled his event, but said that the juxtaposition was an added bonus.)","14","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton’s advisers are holding a conference call for her entire staff on Saturday afternoon, according to two people briefed about it. For all the planning that went into Sunday’s event, her team has been working feverishly in recent days, another sign of how the campaign’s infrastructure has been slow to take shape.","15","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-announce-2016-run-for-president-on-sunday.html?_r=0"
"Ending two years of speculation and coy denials, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced on Sunday that she would seek the presidency for a second time, immediately establishing herself as the likely 2016 Democratic nominee.","APRIL 12, 2015","16","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"“I’m running for president,” she said with a smile near the end of a two-minute video released just after 3 p.m.","17","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"“Everyday Americans need a champion. And I want to be that champion,” Mrs. Clinton said. “So I’m hitting the road to earn your vote — because it’s your time. And I hope you’ll join me on this journey.”","18","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"The announcement came minutes after emails from John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, alerting donors and longtime Clinton associates to her candidacy.","19","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Podesta said that Mrs. Clinton would meet soon with voters in Iowa and host a formal kickoff event some time next month.","20","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"The announcement effectively began what could be one of the least contested races, without an incumbent, for the Democratic presidential nomination in recent history — a stark contrast to the 2008 primaries, when Mrs. Clinton, the early front-runner, ended up in a long and expensive battle won by Barack Obama. It could also be the first time a woman captures a major party’s nomination.","21","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"Regardless of the outcome, Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 campaign will open a new chapter in the extraordinary life of a public figure who has captivated and polarized the country since her husband, former President Bill Clinton, declared his intention to run for president in 1991. Mrs. Clinton was the co-star of the Clinton administration, the only first lady ever elected to the United States Senate and a globe-trotting diplomat who surprised her party by serving dutifully under the president who defeated her.","22","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"She will embark on her latest — and perhaps last — bid for the White House with nearly universal name recognition and a strong base of support, particularly among women. But in a campaign that will inevitably be about the future, Mrs. Clinton, 67, enters as a quintessential baby boomer, associated with the 1990s and with the drama of the Bill Clinton years.","23","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"This campaign will begin on a small scale and build up to an effort likely to cost more than any presidential bid waged before, with Mrs. Clinton’s supporters and outside “super PACs” looking to raise as much as $2.5 billion in a blitz of donations from Democrats who overwhelmingly support her candidacy. Much of that enthusiasm is tied to the chance to make history by electing a woman to the presidency. But some, too, owes to the lack of compelling alternatives in a party trying desperately to hold on to the White House when Republicans control the House and the Senate.","24","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton’s declaration on Sunday is to be followed by a series of intimate but critical campaign events in Iowa and New Hampshire. She will use them to reintroduce herself to voters and begin to lay out the central theme of her candidacy: improving the economic fortunes of the middle class, with an emphasis on increasing wages and reducing income inequality.","25","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"In the video, she does not appear until after 90 seconds of images featuring personal stories of others, each describing how they are getting ready to start something new.","26","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"The video prominently features a black couple expecting a child, a young Asian-American woman, and two men who say they are getting married. It also shows plenty of the white, working-class people who were crucial to her previous White House bid and signals that she intends to make helping the middle class and reducing income inequality major themes of her campaign.","27","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"Near the end of the video, Mrs. Clinton finally appears outside a suburban home and says: “I’m getting ready to do something too. I’m running for president.”","28","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"Her return to the campaign trail this week offers her a fortuitous circumstance: Tuesday is National Equal Pay Day, the point in the year at which, on average, a woman’s pay for working in 2014 and 2015 would equal a man’s pay just for 2014. Pay equity is an issue that Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy will take up in earnest, along with others important to many women, like paid family and medical leave, a higher minimum wage and affordable access to child care.","29","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"Unlike in her 2008 campaign, when she played down gender and sought to show she was tough enough to be president, Mrs. Clinton plans to highlight that she is a grandmother and trumpet her chance to make history.","30","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"“Being the first woman to run for president with a real chance of winning, that’s a wild card, but potentially a net positive, particularly for undecided women,” said Scott Keeter, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center.","31","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"It was not surprising that Mrs. Clinton chose to make her intentions public in a video circulated on social media. Since she left the State Department in early 2013, she has found a welcome outlet in Twitter, which has allowed her to express her opinions in terse missives while avoiding the news conferences that are likely to become a mainstay now that she is a presidential candidate.","32","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"She will also look for ways to demonstrate that, after more than three decades in public life, she understands the ways of modern campaigns and can appeal to younger voters. Mrs. Clinton’s 35-year-old campaign manager, Robby Mook, known for exploiting technology, data and analytics to win elections, has already dispatched field organizers to Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.","33","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"For all the months of quiet and careful planning, however, her campaign’s rollout did not come off as smoothly as envisioned. Rather than gliding into the spotlight as an above-the-fray former secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton entered the 2016 race in the midst of lingering questions about her exclusive use of a private email address while at the State Department and about donations from foreign countries to her family’s philanthropic foundation.","34","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Podesta, the campaign chairman, assured donors that both controversies would pass and that the momentum would shift as soon as Mrs. Clinton was officially a candidate, according to a person involved in those discussions.","35","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton will enter the race with a strong base of support: 81 percent of Democrats said they would consider voting for her, according to a CBS News poll conducted in February. That support dwarfs that of her potential rivals for the nomination, including former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia and Senator Bernard Sanders, an independent from Vermont who could run as a Democrat.","36","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"But the roller coaster of a presidential campaign can erode even the most seemingly certain advantages. Just over eight years ago, Mrs. Clinton began that campaign with an email to supporters declaring that she was “in to win.” That announcement began a downward trajectory in which she went from being considered the inevitable nominee to finishing in third place in the Iowa caucuses, behind Mr. Obama and John Edwards.","37","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"She went on to pick up primary victories in crucial battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, but by then Mr. Obama had an edge in the fight for delegates.","38","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"In her 2008 concession speech, Mrs. Clinton sought to energize the women who had supported her candidacy.","39","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"“Although we weren’t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it’s got about 18 million cracks in it,” she said. “And the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time.”","40","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"This time, Mrs. Clinton’s aides have signaled that she will take nothing for granted and present herself as a more humble candidate, as unencumbered by the trappings of power and celebrity as is possible for a universally recognized former first lady, secretary of state and presidential candidate.","41","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"There may be little room for error, though, for Mrs. Clinton, who will begin her campaign under the glare of intense media scrutiny and criticism from a broad field of potential Republican opponents, including former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, and Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky — all of whom will try to prove they are best positioned to defeat her.","42","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?_r=0"
"Hillary Rodham Clinton, a former secretary of state, has been most outspoken in recent years on foreign policy matters. But she has also taken positions on domestic and economic issues, like immigration and income inequality, that have been at the center of policy discussions since she left government. Here is a look at where she stands on some major issues.","APRIL 12, 2015","43","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton has long advocated a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. She declined to comment on the recent Israeli election, even as many Republicans came out in support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She calls herself “an emphatic, unwavering supporter of Israel’s safety and security.”","44","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"Regarding the Islamic State, Mrs. Clinton has said the failure to help some of the more moderate rebels during the Syrian uprising led to a power vacuum that set the stage for the rise of Islamic militancy.","45","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"Like most leading Democrats, Mrs. Clinton has called for government action to fight climate change, saying, “The science of climate change is unforgiving, no matter what the deniers may say; sea levels are rising, ice caps are melting, storms, droughts and wildfires are wreaking havoc.” She has supported cap and trade, under which companies can trade carbon credits to reduce harmful emissions.","46","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"She supports President Obama’s decision to use his executive powers to reshape the nation’s immigration policy, saying it was needed “to begin fixing our broken immigration system and focus finite resources on deporting felons rather than families.”","47","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton has yet to outline her economic strategy, but people close to her say she is expected to support raising the minimum wage, closing corporate tax loopholes, cutting taxes for the middle class and investing in infrastructure.","48","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"She supports the 2010 Dodd-Frank law toughening regulation of financial institutions, but has come under criticism for her family’s close ties to the financial sector, including highly paid speeches to Wall Street banks.","49","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-on-the-issues.html?_r=0"
"He defeated her in a grueling Democratic nomination battle. Then she pursued his agenda across the world as secretary of state.

"For months, Mrs. Clinton and her team have pored over Mr. Obama’s poll ratings, policies and constituencies, seeking to solve a central riddle for the campaign she is about to begin: How can she run for president as her own person, without criticizing the sitting president she served — while her Republican opponents will be working to demonize them both?","51","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/politics/hillary-clintons-calculus-on-embracing-obama.html?_r=0"
"Aligning herself too closely with Mr. Obama is fraught with risk for Mrs. Clinton. Asked to imagine their “perfect candidate,” nearly six in 10 Americans said they wanted someone who would change most of Mr. Obama’s policies, according to a CNN poll released last month. And Republicans are betting that attacks based on the incumbent’s record will be as effective against Mrs. Clinton as the tactic was in 2008, when Democrats equated a victory by Senator John McCain to four more years of President George W. Bush.","52","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/politics/hillary-clintons-calculus-on-embracing-obama.html?_r=0"

"Mrs. Clinton will also be trying to defy political history: Only once since the establishment of the two-term limit in 1951 has a candidate won an election to succeed a president from the same party — and it was the first President George Bush, whose predecessor, Ronald Reagan, remained popular at the time and was beloved by Republicans.","54","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/politics/hillary-clintons-calculus-on-embracing-obama.html?_r=0"
"Yet Mrs. Clinton and her team have decided that, on balance, the risk of lining up near Mr. Obama’s record is worth taking.","55","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/politics/hillary-clintons-calculus-on-embracing-obama.html?_r=0"
"Rather than run from Mr. Obama, she intends to turn to him as one of her campaign’s most important allies and advocates — second only, perhaps, to her husband, the other president whose record will hover over her bid.","56","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/politics/hillary-clintons-calculus-on-embracing-obama.html?_r=0"
"In a general election, Mr. Obama is expected to help Mrs. Clinton raise money, and he would be asked to campaign for her in, among other places, the most heavily African-American counties of the swing states that he won in 2008 and 2012, according to numerous people briefed on the plans, who discussed them on the condition of anonymity.","57","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/politics/hillary-clintons-calculus-on-embracing-obama.html?_r=0"

"But even in those states, Mrs. Clinton does not plan to distance herself from Mr. Obama’s record, advisers said. Rather, she intends to praise, above all, the economic progress Mr. Obama has made, getting the country out of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and cutting the unemployment rate nearly in half.","59","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/politics/hillary-clintons-calculus-on-embracing-obama.html?_r=0"

"Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said that she “is proud of what was accomplished, both as President Obama’s partner on critical issues of national security, and on the progress made on the domestic front” and that “a campaign would be about laying out her own vision for tackling our toughest challenges.”","63","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/politics/hillary-clintons-calculus-on-embracing-obama.html?_r=0"
"But seeking a “third Obama term,” as some put it in the shorthand of political operatives, is not a simple matter for Mrs. Clinton. She can take little credit for the administration’s signature domestic accomplishments, like the Affordable Care Act, and she has scant leeway to disavow what Republicans portray as Mr. Obama’s misguided foreign-policy moves in places like Iran, Israel and Russia.","64","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/politics/hillary-clintons-calculus-on-embracing-obama.html?_r=0"
"The approach is laden with uncertainty: While few Democrats expect Mr. Obama to be as unpopular as Mr. Bush in 2008, some worry that Mrs. Clinton’s endorsement of Mr. Obama’s policies, whether tacit or explicit, would presume continuing economic tailwinds and the absence of crises that could damage the president’s standing. Moreover, by praising Mr. Obama’s accomplishments, along with those of her husband’s presidency, Mrs. Clinton, 67, could seem too focused on the past.","65","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/politics/hillary-clintons-calculus-on-embracing-obama.html?_r=0"

"Strategic Shift","67","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/politics/hillary-clintons-calculus-on-embracing-obama.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton’s strategic calculation is a sharp change in perspective from late last year, after Republicans gained a majority in the Senate and retained control of the House in the midterm elections, when a record 55 percent of Americans said they disapproved of the president.","68","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/politics/hillary-clintons-calculus-on-embracing-obama.html?_r=0"

"Mrs. Clinton has not had to wade into domestic policy since before she became secretary of state in 2009, and she has spent the past few months engaged in policy discussions with economists on the left and closer to the Democratic Party’s center who are grappling with the discontent set off by the gap between rich and poor. Sorting through the often divergent advice to develop an economic plan could affect the timing and planning of the official announcement of her campaign.","307","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/us/politics/economic-plan-is-a-quandary-for-hillary-clintons-campaign.html?_r=0"
"Although people close to Mrs. Clinton say she has not yet settled on a specific platform, she is expected to embrace several principles. They include standard Democratic initiatives like raising the minimum wage, investing in infrastructure, closing corporate tax loopholes and cutting taxes for the middle class.

"Behind many of these proposals is a philosophy, endorsed by Mrs. Clinton’s closest economic advisers and often referred to as inclusive capitalism, that contends that a majority of Americans do not want to punish the rich; they just want to feel that they, too, have a chance to succeed. It also calls for corporations to put less emphasis on short-term profits that increase shareholder value and to invest more in employees, the environment and communities.","309","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/us/politics/economic-plan-is-a-quandary-for-hillary-clintons-campaign.html?_r=0"
"Whether Mrs. Clinton’s approach will be enough to satisfy the unease over growing economic disparity is unclear. In a Gallup poll conducted last month, 67 percent of Americans said they were dissatisfied with the way income and wealth are distributed in the United States. In the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, Mrs. Clinton’s economic message — summed up by a frequent refrain, “If you work hard, you play by the rules, you ought to be able to get ahead” — resonated with white, working-class voters, who overwhelmingly supported her over Barack Obama.","310","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/us/politics/economic-plan-is-a-quandary-for-hillary-clintons-campaign.html?_r=0"
"But in the years since, Mrs. Clinton has come under criticism for delivering speeches to Wall Street banks at more than $200,000 each, roughly four times the median annual household income in the United States, and for comments she made about her family’s financial situation, including a lament about being “dead broke” after leaving the White House. And she must convince a middle class that feels frustrated and left behind that she understands its struggles, even as she relies heavily on the financial industry and corporate interests to fund her candidacy.","311","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/us/politics/economic-plan-is-a-quandary-for-hillary-clintons-campaign.html?_r=0"

"Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state when some major economic debates took hold on Capitol Hill, and as a result, her economic views are still not broadly known.

"But later experiences complicated her worldview. Many of the advocates who knew Mrs. Clinton as a champion for the poor and working-class women felt betrayed in 1996 when, as first lady, she supported Mr. Clinton’s overhaul of the welfare system, which gave states more power to remove people from welfare rolls and pledged to cut federal spending on assistance for the poor by nearly $55 billion over six years.

"She was certainly a strong candidate in 2008. But by this time in that cycle, it was already clear that she would not cruise to the nomination. Yes, she held an impressive 40 percent or so of the Democratic vote in national polls, leading Senator Barack Obama by 15 points.

"She was also running against a bevy of competent, second-tier candidates like Gov.

"The fact that Mrs. Clinton seems poised to clear the field is the surest evidence that 2016 is not 2008. It means that Ms. Warren is getting a very different message from the one Mr. Obama received when Senator Harry Reid reportedly urged him to seek the presidency. Instead, many of the first people to endorse Mr. Obama in 2008, like Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, have already endorsed Mrs. Clinton.","625","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/upshot/hillary-clinton-and-inevitability-this-time-is-different.html?_r=0"
"Even if Ms. Warren did run, it is hard to argue that she is as strong as Mr. Obama was eight years ago. Not only is it a stretch to compare the enthusiasm for Ms. Warren to that for Mr. Obama, but the differences between her and Mrs. Clinton on inequality and finance are also less clear — and probably less salient — than Mrs. Clinton’s vote to authorize the war in Iraq. Ms. Warren won’t replicate Mr. Obama’s support among black voters, either, and it is hard to see how she would make up for it.","626","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/upshot/hillary-clinton-and-inevitability-this-time-is-different.html?_r=0"
"There are, of course, unlikely scenarios in which someone other than Mrs. Clinton would be the nominee. But if anyone could ever be considered inevitable, it would be Mrs. Clinton right now.

"Perhaps the easiest way to think about Mrs. Clinton’s strength is simply to remember just how close she came to victory in 2008.

"Since Watergate, many scandal wars have been fought over access to information about the scandal rather than about the scandal itself.

Her health care reform effort was needlessly marred by her unwillingness to release the names of her consultants.

"The resulting program, a compromise between Republicans and Democrats, disburses money to the states but gives them flexibility to tailor how they provide coverage to meet the needs of their own children and families.

"One specific provision of the Affordable Care Act, often called the “family glitch,” has been interpreted to prevent many families from receiving subsidized health coverage in the new marketplace if one parent is offered “affordable coverage” through his or her job. In this case, “affordable” is defined as less than roughly 9.5 percent of household income for that parent to sign up alone — even though the actual cost of available family coverage is far higher. For families affected by this glitch, CHIP may be the only affordable option for making sure their children are covered.","778","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/opinion/hillary-clinton-and-bill-frist-on-health-care-for-americas-kids.html?_r=0"

As many as two million children could lose coverage altogether. Millions more will have fewer health care benefits and much higher out-of-pocket costs, threatening access to needed health services. And because families without adequate insurance often miss out on preventive care and instead receive more expensive treatment in hospital emergency rooms, all of us will be likely to end up paying part of the bill.","780","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/opinion/hillary-clinton-and-bill-frist-on-health-care-for-americas-kids.html?_r=0"

Advancing women has been her central life’s work, as she and her admirers say proudly; she made it a priority as secretary of state and focused on it as a philanthropist. But that focus also allowed Mrs. Clinton, who played down her gender in 2008, to frame her second attempt at the White House in what could be one way to make it special and new: as a shot at history for her and for all women.","813","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/us/politics/hillary-clinton-faces-test-of-record-aiding-women.html?_r=0"

In 2007, it merged with Uranium One, a South African company with assets in Africa and Australia, in what was described as a $3.5 billion transaction. The new company, which kept the Uranium One name, was controlled by UrAsia investors including Ian Telfer, a Canadian who became chairman.

The strategy would channel his myriad political talents, such as synthesizing polling data with ground operations in important states like Florida, which he is preoccupied with winning in 2016.

As Daniel Patrick Moynihan once observed, officials hoard secrets because they are the currency of power, but too many secrets debase that currency. Officials should not be able to “mint” new secrets until they declassify an equivalent number of old secrets. Wrongly withholding information from the public should be treated with the same severity as an unauthorized disclosure.

They provide an opportunity for candidates to refine their messages, raise money, register voters, build organizations and gain additional valuable experience. Barack Obama, who had few weaknesses but little experience, was served exceptionally well by the 2008 Democratic primaries.","1093","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-a-primary-fight.html?_r=0"
"But primary campaigns tend to expose the flaws of fundamentally weak candidates. Take Mitt Romney, who was tarred as a flip-flopper in 2012 and forced to move to the right on immigration and other issues. Establishment Republicans blamed the primary debates and have since moved to reassert control over the process. But the debates weren’t the problem; Mitt Romney was. He had changed his positions on a number of crucial issues, and when he was governor of Massachusetts, he had overseen the creation of a health care plan similar to the Affordable Care Act. All this was bound to be examined in a competitive primary campaign, regardless of how many debates were sanctioned by the Republican National Committee.","1094","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-a-primary-fight.html?_r=0"
"The primary had an obvious and negative effect on public views of Mr. Romney. His unfavorable ratings surged to around 50 percent and never recovered. His favorable ratings ultimately rose to meet his unfavorable ratings, mainly because Republicans ultimately rallied behind him, but I’m nonetheless skeptical of the position of my colleague Brendan Nyhan, who doesn’t think it made much difference. At the very least, I’m sure the Romney campaign would have preferred to start the general election with an even favorability rating rather than one with a minus 10.","1095","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-a-primary-fight.html?_r=0"
"For a candidate as strong as Mrs. Clinton, there are a lot of reasons many liberal Democrats — and voters more generally — could have reservations about her candidacy. As ProPublica’s Alec MacGillis put it, “There is a sort of collective amnesia” about Mrs. Clinton among Democrats, and particularly among former Obama supporters, regarding their old “estimation of Mrs. Clinton.” The concerns include foreign policy, ties to Wall Street and the various reservations about her personal dealings, revived by news about foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation and her use of a personal email account and server while secretary of state.","1096","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-a-primary-fight.html?_r=0"
"Mr. MacGillis argues that it would be better for Democrats to reckon with their true feelings about Mrs. Clinton in the primary rather than in the general election. That may be true on matters of style — on the “hyper-cautious answers” or “disingenuous” efforts to align herself with the moods of the moment that Mr. MacGillis cites. But on the more substantive matters, a credible and vigorous primary challenger would be the single likeliest thing to increase Democratic dissatisfaction with her candidacy. It would involve a full year of a liberal Democrat and allies reminding liberal Democrats of all of the reasons they thought Mrs. Clinton was a problematic candidate in the first place.","1097","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-a-primary-fight.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton has a good chance of fending off these charges with a unified Democratic Party. Republicans won’t attack her for being overly hawkish on national security, and Democrats won’t countenance a Republican like Jeb Bush or Scott Walker attacking Mrs. Clinton on her ties to Wall Street. Controversies about the Clintons — like over the Clinton Foundation or her email account — are far less likely to take hold if Democrats defend her.","1098","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-a-primary-fight.html?_r=0"
"But without a unified party, she could face recurring and resonant attacks on all of those issues. Though it probably wouldn’t be as bad as what Mr. Romney faced, it could also be worse. After a year of being characterized as a Wall Street hack, or a warmonger with low-grade corruption issues, Mrs. Clinton could face a Ralph Nader-like third-party challenge, which generally becomes likelier after a party has held the White House for consecutive terms.","1099","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-a-primary-fight.html?_r=0"
"And Mrs. Clinton is not the type of candidate who benefits most from a primary campaign. She is not an inexperienced candidate who needs to be vetted or to prove her ability to handle a presidential campaign.

Her experience as first lady and secretary of state gives her additional national and international political experience.","1100","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-a-primary-fight.html?_r=0"
"Her total political experience entering the 2016 contest is probably more akin to that of an incumbent president than anything else. Did Presidents Obama or Bush or Clinton struggle in the general elections in 2012, 2004 and 1996 because they weren’t tested in the primaries? It may have hurt them a little bit in the first debate. But incumbent presidents tend to fare pretty well in presidential elections, and I don’t remember too much talk about the trouble they faced getting back into playing shape.","1101","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-a-primary-fight.html?_r=0"
"Perhaps she’s rustier than most — it has been seven years since she last ran — but it’s not as if Mrs. Clinton will be on the sidelines for the next year. She’ll probably engage and respond to her Republican opponents, she’ll hold events in the early primary states, and she can debate the likes of Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee if her campaign thinks it’s useful practice for her.

Not true. No one person is to blame, or thousand people, or president, or talking head. The country has been divided for a long time and for a variety of reasons: the flood of money into the political system; the perverse proliferation and specialization of negative ads; partisan news channels; and the proverbial “coarsening of our culture.” Clinton is a product of that environment.

"Polarization is an idea from physics. In 1808, the French engineer Étienne-Louis Malus noticed that a calcite crystal could block or transmit various kinds of light, depending on the angle by which you viewed it. In the 1930s, the inventor Edwin Land found a way to manufacture a synthetic filter that could do the same, only more precisely and on the cheap, and The Times marveled at his “light-polarizing ‘glass’ that transforms motion pictures into a fairyland of substance and reality.” The merits of metaphorical polarization were then still undecided. During World War II, The Times cited “China’s continued fight against Japan as the polarizing influence on American policy in the Pacific.” And in 1955, the Senate minority leader, William F. Knowland, was said to come “as near as anyone to polarizing the conservative, mildly isolationist sentiment that once centered about Senator Taft,” suggesting that Knowland’s polarizing tendencies might in fact have been a good thing. It took only a slight shift in emphasis to transform an insult into an accolade. (Oxford English Dictionary: “To give unity of direction to; to focus. Now rare.”) By 1970, though, it was clear that George McGovern meant no plaudits for Richard Nixon when he accused him of engaging in “a deliberate effort to polarize the nation’s politics.”","1142","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/magazine/what-it-really-means-to-call-hillary-clinton-polarizing.html?_r=0"

Last February, when I was interviewing attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the subject of Hillary Clinton came up a lot, and when it did, the term “polarizing figure” was never more than a few sentences away. Maybe this is a simple conjugation issue. Hillary Clinton is not “polarizing” so much as she is “polarized.” She has been at the center of a long brawl that has left people weary on all sides. But if Clinton was not so willing to fight (and so well equipped for battle), she could be called worse.

She was a working woman and full political partner with (gasp) feminist tendencies. Among would-be first ladies in the early 1990s, these were exotic qualities. Today Hillary Clinton is a cautious and exceedingly diplomatic politician, perhaps to her detriment. (She is often criticized for being “calculating” and “robotic.”) If anything, her willingness to be deliberate, speak carefully and appeal to the political center was a big part of what sank her with liberal Democrats who opted for Barack Obama in 2008.

"When people say Clinton is polarizing, they are largely indicting her by association. She has been a fixture of our political climate for so long that the climate defines her. But the political climate has not been made, or polarized, by mysterious outside forces. It is us. You could argue that the act of showing up at CPAC and cheering a red-meat speech from the likes of Ted Cruz is an act of self-polarization, or at least an indication that common cause with Clinton probably was not much of a possibility to begin with.","1147","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/magazine/what-it-really-means-to-call-hillary-clinton-polarizing.html?_r=0"
"A corollary term, often used interchangeably with polarizing, is “divisive.” We often hear that Clinton is “divisive,” that she deprives us of the unity we supposedly crave (the thing George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama all ran on before they became so polarizing). And yet the climate is the climate. It is like rain in Seattle or London. If Clinton (or Bush or Cruz) lived in either place, it would still be raining, and no one would blame them. Or maybe, in this age of polarization, someone would.","1148","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/magazine/what-it-really-means-to-call-hillary-clinton-polarizing.html?_r=0"
"People often use “polarizing” as a place holder for words like “inflammatory” or “strongly disliked.” Reporters love the word because it allows them to sound noncommittal and nonjudgmental. It offers them neutrality, limp and passive though it may be.

"Mitt Romney was not a polarizing figure because he was caught on video writing off 47 percent of the electorate. He was a polarizing figure because he was running for president of a country in which about 40 percent of the electorate, probably more, had written him off from the get-go, same as with the other guy. That will surely be true of anyone, Democrat or Republican, dynastic or insurgent, who wins the nomination of a major party today.","1150","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/magazine/what-it-really-means-to-call-hillary-clinton-polarizing.html?_r=0"
"Put aside the clumsy and offensive way that Romney characterized the 47 percent he said would never vote for him (people who he said were “dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them”). The crux of his point was that nearly half of all voters would be against him automatically, that a tiny portion was actually persuadable and that he intended to concern himself with these people. In that narrow numeric sense, Romney was describing the polarized norm of today’s electorate. He was describing reality, in other words, and that’s when a politician can really get into trouble.","1151","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/magazine/what-it-really-means-to-call-hillary-clinton-polarizing.html?_r=0"

"Paul Begala, the Clinton partisan and part-of-the-furniture pundit, had tweeted a link to a U.S. News and World Report article that described Hillary Clinton as “relaxed, warm, funny and relatable” in a speech she gave in Atlantic City. I immediately recognized “relatable” as the Clinton trope that it is.

"The thing with “relatable” is that it has become an inside joke, or even a not-so-inside joke. The word was set in lights by “Saturday Night Live” a couple of weeks ago with a sendup in which the former first lady — played by Kate McKinnon — delivered “A Message From Hillary Clinton” in the aftermath of the controversy surrounding her use of a private email account during her time as secretary of state. “Tonight I am speaking to you not as secretary of state, or as a senator or as a first lady,” McKinnon said, “but as a relatable woman on a couch.”","1228","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/hillarys-eternal-quest-for-relatability.html?_r=0"
"“Relatable” is one of those perfectly awful words that has colonized the American vocabulary over an alarmingly short period of time. Writing in The New Yorker last year, Rebecca Mead described its rapid ascent in art and popular culture, but nowhere is it more perfectly at home than in the vacuous vernacular of campaign politics. It perfectly distills both the futility of the most famous woman in American politics embarking on a project to convince everyone that she can in fact relate to their everyday concerns and routines, and vice versa.","1229","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/hillarys-eternal-quest-for-relatability.html?_r=0"
"Perhaps even more so, it also reflects the tired constructs that so many political-media types apply to the “challenges” facing politicians as they try to escape the various pigeonholes in which they find themselves (often thanks to the same political-media types). As a presidential candidate in 2004, John Kerry tried to shed an impression of being “aloof”; George H.W. Bush battled a “wimp factor”; Joe Biden fought a “lightweight” perception, especially from early in his career. Now comes “relatable,” which Clinton owns in a big way — as in, she’s not. Too rich, too famous, too calculated. If she did not own this “relatable” stamp before, she does now, thanks largely to McKinnon and “S.N.L.”","1230","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/hillarys-eternal-quest-for-relatability.html?_r=0"
"So what is Clinton supposed to do? Make herself less familiar? Is she obligated to just go away?

"Late in the “S.N.L.” skit, McKinnon’s Clinton showed a sonogram of her fetal self hoisting a “Hillary 2008” sign in her mother’s womb. She cackled and added, for good measure, “what a relatable laugh!” It was a gratuitous and perfect touch; completely absurd, and equal-opportunity in its cringeworthiness. You can imagine Clinton seeing this and wondering whether she is in danger of being buried by a cartoon — and you can just as easily imagine a pall of shame coming over the trope-meisters in political-media land who trade in these shallow notions. It’s easy to feel the pain on both sides. I can relate.","1232","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/magazine/hillarys-eternal-quest-for-relatability.html?_r=0"

"In the aftermath of President Obama’s re-election, it was common to suggest that Mrs. Clinton was an unusually formidable general election candidate, and the polls seemed to back it up. Her favorability ratings soared to the mid-60s during her tenure as secretary of state. In hypothetical head-to-head polling matchups, she even led in places such as Texas against home-state candidates like Rick Perry. Feeding the perception of her strength was the notion that Democrats had an advantage in presidential elections, given their sway among growing parts of the electorate, like young and nonwhite voters, and their apparent Electoral College advantage.","1235","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/hillary-clinton-is-more-vulnerable-in-2016-than-you-think.html?_r=0"
"But Mrs. Clinton will not be a Democratic Eisenhower, a popular, senior statesperson who cruises to an easy victory. Her popularity has already faded considerably over the last two years.

"As many analysts predicted, her high ratings were unsustainable — her popularity the product of serving as the country’s top diplomat, partly shielded from domestic political criticism. Her ratings have returned to earth since her exit from the position in early 2013 — and since she has emerged as the likely Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential election.","1237","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/hillary-clinton-is-more-vulnerable-in-2016-than-you-think.html?_r=0"
"The polls now show her favorability rating beneath 50 percent, making her a fairly typical candidate for the presidency. Her numbers are much more similar to Mr. Obama’s and Mitt Romney’s ratings in late 2012 than her own ratings from two years ago. She has, in other words, gone back to being what Mr. Obama’s supporters alleged in 2008: a polarizing figure, just as Mr. Obama is today.","1238","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/hillary-clinton-is-more-vulnerable-in-2016-than-you-think.html?_r=0"

"Her ratings started out high as first lady in 1993, as is often the case with that role, but dropped to the mid-40s when she pursued health reform. Her ratings surged during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, but returned to the mid-40s once she ran for Senate, and remained there through her 2008 presidential campaign. Her ratings recovered again after she withdrew from the 2008 race and was no longer active in day-to-day politics.","1240","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/hillary-clinton-is-more-vulnerable-in-2016-than-you-think.html?_r=0"
"There is little about Mrs. Clinton’s electoral history that suggests she’s a stronger candidate than these ratings. As a Senate candidate in New York in 2000, she ran well behind Al Gore’s presidential election numbers in New York that year. Few defend her performance in the 2008 presidential primaries. If anything, the extent to which she was criticized by the left has largely been forgotten. As Slate’s Alec MacGillis put it, there is “a sort of collective amnesia among Obama supporters when it comes to their former estimation of Clinton — a reluctance to reckon fully with their aversion to her then and what has come of it since.”","1241","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/hillary-clinton-is-more-vulnerable-in-2016-than-you-think.html?_r=0"
"Although it’s true that Democrats have fared well in recent presidential elections, there is no guarantee their success will continue. In 2016, the Democratic nominee will have to argue for a third term for the party at a time when Mr. Obama’s approval ratings may be beneath 50 percent, and when many Americans may be anxious or downright pessimistic about the country’s future. At the moment, Mr. Obama’s approval ratings and the pace of economic growth are consistent with a close, competitive race, in which the Republicans might have a slight but uncertain edge.","1242","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/hillary-clinton-is-more-vulnerable-in-2016-than-you-think.html?_r=0"
"There were signs in last year’s midterm elections that dissatisfaction with Mr. Obama’s performance was costing Democrats among white voters without a college degree, most obviously in the countryside of Iowa and Colorado.

"Yes, Mrs. Clinton has a large lead over her likeliest Republican challengers in national polls, including in many of the most important battleground states. But general-election polls more than a year before Election Day have little meaning. More specifically, the preponderance of undecided voters in those polls have been Republican-leaners who will eventually rally behind the Republican nominee.","1244","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/hillary-clinton-is-more-vulnerable-in-2016-than-you-think.html?_r=0"
"Recent Fox News, ABC/Washington Post and Marist polls found Mrs. Clinton with a large lead over Jeb Bush, for instance, but Mr. Bush earned no more than 81 percent of the support of Republicans (and 69 percent among conservatives) in any of the three surveys. Mrs. Clinton held at least 87 percent support among Democrats. The conservatives who are not backing Mr. Bush in these very early polls are likely to come home to the party should he win the nomination.","1245","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/hillary-clinton-is-more-vulnerable-in-2016-than-you-think.html?_r=0"
"There is also evidence, especially in state polling, that Mrs. Clinton’s support from traditionally Democratic, white, conservative voters is unsustainable — especially in the South and Appalachia. For instance, polls in Kentucky matching her against the home-state favorite Rand Paul have often shown her running well ahead of Mr. Obama’s performance in the state in 2012, and still further ahead of candidates from elsewhere.","1246","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/hillary-clinton-is-more-vulnerable-in-2016-than-you-think.html?_r=0"
"On paper, her strength among these voters is her greatest advantage over Mr. Obama. Perhaps 10 or 15 years ago, Mrs. Clinton could have run a campaign to win these white, Southern conservatives and perhaps carry Arkansas or West Virginia, two states her husband won in both of his presidential elections. But that strategy is untenable in today’s Democratic Party, which will demand a far more liberal candidate than conservative voters are willing to tolerate.","1247","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/hillary-clinton-is-more-vulnerable-in-2016-than-you-think.html?_r=0"
"Even if she did run a campaign to appeal to these voters, it probably wouldn’t work. In the last midterm election, formidable white Democratic candidates in the South struggled to run ahead of Mr. Obama’s performance there in 2012. It is an inefficient route to victory in any case, out of alignment with today’s Electoral College map: Well-educated, diverse and secular residents of metropolitan areas are more important than traditionally Democratic but conservative voters.","1248","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/hillary-clinton-is-more-vulnerable-in-2016-than-you-think.html?_r=0"
"None of this is to say that Mrs. Clinton is a weak candidate. Mr. Obama won re-election, after all, despite evolving into a polarizing figure. Her favorability rating is better than that of any of her Republican opponents, who are all poised to become just as polarizing as she. There is a case that she will be a better candidate than she was in 2008, when she was widely caricatured as calculating and unlikable. Many believed that she was already a much stronger candidate by the time the 2008 campaign was over.","1249","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/hillary-clinton-is-more-vulnerable-in-2016-than-you-think.html?_r=0"
"If Mrs. Clinton does prove to be a particularly adept candidate, given how close the race shapes up to be, it could make a significant difference. But at least for now, her favorability ratings don’t resemble those of an especially strong candidate. The better argument for her strength would be the demographic advantages of today’s Democratic coalition.","1250","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/hillary-clinton-is-more-vulnerable-in-2016-than-you-think.html?_r=0"
"If the Democrats have such an advantage, then Mrs. Clinton, a person who has engendered great loyalty from many Democratic-leaning voters, may be the candidate best positioned to reassemble that coalition — particularly under potentially adverse circumstances.

(Crowdpac bases this mainly on campaign contributions, but also on votes and speeches.) Her problem was that Barack Obama, who was further to the left of her — at -7.8 to her -6.9 — also had the donors who were to the left of her.

"The negative coverage that she is receiving certainly stems in no small part from her decisions. But it also reflects some forces she can’t control — like the fact that she is being treated as a serious contender for the presidency. All of the potential candidates are being scrutinized at this early stage. What is different for Mrs. Clinton is that as someone who has been on the national stage for more than 20 years, she will have no honeymoon in the 2016 campaign. Without a major opponent, she will have no moments of victory providing positive momentum along the way. She is going to skip right over the part of the campaign when voters learn about her and get excited about her possibilities.

"Whether Americans believe Mrs. Clinton’s decision to use only a private email account for her public business is a troubling scandal well worth an F.B.I. inquiry, a pragmatic move blown out of proportion by Republican enemies, or something in between, may depend more on their partisan leanings than the facts of the affair itself.","1663","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/us/hillary-clinton-emails-take-long-path-to-controversy.html?_r=0"

"Mrs. Clinton, who has said she now regrets her unorthodox decision to keep private control of her official messages, is not a target in the F.B.I.’s investigation, which is focused on assessing security breaches.

"But exempting herself from the practices imposed on the 24,000 Foreign Service officers and Civil Service workers she oversaw has led to resentment from some former subordinates.

"But changing times, and the practical needs of a secretary of state, evidently overcame that instinct. When she took office in 2009, with ever more people doing government business through email, the State Department allowed the use of home computers as long as they were secure; nine months later a new policy required that steps be taken to make sure emails were captured in the department’s records. There appears to have been no prohibition on the exclusive use of a private server; it does not appear to be an option anyone had thought about.","1681","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/us/hillary-clinton-emails-take-long-path-to-controversy.html?_r=0"

"Mrs. Clinton has said she decided in 2009 to handle all her email, official and personal, on one account to avoid carrying multiple electronic devices.

"So there may have been other reasons for using a private server. For an oft-attacked politician considering a presidential run, the server would give Mrs. Clinton some control over what would become public from her four years as the nation’s top diplomat. “I’ve been following it very carefully,” said Shiva Ayyadurai, an email pioneer who has designed email systems for both government and large corporations.

"There is another factor that some former colleagues say puts Mrs. Clinton’s decision in a more reasonable light: the archaic, dysfunctional computer systems at the State Department. Only a tiny fraction of emails sent on the State.gov system in recent years have been permanently archived.

"Mr. McCullough, a former F.B.I agent and the watchdog for the intelligence agencies, took the lead in examining Mrs. Clinton’s emails.

"Mr. McCullough then looked at a sample of 40 more messages and found four that he concluded contained information that should have been marked “secret.” In last month’s court-ordered State Department release of an additional 2,200 pages of emails, 64 passages from 37 messages were blacked out because they were judged too sensitive to be released.

"Because the classified passages are blacked out, it is impossible to gauge how much damage their disclosure might have caused.

"Moreover, “spillage” — the technical term for classified information slipping into an unclassified system — is so common that the government has a protocol to deal with it. A 2008 guide, “National Instruction on Classified Information Spillage” treats it as a regrettable but not-so-rare occurrence.

For Mrs. Clinton, it has meant that her every move is tracked, often to a fault. Separately, readers objected last April to the way The Times, touting an “exclusive agreement” with the author, reported on aspects of a highly critical book, “Clinton Cash.” And some observers make the case that there’s no substance to the story line about Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email system as secretary of state.

"But the real shift is a plan to introduce a “six-year sliding scale” for capital gains taxes. Individuals in the top bracket would pay ordinary income tax on the sale of investments — 39.6 percent — in the first two years and “then the rate would decrease each year” over the next four years until it returns to the current capital gains rate of 20 percent.","2054","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/28/business/dealbook/clinton-aim-is-to-thwart-quick-buck-on-wall-st.html?_r=0"

"Mr. Sanders has become the favorite of one of the Democratic Party’s most important factions: the overwhelmingly white, progressive left. These voters are plentiful in the well-educated, more secular enclaves where journalists roam. This voting support is enough for him to compete in Iowa; New Hampshire and elsewhere in New England; the Northwest; and many Western caucuses. But it is not a viable electoral coalition in a Democratic Party that is far more moderate and diverse than his supporters seem to recognize.","2135","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"This doesn’t mean that Mr. Sanders can’t make further gains. But it does mean that he will need to broaden his appeal to voters who may be far less receptive to his message.

"Mrs. Clinton’s advantage among the majority of Democratic voters is underpinned by just about all of the forces that help shape public opinion and determine the outcome of primary elections. Her policy views are smack-dab in the middle of the Democratic electorate, denying Mr. Sanders much room to challenge her on the left. She has won the so-called invisible primary, the behind-the-scenes competition for elite support that helps decide the nomination. She has more endorsements and cash than just about any candidate in American history.","2137","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"

"The possibility that Mr. Biden might run for president has led many to imagine that Mrs. Clinton’s sagging support has Democrats on the verge of drafting him into the race. But the reaction from Democratic elites to a possible Biden run has been tepid at best. Major Democratic figures have publicly argued against his candidacy. My colleagues Carl Hulse and Jason Horowitz reported that the skepticism even extends to Mr. Biden’s friends and many Obama 2008 supporters — exactly the sort of people who ought to be most receptive to his candidacy.","2139","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"

"Mrs. Clinton may be a primary juggernaut, but she could surely lose to a Republican in November 2016. President Obama’s approval ratings are in the mid-40s, so Mrs. Clinton may not benefit from the party’s incumbency. On paper, the race is more or less a tossup. In such a close contest, it might seem reasonable to argue that Mrs. Clinton’s unfavorable ratings are hugely important.","2142","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"But the case for that argument isn’t so strong. Much of the variation in presidential election results can be explained by underlying factors like the president’s approval rating, the economy and partisanship.","2143","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"Many political scientists go a step further. Whether people have a favorable opinion of presidential candidates is as much about rationalizing a latent partisan preference — shaped by the underlying political and economic fundamentals — as it is about the candidates themselves. From this perspective, much of the damage to Mrs. Clinton among Republican-leaning independents was inevitable, while the damage to Democrats can be overcome by partisan loyalty.","2144","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"A good example of this is Mitt Romney, whose ratings fell even lower than Mrs. Clinton’s during the Republican primary. He then faced a variety of attacks about his time at Bain Capital. He damaged himself with his “47 percent” comments. Yet despite it all, his ratings recovered by the 2012 general election. Republican-leaning voters, sure to vote against Mr. Obama, gradually figured out a way to like Mr. Romney. We saw the same thing with another Clinton, William Jefferson, who had even worse favorable ratings than Mrs. Clinton before quickly turning around his image once the 1992 general election began.","2145","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"It’s useful to imagine a counterfactual: What if the economy had been stronger, and George H.W. Bush had had a 60 percent approval rating, on Election Day in 1992? Mr. Clinton wouldn’t have had a chance against those numbers, of course, but Mr. Bush wouldn’t have been running just on his record. He would have attacked Mr. Clinton’s character and he would have maintained a lead in the polls as a media narrative coalesced around a simple explanation: Mr. Clinton, with his weak numbers, was a smooth-talking womanizer who couldn’t be trusted. After his defeat, Mr. Clinton would have been remembered as yet another weak Democratic candidate in the footsteps of Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, fatally damaged before the campaign had even begun, rather than as one of the more talented politicians of our time.","2146","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"For some, this line of thinking offers an uncomfortably deterministic theory about American presidential politics. But it helps explain a lot, such as why favorability ratings can move so much, even when there is relatively little new information about a candidate. It helps explain why, on the other hand, supposed game-changers often seem to have no effect. And it helps explain why, in the end, the polls move toward the fundamentals as the campaign evolves.","2147","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"This doesn’t necessarily mean that Mrs. Clinton is in the clear. The fundamentals are strongest when an incumbent president is on the ballot because the feelings about the president are so strong and firm on either side. Mr. Romney, for instance, might have had a harder time improving his ratings and winning back G.O.P. voters — who disapproved of Mr. Obama — if his opponent had not been Mr. Obama.","2148","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"For this cycle, the fitting analogy might be Al Gore, who started with far weaker favorability ratings than George W. Bush, with the backdrop of Mr. Clinton’s scandals. The economic fundamentals, though, seemed to suggest that Mr. Gore was in line to score a decisive victory. Indeed, the gap between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore’s ratings closed as the race went on in 2000. But Mr. Gore, who like Mrs. Clinton was seeking to make it a third presidential victory in a row for Democrats, fell short.","2149","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"More generally, there have been so few presidential elections in the era of modern polling that it would be a mistake to be too sure that Mrs. Clinton’s image won’t be a factor. In a century, political scientists could easily look back and say, with the help of new data, that favorability ratings can be decisive. For now, it would be unwise to rule it out. We already know that scandals can hurt incumbents in House elections, but it doesn’t come close to dooming them, studies have shown.","2150","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/is-hillary-clinton-really-in-danger-of-losing-the-primary.html?_r=0"
"The issue with Mrs. Clinton’s email account and server doesn’t yet rise to the level of the scandals counted in the studies on House elections.

That is a far smaller proportion than that of her Democratic and Republican rivals who have excited grass-roots donors on the left and right, such as Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ted Cruz of Texas. While Mr. Sanders raised far less than Mrs. Clinton over all — about $15 million, including money transferred from his Senate account — about four-fifths of that amount came from smaller donors.","2197","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"The slow response of grass-roots donors is a consequence, Mrs. Clinton’s aides and advisers said, of the deliberately low-key approach she has taken on the campaign trail — with few of the big rallies and campaign events that can help build voter lists and drive donations — along with the challenge in persuading some donors that Mrs. Clinton, who is far ahead in primary polls, needs their money.","2198","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"The deficit could represent a financial and strategic liability for Mrs. Clinton if she were to win the nomination. The pool of Republican donors willing to write the maximum $2,700 check has grown so large that no Democrat, not even Mrs. Clinton, is likely to be able to match a mainstream Republican nominee on high-dollar fund-raising over the long term. In 2012, President Obama and his party were able to match the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, only by raising far more money than Mr. Romney from small donors.","2199","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"

"Campaign officials said that operational hurdles and administrative delays also have impeded her outreach to small donors. On the day that Mrs. Clinton sent out emails in April announcing her presidential bid, a campaign official said, many of the messages bounced back. Fewer than 100,000 of the 2.5 million email addresses collected during her 2008 campaign, it turned out, were still active. The campaign did not gain access to a huge list of supporters, built over two years at substantial expense by a pro-Clinton “super PAC,” Ready for Hillary, until a month and a half after Mrs. Clinton’s announcement.","2201","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"Some of Mrs. Clinton’s allies acknowledge that Mr. Sanders has done a better job of engaging small donors on the left. “The small donors right now are very much attracted to what Bernie is saying,” said Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and a Clinton supporter.","2202","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has responded with a new program, the Hillbuilder Initiative, intended to build a more robust online presence and harvest the grass-roots money and enthusiasm that can come with it. But the slow start has bewildered some longtime supporters, who recall small-donor enthusiasm as a crucial piece of Mr. Obama’s win over Mrs. Clinton in 2008.","2203","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"Relying more heavily on large donors could also present an unwanted contrast not only to other candidates, like Mr. Sanders, but with Mrs. Clinton’s own statements about fighting for those who feel locked out of the economy. Mrs. Clinton has attended 46 fund-raisers since she entered the campaign, many of them for donors giving the largest possible check. Mr. Sanders has attended two.","2204","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"“We’re spending our time talking to people, rather than sitting around in small rooms talking to very wealthy people,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview on Wednesday, as he prepared for a campaign rally in Phoenix. “These are working people, middle-class people who are making these contributions.”","2205","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"Wednesday’s campaign filings underscored not only how small donors have powered insurgent candidates, but how the growing world of super PACs and outside spending have upended conventional measures of fund-raising strength.","2206","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"

"But super PACs and other outside groups set up by allies or former aides to the Republican candidates have dwarfed the top Democratic super PAC — as well as most of the Republican campaigns — collectively raising in excess of $200 million and startling some in Mrs. Clinton’s camp.","2208","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"Jeb Bush’s super PAC, Right to Rise, raised more than $103 million, on top of $11 million raised by his campaign, giving him an effective war chest twice as large as Mrs. Clinton’s. Priorities USA, the lead Democratic super PAC, has raised $15 million, and Mrs. Clinton’s allies are struggling to persuade her wealthiest backers to make seven- and eight-figure donations to the group.","2209","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"The only silver lining, Democrats said, was the knowledge that much of the Republican super PAC money would be used to savage other Republicans, in what is likely to be a long and hard-fought primary campaign.","2210","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"“What it means is that they are going to tear each other apart in the primary season,” said Mr. Rendell, who predicted that Mrs. Clinton’s small-dollar fund-raising would grow substantially in the months ahead.","2211","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"Some Democrats privately said that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign fund-raising is less impressive than it appears. Aside from Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, who reported raising $2 million for his campaign, Mrs. Clinton has no competition for the Democrats’ big-donor establishment, which handed out a combined $80 million to a crowded Democratic primary field during the equivalent fund-raising period in 2007, the last open primary.","2212","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"She also has been slow to seize the chance to raise money jointly with the Democratic National Committee. Under legislation passed in December, the party can accept up to $334,000 from each donor every calendar year — 10 times the amount in past years. One leading Democratic donor, who asked not to be identified so as not to damage his relations with Mrs. Clinton, estimated that the Democrats could be leaving $60 million to $70 million on the table.","2213","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"While some Clinton allies say they are not concerned about the campaign’s potential to excite small donors, the difficulty that Mrs. Clinton has faced presents a paradox of her position as a kind of de facto incumbent in the fight for the Democratic nomination. Without a pitched primary battle — like the one she faced against then-Senator Barack Obama eight years ago — it is far more difficult for Mrs. Clinton to create urgency among her financial and political base this early in the campaign.","2214","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"But an all-out fund-raising blitz, or a campaign built around larger events, could stoke the aura of “inevitability” that she is determined to avoid.","2215","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"
"A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Josh Schwerin, said the campaign was “thrilled to have 250,000 donors in our first quarter in the race, and our Hillbuilder program is already paying off with a rapidly growing list that is active and engaged.”","2216","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-lags-in-engaging-grass-roots-donors.html?_r=0"

"She argued that exposure to more American commerce and travelers and the Internet would be more effective in changing the policies of a government that continued, she acknowledged, in “beating and harassing” its political opponents and “cracking down on free expression and the Internet.” She said that, as president, she would use executive authority to make it easier for Americans to visit Cuba if Congress does not lift the embargo.","2223","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/us/politics/hillary-clinton-in-miami-calls-for-lifting-of-embargo-on-cuba.html?_r=0"

"In 1996, President Bill Clinton, seeking re-election and courting voters in Florida, found himself under pressure to sign the embargo into federal statute. Mr. Clinton had sought to improve relations with Cuba, but in the election year Cuba shot down two planes of Brothers to the Rescue, a Florida-based group that provided assistance to Cubans escaping the island by raft.","2231","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/us/politics/hillary-clinton-in-miami-calls-for-lifting-of-embargo-on-cuba.html?_r=0"

"But the shift in Cuban-American attitudes, along with the general leftward tilt of the Democratic electorate, have perhaps contributed to Mrs. Clinton’s movement on the matter. Mrs. Clinton said that she came to the determination as secretary of state that keeping the embargo in place unintentionally helped the government there. She said early gestures at easing American restrictions on travel and cash remittances led her, at the end of her term as secretary, to recommend to the president “that we end the failed embargo and double down on a strategy of engagement.”","2236","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/us/politics/hillary-clinton-in-miami-calls-for-lifting-of-embargo-on-cuba.html?_r=0"

The Clinton theory of the campaign seems to be that people vote on the basis of what policy a candidate can deliver or what interest group he or she kowtows to.

In that case, Clinton could be hurt by the fact that only 35 percent of, say, Floridians think she is honest and trustworthy, according to a Quinnipiac poll, whereas, just to pick a random name, 71 percent think that of Joe Biden.","2368","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/opinion/hillary-clintons-opportunist-solution.html?_r=0"
"Second, as a matter of practical governing, it’s hard to organize an administration around an uncertain trumpet.

"Third, there’s the humanitarian issue. Clinton once supported the Pacific trade deal for good reason.

It would lift Malaysian growth by 6.6 percent and Vietnamese growth by 14 percent. It would also build a solid Asian alliance to balance Chinese hegemony.

"WASHINGTON — A special intelligence review of two emails that Hillary Rodham Clinton received as secretary of state on her personal account — including one about North Korea’s nuclear weapons program — has endorsed a finding by the inspector general for the intelligence agencies that the emails contained highly classified information when Mrs. Clinton received them, senior intelligence officials said.","SEPT. 7, 2015","2403","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/us/politics/second-review-says-classified-information-was-in-hillary-clintons-email.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign and the State Department disputed the inspector general’s finding last month and questioned whether the emails had been overclassified by an arbitrary process.

"Other parts of her plan were focused more narrowly on drug prices. One would reduce the amount of time a biologic drug could keep exclusivity, before cheaper copycat products could enter the market.

At a recent New Hampshire dinner, Mrs. Clinton linked Mr. Biden to a bankruptcy bill he had voted for in the Senate that is deeply unpopular among the Democratic Party’s liberal base.","2598","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/politics/warm-in-public-joe-biden-and-hillary-clinton-have-been-intense-rivals-in-private.html?_r=0"
"For weeks leading up to his announcement on Wednesday, Mr. Biden also repeatedly told advisers and potential campaign staff members that he did not believe Mrs. Clinton could defeat the Republican candidate. He watched as she played up her relationship with Mr. Obama, especially when speaking to black crowds in South Carolina and elsewhere, and argued that if anyone should take advantage of the sitting president’s record and high approval rating among Democratic primary voters, it should be him.","2599","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/politics/warm-in-public-joe-biden-and-hillary-clinton-have-been-intense-rivals-in-private.html?_r=0"
"The vice president viewed Mrs. Clinton as “this book-smart student who succeeded by dint of grunt work but not by dazzling brilliance,” saw himself as the more “intuitive politician and the intuitive leader and policy maker,” said one Democrat who has spoken to people advising Mr. Biden.","2600","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/politics/warm-in-public-joe-biden-and-hillary-clinton-have-been-intense-rivals-in-private.html?_r=0"
"In the last 48 hours, Mr. Biden wore his growing frustration on his sleeve, offering a thinly veiled warning to Mrs. Clinton that Democrats would be “making a tragic mistake if we walk away or attempt to undo the Obama legacy.” In recent days, Mrs. Clinton has announced her opposition to the president’s trade deal with Asia, among other policies.","2601","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/politics/warm-in-public-joe-biden-and-hillary-clinton-have-been-intense-rivals-in-private.html?_r=0"
"As colleagues in the Senate, Mr. Biden and Mrs. Clinton were friendly. He was one of the first people Mrs. Clinton met with after her concession speech when she dropped out of the 2008 primary. After Mr. Obama made his vice-presidential choice known, Mr. Biden told a crowd in Nashua, N.H., that Mrs. Clinton “is as qualified or more qualified than I am.” He added, “And, quite frankly, she may have been a better pick than me.”","2602","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/politics/warm-in-public-joe-biden-and-hillary-clinton-have-been-intense-rivals-in-private.html?_r=0"
"But Mrs. Clinton’s outsize celebrity as secretary of state began to grate on Mr. Biden. With the news media noting Mrs. Clinton’s heavy travel schedule, aides to Mr. Biden often said that while miles traveled were irrelevant, the vice president had traveled nearly 700,000 miles in his first term, compared with Mrs. Clinton’s 956,733 miles.","2603","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/politics/warm-in-public-joe-biden-and-hillary-clinton-have-been-intense-rivals-in-private.html?_r=0"

"Mr. Biden’s resentment about Mrs. Clinton has ebbed and flowed. In 2011, pollsters working for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign asked voters in battleground states a question: Would you be more likely to vote for Mr. Obama if Mrs. Clinton were to campaign for him? The poll intensified speculation that Mr. Obama was considering replacing Mr. Biden with Mrs. Clinton on the ticket, angering the vice president.","2606","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/politics/warm-in-public-joe-biden-and-hillary-clinton-have-been-intense-rivals-in-private.html?_r=0"

"With Mrs. Clinton tucked away from politics and above the fray at the State Department in 2012, Mr. Biden barnstormed the country to sell the Obama presidency, sometimes at the expense of his own approval ratings.

"Hillary Rodham Clinton called on Thursday for accelerating the American-led operation to defeat the Islamic State, going well beyond what President Obama has proposed by urging a no-fly zone with coalition forces to protect Syrians, more airstrikes and an expanded deployment of special operations troops to assist local ground forces.","NOV. 19, 2015","2614","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-islamic-state.html?_r=0"
"“Our goal is not to deter or contain ISIS, but to defeat and destroy ISIS,” Mrs. Clinton said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group and distancing herself from Mr. Obama’s much-derided contention, a day before the Nov. 13 attack in Paris, that the group had been geographically “contained.”","2615","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-islamic-state.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton was cautious not to criticize the president directly, saying her plan amounted to “an intensification and acceleration” of his strategy. But it was the urgency with which she spoke of the threat from the Islamic State and the need to respond to it muscularly that most distinguished her approach from that of the president under whom she served for four years as secretary of state.","2616","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-islamic-state.html?_r=0"

"After days of speaking broadly about a response to the attack, Mrs. Clinton used the address on Thursday to display the breadth and detail of her foreign-policy knowledge. But in demonstrating her readiness to be commander-in-chief, Mrs. Clinton also must avoid inflaming Democratic primary voters who overwhelmingly approve of Mr. Obama and who are still reeling from the George W. Bush era of intervention.","2621","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-islamic-state.html?_r=0"
"For the most part, Mrs. Clinton called for building on what the White House is already doing — but at a faster pace. The Pentagon has said, for example, that it will bolster the use of special forces if the initial effort to train and equip Kurdish fighters and improve the targeting of airstrikes is successful; Mrs. Clinton appeared ready to do so now.","2622","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-islamic-state.html?_r=0"

"Mrs. Clinton said that “to be successful, airstrikes will have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from ISIS.” But, mindful that her 2002 vote to authorize force in Iraq largely contributed to her loss in the 2008 Democratic primary, she was quick to say these should be local Sunni troops, and “we cannot substitute for them.”","2626","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-islamic-state.html?_r=0"

"Similarly, she called for more air power, but only in cooperation with Persian Gulf allies.

"Expanding on her previous call for a no-fly zone, Mrs. Clinton said it should be limited to northern Syria, where Turkey has proposed a buffer zone to protect civilians, and enforced by many countries.

"She took a particularly hard line against Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations who she said had been complicit in the rise of the Islamic State. “Once and for all, the Saudis, the Qataris and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations,” Mrs. Clinton said.","2630","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-islamic-state.html?_r=0"
"The core of Mrs. Clinton’s argument for a faster, more aggressive military operation was her contention that it would reinforce Secretary of State John Kerry’s diplomatic effort to negotiate a cease-fire, and ultimately a political solution, in Syria. Administration officials said it closely resembled the arguments Mr. Kerry has made to Mr. Obama — but Mr. Kerry has not yet persuaded the president, who remains hesitant about the risk of being sucked into a ground war.","2631","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-islamic-state.html?_r=0"

"“We had an opportunity, perhaps,” for a regime change, Mrs. Clinton said. But given the current circumstances, she added, “We need to get people to turn against the common enemy of ISIS.”","2634","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-islamic-state.html?_r=0"
"In saying so, Mrs. Clinton seemed to align her strategic approach more closely with those of Russia and Iran, who are backing Mr. Assad, though she criticized both nations in her speech Thursday.","2635","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-islamic-state.html?_r=0"
"She also waded carefully into the question of what American technology companies should do to join the fight. Embracing the least controversial move, Mrs. Clinton said that “social media companies can also do their part by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts so they are not used to plan, provoke, or celebrate violence.” Most American firms already do that.","2636","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-islamic-state.html?_r=0"
"But on the enormously complex issue of encrypted communications, she fell back to the obvious: that encryption was needed to protect everyday transactions, but should not give cover to terror groups. That is where the debate was a year ago. Mrs. Clinton said nothing about Mr. Obama’s recent conclusion that there is no way to stop companies from marketing end-to-end encryption that is very difficult for intelligence agencies to pierce.","2637","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-islamic-state.html?_r=0"

"He had a confrontational style with Obama administration officials, a skill he had honed during his two decades as a prosecutor, not to mention an ever-changing hairstyle that varied from faux mohawk to Gordon Gekko slick.

"So when it came time a year and a half ago for Speaker John A. Boehner to pick a chairman to lead a committee that would investigate the politically sensitive 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, Mr. Gowdy, 51, was an obvious choice. Mr. Boehner believed Mr. Gowdy would be able to keep the more volatile members of his committee from making outlandish accusations about Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state at the time of the attack.","2646","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/politics/questions-for-hillary-clinton-and-for-benghazi-panels-leader.html?_r=0"
"But now, as he prepares for the committee’s most high-profile moment, Mrs. Clinton’s public testimony on Thursday, Mr. Gowdy — who, just a few weeks ago, was being asked by his Republican colleagues to run for a House leadership position — is struggling to uphold his panel’s credibility and his own personal standing after a string of embarrassing blunders.","2647","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/politics/questions-for-hillary-clinton-and-for-benghazi-panels-leader.html?_r=0"
"The troubles began three weeks ago, when one of Mr. Gowdy’s best friends in Congress — Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, then the leading candidate to replace Mr. Boehner as speaker — suggested on Fox News that the committee’s purpose was to bring down Mrs. Clinton. Another Republican lawmaker, Representative Richard Hanna of New York, appearing to want to distance himself from Mr. Gowdy, reiterated the claim. And a former staff member on the committee went public with accusations that the panel was not focused on investigative work, and had done so little before Mrs. Clinton’s email issues came to light that some days they sat around drinking wine.","2648","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/politics/questions-for-hillary-clinton-and-for-benghazi-panels-leader.html?_r=0"

"“This is turning into an investigation that is not advancing the ball,” said Tom Fitton, the head of the conservative group Judicial Watch. “Gowdy is not demanding enough accountability from Mrs. Clinton and the administration. The committee was too slow to initially investigate her emails, and now they are about to question her, and they still don’t have them all.”","2653","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/politics/questions-for-hillary-clinton-and-for-benghazi-panels-leader.html?_r=0"

"“I think he has had a lot of Republicans not on the committee making judgments they are not in the position to make,” said Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina. “I am sure it’s been a difficult time for him.

"The committee got off to a slow start and initially maintained a low profile.

"Despite the attention the email issue generated, Mr. Gowdy told people he was afraid it was a distraction from the original mission of investigating the attack on an American government outpost in Benghazi and the deaths of four Americans there, including Ambassador J.

And it was not clear that Mrs. Clinton’s personal email use was within the committee’s jurisdiction.","2660","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/politics/questions-for-hillary-clinton-and-for-benghazi-panels-leader.html?_r=0"
"Other committee leaders who had larger political ambitions and who were trying to expand their profiles with the far right — like Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, who leads the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee — wanted desperately to have a piece of the issue so they could hold public hearings.

"Then came the comments from Mr. McCarthy, whom Mr. Boehner had endorsed as his successor after his recent decision to resign from the speakership.

"The Dodd-Frank law gave regulators a broad range of powers to oversee “systemically important” institutions. Combined with new international capital rules and more aggressive enforcement of corporate lawbreaking, it has made it more expensive than ever to be a sprawling global megabank.

"A new “risk fee” on the largest financial firms. The biggest banks, insurers and other mega-financial firms already face greater oversight than their smaller rivals under the Dodd-Frank Act. Mrs. Clinton proposes taking that notion a step further by requiring a significant new fee, payable to the United States Treasury, for those very large firms that are potentially risky. Interestingly, its level is not determined by the size of a firm per se, but by the amount it relies upon volatile short-term funding to finance its operations.","2714","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/upshot/how-hillary-clinton-would-regulate-the-too-big-to-fail-banks.html?_r=0"
"So, for example, Wells Fargo has about twice the assets of Goldman Sachs, but primarily funds itself with bank deposits and engages in relatively plain consumer and business lending. A more complex firm like Goldman, which relies more heavily on fast-moving capital markets for funding, would thus have more to fear from the risk fee.","2715","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/upshot/how-hillary-clinton-would-regulate-the-too-big-to-fail-banks.html?_r=0"

"Give regulators more power to break up financial firms. For all the discussion of whether to break up the too-big-to-fail banks in recent years, the actual legal tools that regulators have to do so are limited.

"Dodd-Frank requires that major banks prepare “living wills” that describe the legal details of how they would be unwound in the event of a failure.

"Regulate “shadow banking” more intensively. While the public debate about financial reform has concentrated on the too-big-to-fail banks, in many ways a bigger driver of the 2008 financial crisis was the “shadow banking” sector — segments of the financial system that resemble banks in important ways but are not regulated like them.

"Those teeth were still there in their joint sketch, but the satire was comparatively toothless. Candidate and doppelgänger commiserated about the campaign trail and generously poked fun at election-speak. When Mrs. Clinton’s Val asked her what she did for a living, Ms. McKinnon’s Clinton answered, “First, I am a grandmother. Second, I am a human entrusted with this one green Earth.” (“Oh, I get it,” Mrs. Clinton said. “You’re a politician.”) But there was no mention, for instance, of the controversy over the candidate’s using a personal email server while secretary of state.","2727","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/arts/television/review-hillary-clinton-on-saturday-night-live.html?_r=0"

"But it rarely hurts candidates to show up and take their lumps on a national comedy show, even if we’re a long way from the days when it was stunning to see Richard Nixon say “Sock it to me?” on “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In.” Mrs. Clinton’s appearance in character was a departure: candidates usually play themselves, though her Val was really a sort of meta-image of Mrs. Clinton’s ideal voter.

"Mrs. Clinton also showed off a serviceable Donald Trump impression.

(Ms. Strong also played Mrs. Clinton’s adviser Huma Abedin on the later segment.) This segment was harsher, with the duo sending up Mr. Trump’s insults of women, his ideological inconsistency and his vanity.

"The Clinton sketch, on the other hand, ended with the candidate singing a few bars of “Lean on Me” with Ms. McKinnon. If Mr. Trump is going to be this much of a presence in late night, then, he might be wise to follow Mrs. Clinton’s lead and appear on the show.

"For example, instead of just issuing a generic call to get tough on the terrorists, she pointed to the reality that ISIS will be toppled only if there is an uprising by fellow Sunnis.

"That will not happen while President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria is spreading mayhem, terror and genocide.

"Clinton therefore gestured to the reality that you can’t really deal with ISIS unless you are also willing to deal with Assad. Assad is not some secondary threat who we can deal with after we’ve tamed the ISIS monster. Assad created the failed state and the power vacuum that ISIS was able to fill. Assad serves as chief recruiter for ISIS every time he drops a barrel bomb on a school or a market. Assad, as Clinton pointed out, has murdered even more Syrians than ISIS has.","2778","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/opinion/hillary-clinton-takes-on-isis.html?_r=0"
"Dealing with both Assad and ISIS simultaneously throws you into the bitter and complex jockeying between Sunni and Shiite, between Iran and Saudi Arabia. It puts pressure on your Ukraine policy (Vladimir Putin will want concessions as a price for backing off his aggression in the Middle East). Everything is connected.

But she is thoughtful and instructive on both the big picture and the right way forward. She seems to understand that if we end up allying with Russia in a common fight against terrorism, we will end up preserving Assad, preserving ISIS and making everything worse.","2780","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/opinion/hillary-clinton-takes-on-isis.html?_r=0"

"The Arab nation-states were not great. But the nation-state system did preserve a certain order. National identities and boundaries enabled Sunnis and Shiites to live together peaceably.

"That means confronting the forces that thrive in failed states. That begins with stepped-up military pressure on ISIS. Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations proposes a campaign like the one that allowed the Northern Alliance to overthrow the Taliban after 9/11 — a light footprint campaign using Special Operations forces and C.I.A. paramilitaries to direct allied bombing in support of locals on the ground. Once life becomes a miserable grind for ISIS soldiers, recruiting will suffer.","2785","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/opinion/hillary-clinton-takes-on-isis.html?_r=0"
"But it also means going hard on Assad, creating no-fly zones for sanctuaries for Syrian refugees to limit his power, ratcheting up pressure on Iran and Russia to force his departure. And it also means supporting institutional reform, as Clinton said, throughout the Arab world, to revitalize nations as functioning units.

"Her performance Tuesday night at the first Democratic debate was so spectacular as to erase all doubt: Weakened as she may be, there is still fire in that belly, and she will not quietly shift to the side to make room for someone else — not Bernie Sanders, and not Joe Biden should he ever stop this annoying dillydallying and decide to run.","2857","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/hillary-clinton-the-queen-came-to-play.html?_r=0"
"And I don’t consider her performance spectacular simply because of what she did — although she demonstrated a remarkable assuredness and dexterity — but also because of what the others didn’t do.","2858","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/hillary-clinton-the-queen-came-to-play.html?_r=0"

"Days before the debate on CNN (where I am a commentator), I was asked who I thought had the most to gain from the debate. I answered: Bernie Sanders.","2860","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/hillary-clinton-the-queen-came-to-play.html?_r=0"
"My reasoning was that there are still large sections of the Democratic base — namely blacks and Hispanics — who don’t know who he is, and the debate was a perfect opportunity for him to introduce himself to those voters.","2861","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/hillary-clinton-the-queen-came-to-play.html?_r=0"
"I actually believe that Sanders did that. He forcefully presented his message, and really hammered his selling point, his crusade against income inequality. And he had some strong and memorable lines, like “Congress does not regulate Wall Street; Wall Street regulates Congress.”","2862","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/hillary-clinton-the-queen-came-to-play.html?_r=0"
"But in the end, Sanders’s strong performance was subsumed by Clinton’s even stronger one. Indeed, Sanders may have increased the margin separating them when he said that Americans were tired of talking about Clinton’s emails, thereby giving her a pass.","2863","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/hillary-clinton-the-queen-came-to-play.html?_r=0"

Who knows.","2864","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/hillary-clinton-the-queen-came-to-play.html?_r=0"
"And none of this means that Clinton’s performance was perfect. She inexplicably couldn’t bring herself to say the words “Black Lives Matter,” even after meeting with the group last week. She fumbled about a bit when answering a question about her relationship to Wall Street. She could have been more tactful when answering the question about the enemies she was proud of making.","2865","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/hillary-clinton-the-queen-came-to-play.html?_r=0"
"But all in all, she played it nearly perfectly. That was in part because there was a prevailing sense of civility and seriousness that hung over the debate. That’s good. But there were also times when that civility seemed to border on acquiescence. Absolute civility isn’t always a luxury available to those who are losing. They need to punch up, often and hard.","2866","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/hillary-clinton-the-queen-came-to-play.html?_r=0"
"The only person who came with that kind of bite was the curmudgeonly Jim Webb, who seemed like a candidate who got lost on his way to the Republican debate and simply decided to show up at the Democratic one.","2867","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/hillary-clinton-the-queen-came-to-play.html?_r=0"

"I was absolutely sure that Clinton would be dinged a bit during the debate, but she escaped virtually unscathed and therefore looking untouchable.","2869","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/hillary-clinton-the-queen-came-to-play.html?_r=0"

"“Absolutely. We have to repair American credibility after we told the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction which he didn’t, so there’s an issue of American credibility out there. So anytime someone’s running to be our leader, and a world leader, which the American president is, credibility is an issue out there with the world. And we have repair work to be done. I think we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president.”","2873","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/hillary-clinton-the-queen-came-to-play.html?_r=0"
"When Clinton was asked if she would like to respond, she delivered the perfect little one-word dis: “No!” That’s the kind of shade that would make Dorian Corey — who introduced the nuanced concept of “shade” to much of America in the 1990 documentary “Paris is Burning” — applaud.","2874","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/hillary-clinton-the-queen-came-to-play.html?_r=0"

"For all her struggles with poll numbers and the email investigation this year, Hillary Rodham Clinton has done one thing really well: dissuade mainstream opponents by dominating the invisible primary, the behind-the-scenes competition for elite support that often decides the nomination.","OCT. 21, 2015","2879","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/upshot/joe-bidens-decision-and-hillary-clintons-victory.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=46B0B1BE1DE239C24873768DC71AC940&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"
"Today, her dominance in the invisible primary yielded another victory. Vice President Joe Biden’s decision to stay out of the presidential race leaves Mrs. Clinton as the only viable mainstream candidate in the race. It gives her an opportunity to unite the coalition of moderate, nonwhite and older voters who traditionally have an edge over the white progressives who now support Bernie Sanders.","2880","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/upshot/joe-bidens-decision-and-hillary-clintons-victory.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=46B0B1BE1DE239C24873768DC71AC940&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"
